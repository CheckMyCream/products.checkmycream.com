<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only reason I gave these 4 stars is because of the very intense smell that came with the brushes. However, everything else was fantastic! The brushes work well, and for a beginner like me, I feel like I have everything I need for an affordable price. The company also sends a few follow up emails on how to use your brushes and how to care for them.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for beginner makeup users who are trying to keep their hobby affordable!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes also VERY soft! Also you get a very nice almost &amp;#34;leather like&amp;#34; bag to hold all of your brushes or whatever you want.</li>
    <li> Originally my first set had a few brushes that shed a ton when I spot cleaned or deep cleaned them. It was so disappointing, so I gave it a three star review. But, I was contacted and sent brand new brushes! I was so surprised this company is legit. They are ready to help in anyway they can. And so for that, I have to give them a 5 star! Order these brushes and if yours sheds a little like mine did, you can buy with confidence knowing that Beauty Junkee will take care of you! (P.S They did NOT tell me to say ANYTHING, I am rewriting this review because this company simply deserves it.)</li>
    <li> Amazing set of brushes. Very high-quality, well made. I have several high end brands and I reach for my Beauty Junkees brushes more than any other brand (Sigma, MAC, Larua Mercier). What an amazing value for the quality you get! Buy these and you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It works great. Very smooth application.</li>
    <li> The brushes are awesome and the quality is outstanding.  The price is so right too.  I plan to buy another set for back up</li>
    <li> About two months ago, I was thinking it was time to upgrade my painfully average eye makeup skills when I noticed a sale on eye makeup brushes at my local drugstore.  I know better, I really do.  I bought them anyway.  After a couple of weeks of fighting with them, I decided I&#x27;m terrible at eye makeup and gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Beauty Junkees offered me their eye makeup brushes to review.  I doubted my skill, but I use their [[ASIN:B00F008GFQ flat kabuki]] brush daily and it is an amazing, high quality brush.  I ignored my fear of failure and agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case was the first thing I saw, and the quality of the *case* blew me away.  To me, this is not an important part of a set of brushes and I wouldn&#x27;t blame the manufacturer if they skimped on the case.  They didn&#x27;t skimp--they paid attention to every detail.  It&#x27;s well made and the zipper and every seam can withstand abuse I&#x27;d never expect my brushes to experience.  (I&#x27;m sitting here beating up the case, and I can&#x27;t damage it with bare hands.)  It is plenty large for all these brushes plus my kabuki brush, and I could fit makeup in it if I wanted to.  Even the zipper pull is sleek but large and easy to grasp, and the zipper is substantial and easy to use.  Many times I&#x27;ve bought makeup that came with a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; case, and every time it&#x27;s been a cheap piece of junk that fell apart before the makeup was used up.  This case is made to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t want this for the case.  I hoped the brushes would be as good as the kabuki, and I hoped that Beauty Junkees&#x27; instructions would be as helpful as their foundation instructions.  On both counts: yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these brushes have some things in common.  Handles are substantial and well balanced, and easy to hold and control.  The function is written in silver on each handle, so if your vision is as fuzzy as mine is first thing in the morning, you can be sure you&#x27;ve grabbed the right brush by checking the handle.  The ferrules are more than an inch long for the thinner, finer brushes, and over an inch and a half long for the denser brushes.  By comparison, the best ferrule on my junk brushes is less than half an inch long.  My kabuki brush is washed daily and hasn&#x27;t lost a bristle yet, so I expect the same performance from these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very dense and wonderfully soft.  The flat brushes are very precise, and have not gotten sloppy or frizzy with regular washing.  Actually, none of the brushes have had a problem with regular washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like the kabuki, these brushes do what I want them to do, with precision, without smearing spots of makeup where I don&#x27;t expect them.  My problem with my old brushes was not my lack of skill (though that didn&#x27;t help,) the problem was that I was using junk brushes to try to work in a small area with a variable surface--the old frizzy brushes just made a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for each brush: The all-over shader and angled shader are nicely dense and somewhat flat, and provide excellent coverage.  The crease brush is thicker than I expected and gives a natural, diffuse look.  I thought I&#x27;d hate this brush but I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blending and tapered blending brushes are dense, and do a great job of blending.  Oddly, I find the blending brush to be more precise than the tapered blending, because of the slightly shorter and just slightly stiffer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencil brush is great for smudging, and is dense and tight and easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the flat definer very much.  Ergonomically, I&#x27;m more comfortable with the precision eye liner, though that may change as I practice.  I&#x27;m probably holding it wrong.  Both brushes are wonderfully precise and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I insist on good quality brushes for all my other work, yet for makeup I continue to compromise and then wonder why I&#x27;m terrible at makeup.  This is the second time that Beauty Junkees has taught me that my problem is not me, because when I use good brushes my makeup looks good.  I wish I had started with Beauty Junkees and skipped the junk brushes altogether.hen I use good brushes my makeup looks good.  I wish I had started with Beauty Junkees and skipped the junk brushes altogether.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye make application  brush I have ever used. The brush applies make up very evenly and stays put all day.  5 stars.  L.C.</li>
    <li> As always beauty Junkees produced an awesome product. I love this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been looking for a blending brush for a very long time, yet none of them have been exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for, and this has. I love the length of the actual bristles and blending transition colors into your crease is extremely easy. I was surprised and delighted at how easily it picked up product, and you can use the brush for both packing on eyeshadow and also mostly for blending. It&#x27;s a really nice brush that can be used for different things. So glad I got it! The only con (which wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying another because it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal) is the fact that after blending for a while it kind of starts to scratch your eyelid. But don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is still a soft brush. Overall it&#x27;s still amazing.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and a great price.  I love how the brushes are marked to identify how to use them (crease, blender, etc.).  I also received an email from the company with more detailed info about use of each brush.  The case is nice, though it did have a heavy smell (I assume from the material its made from), but it faded after a day or so of airing.  This is a great starter eye brush kit for someone just getting beginning a brush collection.  The shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Love the feel and seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> This is the third set of brushes we have used from this company.  We have been happy with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are constructed exceedingly well.  They are very close to the MAC brushes our daughter likes to use and are definitely comparable to Sephora.  The bristles are soft and as close to natural as I have used.  Despite serious use, bristles do not come out.  Eight brushes come in a fairly decent case (not the best). While the case is nominal, it is definitely usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- a great deal by any measure.  Note- I was provide a sample for evaluation, review, and a no obligation review.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this set of brushes! This brush set was featured in a youtuber&#x27;s favorites video and I gave it a try since I was needing brushes. I currently only own eye brushes by Sigma so I can only compare to them. These are just as good if not better and the price is very reasonable. As long as they hold up after washing, I have no other reason not to continue purchasing these brushes!</li>
    <li> Buy this brush. Seriously. It is comparable to the Mac 217. It&#x27;s perfect and blends my shadows perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> great quality! it is amazing for smaller eyes and detailing.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of eye shadow brush set. It has everything you need for a good quality and good price point. I would recommend this. I washed the brush before i used it with warm soapy water and the bristle didn&#x27;t fall off. They are soft also so I can comfortably swipe them back and forth or pat the eye shadow to my eyes.</li>
    <li> So excited over these brushes! The blending brush is a perfect dupe for the MAC 217 brush. Love this set</li>
    <li> Brushes are good , somehow they have a weird scent on it</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes and I cannot stop using them..They are so soft and easy to use.And I am so happy with my purchase.I love how beauty junkees came up these high quality brushes at such reasonable price.I am eyeing their kabuki brushes now.Have already heard lot of good reviews about them.</li>
    <li> excellent value for these brushes. they work well</li>
    <li> Really great set of brushes. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup brush guru or junkie...I&#x27;ve never owned Mac anything...so I can&#x27;t compare, but I gotta say I love these brushes. I also own the Bdellium brushes in the green bamboo series, and I gotta say I find myself reaching for these more. I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredible! I was skeptical at first and thought they would be just like any other eye makeup brush. However, I could instantly tell a huge difference on the smoothness of the application and even distribution of eye color when using these brushes. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Got these based on YT channel review and am really happy with them.  Haven&#x27;t used all of them but it is great starter set for a great price. With or without discount code!</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes. They&#x27;re really soft and I used a coupon code so I got them for a good price! There was a bit of shedding when I received them and took them out of the packaging but it was only a few hairs. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of them and the brush case. Once I received them it smelled strongly of nail polish or nail polish remover and I couldn&#x27;t get over that until I washed them. But great brushes over all.</li>
    <li> The Pro Series Eye brush set includes every brush possible to create fabulous eye make-up. I especially love the flat brush, but there are contours, liners, crease brush and so much more in this kit. One of my daughters is a cosmetologist and she loves this set as well. For great make-up results, this kit is a wonderful addition. The brushes are well made and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding or loose hairs. The quality is first rate. I have been using a Kabuki brush from Beauty Junkees for almost a year and I have had no problems with it. I am happily adding these to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is versatile and fabulous. The brushes come in a nice zipper pouch for convenience. These are simply wonderful brushes and the set includes 8 brushes to create any make up effect for eyes and brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this kit to review and I am super happy with the performance, quality and the variety of brushes provided in the handy, nice case.</li>
    <li> this is very comparable to MUCH more expensive blending brushes!  blends and fits beautifully in my eyelid crease - great for smoky looks!</li>
    <li> Received these today!  Very nice quality brushes and the pouch will come in handy when we travel!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Everything you need for any eye look. Highly recommend them. The pouch is great too. I use it in my purse.</li>
    <li> High quality eye brushes!! Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Pro Eye Set.  The brushes came quickly and are all as described.  The handles are sturdy and the bristles are soft and dense and work as well as my more expensive brushes.  I was also very pleased with the quality of the zippered case.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every time I do my makeup. I feel like they need to be &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; in a little but after a few uses and washes they are great. The bag is good quality and convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Beauty Junkee products. I own 4 of them and they have yet to disappoint. I actually returned my high end makeup brushes (Urban Decay, MAC, etc) in favor of the ones from Beauty Junkees. The company is so thoughtful and I love the helpful tips and thoughtful packaging that come with every purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice long handles and a nice variety of high quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Just got my brushes and I love them! Great service and fast shipping! The brushes are super soft!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Shadow goes on so smoothly!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I have had it for less then a week and I can&#x27;t wait to use it every morning. It blend every color so perfectly and the brush is so soft on my face. This brush is the best investment for someone who is serious about applying their make up flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I love my Pro Eye Make up Brush!! I ordered the pro all over shading brush and its great!! I am a Makeup Artist and I love Beauty Junkees brushes!! my clients love them and always ask where to get them. The Customer service for Beauty Junkees is the BEST I have ever received!! you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> These are fantastic brushes. I heard about them from a YouTube website and ordered them the next day. They are everything I needed! Soft and durable. The company that sells them even sent me an email on how to use each brush and a second email on cleaning them. Also, in case your memory is like mine, each brush is labeled with the proper use. Thanks, Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> I also found this through a recommendation from online blogs. There are many Mac brush dupes in this kit. However, I find that some brushes were much scratchier than the Mac brushes. I had to switch from using the Beauty Junkee crease brush while blending to a Mac one because it was scratching my eye a bit too much. Only the white brushes felt like that but the others were fine. They feel sturdy and not cheap quality which was awesome considering how great of a deal this is. Shipping was super fast and I received a friendly follow up e-mail after purchasing.</li>
    <li> What a great, inexpensive brush set!  Not super-pro quality BUT much better than most Sephora/Ulta options.  Stiff enough to place pigments &amp; soft enough to blend properly.  Nice brush &#x27;integrity&amp;#34; for a non-pro set.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brushes.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes for the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful.  I purchased after watching a YouTube review and demo.  They performed exactly as described.  They are soft, pick up a good amount of color and blend like a dream.  I love the variety of shapes/uses and the pouch is fun!  Shipping was very quick and the quality top notch.</li>
    <li> Just received these brushes and tried them and I love them. Everything you need to complete an eye shadow look.</li>
    <li> As always, brushes from Beauty Junkees are amazing! The quality is top notch and they are so soft and smooth! Love love love these!</li>
    <li> I have a very large collection of makeup brushes, and love trying out new brands. I ordered the angled brush and have been using it everyday. I use it for highlighting under my brow bone, but it also works well for blending colors in and around the crease. Very soft bristles with no shedding, I would definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> Before I odered this set I did some research on other eye sets, but I decided to get this one when I saw a YouTube video reviewing it. When I received it in the mail, I opened it right away. As I  opened it a terrible chemical smell came out of the bag. All the brushes came inside of a black cosmetic bag and each brush was individually wrapped inside. I washed them the way I wash my other brushes. There was no shedding except for the black bristle blending brush, that one shed A LOT. I&#x27;m thinking because it&#x27;s new but we&#x27;ll see. They dried pretty fast, like a few hours. The chemical scent also disappeared so that&#x27;s good. I used them when they dried right away to apply my eyeshadow and they are so soft. Overall, I think they applied my makeup awesome. These brushes are very good quality, they don&#x27;t look or feel cheap. The only think I&#x27;m not too happy about are the blending brushes in this set. I&#x27;m going to continue using these brushes for a month then update my review.</li>
    <li> I opened the package, was amazed by the feel of the brushes, washed them, then used them ,.....these brushes are better than good they are great....I had no idea what I was missing......Ladies and Gentlemen, add these brushes to your collection you will be amazed and pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  They are very soft and make blending so much easier.  The more I use them the better my eye shadow looks.  The case does smell like nail polish remover so I don&#x27;t use it.  I wish the brushes came with one of the cases where the brushes stand up so it would be easier to tell them apart.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very very impressed with these brushes,excellent price and quality,a great addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> I loved the eye makeup brushes! They are great quality, they don&#x27;t shed and they blend beautifully. They are also soft so they don&#x27;t hurt my eyes because I have really sensitive eyes. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this and came a day early. I washed it then used it right away and they were just amazing! The brushes picked up the makeup very well and they feel very soft. Only one thing I was disappointed with was the white blending brush because it wasn&#x27;t as soft as the rest but it&#x27;s okay since there were 2 other blending brushes anyways.</li>
    <li> Love the pouch and the variety of brushes. Maybe not super great quality, but good for the price point.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great value!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use all brushes, but the brushes I have used are good so far</li>
    <li> Awesome seller. Best brushes I own besides my sigma ones! Great dupes and very affordable :)</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes!  I also received an email telling me exactly how to use each brush. Very helpful!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable brand of brushes, or are in need of a beginners eyebrush set, this should be your go to because everything you need is included in this set. Arrived in the mail super fast, and the zippered pouch it comes with is great! Though there&#x27;s a smell to the pouch when you first open it, you can easily get over it. I absolutely LOVE the eyeliner brush, it&#x27;s my go to!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about theses lovely brushes!  Everything you need for beautiful eye makeup is in this set. They are soft and beautifully made. You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing quality and the price point is great! They arrived on time and blend like a MAC brush but without the cost! can&#x27;t wait to order another set for travel kit!</li>
    <li> Just received these brushes and used them for inly two days now. Very happy and will definetely be ordering some single brushes I had my eye on.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are great and have taken my eye makeup to another level.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes, they are very soft! great quality! I would like to try out the other brushes from this brand! :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  They are super soft and remind me of a more expensive brand.  So glad I purchased them and would totally recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. I have used them every day since receiving them. The eyeliner and blending brushes are my favorite. All of them are soft on the skin and very well made and the case is an added bonus. For the quality you cannot beat the cost of these brushes. They will definitely be a staple.</li>
    <li> Wow these brushes are absolutely amazing! The shipping was really fast, and I received them in 3 days from when I ordered them. The brushes are very high quality, especially for the price. They are definitely better quality than my sigma brushes. I am really impressed and happy with my purchase. Will definitely be purchasing more brushes from them!</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes!!!  Best ones I&#x27;ve ever used!  Excellent customer care.  Received an email explaining how to use each brush....very helpful!!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> The brushes are easy to use and there is support information on their professional use.  Very helpful for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are mac dupes and for such an affordable price. They are great quality and blend the eyeshadows so well. After wash the brushes did not shed and did not get flimsy. The shipping was quick and they arrived the very next day. The brush holder which comes along with the brushes is a nice leather finish pouch to carry the brushes in, its very travel friendly. I have been using these brushes daily for my eyeshadows and they works very well. They are totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I just love these makeup brushes!!  Excellent quality, and great price :-)  Delivery was super fast too!!  I will definitely order from Beauty Junkees again.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice and a good value. I haven&#x27;t used them for too long but I like them so far. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell when I first received them.</li>
    <li> I am quite impressed with this eye brush set.  They are very nice and do an amazing job at blending.  Sometimes when an eye brush is too soft it doesn&#x27;t pick up product or blend well but that is not the case with these.  I first bought the pencil brush to try them out and quickly bought the set. I did the same with the kabuki brush set.  I have only washed them once but they dry nicely and there was no shedding at all. The quality of these brushes are on par with higher end brushes at a much lower price...Win.  I would recommend these to both beginners and the pros they are just that good. Looking forward to trying more products from BeautyJunkees.</li>
    <li> Love it! Got these as a gift and they are amazing.</li>
    <li> These are beauty brushes and are definitely dupes for sigmas. The tapered blending brush is a dupe for the e40, crease brush is a dupe for e38. Pro blending one is a dupe for e25 and mac 217.. must haves! If you have problems with your brushes, just let them know, they have the best customer service ever!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Pro Crease brush, and like all my Beauty Junkie brushes it reigns supreme over all other brushes. Perfect for defining your crease and then blending out. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by any of their brushes!</li>
    <li> This set has every brush you could need to create the perfect eye look! The brushes are so incredibly soft and amazing quality! This set is a absolutely most!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, Very happy with them</li>
    <li> I am no professional makeup artist but I do consider myself a seasoned makeup junkie and I think these brushes are for the most part, fantastic.  I find myself reaching for these over some of my MAC and other drugstore favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the set with the makeup bag. The stars of the set that stick out the most are the white pencil brush and the angled shader brush.  The pencil brush is phenomenal for applying a shimmery hilight color to the inner corners of your eyes and brow bone. It has the perfect density and point for this small area to create a diffused glow with ease. The angled shader brush applies your outer corner color with ease and blends it fantastically with your lid color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ones that I don&#x27;t have as much use for is the white blending brush and the crease brush, which are sadly no match for the legendary MAC 217 and 224, but I am by no means regretful of purchasing the whole set or having them in my arsenal, since they are backups when I get too lazy to clean my other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this set of beautiful and ridiculously soft brushes are an amazing buy, especially at the price point. This would make a wonderful gift for someone first starting out with makeup or someone who would like to expand their collection.</li>
    <li> Oh ya! These are great brushes! A few of them have replaced favorites from MAC and Sigma in my collection.</li>
    <li> Impressive brush set! Soft and good variety.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and they were reasonable compared to the MAC brushes and was very happy with them. Each brush has its purpose and easy to handle, which is very helpful for someone who is trying to get their makeup on precisely.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes, perfect set to travel with!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush! Glad I ordered it. I&#x27;ve ordered from them before, and I love those brushes, too.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. You get all the brushes you need to complete any eye look. Super soft bristles, they have become my new &#x27;go to&#x27; brushes. I have been using them more then my Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Excellent value, terrific brushes on par with those 3 and 4 times this price.  High quality, each brush clearly marked with its intended purpose although most are certainly multi-use.  I will repurchase from this company again and soon.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  The quality is good and a good value for the money.  Customer Service is great.  I will definitely order more brushes.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the quality of these brushes and look forward to professional results!</li>
    <li> Very soft brush and blends very well! I used it to blend my eyeshadows and it works great! Seriously such great quality!</li>
    <li> I have actually been using this brush as a mini concealer brush for my foundation mineral powder and it workings really nicely! Very happy with all by brushes from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> Received my brushes a week ago and used it everyday since then! The bag it came in is cute. The brushes are real good to work with.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.They are very soft and very useful. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These brushes are fabulous! I am a brush lover and collector and these rival the best I have. I cannot recommend them more highly!</li>
    <li> Great brushes in good price</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Beauty Junkie makeup brushes, I am so excited for their eye brushes! Their products are outstanding and always worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with makeup brushes &amp; I have so many different brands from drugstore to high end &amp; luxury so when I kept seeing Beauty Junkees makeup brushes being used in many YouTube tutorials I was curious to check them out. Once I read many of the 2,000+ 5 star reviews &amp; noticed the incredibly affordable price I placed an order immediately! I actually ordered all 3 sets of Beauty Junkees brushes but this review is about the eye brush set. First off, in this set you&#x27;ll receive every brush u need to do ANY eye look. I tugged on every brush head &amp; there was no shedding &amp; the ferrules are on nice &amp; tight. There was no strong scent upon opening  the brushes. Each brush is individually wrapped &amp; the set comes with a zippered leatherette pouch that&#x27;s also surprisingly high quality. The brush hairs are super soft but they blend, pick up &amp; deposit product beautifully. Each brush handle is labeled &amp; stamped with the Beauty Junkees logo &amp; the wood handles with the copper ferrules look sleek &amp; expensive &amp; feel comfortable in your hands when applying eye makeup. Everything arrived quickly &amp; in perfect condition. Something else that really impressed me is Beauty Junkees customer service! Before I even received my brushes, they sent me an email with detailed instructions on proper care &amp; cleaning instructions plus what each brush is used for. All in all my whose experience with buying Beauty Junkees brushes had been an amazing experience &amp; I highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to bareminerals and it cosmetics brushes I choose these hands down. I use them everyday, and wash them with bareminerals conditioning shampoo and there is still no shedding. LOVE LOVE LOVE! I used a code and got them for like 28, and recommend everyone to buy.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a cost effective brush that does what it&#x27;s supposed to instead of leaving hairs all over your face. I have  been tryingn this brush out for a little over a week and it is amazing. It blends my shadows seamlessly in the first try. I also washed it just to see how it held up and there was no loose hairs falling out. Must have brush!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are superior to many of the brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased through many different places.  They&#x27;re soft, don&#x27;t shed and wash well.  I  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great brushes I love them!!!</li>
    <li> First I want to say I am not a makeup guru, so I do not own the high-end makeup brushes and cannot compare these brushes to those. However, I do have the very popular E.L.F brushes and Coastal Scents 22 piece set and that is what I am basing my review on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;They do not shed, unlike my 22 piece set (which everyone says they don&#x27;t, but mine did and continue to)&lt;br /&gt;They are soft, except the white blender...it is a little scratchy and I mean a little, like one of the hairs is more coarse than the others. I will still use it.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes picked up the right amount of product and blended beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say if you are on the fence about the purchase...don&#x27;t be, going from what I have been using to these is really wonderful. And if they are as comparable to the high-end brushes you definitely can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> I bought the flat kabuki brush and this set. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but there were so many raving reviews. You can add mine to the list. These brushes are in excellent quality and I own Sigma brushes as well. I would dare say they are even a bit more softer and the handles are sturdy. The shipping was fast and they were packaged carefully. I do have to note that upon opening the case that came with the eye brushes, there was a strong odor. However, I have left the case open to air out and now it is wonderful. I did not notice that with the foundation brush so maybe it&#x27;s the case. Definitely, will have to get the other kabuki brushes. They are very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, very good quality &amp; price!</li>
    <li> Heard about these on &amp;#34;hot and Flashy&amp;#34; you tube site...great product AND discount from you tube site...Bonus!</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. White bristled brushed are not as soft as the rest.</li>
    <li> Recommended by Angie on YouTube channel, &amp;#34;Hot and Flashy.&amp;#34; I have been using brushes from Trish McEvoy (excellent, BTW), Bobbie Brown and Laura Mercier for years. Several of the Beauty Junkees brushes have now displaced my prestige brushes, largely because their fluffy heads do a great job of picking up shadow (mostly Trish McEvoy) and laying them on my 60-year-old, slightly saggy eyelids without a lot of hard work. Great value, great brushes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Thsee are nice brushes.  They wash up well, dry well and in shape. They are very balanced  in your hand. I was especially  impressed  with the angled eyeliner brush. It is very thin so you could also use this to apply product to your eyebrows, it is very precise. It is even more precise  than my Anastasia  brow brush.  The application  brush is very good and packs on product  nicely. The crease and blending brushes are very nice also. The angled brush is perfect also for making that outer V to open your eyes up.  Pencil and push brushes are excellent for eyeliner and for smoking eyeliner shadow out.  All in all they are really good brushes. P.S. nice case too!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes! Use them every day . Best brushes I have ever bought! The large kabuki brushes r also awesome!</li>
    <li> Beyond my expectations ! I already heard so many great reviews but when you receive it &amp; see for yourself, they&#x27;re amazing. The quality is so good &amp; the case was a lot bigger than I thought ! I can&#x27;t get over how soft they feel. I&#x27;m already in love &amp; have yet to use them ! Definitely do not regret getting this ! Can&#x27;t wait to put them to use !</li>
    <li> I love these brushes which are labeled so I always know which one to use for what.  Top quality and they make a difference in how my eye shadow looks, making it easy to blend. I will be ordering these for my daughter after she tried mine. She loves them.</li>
    <li> These brushes feel very nice against my skin and apply eye makeup beautifully. I use the tapered blending brush, crease brush and allover shader brush daily and I use the other brushes as well when I put on a lot of makeup for going out. I like them more than some of the more expensive brushes I have used in the past. The pouch that comes with the brushes is a really good size too-- it fits all the eye makeup brushes as well as the other brushes I use.</li>
    <li> I have bought all of the brushes from this brand and I was doubtful on getting this eye set. So I went ahead and got the set and I have to say this is one of the best purchases I have made this year. Amazing set with all the brushes you need to achieve a look like a pro. I have sigma, bobbi brown, real techniques, and morphe brushes and this set is my go to this days! Do not doubt yourself and get it now! ... And the rest of the face brushes too... I think they are better than Sigma ones!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes a few months ago and when I first got my package the brushes and the case had a strong smell. After washing the brushes a couple times the smell did go away after a while. Some brushes did shed a bit when I first got them, but they shed way less than the bh cosmetics brush set I recently bought. After a couple of washes they did stop shedding. These brushes are so soft! They are way softer than the bh cosmetics brushes. The bh cosmetics brushes scratch my eyes and these brushes don&#x27;t. I love using the precision eyeliner brush for my eyebrows. I use the Anastasia Dipbrow with the brush and I find that it helps me create a soft feathery brow with it. I also love using the angled shading brush to highlight my brow bone. The blending and crease brushes are soft and can easily create any eyeshadow look. These are great quality brushes that I would recommend to anyone whether they are just starting to build their brush collection or have brushes in their collection already.</li>
    <li> Bought the dupe for Mac 217. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this brush set. I thought it was a great value and shipping was extremely fast! I keep my brushes in a holder so I am not using the case for that but I am sure I will get some use out of the case when I travel. I would recommend this set, matter of fact I did recommend it by posting it on facebook page. :-)</li>
    <li> Brushes are great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and hold the makeup well. I just received them, but like them so far.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes that come in their own zipper case. Work just as well as many of my much more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality brushes for a very nice price!  These brushes feel much more &#x27;lush&#x27; than others I have owned.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  Great value.  These are very comparable to my It Cosmetic brushes and I actual like some of these better.  Shipping was very quick.  I had them in just couple of days.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!  They are super soft….felt like my eyelids were getting a massage when I used them.  And with the variety of sizes, I can finally reach those tiny eye creases!  Also worked great at blending eyeshadow colors smoothly.  For sure a two thumbs up!!  Love them!</li>
    <li> Quality products at an affordable price! Would purchase from again</li>
    <li> This feels like a very high quality brush! The bristles are soft and it works well for my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for all over eye color.  The tip of the brush is nice and full and evenly spreads my shadows over my lids.  I love it and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am a junkee for Beauty Junkees.  I really like all their products.  I purchased the All Over Shader brush and it&#x27;s great.  The bristles are very soft.  The handle is very sturdy.  It&#x27;s a really well-made product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this brush I love all of beauty junkees brushes they are great and last a long time</li>
    <li> THE BEST BRUSHES AROUND!!!!! I got these as a gift for my birthday, and when my mom gave them to me she told me they are the best brushes I will ever use. She was 100000% right!!!!!!! I love these brushes and cannot see myself using any other brand. They are super soft and easy to use.. I would recommend these for beginners and pros! I use them every single day and plan on getting the face brushes next!</li>
    <li> These brushes never disappoint.  I ordered the blending brush and I love it. It&#x27;s soft, but sturdy enough to blend my shadow, without all of my shadow coming off on the brush. I washed it and there was no shedding at all.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes. The one thing that was slightly bothersome was the smell of the bag that it came in but I left it to air out overnight and the smell went away! These are def. worth buying!</li>
    <li> This is a must have in your collection of brushes. they are absolutely amazing quality brush and for the price you cannot go wrong. They get the job done. The bristles are so soft and they are honestly like the best brushes I have ever owned. If you are looking for affordable brushes I completely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Beauty Junkees has some of the best brushes around! Nice soft bristles and little carrying pouch. Don&#x27;t think about it, just buy them!</li>
    <li> Brushes are very high quality, and make application a breeze. You truly can not do a great job, without great tools....these are great tools.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes on the market. They are as good as the high end ones I have owned.</li>
    <li> Bought the eye shadow brush. It arrived quickly and in good condition.  I washed it and let it air dry. I used it to apply my mac eye shadow and it worked great. Nice smooth application. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great eye shadow brush!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have many eye makeup brushes and didn&#x27;t feel like I needed them but since I got a discount for them I decided to try two. I&#x27;ve only used them 3 times and oh my baby Jesus!! They&#x27;re amazing and have completely transformed my eye makeup. And that&#x27;s only 2! I can&#x27;t imagine what I could do with the whole set! Most definitely going to the whole set in the future. I would totally recommend them no doubt. Very happy thank you beauty junkees :)</li>
    <li> Received my brushes last week. Loved the quality. I think they&#x27;re very comparable to Sigma brushes. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought theses because I saw a Youtuber rave about these in her favourites;I&#x27;m glad she did. They&#x27;re all soft  with the exception of the liner brushes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a &amp;#34;core&amp;#34; set of eye brush &amp; these fit the bill perfectly. I&#x27;ve washed them &amp; they&#x27;ve held their shape.</li>
    <li> 3/8 brushes (tapered blending, crease, blending) frayed after the first wash and it&#x27;s basically unusable for its original purpose now, and the angled shadow brushed arrived frayed because of the plastic wrap it was in. The Sigma E40 dupe (tapered blending) shed and bled and the MAC 217 dupe (blending) is scratchy and hurts when I blend, and I personally don&#x27;t have sensitive eyelids. As you can see in the photo, the brush head is really frayed, and this brushed is originally supposed to be a little flatter and in uniform shape. **EDIT** Beauty Junkees and their customer service are great! They have sent out a replacements and I will update again once I get them.</li>
    <li> By far the best brushes to take with me when traveling. They&#x27;re soft and dense so the shadow looks perfectly blended out. Definitely the best dupe for sigma brushes at a way more affordable price.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes at such a reasonable price.  They are perfect for applying eye makeup.  Beauty Junkees continues to be an excellent source for beauty products.</li>
    <li> Love love these brushes! I&#x27;m obsessed with makeup brushes, I&#x27;m so impressed with the quality and blend ability. I definitely will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> What a nice set of brushes for the price. I&#x27;m old school and always used the little sponges that came with shadows, so I&#x27;m enjoying using all the different brushes.</li>
    <li> This is the best set of brushes purchased yet! I&#x27;ve tried many, including some higher end, that left me under-whelmed. These, however, have made a huge difference in my makeup application and I am thrilled: no shedding, great blending, excellent control and fierce payoff. I sincerely got complimented twice today on my eyeshadow by randome strangers, which was very cool. Now I want them all, lol!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned these brushes for one week but so far, I&#x27;ve liked them so much that I gave my other set to my daughter. I also appreciate that they sent me a detailed email on how to clean them. All is good and I plan on buying another set for a friend.</li>
    <li> So far they seem like they&#x27;re very good quality. I honestly love the bag and I can&#x27;t wait to use these.</li>
    <li> I subscribe to youtubes Hot&amp;Flashy.  Angie raved over these brushes, compared them to It&#x27;s no tug.  I had to give them a try and am not sorry I did.  The one thing that defines these brushes for me is the amount of produced they pick up and apply.  Great brushes, great price.</li>
    <li> I was looking only for a new blush brush, but I was so impressed with the reviews for these brushes that I ended up getting the full 5-piece Kabuki set and the full 8-piece Eye Makeup brush set! I decided that finding brushes this good at a reasonable price point warranted getting rid of all my old and not-so-great brushes and starting fresh with a great matching set. I am so happy with my purchases... the brushes exceed my expectations. They are sturdy, full and soft, with a perfectly balanced feel in your hand. The quality is top notch. That goes for the cases too for both sets - unbelievably well-made! I cannot believe brushes this good are this reasonable, and I&#x27;m so happy I found Beauty Junkee.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!! I bought these after buying the Beauty Junkees face brushes. I&#x27;m someone that has to research product before buying. I was already thinking of buying real technique when I came across beauty Junkees.  I was amazed of how many good reviews they had so I just had to try them out..... Love them....best purchase ever. Great price too. And very very fast shipping. Can&#x27;t get any better. -jessica</li>
    <li> This is an excellent set of brushes. They were recommended by a video blogger on You Tube, and I&#x27;m glad I ordered them.On the brush is written what it is used for and they are are very soft. This is especially important for the sensitive eyelid skin. Love the feel of these brushes. The flat and slant eyeliner brushes are very precise. By sending you emails Beauty  Junkees makes sure you have instructions on how to clean them and how to use them. I am very satisfied of this product. Will be looking for more products from this company as they value their customers.</li>
    <li> Great brushes at an affordable price.  I will definitely purchase the kabuki set.  Good job Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> These are incredible brushes.  Unique mixture that makes doing my eye makeup SO MUCH easier. Highly recommend. The quality is incredible compared to the cost.  I&#x27;m not sure how they did that :-)</li>
    <li> These are a very good set of eye makeup brushes. They bristles are very soft. I especially like the crease brush, the tapered blending, and pencil brush. They come in a very nice case!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these brushes. The quality is just as good as my Sigma brushes. And wayyyy more affordable too! I really love them. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> a great buy.  would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I been buying brushes for awhile trying to avoid paying 100s of dollars and when I found this set it was all I needed. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this collection of brushes.  I&#x27;ve just received them and am very anxious to start using them everyday.  The quality of the brushes and the zippered pouch is phenomenal. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes! I spent so much time researching for the perfect brushes and I am so glad I purchased these! They are everything you could possibly need AND they are great quality. Dupes to Sigma and Mac, if not better! So happy with this purchase. Also have a flat top kabuki brush for foundation from Beauty Junkees and it is amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the 8 eye makeup brush set.  All the brushes are good quality and the case is large enough to add some of my other brushes.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> As with all my other Beauty Junkee purchases, these brushes are totally amazing. Soft and yet densely packed, they perform really well and stand up to my expensive brushes. I&#x27;m a #beautyjunkee for life</li>
    <li> Love the brush set and the pouch it came in, great for storage and to travel. The brushes are good quality and very soft. You get the variety of brushes for a good price point.</li>
    <li> Probably some of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used. Perfect precise blending, I can literally create ny eye make-up looks with these. Some do get frayed, but it is unbeatable for the price!</li>
    <li> I had a chance to use a handful of the brushes this morning, and I have to say, my eye makeup looks amazing! I specifically used the All Over Shader, Angled Shading, and Precision Eye Liner brushes. I&#x27;m excited to try out the Pencil and Blending brushes next.There is such a wide variety of options and all of the brushes are so soft and well made that I don&#x27;t mind experimenting with different looks since I know they won&#x27;t irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes. Thanks again for quality products I can trust, Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the variety, quality, versatility and cost of the eye brush set. It is a marvelous clever composite for creating dynamic eye enhancement. Truly am more than satisfied with brushes. Beauty Junkees have done it again: Great quality products, supper efficient service, nicely packaged in a lovely case, received the brushes within 3 days.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really love the Beauty Junkees brushes. They are affordable yet hold up really well. I ordered the blending brush and its soft and blends great. Does not shed either!</li>
    <li> I have to say that those are the best eyebrushes that i&#x27;ve used untill now. I have Sigma, Real Techniques and many more. The Beauty Junkees brushes are the ones to beat. They are the best....</li>
    <li> I ordered the angled eye liner brush. It very soft, and applies gel eyeliner line a Pro brand. I have many Beauty Junkees brushes and I&#x27;ve never had to deal broken handles or shedding.</li>
    <li> The bristles on my all over shadow brush are very soft but still able to pick up a lot of product. Will definitely consider purchasing more from this set. Shipping was very fast too.</li>
    <li> This professional assortment has eight different brushes intended for eyes only.  Having excellent quality brushes like these makes a huge difference when applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are plush, don&#x27;t shed, and wash well.  The wooden handles have a perfectly smooth lacquer finish and metal ferrules.  Each one is labeled with the intended use.  Overall length varies from about 6 1/4 to 7 in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage pouch is made of soft synthetic leather with fuchsia lining and a smooth zipper.  It measures 9 x 4 1/2 in. and will hold a lot more than just these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Junkees provided a set of brushes for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Beauty Junkees Brushes. I already owned the four big face brushes and loved them, so I was very excited to try out the pencil eye brush. To make it short: I love it! It applies to the point, which is, in my case, the V of the eye, because this is what I wanted it for. It takes up the right amount of product and when I cleaned it, it didn&#x27;t loose one hair. After drying, it stayed in shape and what I really like about it, is it&#x27;s handle. I&#x27;m owning a bunch of brands, Real Techniques, Makeup Geek and It-brushes. What makes this one stand out, is that the handle is a bit more thicker and heavier, which I like a lot, because it makes the application easier. Especially when it comes to a pencil brush I find this very helpful, because you want the color at a certain point and not all over the place. I&#x27;m very happy with my new brush and will certainly use it on a daily base. Thank you Beauty Junkees for yet another wonderful product!   Updated Review March 15 2015  I ordered the whole set of brushes after I loved the pencil eye brush so much and I received it within a couple of days. I mentioned in another review that one of the brushes in the set had some issues with shading, while the rest of the set was the normal high quality and even though I never contacted the customer service, they contacted ME after reading my review and offered me a replacement for the one shading brush. I have never ever experienced such an amazing customer service. I just had to let you guys know, because apart from offering a high quality product for a really affordable price, they really take care of their customers, even after the whole bought it - rated it process. I can only repeat what I said before:   The brushes are an excellent quality (the one where I had some issues with was an exception, I own 15 Beauty Junkees Brushes and 4 of them for over a year and not one of them ever shaded on me and I use them on a daily base). The price is great and the customer service is unlike anything I have ever experienced. So, even if you do have a problem, there&#x27;s nothing to worry about. They&#x27;ve got your back. Give those brushes a try if you are looking for a long time companion.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the blending brush from Beauty Junkees and I love it! It&#x27;s soft, and fluffy and the fibers are the perfect length. It is everything I look for in a blending brush, and it is perfect for the job. I have no complaints about this brush - the quality and performance are both professional. I cannot recommend these brushes enough!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for my well loved and now super worn Mac 224 brush and I think it works just as great at blending, definitely a steal it&#x27;s not one of those brushes that look nice in the picture and when you receive it, it looks like it&#x27;s about to fall apart these are very well made brushes I also own the flat top kabuki and have had no shedding at all</li>
    <li> I went with the pro crease brush and I love it. I had previously purchased a flat top Kabuki from Beauty Junkees and I absolutely love it,  so I knew this brush wouldn&#x27;t disappoint. The bristles are super soft,  the design of the brush is lightweight,  and it leaves shadows flawless and well blended if used correctly. Zero regrets on my purchase,  and will definetly keep on buying brushes and products from Beauty Junkees in the future ❤</li>
    <li> This is a great set to do \\&quot;professional\\&quot; looking eye shadow. Finally learned to use the angled brush! (Thanks Angie!)    I have 2 other Beauty Junkees brushes, and they are great. I use these brushes every day.    AND WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!</li>
    <li> I think that these brushes are nice and would have given 5 stars, but when I opened the bag they came in, it smelled like nail polish.  It was a very strong odor.  After I washed them it was fine and they are working great.  They are kind of light--I am used to heavier brushes, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  They are soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding after I washed them.</li>
    <li> I purchased the precision eye liner brush and I love it! The brush is soft yet strong--I get a great clean line with this brush which isn&#x27;t always easy with gel eyeliner. I am a Beauty Junkees fan!! I love their brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought the eyeshadow brush and it&#x27;s amazing.  It&#x27;s super soft, easy to clean and not once have I had any issues with the bristles coming out (unlike other makeup brushes I&#x27;ve tried).  This brush is A+.</li>
    <li> As usual, Beauty Junkees has delivered another great quality cosmetic brush at terrific value!  Comparable to MAC, Sephora, etc. at a fraction of the price!  Beauty Junkees continues to prove that they are the first go-to source for great, long-lasting makeup brushes at the most competitive price points.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! My fav beauty blogger reviewed them and she was right. These are soft  and pick up a good amount of shadow. I like them better than some of the high end ones I have. One of the nicest things was that I got an email explaining how to use each brush. I would buy these again and have recommended them to others.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of the brushes particularly at this price point.  Anxious to try the rest of this line.</li>
    <li> I have used probably every brand of makeup brush available. However, these tops them all! Love how these are the perfect set of eye brushes. If I was going to put a set together, these are the exact ones I would want. I am looking forward to the time that I can try the face brushes. Give these a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!!</li>
    <li> There have been many times I&#x27;ve wished for a specially shaped brush for precision application of eye shadow or eyeliner as in, if I only had a crease brush, or a brush to blend a harsh black liner, or a brush to quickly cover the eyelid.  Well, guess what?  Every shape of brush I&#x27;ve wished for is in this collection, as well as a couple more I didn&#x27;t know I needed but now can&#x27;t do without!  They&#x27;re kept in a great little pouch that&#x27;s big enough for blush and powder brushes as well, so there&#x27;s no more scrabbling for the right brush.  It&#x27;s right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are of excellent quality; they&#x27;re easily washable after use and fast drying.They make applying eye makeup a slick and quick process, are a joy to use, and the results are fantastic.  No more raccoon eyes for me!  I highly recommend this set of brushes, especially if you&#x27;re not someone who spends hours on her face.  This set will pay for itself in time saved and lack of wasted product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set was provided for review, and I&#x27;m thrilled with it!</li>
    <li> Great brushes..full size..very very soft which is great for older eyes! Love the well made case and that the brushes are labeled. I also appreciated the e-mail with instructions as how to use each brush.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with these brushes! Very high quality at a reasonable price. They perform beautifully on my middle-aged eyes. Very little, if any, tugging on the lids when I apply eye shadow.  I also appreciated the communication from this company. The email describing how each brush is used was especially helpful. I highly recommend this brush set!</li>
    <li> I bought this set based on a youtube video that recommended it (I know, who actually falls for that right?). But I have to say, they are awsome! If there ever were dupes for MAC brushes out there, these are it. So impressed with them, great value and more importantly really quality brushes! I have washed them tons and they don&#x27;t shed and still hold their shape. The company (beauty junkees) sent me a follow up email after I purchased them with all of their information and some good makeup brush tips. Really impressed by this company!</li>
    <li> Amazing, I wasn&#x27;t sure at first but I&#x27;m glad I went for it. Plan on buying more</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and apply your makeup seamlessly! Great value and a great price! The set included every brush I would need for eyes all in a very handy cute case! I love these brushes and would highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Brushes arrived on time and are high quality.</li>
    <li> You can always count of Beauty Junkees when you need to quality makeup brushes. Shipping was super fast and you just can&#x27;t beat the quality. The brushes had yet to lose a fiber and they are the perfect shape and size. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for such an affordable price. I received a discount code and bought this set for $19.95 which is about $5 a brush plus a sleek brush pouch great for travel or storage. These didn&#x27;t feel cheap or poorly made, they are very soft and so far I have had little to no shedding. My favorites are the white blending brush (dupe for Mac217-not as fluffy but still soft and a good blending brush), pencil brush is so soft not scratchy at all, flat definer is sturdy &amp; flexible, and the shader is dense &amp; perfect for packing color. The other blending brushes are great also and I will get great use out of this set. I have the face brushes which I would also recommend. Especially if you can get the coupon codes. You will not find better brushes for $5-$7 anywhere. Plus the shipping was quick, I received them in 2 days, and customer service is awesome. They have sent me follow up emails from shipment to how to care for the brushes.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping!  These brushes are very soft and great for applying makeup, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These brushes work great! Very comparable to sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the set of brushes I received.  They came with a very nice carrying case large enough to hold most of my brush collection.  I have also been very impressed with the level of customer service I have received.  They have sent two emails as a followup to my order - one describing each brush I received and what it was for and how to use it and another email describing the proper way to care for the brushes.  I found both emails very helpful and really appreciated receiving the information.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes based on a YouTube review, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. The YouTuber I was watching had a special promo code for this specific set of brushes so I ended up getting the set for $26! Yes, 8 brushes plus a bonus makeup bag for only $26. Such a great deal. I was very impressed when I first saw the brushes, and the bonus bag was a very nice all black bag with the Beauty Junkees logo engraved in it. The brushes looked very well made, sleek, and the bristles were very soft. I was even more impressed after using them -- they worked wonderfully. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good affordable brushes, and these are exactly that. I know I only paid $26 for them, but they&#x27;re definitely worth the $39 they&#x27;re selling for. I even bought the mini kabuki brush set shortly after testing these out.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of eye brushes for the price.  The angled shadow brush is a little floppy, but is good for applying color to the outer V.  The allover shadow brush is fabulous and applies color very smoothly to the entire eye area.  The small angled brush is good for lining the lower lash line.</li>
    <li> Love the selection and quality!  Great brush set!</li>
    <li> This brush set is phenomenal. Very soft bristle that are gentle enough for eyes and excellent for blending. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes! Nice variety for many looks. Bristles are super soft with no shedding so far.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have made many purchases on Amazon over the years but have never reviewed anything.  I felt strongly enough about the quality of these brushes to post my first review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a beauty bloggers review I purchased this Beauty Junkees Eye Makeup Brush Set.  The review included a discount code which made these the most affordable brushes I have ever purchased.  Aside from an amazing price these brushes are high quality and come with a very well made case.  The brushes themselves don’t shed and I have experienced no tugging on my eyelids, just smooth application.  They are very soft, dense and pick up a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that each brush is imprinted on the handle with the name of the brush.  I am very impressed with this company who followed up the purchase with a detailed email explaining how to use each brush in the set as well as another email describing proper care for the brushes.  I will definitely be trying more of the brushes in the Beauty Junkees line!</li>
    <li> Great brushes totally changed my makeup game. Very easy to work with and gets the job done. Also very good quality plan on getting a couple more sets.</li>
    <li> Love them!  I have virtually every brush out there and these are a tremendous bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality brush. The bristles are soft although they are a little stiffer than synthetic bristles because they are narural goat hair. The brush washes well. It shedded a little the first washing and the bristles fluffed out quite a bit after washing, but I like it that way. It&#x27;s a good blending brush but because it&#x27;s a little stiffer you can definitely feel it on your eyelid, but it&#x27;s not quite scratchy that it hurts.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, quick delivery! As good as those that are four times this price!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.  The brushes have a nice feel in your hand when you are using them - a bonus working around your eyes.  Brushes hold powder well and the pouch is the perfect size for all your makeup brushes if you travel.</li>
    <li> Love all the brushes in this collection. Especially the pencil brush. It&#x27;s just like the sigma pencil brush!</li>
    <li> Very good brushes made by natural hair. The size is perfect, not too big or too small.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! A different brush for every area of your eye. My eye make up looks better then it ever has! I love the quality of all of the brushes I have gotten from Beauty Junkees. Never disappointed!</li>
    <li> The brushes are excellent.  I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on ordering the brush set.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if make up is your addiction!</li>
    <li> Brushes are great!  still learning how to use them</li>
    <li> I really love this brush set!  It includes everything you need (and more!) to get a perfect eye look.  I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable pencil brush as well as great blending brushes.  This set includes both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very soft and have nice, dense bristles.  I haven&#x27;t washed them yet but so far they do not have any shedding or other issues. The only problem I found is that the included brush pouch has a very strong chemical odor at first.  Once everything is removed from the plastic protection, though, the smell gradually fades.</li>
    <li> This brush works very well blending in the crease. I have so very many brushes and I could see myself going back to this one a lot.</li>
    <li> I picked up the pro angled shading brush and very pleased with it. It feels nice in hand and the head is super soft. I find it great for doing a soft daytime smoky eye, crease blending and highlighting along the brow.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend the brushes from this company more highly, I have a bunch now. They don&#x27;t shed, they wash well and they blend the makeup excellently. Plus they&#x27;re priced great - they&#x27;re definitely a win-win all around.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful set of brushes. I especially love the pencil brush which is perfect for getting eyeshadow in the vee of my hooded eyes and the all over shader is very dense and soft and works wonderfully. The brushes are very well made and definitely worth the money. The blending brushes are not as soft as like which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this set five stars.</li>
    <li> OMG! Just received these in the mail and they are perfect. They come in this sturdy bag that looks like the same bag that Zoeva brushes come in and they look very well made. I have not use them yet but as soon as I do I will be back on here with more info regarding perdormance. But from the looks of things.... these other brush companies have met their match and if they havent. They will!</li>
    <li> Love! Affordable dupes for high end brushes! Sigma and MAC. Pro blending brush is amazing, you can never have enough of those! And the angle shader brush is a MUST HAVE for me now. So glad I found this brand! Definitely going to try other things from this brand.</li>
    <li> Precision liner is just amazing! Helps me put gel liner in thinnest line and any shape.&lt;br /&gt;Flat definer is perfect for applying shadow on my lower lash line.&lt;br /&gt;Blending brushes are soft and what&#x27;s important for me-smaller then sigma e40.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with overall quality of the whole set, including the pouch:)</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes for mature, crepey eyelids!!  Nice quality...</li>
    <li> All the brushes work great. I&#x27;m glad I saw them on YouTube .</li>
</ol>
