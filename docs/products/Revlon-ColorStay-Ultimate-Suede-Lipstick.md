### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought this on a lark and found it to be the perfect product.</li>
      <li>perfect for a day at the office.  </li>
      <li>and backstage is a beautiful wine color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful plum color.</li>
      <li>I think Fashion Fair lipsticks are the best</li>
      <li>lol.  </li>
      <li>I saw a wine colored lipstick that looked amazing!</li>
      <li>Good color, goes on well and stays on longer than any lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>But I love Revlon products!</li>
      <li>I have 4 and want more!</li>
      <li>After seeing the wonderful women of France do light liner, swath of mascara and bold color lips....</li>
      <li>I totally love.</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered more than one since I like it so well.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more</li>
      <li>I love ColorStay</li>
      <li>my Favorite thank you</li>
      <li>The photo looks more purple</li>
      <li>Love love love it</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s my favorite color lipstick</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I got many compliments.</li>
      <li>but it get kinder &amp;#34;spacey&amp;#34; on the lip if that makes any sense... love the colour though...</li>
      <li>Wish it was better.</li>
      <li>For a lipstick that you can buy at a grocery store, it&#x27;s pretty damn good.</li>
      <li>I am way over 35 years old and this looks great on me.</li>
      <li>This berry color is perfect for a wide variety of occasions.</li>
      <li>Girl\\&quot;  - a bright vibrant coral color in the tube.  </li>
      <li>I will most certainly buy more of this brand.</li>
      <li>Second, the color in the picture shows a purple looking lipstick, but the reviews said it was a great looking wine color</li>
      <li>I found this light and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a great idea having it stay on for several hours.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Shade is more intense than I had hoped for and is more the texture of a lipstick than a lip stain.</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and it stays on for a long time.  </li>
      <li>After one good application, it pretty much stays on all day, even after eating and drinking.</li>
      <li>And I promise, this is the only product that has done this to my lips, I pride in taking good care of my lips.</li>
      <li>it really does stay on your lips for a long time and this color specifically is beautiful on.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it is OK if you are under 35, but I would not recommend this for anyone older.</li>
      <li>God did not put these beautiful little animals here so that greedy  people could torture them and kill them to produce their makup at a cheaper price in another country.</li>
      <li>Stays for a really long time with a lovely color!</li>
      <li>i absolutely love ultimate suede lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>and I have found this one to last quite a while before refreshing.</li>
      <li>the picture makes the lipstick look more fushia, when in reality it is more of a deep red or Merlot.</li>
      <li>again I don&#x27;t care how pretty they make it look.  </li>
      <li>The color is very pretty, and it feels very soft when I applied it.</li>
      <li>Love this, it stays on as long as my $22.  </li>
      <li>The only \\&quot;staying\\&quot; part of the lipstick is where it settles into fine lines on my lips.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer CoverGirl Outlast.</li>
      <li>It is really color stay I would buy again and again and again.</li>
      <li>Way better than a lot of lipsticks that I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money on.</li>
      <li>this color is very flattering (for me).</li>
      <li>Torturing and killing them to see how much is toxic to the user.  </li>
      <li>once dry(whitch takes about 20-30mins depending on how much you put on)  </li>
      <li>I do apply moisturizer through out the day, but it isn&#x27;t drying like many other stains.</li>
      <li>And although it is fairly long-lasting, it settles into fine lines which results in an unpleasant smudginess.</li>
      <li>Although the feeling of the lipstick formula itself was pretty nice and moisturizing, I was just not happy with the color.</li>
      <li>I have never been this satisfied with a long lasting lip color before.</li>
      <li>I had to purchase a new one because my 21 year-old daughter stole it.</li>
      <li>After a while it stops being very moisturizing but be careful, if you put chapstick on over it, the color comes right off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little sheerer than expected,  but the texture is nice.</li>
      <li>Have been a long-time Revlon lipstick wearer but this formula is completely unsatisfactory.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a few different colors and have been continually satisfied.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t chap or dry your lips, and it&#x27;s colorstay for real!</li>
      <li>Third, &amp;#34;ultimate suede colorstay&amp;#34; you&#x27;d think was a matte, but this thin shiny lipstick goes on like a cheap gloss for something you&#x27;d give a girl learning to wear lipstick for the first time.</li>
      <li>Does not dry my lips.  </li>

<li> Does not dry my lips.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually wear lipstick which made this really noticeable.</li>
<li> As long as you use only the lipstick, it lasts all day.</li>
<li> It does feel slightly dry on the lips though- not enough to stop me wearing it though.</li>
<li> Too bad Amazon&#x27;s yo-yo pricing keeps me waiting until the price is low enough to get some more colors.</li>
<li> I like how long the color stays on your lips</li>
<li> It was a sheer pink on my lips.  </li>
<li> My only issue is that sometimes the color is a little iridescent, but that&#x27;s not even that big of a deal.</li>
<li> but this is a deep wine color as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
<li> Use it on dry lips and it will seem to almost stain them for the day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just your average brick red color, and I have about 5 of those already.</li>
<li> The only cons are it is a little drying and every once in awhile</li>
<li> The only problem was when I applied it the color doesn&#x27;t go on your lips very dark.</li>
<li> socialite is alight pink nudeish color.</li>
<li> Total waste of money</li>
<li> Not sure why it is called colorstay because it doesn&#x27;t even last through lunchtime.</li>
<li> The picture makes you think it&#x27;s a kind of plum color, which is what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a lipstick lately, but when it came, I was totally disappointed.</li>
<li> Unless you are matching this color to an outfit, I would not recommend this color for fair-skinned women as it may be too dark.</li>
<li> I agree with the previous reviewer who said that this is not a lipstick for someone over 35.  </li>
<li> I applied this lipstick and I waited a while like I usually do with other brands</li>
<li> I thought the color was a little lighter.</li>
<li> This is the most horrible lipstick I have ever used.</li>
<li> No more Revlon for me.</li>
<li> This lipstick is a waste!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find though.</li>
<li> and now I&#x27;m wondering who&#x27;s writing these reviews, seriously?</li>
<li> But, in less than a minute the product made my lips look cracked (very very unappealing).</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a balm.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sticky and unpleasant feeling on my lips.  </li>
<li> Absolutely disgusting and unnecessary in this day and age .  </li>
<li> and  are shocked to see your lips all shriveled up.</li>
<li> And I was so disappointed with color.  </li>
<li> Really awful and embarrassing when you look in the mirror</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not sure why it is called colorstay because it doesn&#x27;t even last through lunchtime. I much prefer CoverGirl Outlast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear lipstick which made this really noticeable. I got many compliments. I&#x27;m a medium brown woman.</li>
    <li> The color &amp;#34;Backstage&amp;#34; looks nothing like it does in the picture. The picture makes you think it&#x27;s a kind of plum color, which is what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a lipstick lately, but when it came, I was totally disappointed. It&#x27;s just your average brick red color, and I have about 5 of those already. Although the feeling of the lipstick formula itself was pretty nice and moisturizing, I was just not happy with the color. I suggest you look up reviews ore swatches of a lipstick before ever buying it online.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love ultimate suede lipsticks.  they really last all day.  they are matt once dry(whitch takes about 20-30mins depending on how much you put on)  they have buildable color.  do not transfer to my white Styrofoam cup.  perfect for a day at the office.  and backstage is a beautiful wine color. second one is on its way lol.  supermodel is a purple nudeish color.  socialite is alight pink nudeish color.</li>
    <li> I like how long the color stays on your lips</li>
    <li> Stays for a really long time with a lovely color! Doesn&#x27;t chap or dry your lips, and it&#x27;s colorstay for real!</li>
    <li> my Favorite thank you</li>
    <li> The color (Backstage) was darker than it look online. But it goes on shear and is build-able. So you can choose to wear it shear or dark.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful plum color. Goes on smoothly. Feels like you&#x27;re wearing nothing. It doesn&#x27;t dry-out your lips.</li>
    <li> How can I review a lipstick?  It works for me is about all I can say.  It&#x27;s hard to find though.</li>
    <li> The color is very pretty, and it feels very soft when I applied it. But, in less than a minute the product made my lips look cracked (very very unappealing). And I promise, this is the only product that has done this to my lips, I pride in taking good care of my lips. Wish it was better.</li>
    <li> For a lipstick that you can buy at a grocery store, it&#x27;s pretty damn good. After one good application, it pretty much stays on all day, even after eating and drinking. Way better than a lot of lipsticks that I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of money on. I&#x27;ve purchased a few different colors and have been continually satisfied. My only issue is that sometimes the color is a little iridescent, but that&#x27;s not even that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> i like it, it definitely has staying power but it get kinder &amp;#34;spacey&amp;#34; on the lip if that makes any sense... love the colour though...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this out yet, just put it on to test how it looked. It&#x27;s a little sheerer than expected,  but the texture is nice. I think with multiple coats it will be a vampy wine color as I would like.</li>
    <li> Good color, goes on well and stays on longer than any lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Use it on dry lips and it will seem to almost stain them for the day.</li>
    <li> It is really color stay I would buy again and again and again. I totally love. Love love love it</li>
    <li> I will most certainly buy more of this brand. I love ColorStay it really does stay on your lips for a long time and this color specifically is beautiful on.</li>
    <li> Love this, it stays on as long as my $22.  lip color.  Does not dry my lips.  Is non transferrable.  All day color, that looks soft.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the color \\&quot;Backstage\\&quot; which is show in the magazine ad.  I have never been this satisfied with a long lasting lip color before.</li>
    <li> Have been a long-time Revlon lipstick wearer but this formula is completely unsatisfactory. It remains sticky, even after blotting. And although it is fairly long-lasting, it settles into fine lines which results in an unpleasant smudginess. Perhaps it is OK if you are under 35, but I would not recommend this for anyone older.</li>
    <li> the picture makes the lipstick look more fushia, when in reality it is more of a deep red or Merlot.</li>
    <li> Shade is more intense than I had hoped for and is more the texture of a lipstick than a lip stain.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviewer who said that this is not a lipstick for someone over 35.  The only \\&quot;staying\\&quot; part of the lipstick is where it settles into fine lines on my lips.  It&#x27;s sticky and unpleasant feeling on my lips.  And I was so disappointed with color.  I bought \\&quot;It Girl\\&quot;  - a bright vibrant coral color in the tube.  It was a sheer pink on my lips.  Total waste of money</li>
    <li> After seeing the wonderful women of France do light liner, swath of mascara and bold color lips....it&#x27;s become my go to face. I bought this on a lark and found it to be the perfect product. I don&#x27;t understand the sticky reviews....I found this light and moisturizing. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a balm. I do apply moisturizer through out the day, but it isn&#x27;t drying like many other stains. This berry color is perfect for a wide variety of occasions. I had to purchase a new one because my 21 year-old daughter stole it.</li>
    <li> The photo looks more purple but this is a deep wine color as other reviewers have mentioned. I am way over 35 years old and this looks great on me. However, I am a woman of color so that could make a difference. Unless you are matching this color to an outfit, I would not recommend this color for fair-skinned women as it may be too dark. A friend recommended this brand to me because she thought it was the longest lasting lipstick she had ever used. I think Fashion Fair lipsticks are the best but Revlon makes a lot of shades and I have found this one to last quite a while before refreshing. Too bad Amazon&#x27;s yo-yo pricing keeps me waiting until the price is low enough to get some more colors. I have 4 and want more!</li>
    <li> I saw Revlon Colorstay Ultimate Suede Longwear Lipstick in Backstage in a magazine and knew I had to have it!  The color is beautiful and it stays on for a long time.  I didn&#x27;t count the actual hours, but it does last.  The only cons are it is a little drying and every once in awhile it seems to disappear.  I think it has to do with my lip condition.  I recommend using a lot of lip balm before use.</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews and I thought I would buy this and now I&#x27;m wondering who&#x27;s writing these reviews, seriously? I heard it stays on, NO it doesn&#x27;t. I applied this lipstick and I waited a while like I usually do with other brands and it never set. Immediately after I touched it it smeared. Anything that touched my mouth - fork, cups, or my hand the lipstick was all over it! This is not a colorstay lipstick at all. Second, the color in the picture shows a purple looking lipstick, but the reviews said it was a great looking wine color and that&#x27;s my favorite color lipstick so I bought it. The reviews were correct it arrived in a box and as soon as I opened it I saw a wine colored lipstick that looked amazing! The only problem was when I applied it the color doesn&#x27;t go on your lips very dark. It was almost like I was wearing a gloss or something. Third, &amp;#34;ultimate suede colorstay&amp;#34; you&#x27;d think was a matte, but this thin shiny lipstick goes on like a cheap gloss for something you&#x27;d give a girl learning to wear lipstick for the first time. This lipstick is a waste!</li>
    <li> This lipstick performs as advertised, not drying has staying power and this color is very flattering (for me). Glad I ordered more than one since I like it so well. Will be ordering more and I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lipstick. I have it in several colors and it lasts all day (even after eating and drinking)! After a while it stops being very moisturizing but be careful, if you put chapstick on over it, the color comes right off. As long as you use only the lipstick, it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I thought the color was a little lighter. But I love Revlon products! If you apply once, it last forever!</li>
    <li> This is the most horrible lipstick I have ever used. I thought it was a great idea having it stay on for several hours. What I did not know is it dries like paint and dries up your lips so they look like prunes. Really awful and embarrassing when you look in the mirror and  are shocked to see your lips all shriveled up. Besides I just found out Revlon has moved their plant to China where it is mandatory that make up is tested on animals .  Torturing and killing them to see how much is toxic to the user.  Absolutely disgusting and unnecessary in this day and age .  I will never by Revlon again I don&#x27;t care how pretty they make it look.  God did not put these beautiful little animals here so that greedy  people could torture them and kill them to produce their makup at a cheaper price in another country. No more Revlon for me.</li>
    <li> This lipstick does stay for several hours on the lips if you don&#x27;t drink anything! It does feel slightly dry on the lips though- not enough to stop me wearing it though.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like advertised</li>
</ol>
