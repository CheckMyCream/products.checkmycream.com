<li> so it goes a long way.  </li>
<li> This is the only cream that smooths my heels when they get rough.</li>
<li> Goodbye dry feet.</li>
<li> It helps me go through dry winters without suffering from cracked fingers and dry feet.</li>
<li> And calluses are less hard, grow less quickly...</li>
<li> I exercise a lot and my feet get very dry.  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin and even use it on my face.  </li>
<li> This cream effectively alleviated the painful cracks on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This helps the rough and calloused areas of my feet and also seems to help my finger cuticles.</li>
<li> It helped make my rough feet softer.  </li>
<li> Dry cracked heels gone!!</li>
<li> cleared up my rough skin in 2 weeks!</li>
<li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that has problems with feet due to diabetes.</li>

<li> It is hard for me to walk without this cream.  </li>
<li> The drug was extremely hard I.</li>
<li> I finally went to a foot dr because the cracks in my feet were so painful.</li>
<li> Works wonders on thick crack skin on your heels!</li>
<li> and you&#x27;ll have residues all over the skin, which could be unpleasant, giving the impression that dead skin is peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
<li> On the face, it looks expensive.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to find urea in this strength.  </li>
<li> I have suffered for years with horribly calloused, ugly and dry heels.</li>
<li> When my feet get really bad, I still need to soak them in a salt bath, and use a pumice stone in addition to putting on this cream at night.</li>
<li> My feet often crack to the point of bleeding and being painful to walk.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing will cure the callouses but this makes them something I can deal with.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this. It has softened my heels so well.</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever had for my dry, dry heals.  Pricey, but it works.</li>
    <li> I Would definitely recommend this product to get rid of cracked heels and flakey skin on feet.  My dermatologist recommended a product with Urea Cream.  Couldn&#x27;t find one in stores but found this on line at amazon.com.  Received it quickly</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. My Dr recommended it and it really works. Goodbye dry feet. I would highly recommend this cream</li>
    <li> This helps the rough and calloused areas of my feet and also seems to help my finger cuticles.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended Urea to me to help me to deal with the cracked skin on my feet, and a tendency to get calluses.  This stuff really works, really helps. If I use it daily, cracking and flaking don&#x27;t happen any more. And calluses are less hard, grow less quickly... I&#x27;m very happy with it, have tried lots of different foot creams, many good ones, but nothing as good as this.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that smooths my heels when they get rough. I&#x27;ve tried many creams and lotions but none quite works as well. I put it on and then wears socks while it absorbs. I&#x27;m not sure it would be as great if you put sandals on afterwards.</li>
    <li> cleared up my rough skin in 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> It is medicine for my feet.  It has proven to be very good and the feet are improving.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that has problems with feet due to diabetes.</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever used.  Works exactly as said.  Will recommend to others.  Order was shipped fast and delivered as said.</li>
    <li> Good product for skin irritations and cracked heels!</li>
    <li> I have used other Urea products for my feet. This is better than low percentage products and better priced.</li>
    <li> Outstanding topical cream. My wife&#x27;s feet are now as smooth as a baby. Highly recommended. Apply this either in AM or at bedtime and wear socks so product stays in contact with skin .</li>
    <li> Excellent cream which helps me a lot restoring smooth skin on my hands and feet. I don&#x27;t find any use for the pumice stone that comes with it though...&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it to minimize eczema flares and this product does a great job. It doesn&#x27;t cure it, but it makes it easier to deal with. When used in combination with Aloe gel, I found it very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to a couple of friends whom are exposed to harsh chemicals and aggressive solvents and they both love it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is on the neutral side, slightly &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; and definitely not overwhelming.

Too much of it and you&#x27;ll have residues all over the skin, which could be unpleasant, giving the impression that dead skin is peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;What I found very effective is to add one or two drops of water (or Aloe gel) right after applying the cream and rub it in for a few seconds. Works awesome this way!&lt;br /&gt;I give this product two thumbs up without a doubt. It helps me go through dry winters without suffering from cracked fingers and dry feet. I really love it.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best foot cream I have ever used and I have tried many. Rich, creamy, softens your feet on the first use.</li>
    <li> I suffered many years from the hard skin on my foot. This cream effectively alleviated the painful cracks on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>

In reality the product is cheap!</li>
    <li> This is the best foot cream out there. I tried everything before this stuff and nothing worked. I finally went to a foot dr because the cracks in my feet were so painful. He gave me this stuff to try, and now my feet are so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s like a miracle. You do need to exfoliate your feet every so often as well to keep them smooth.</li>
    <li> A sure fire way to combat toenail fungus. I applied this product daily to my infected nail(s); covered them with a band aid and over time, was able to remove the nail, which allowed antiseptic to be successfully applied to the fungus beneath. RevitaDERM contains 40% urea, which formerly was available only by prescription. The key here to treating toenail fungus without taking oral medication (and the potential stress on one&#x27;s liver) is removing the nail; this stuff does the trick painlessly and in a relatively short time. Works.</li>
    <li> Excellent products and very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on thick crack skin on your heels! Best price too!</li>
    <li> I exercise a lot and my feet get very dry.  I have tried every moisturizing cream out there, but they don&#x27;t really work.  This cream works very well.  It&#x27;s helped with the dryness and the cracking.  I would buy it again, even if it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Dry cracked heels gone!!</li>
    <li> I love that this cream.  It isn&#x27;t greasy.  You don&#x27;t need a lot.  It helped make my rough feet softer.  It&#x27;s difficult to find urea in this strength.  It&#x27;s going to last me awhile but I will reorder when I need another.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream twice a day as instructed and find it works better than anything else I have tried.  Will continue to use and&lt;br /&gt;recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T SEE ANY CHANGE.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase urea 40 when it was Carmol 40 (prior to becoming generic, but still requiring a prescription).  Since this time and no longer requiring a prescription, I do not believe this product to have the same quality/percentage of urea as when I purchased with Rx at a pharmacy.  I&#x27;d like to say it works as well, but this &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; fell short.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this while on chemo for cancer. The drug was extremely hard I. His feet and hands. This is the best thing we have found for keeping his skin healthy.</li>
    <li> The CVS and other pharmacies in my area no longer carry Urea Cream 40, I was at my wits end and was happy to find it at Amazon.  It is hard for me to walk without this cream.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It will leave your feet feeling baby smooth all the time. Trust me, it really works. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best ever, very thick but goes on smoothly. I use it on my legs after my shower and it works great.  I have very dry skin and even use it on my face.  It is a large bottle so it goes a long way.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have suffered for years with horribly calloused, ugly and dry heels. My feet often crack to the point of bleeding and being painful to walk. This cream was recommended to me by someone going through chemo. It is the best cream I&#x27;ve used, and I have tried a lot. When my feet get really bad, I still need to soak them in a salt bath, and use a pumice stone in addition to putting on this cream at night. You don&#x27;t need much for it to work, either.</li>
