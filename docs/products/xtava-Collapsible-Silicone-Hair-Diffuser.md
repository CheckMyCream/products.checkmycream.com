<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok people with curly hair know a diffuser is a must have. We also know that they are big and bulky to take around with you. This is an amazing idea for travelling because most hotels come with hair dryers but not many have diffusers. I love it for taking in my travel bags and it works great!</li>
    <li> This works great. Fits nicely on my hair dryer and stores easily.</li>
    <li> The diffuser I was sent has a 3 inch opening (the one advertised is 2.5inch) so my 6.5 inch barrel dryer doesn&#x27;t fit at all (it would fit a 9-10 inch barrel).  I imagine I could go through the hassle of returning it, but since I want this for traveling and you never know what dryer you&#x27;re going to get, I decided to just keep it and bring a clip to tighten it.&lt;br /&gt;And how hard can it be to make a diffuser that truly fits ANY hair dryer so it would be useful when you&#x27;re traveling and don&#x27;t know what type of dryer you&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of which size they send you, it&#x27;s very limited on what size dryer it will fit.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just start with:  it&#x27;s made of silicone.&lt;br /&gt;Do you know what happens to silicone when it gets hot?  It bends, collapses, gets really soft.  So, a silicone diffuser for a hair dryer wasn&#x27;t the brightest engineering idea.  It does the job of diffusing well, however, as it gets hot, it easily comes off if bumped and tends to begin collapsing as well.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel for my curly hair.  I was searching for a travel diffuser that would work on any/most hotel/motel hair dryers and this diffuser is just the ticket.  Having it collapse makes it perfect for carry-on travel.  Tested this at home and it really worked quite well on my curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is exactly what I wanted.  It fits on my dryer.  More importantly, it saves room in my gym bag vs the big plastic diffuser I have been using.  I have very curly hair &amp; the product performs as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy that I made this purchase &amp; would recommend it .</li>
    <li> *** updated my review from 4 to 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;It snuggly fits around my hair dryer. The rubbery material handles the heat very well. My hair dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough power for the large size of the diffuser, so I have to hold it very close to my head. It&#x27;s not a perfect product, but it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** update *** I updated my review from 4 stars to 5. I realized I didn&#x27;t put the diffuser on correctly. Push it back further on the barrel of the dryer- and the heat travels better. ***</li>
    <li> So I received this today and I tried it ou it fit my hair dryer it silicone so it will probably fit most hair dryers,  its easy to use you just pull it out to open and push it back in to store it. It worked great on my hair my hair is naturally really wavy/curly it didnt make my hair frizzy and it made my curls look better Its a great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this hoping it would fit the Babybliss pro TT tourmaline titanium travel dryer but it is too large and does not even remotely fit the nozzle of the dryer. I am keeping it all the same because it does fit my regular size Babyliss dryer and collapses very neatly which is useful</li>
    <li> great product, can&#x27;t wait to use it while traveling</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. The universal size was hard to get on my blowdryer, but that&#x27;s probably the reason why ot doesn&#x27;t come off when I am using it.</li>
    <li> this is a great perfect product!! it actually works no fizz nothing love it ! better then professional that cost over 100 dollars</li>
    <li> I have used a hard plastic diffuser in the past. I really love that this diffuser collapses and can be easily packed. Although at times, it does collapse slightly while I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s not really a problem. I have also noticed that my hair seems even curlier than usual after using this diffuser compared to my old diffuser that I used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but it doesn&#x27;t fit my Hot Tools hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love the Xtava Collapsible Diffuser. It fits my hair dryer very well. I also tested it on my friends hair dryer to see if it would fit her Paul Mitchell hairy dryer and it does. I love this product. I really want it in hot pink but I only got the black diffuser. I am still happy with the product. I am just going to have to order the hot pink one ASAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how it can go in and out which also means collapse so I can travel with it. I am able to fit it in my suitcase without having to struggle to fit a huge diffuser in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy this diffuser online for 12.00 which is actually cheaper then most of them out there. This one is the best I have used, so definitely buy it. It is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this for free and I did test this product. These are my words! 100 %</li>
    <li> I have really thick curly hair and I have NEVER been able to wear my natural texture with defines curls. It always becomes a thick frizzy Afro instead of defined curls. Well my xtava diffuser (with the right leave in and styling gel) has changed all that. It was easy to put onto the dryer I already own. From there I was able to gently dry my thick coils perfectly. Very happy to support this product and this small business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included a picture of my thick hair so people can see exactly what my diffuser helped to tame :-)</li>
    <li> This collapsible diffuser is great for slipping in your suitcase for traveling.  It even fits over my small travel hair dryer and stays on!  Much better than a full size diffuser that takes up much needed space when traveling.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this, thinking it would be a great replacement for bring my hair dryer with attachable diffuser with me when I traveled.  Well I was very disappointed. I have a standard hair dryer with a 2 1/4 diameter end and I couldn&#x27;t even get this diffuser to fit.  I&#x27;m going to return it and just get a travel blow dryer that comes with a diffuser.  I&#x27;m sure it works great....if you can get it on.</li>
    <li> This serves well as a travel diffuser. That said, if your styling process requires you to apply pressure on the diffuser - like if you plop-dry your curls - then you might want a different diffuser. I can apply light pressure, but too much and the diffuser collapses a bit.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken hence I cannot properly rate it since I was no able to use it.  I feel it is cheaply made &amp; a bit pricey!  The return process was simple &amp; credit issued to my account promptly</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! ALSO GOT ONE FOR MY SISTER, the volume and the curls were amazing!&lt;br /&gt;A MUSt HAVE!  Fits any blower</li>
    <li> I like it but it does collapse very easily.</li>
    <li> I do like that it is compact and packs well for travel. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it melting my dryer like other reviews. It does get hot if you use it long enough. It does collapse easily while using it if you aren&#x27;t careful. It doesn&#x27;t harm anything just kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> Okay i was so scared to purchase this but cause  it was cheap and you know silicone made me not feel too bad if it didnt fit my dryer. Plus it fits hotel ones as stated by others and is very portable. Before i purchased i looked at reviews of it, pics of it, heard what dryers it fit and googled them and compared them to mine (didnt have mine with me or the box it came in and theres no barrel size on any of the websites) via images. I weighed all the pros and cons and did like finger measurements with google images when comparing my blow dryer to the others. Theres this specific one where someone had a very long blow dryer that starts of slender then started getting fat so that helped me a lot in seeing if it would fit. So you can try this method if youre desperate like me where you couldnt buy another diffuser or didn&#x27;t wanna purchase a new blow dryer set.    So now.... its very easy to put on for me, didnt slide on though. Its also bigger than i thought!!! This is so good so it can hold a lot of hair in it.  The reason for 4 stars is i havent used it yet but i have pressed my hand on it to test its strength and it collapses easily so thats a downside for the technique i would be using. Otherwise from that its very cute and i got the black to match my dryer.    Excuse the bad English. I was typing fast from my phone immediately when I got it.   https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YYm28hP0L._SL256_.jpg</li>
    <li> Love this product. Has made traveling so much easier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s frustrating.  I have two blow dryers at home.  They both are too large for these small mounts.  Mine are the regular size girls buy for home.  yours work well in the beauty salon huge sized blow dryers.  I had homes.  Now I give up.</li>
    <li> This is the first diffuser I ever got so I wasn’t sure what to expect. It’s made out of very soft silicone and it collapses very easily. I wish there was a way to lock it into a fully expanded position as it makes using it somewhat tricky. Since the silicone is so soft, it keeps on wanting to collapse back. However, you it can still be used. It did fit on my hair dryer and it liked the results. I will keep on using it and I think it should help prevent my hair from getting frizzy and damaged by the hot heat of the dryer. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I think it’s a perfect diffuser for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is made of silicon so it can stretch a reasonable amount to fit blow dryers. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is perfect for curly hair! I&#x27;ve never used one before but it works phenomenally. The only issue is that it take a lot of effort to get it on a blow drier, and of course it collapses when you use it. But worth the money, great for travel.</li>
    <li> I left my hair dryer at home when visiting family over the holidays and I brought my travel dryer instead so I could save space in my carry on. Desperate for a diffuser for my curly hair, I searched on Amazon and found this one. It fits over my revlon travel dryer but my only complaint is that it does collapse on itself when trying to use. In a pinch it works and makes my hair look great. For $12 it does the job.</li>
    <li> best diffuser I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> it was okay but not worth the money</li>
    <li> Wow! I am actually Loving this Diffuser! I, for the past 20 years have worn a ponytail, and I have gotten a few Xtava Products and a hair dryer was one of them and it comes with an attachment, that did not work in my hair, because I have very frizzy, long, very long, to my butt long hair and I was told I need a diffuser. So when I was given the chance to try, test and review this diffuser, because it made my hair a lot tamer then normal which made my Straightener not have to work as hard! I am happy about that! I highly recommend this Xtava Diffuser if your hair is on the frizzy side!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Securely stays on my dryer.  The other plastic one keeps falling off.</li>
    <li> The Xtava collapsible diffuser is thePERFECT diffuser.  It not only fits a wide variety of hair dryer nozzles and it&#x27;s collapsible feature makes it ideal for storage and travel but it also dries my hair without blowing it all around.  The wide &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; of the diffuser allows me to place my curls in there which gives me  added &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve only had my diffuser for a week so I&#x27;m hoping that it is as durable as it is conveninet.</li>
    <li> Only because it did not fit my blow dryer. I loved the construction and the idea behind the product. If I didn&#x27;t really like my blow dryer I would have kept it.</li>
    <li> Clear knobs loosened and fell off after 2nd use.</li>
    <li> Sometimes while diffusing my hair it closes and I have to open it again. not completely but it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this item was very difficult to put on both of my hairdryers, and refused to stay on once it was finally in place. Additionally (as a few other people have noted) the diffuser collapsed as soon as any pressure was applied.</li>
    <li> Collapsible Diffuser for hair dryer, fit one of my two hair dryers, it works well and since it folds flat, it takes up much less space than my old diffuser, age unknown (forgot how many years ago it was purchased.  Hope this one lasts as long.  Recommend it to anyone looking for a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Much smaller nozzle than I imagined. Wont be able to use on either on the blow dryers I have.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and have wavy hair that does not like to be blown dry without a diffuser. I have a travel dryer with a diffuser, but it is bulky and is starting to break from repeated squashings in my suitcase. This collapsible diffuser is great. So far no problems with is staying on the dryer, and it goes much flatter than my previous diffuser. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after I was reading how great it is to have a diffuser for naturally curly/wavy hair. However, I did not like it at all. One problem may be that my hair is at my shoulders, which makes my curls look wonky after diffusing. The biggest issue that I very much disliked was that the diffuser would collapse too easily during use, which was a pain. I kept having to open it back up while I was trying to dry my hair.  I would not purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Great concept, but not quite the best implementation of the idea. It is wonderful to have a travel diffuser for all those curly-haired girls, but it collapses a couple times while I&#x27;m using it. Also, the metal prong disc came apart from the collapsible cone... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to stay glued together, but mine definitely did not stay in one piece.</li>
    <li> Outstanding concept. Took it on three vacations this summer and fit all hair dryers the hotels and resorts had.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser. I Bought it for travel but it&#x27;ll get used for daily blow dry now that I&#x27;m home.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser! A couple things I like about this Collapsable Diffuser by xtava is that it is collapsible which is nice for storage or travel and I use it for my daughters naturally curly hair and it makes her curls more defined, less frizzy and adds overall body to her hair. A couple of cons about this diffuser is that it was difficult to get it to fit on my blow dryer, just make sure that your blow dryer has a more narrow opening and although I like the silicone look of the diffuser, it attracts everything and mine was immediately covered in cat hair. Other than the couple of cons I feel that this diffuser does everything that it claims to do and I would recommend it to my friends for sure. I received this diffuser complimentary and am sharing my honest and unbiased opinion about the product here with you.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product for travel purposes, hoping it&#x27;ll fit most of the various hair dryers at hotels - and it does! So glad I don&#x27;t have to take my own hair dryer with me any more - especially overseas.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> It is just OK. I had a problem with it collapsing while using - as did another reviewer. However, it wasn&#x27;t terrible. I am keeping it just for the ease of packing.</li>
    <li> Really heavy falls off at times</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for review and testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This Diffuser is huge! I connected it to the Xtava allure hairdryer and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was suppose to slide it all the way down but I guess the placement didn&#x27;t matter. I towel dried my hair and put the dryer on the first heat setting and took parts of my hair and placed it in the diffuser. I turned my head upside down and put my whole hair in as well. It took a while to dry but it did a great job at volumizing and catching my natural wave. The next time I use it I will put mouse or gel so the wave can hold better. I also like that the diffuser comes in assorted colors and that it collapses for easy storage. I keep my hairdryer in the box it came with and now the collapsible diffuser as well. Here is a collage of the Xtava diffuser and my results!</li>
    <li> Where has this diffuser been all my life? I&#x27;ve been missing out just using a regular hair dryer on my hair! This diffuser has made a huge difference in my hair! Whenever I use this product, I always get tons of compliments! People are always asking me what products I use! The only difference in my routine is that I used this amazing collapsible diffuser for my Xtava hair dryer! It gives my hair so much more volume and body. My hair looks like I just went to the salon! I love that I can use this on my hair whenever it&#x27;s either straight or curly. Either way, it makes my hair look amazing. I like to put my hair dryer on cool whenever I have my hair curly, and then just push it from the ends toward my scalp. You won&#x27;t believe how much more volume it gives my curls! I am so impressed with this awesome product and am so happy to own it! I did order this item during a promotion for observation purposes. After close and careful examination, I have come to the conclusion that this is amazing and worthy of a 5 star review! Ladies, you won&#x27;t believe how much using a diffuser like this one will change the overall look of your hair! It would make a great gift to buy the hair dryer and this diffuser and the incredible set to someone special !!</li>
    <li> I was born with naturally curly hair. Unfortunately with natural curls comes frizz. Not long after my Collapsible Smart Diffuser by Xtara arrived, I just had to put it to the test. I can&#x27;t believe how light weight it is. Most diffusers are heavy and just make having to hold a hair dryer pretty uncomfortable. This one was just quite the opposite. I also was very impressed with the easy collapsible folding design. You either press it down or pull the top up to extend or compact the diffuser. I also love that it has four different levels that you can test out to see which one is best for your hair. I know all hair types are different. That really impressed me because its more suitable for more hair types. I also love that its a great size for travel or on the go, but also perfect to store at home.&lt;br /&gt;After my first use, I have to say that I just love this little diffuser. Not only does it pretty much eliminate frizziness, it also makes my hair just shine. With this awesome little diffuser, I get to control and reduce the unwanted effects of blow drying my hair everyday. I honestly have to say that after many years of using many different types of diffusers, this most definitley has to be the favorite of them all. I have gotten quite a few compliments on my hair since I have started using this diffuser. Overall it just does a really great job. I definitely recommend this Collapsiblle Diffuser for any lady that is like me trying to eliminate the frizz. Its is just a great diffuser for the great low price. I received this diffuser free during a promotional period in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Only problem is that if falls off the hairdryer if point down.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer. There were several reviews stating that problem. I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I workout a lot and needed a space-saving device like this one for my gym locker. My gym provides hair dyers, so all I need was a collapsable attachment like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair so drying with a diffuser makes things so much easier, especially now that it&#x27;s so cold out and I need to wash my hair after every workout (sometimes 2x/day). One thing that I really like is that I can easily store it in my gym locker. I have no problem attaching it to any of the hair dryers in the gym lockers.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly because I have an Xtava blow dryer which I really like.  I also liked that it was collapsible which makes it great for travel.  But after using it for a week I&#x27;ve concluded it will become my &amp;#34;travel diffuser&amp;#34; and not the one I use everyday.  It is not very sturdy and collapses easily when it&#x27;s in use.  I prefer to get into my roots with it for extra lift but this closes right up once it hits my hair.  The main reason I give it 3 stars and not 5, it&#x27;s difficult to put on the end of my Xtava blow dryer!  I have to use tweezers help it along.  The opening doesn&#x27;t have much stretch so it&#x27;s a bit of a project to get it in place.  I don&#x27;t always diffuse my hair otherwise I&#x27;d just leave it on to avoid this.  So I will be purchasing an alternate diffuser for regular use and pack this away for trips.</li>
    <li> I love this collapsible diffuser. It met all expectations and is great for travel!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this diffuser.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a diffuser I could travel with for awhile, and thought this would be great.  The rubber accordion shape makes it operate awkwardly.  I think the most annoying thing about it is that it has these little plastic pieces that stand in for the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; in a regular diffuser are for some reason detachable?  I can&#x27;t for the life of me see any benefit to this.  You would never really have any reason to take them off.  However, after only using it three times, I have lost three of the little plastic pieces.  Fantastic.  I don&#x27;t know.  This product is very slightly better than the sock diffuser I was traveling with, but not much.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This only fits hairdryers with small nozzles, which is the first thing you should know. With more hotels providing regular sized hairdryers, it doesn&#x27;t always fit. But when it does, it works great. Plus it collapses so makes it easy for travel. You just have to hope the hairdryer fits when you check in to your hotel! haha. So far, it been fine 6 of 8 times I&#x27;ve taken it with me.</li>
    <li> Works for what I need. My hair is short and not too heavy, but even so the diffuser still collapses easily. It doesn&#x27;t entirely affect my ability to use it, so no big, but much be an issue if you have very long,thick hair. Love the portability!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit almost any hairdryers. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair gets frizzy and puffy when I blow dry it often. When I received Xtava&#x27;s Silicone Collapsible Diffuser, I was quite excited to try it but had the problem of using it because it doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer! So, in this post, I&#x27;ll describe the look of the Xtava&#x27;s Collapsible Diffuser. I am planning to change my hair dryer sometime soon so I will update my post on how this diffuser works as soon as I&#x27;ve tried it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of silicone and it&#x27;s quite similar to the collapsible measuring cups I have but just bigger. I love the neon pink color! :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to pop out and once popped out, it stretches up to 5 inches tall. I tried countless times to put it in my hair dryer because I really wanted to try it. My hair dryer by the way is 1875W Ionic Hair Dryer in Pink By Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller hole&#x27;s diameter measures roughly about 2 1/2 inches and the mouth of my hair dryer is bigger than that.&lt;br /&gt;The base or bigger hole&#x27;s diameter where the air should come out measure about 5 1/2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the color of the Collapsible Diffuser for Hair Dryers by Xtava. I love how it collapses to a smaller and flatter look so that I can easily store it and wouldn&#x27;t take up too much space. I can&#x27;t wait to try this once I find a hair dryer which will fit this. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this diffuser to me and it works perfectly!  It keeps my curls in place, as she said it would.  And, I like the fact that it collapses so that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> So every curly girl needs a few hair tools to make her hair look awesomely tamed. A diffuser is one of those needed tools. I, luckly, got the opportunity to test and review this diffuser.This diffuser did a really good job disturbing heat without  disrupting the definition of the curl. There was little to no shrinkage, and my frizzy curls seemed less frizzy.I can definately see why having a diffuser is a must for curly girls everywhere. The down side is that it did not fit my Gold-N-Hot dryer. For some reason the nozzle on my dryer was too big and the nozzle on the diffuser is pliable but it does not stretch unfortunately. I had to borrow a friend&#x27;s dry (I can&#x27;t remember the model), and it fit it just fine. I will look to invest in the xtava dryer in the near future because of how impressive the diffuser attachment is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the diffuser is pretty large, so I appreciate its ability to collapse and take up less room. Thats a pretty awesome feature.</li>
    <li> The last hair dryer I purchased did not come with a diffuser so I was in desperate need of one!  This collapsible diffuser from Xtava is a perfect fit for me.  I love that it can be used on practically any hair dryer you already own and that it&#x27;s collapsible so that you can easily store it.  You can use it for home and for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and wavy hair so a diffuser is a must for me.  It not only decreases the frizz, but it also adds shine and volume to your hair.  It&#x27;s very simple to use.  You simply attach it to your hair dryer (it&#x27;s very elastic and stretchy so that it can fit most dryers) and it&#x27;s ready to work it&#x27;s magic. I suggest you hold the hair dryer with the diffuser close to your head (not touching) while you dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s available in three beautiful colors-black, pink, and blue.  I had no issues with it collapsing by itself while I was using it...that seems to be an issue a few people had mentioned.  Again-you are not supposed to touch your head with the diffuser...it&#x27;s meant to use close to your head but without touching.  You are also supposed to move it around and not keep it in the same place.  It&#x27;s best to turn your head upside down and use it starting at the ends and moving up to your scalp.  The more you touch or mess with your hair the more of a big mess it will be.  These are just some tips that I use for the best use of a diffuser.  If you follow the steps above you will get natural frizz free waves/curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Super handy and space conscious . It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s a soft material &amp; folds down out of the way.</li>
    <li> I like the diffuser for traveling because it flattens out for packing. But if you use the method of bunching your hair up against your head with the diffuser to get more curl, it can be a bit challenging because it wants to collapse. It usually only partially collapses on one side though, so it still works out.</li>
    <li> The best invention ever! I have very coarse- curly hair and this product quickly dries my hair without disturbing my curls.</li>
    <li> Fits my Rx7 Superlite hair dryer perfectly.  As one reviewer noted, due to the collapsible nature the diffuser would sometimes bend in, but it wasn&#x27;t too much of a problem for drying my hair.  My hair curls nicely with no frizz, and I&#x27;ve used the highest heat setting with no damage to the diffuser or my hair dryer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I like that the funnel collapses even while on the dryer. It still does the job of diffusing the air!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit 2 of the 4 hair dryers that I used on my trip to Europe. The opening was too small.</li>
    <li> I am disapointed with the diffuser as it is too small for my best dryer so I used a smaller dryer and it fits but does not stay on during use.  I struggle to use it and am sorry it doesn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
    <li> This diffuser did not fit ANY of the hairdryers I have in my house (I have quite a few). When I bought a new travel hairdryer that it barely fit, after one use, the side of it ripped and it was then useless. The hairdryers I have a standard and probably what most people have. I am not sure what kind of hairdryer the creators intended this thing to fit on. I will not waste my money again.</li>
    <li> It was just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Product overall is a good concept. However, because of the silicone that it is made out of, it kept collapsing on itself as I was trying to use it. The little silver knobs are a type of metal and get very hot when in use. The opening is very small and does not fit on most hairdryer models, as stated. It took a lot of working to get mine on. Then to top it off, it melted the plastic of my hairdryer under the silicone part, making the dryer unusable and I had to buy another. Do yourself a favor, and just buy a dryer that comes with a diffuser specifically for the model. This is definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Convenient and perfect for traveling</li>
    <li> Curly hair in the winter can be difficult to manage when you have to wear a hat or a hood, but using this diffuser before putting on the hat ensured that my curls didn&#x27;t get frizzy. I just ran my fingers threw to replace the volume and no hat had!</li>
    <li> If you need a diffuser this is the one.  It does not slip off while using. It is made with a soft rubber.  I had a hard plastic diffuser come with my Chi dryer but it was useless since it always fell off while using.</li>
    <li> This diffuser for my hairdryer is pretty neat because it is collapsible and and silicone material. It&#x27;s compact so that you can take it with you on vacation. It does fitmost hairdryers I have two hairdryers one it did fit fine the other one it didn&#x27;t fit it was too small to fit over the opening of my dryer. When I did use it on my hair you did a really good job at keeping my hair with some body and texture. I do not have curly hair but I do have wavy hair and it was able to keep the waves in my hair throughout the day.it also gave a lot of lift when I use the diffuser close to my scalp. You should be careful when using a diffuser close to your scalp since the diffuser can start to collapse so don&#x27;t press too hard against your scalp. Overall I did like it it was easyto use and since it&#x27;s silicone it doesn&#x27;t get hot and burn your hand while touching it. I was sent this for review purposes, however it does not affect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product, but I am unable to use it because it does not fit my blow dryer! The diffuser feels like a good quality, though. It is made of silicone and is collapsible for easy storage. It is very wide, which is perfect for long, thick hair like mine! It is supposed to create frizz-free curls and waves. Cannot wait to try it on a smaller blow dryer!</li>
    <li> I bought the diffuser to use with small hotel hairdryers - the kind with almost triangular barrels.  It wasn&#x27;t easy, but I managed to get the diffuser on the hairdryer. Unfortunately, once the dryer barrel heated up the diffuser flew off.  Repeatedly. Also, when I used the diffuser to hold my hair in a scrunched up position the diffuser collapsed. It&#x27;s a well made diffuser. It defuses the air flow effectively. Delivery was prompt and Xtava contacted me to make sure I was happy with my purchase. Too bad I can&#x27;t use it as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> My hair really tends to frizz out when blow-drying my hair, especially in the winter months.  Also, as I get older and frequently get highlights, my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be as shiny as it used to be.  Leave-in conditioners and other products leave my hair flat and greasy-looking.  So, I thought I&#x27;d give a diffuser a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair dryer didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser (I didn&#x27;t seem to need one when I purchased it), I had to start looking.  I was really excited to find one that collapses and is made of silicone.  And because the Xtava diffuser fits most hair dryers, I can actually just take this with me when we travel and use it with the hair dryer in the hotel or condo and not take mine with me.  Trust me, with two kids space is at a premium when we travel!  When I&#x27;m at home, I just collapse it down and throw it in a drawer.  I wish my hair dryer did this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part--my hair has volume without the frizz and my natural shine is back!  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> this works wonderful for me.  I recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fit any of my dryers :( I returned it without a problem.</li>
    <li> My husband hates when I lug my blow dryer and diffuser on trips and bought me this right before our last vacation.  I was skeptical but it was a winner.  Great end result and fit on many different hotel blow dryer models!</li>
    <li> Can I first say the colors are so cool! I love having brightly colored products to keep in my bathroom and this is one of them. The downfall is that my hair dryer is one that it unfortunately doesn&#x27;t fit. So I ended up giving it to someone else who fit their blow dryer and they were so impressed with it. It works perfectly without any glitches and dries her hair perfectly. I highly recommend this but do make sure that you have the correct dimensions for your hair dryer before you purchase. It would make a great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my trip to Cali to visit my Auntie. I wanted something that would take up less room in my suitcase to allow more room for goodies to bring home.  It was the perfect thing. It broke down to a round disk shape and fit snug in my carry-on side pocket.  Not only did it take up less space but it worked better than the other one I had at home that I bought in a store. I found that after using it there was less frizz to my hair, and gave it more body and natural shine.  The cost was appropriate. One of the biggest pros to this product is that it will fit most any hair dryer, and since I left mine at the house back in Washington I was able to use my auntie&#x27;s with no issues.  I bring it on every trip now and have since bought one for my sister, and mother. Two thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have been partially reimbursed for the cost of this product</li>
    <li> Great for storage as folds into self. More space for curly hair products.</li>
    <li> This diffuser works really well on my Babyliss Pro BABNT5548 hair dryer. The air is sufficiently diffused and helps me style my wavy hair the way I want to. I also really like how the diffuser collapses down for easy packing while traveling, but that feature does come with a con. At least once every time I use the diffuser, at least one of the sides/layers collapses and I have to pop it back out. It doesn&#x27;t take away from the overall functionality, but it does make this product less than perfect. I just wish it were a little studier.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product an try it. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to attach to any of the blow dryers I have in my house. So if anyone knows what dryers it does attach to let me know. So I can give this product a better review.</li>
    <li> I lost the diffuser that came with my hair drier.  The price was right buying this vs a new blow drier. It was a bit stiff the first time I used it but I would rather a snug fit instead of it being to big. Overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I received this free in return for honest opinion. All opinions or staments are from my own use. First I like how easy it is to store this in my vanity with my dryer without having any issues with space or closing the drawer! Second I like how easy it is to attach to my hair dryer and use to dry my hair and how it helps keep my hair from getting frizzy from the blow dryer! So easy to use and I would recommend this for anyone looking to add a diffuser to their hair dryer t a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is genius! Works well and takes up very little storage or suitcase space. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Its compact and easy to attach to your blow dryer.  The only negative is that I&#x27;ve lost almost all the grey pieces. so I would say the quality isn&#x27;t the best but it is still working.</li>
    <li> well made and it fit my standard size hair dryer i had at home.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this diffuser for a free or a discounted price and I have to say that I am very pleased it.  For one it is compact for easy storage so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.  I experimented with the different sizes to get a sense of what this diffuser can do. I have thick wavy hair and it goes down to the middle of my back.  You will not be disappointed, It is very easy to use by simply pulling up or down to your desire outcome.</li>
    <li> Works really well for what it&#x27;s intended for ... but does tend to collapse easily.</li>
    <li> I loved the concept of this diffuser if it had fit my hair dryer I would have loved to use it, I do love that it is portable and able to bring with you.</li>
    <li> This thing is huge! Yes, It does collapse and it&#x27;s easy to store. Great bee hive design. Dried my hair perfectly and held my curls! My first diffuser and I think it&#x27;s pretty great and worth the purchase. *sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected for my long hair.  Hope the other diffuser is more helpful</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the description, &amp;#34;FITS MOST HAIRDRYERS - With its elastic silicone texture the diffuser can easily adapt to a large variety of hair dryers (6&#x27;&#x27; to 7&#x27;&#x27; Inch barrel...&amp;#34;. Sadly it did not fit mine. So now I will keep searching and will be a little more cautious. The product itself is very nice and the collapsible feature is great. Really wish it had fit!</li>
    <li> Fits on the blow dryer but not very snug.  It collapses too easily at the slightest touch.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It is compact and can be stored easily, fits perfectly on both hair dryers and it gives my hair the volume ir needed.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> This diffuser is a great addition to any hair dryer. Before this one, I had one that would fly off the hair dryer when it was put on the &#x27;high&#x27; setting. But this one stays on, is super flexible, and does not get burning hot. We have an upcoming trip planned, and I can&#x27;t wait to travel with this collapsable diffuser!</li>
    <li> Great product. Awesome for traveling.</li>
    <li> As far as fitting onto the hair dryer goes it works fine. However, the problem with this diffuser is that the moment you touch it to your hair it just collapses and becomes unusable. I had to do a weird two handed drying where one hand held the diffuser extended and the other hand held the dryer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love it for my curls.  No other diffuser worked this well for me!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, but sometimes falls off my blow dryer. I like that it&#x27;s collapsible, so it takes up less space and is easy to pack.</li>
    <li> Works for a short blow dry, but if your hair is slow to dry please note that the material expands and the diffuser can come off the end of the dryer.  Nice to have for travel.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using a diffuser.  The only time I have had my hair dried with one was at the hair dresser and it always looked so good.  I got the black one.  It&#x27;s gonna be perfect when I travel.  I have two Xtava hair dryers and it fits right on them.  It also fits most other hair dryers too.  I have to admit I usually wear my hair in a pony tail but sometimes I like to do my hair.  I tried this diffuser.  It was easy to use and dries my hair fast.  It gives my hair lots of volume and shine.  I like that it really helps control the frizz too.  I would recommend.  I did receive this product free to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love love love my new diffuser attachment. Works perfectly with my dryer and i am excited to take it traveling with me because it collapses down.  Great product</li>
    <li> They claim it fits most hair dryers, but I have now tried to use it with 3 different dryers and it does not fit any of them.  In fact, XTAVA does not even sell a dryer that fits this diffuser.</li>
    <li> My husband and I travel often, whether its a nice family vacation or a weekend road trip.  I am always on the lookout for great haircare products, which are easy to take along.  As someone with long wavy hair, I can style my hair pretty easily to do a curly or straight hair style without much effort, with the right tools of course.  I received this silicone collapsible diffuser in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I immediately wanted to test it out since we have an upcoming trip and needed to save room in our luggage.  I curled my hair and came to diffuse it and dry the curling mouse product onto my hair without getting frizz.  I used it on my blow dryer and it didn&#x27;t fit perfectly but it did stay on.  I was able to dry my curls and also minimize frizz.  One downfall to the product is that since it&#x27;s collapsible, if pressed against it, it tries to collapse back down.  I just made sure to hold it close but not against my head so it stays open.  For the convenience of traveling this diffuser is amazing. You can get the same results you would at home but on vacation.  I always struggle with having nice hair on vacation since hotel blow driers aren&#x27;t the best and I never have room to bring my own.  This is my second product from Xtava and both of their products have been travel friendly and great on travel as well as for everyday use. I will definitely be keeping their products at the top of my list for hair styling products.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received the opportunity to try out the Black Collapsible Hair Dryer Diffuser. However now that I own the black one, the hot pink collapsible hair dryer diffuser is now on my wish list too! It is supper easy to use &amp; I love the elastic silicone material. It makes it very easy to use &amp; collapse for easy storage until your next use. Plus it amazingly helps eliminates my unwanted frizz &amp; gives some life to my thin straight hair!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a diffuser to that would be able to be stored easily and was so excited to be able to test this one out for review. Just as the description states my hair felt less frizzy and definitely was more shiny than using my blow drier and then a curling product. I also have two different blow dryers that I have collected along the way and I wanted to test to see if it really fit on both different shapes, and it does! Amazingly versatile product that lives up to its claims. I will be recommending this diffuser to anyone and everyone that I know that uses one.</li>
    <li> XTAVA collapsible diffuser is exactly as expected!</li>
