      <li>Refreshing scent as always.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll return to T.J. Maxx to troll for more, but I&#x27;ll have to get it from Amazon if I can&#x27;t find it there because I know</li>
      <li>and I wish I could find more.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and the powder is smooth and nice.  </li>
      <li>Delightful, light, barely there perfumed Talc.  </li>
      <li>The most widely available is Johnson and Johnson baby pwd.</li>
      <li>a nice fresh smelling talc</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s pricier than baby powder, it is a very good buy for top grade body powder, and leaves your skin satiny, and you feel happy in your cool dry and soft scented skin.</li>
      <li>finely milled &amp; not too overpowering with the scent-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for those days when you don&#x27;t want a heavy perfume or are visiting places where they are discouraged.</li>
      <li>ALSO THE COMFORTABLE FEELING AFTER USING IT.</li>
      <li>It is so silky when applied to your skin with a calming light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Maybe a perfect blend of citrus and green tones.  </li>
      <li>I use it after a shower and it makes my skin feel soft and smelling soooooo good.  </li>
      <li>A very fresh smell will order again soon</li>
      <li>The fragrance is not overpowering but floral and clean.  </li>
      <li>NOT ONLY THE PLEASANT FRAGRANT BUT</li>
      <li>smells nice feels soft to the skin</li>
      <li>Gentle and lovely scent.</li>
      <li>I do like it very much!</li>
      <li>This container is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>The powder feels super smooth and very luxe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not over powering but has a really pretty and clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I rarely find any product of this type for which I&#x27;d leave five stars.</li>
      <li>Did not care for the Lemon Blossom &amp; White Rose scent.</li>
      <li>I went back and got the Rose Honeysuckle one</li>
      <li>Large tin, too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s enough of it to apply generously.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to pay more than that if possible</li>
      <li>The fragrance of this talcum powder is delicate, great for daytime.</li>
      <li>Its hard to find a non-floral bath powder, so I love it and will be buying more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find nice lightly scented talc/powder.</li>
      <li>It is a rather large container (which also looks pretty)</li>
      <li>A bit of this lovely powder during the relentless summer heat goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I love the real baylis and harding powder but what I received off the Amazon website was foul smelling and arrived in a yellowed tin when the real baylis and harding powder is in a snowy white tin.</li>
      <li>The scent is really strong for the first several minutes and then become much lighter.</li>
      <li>I tried the matching lotion, but didn&#x27;t like that as much.</li>
      <li>You must use very sparingly.</li>
      <li>Everyone always wants to know what I am wearing.</li>
      <li>This is a more traditionally masculine scent than I had expected.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>For some reason it is hard to find nice body powder.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be a fresh, clean scent, maybe even a little citrusy, but instead it smells masculine to me like shaving cream or after shave.</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin so soft!</li>
      <li>The scent is so subtle, fresh and light that you don&#x27;t smell like a baby, and to be honest, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with baby powder, but, this high quality talc is the difference between champagne and a wine cooler.  </li>
      <li>Going to try to find someone to give it to that doesn&#x27;t think it stinks :P</li>
      <li>Overly sweet, heavy scent to my thinking.  </li>
      <li>I live in a hot climate and use it everyday.  </li>
      <li>OK not a great powder.</li>

    <li> Gentle and lovely scent.</li>
    <li> I found this talc at TJ Maxx for $5.99 and I wish I could find more. It is so silky when applied to your skin with a calming light fragrance. I don&#x27;t want to pay more than that if possible so, I am going to continue searching at TJ Maxx. I would give this as a gift, that is if I could part with it.</li>
    <li> a nice fresh smelling talc</li>
    <li> finely milled &amp; not too overpowering with the scent- I will buy more!</li>
    <li> I found this talcum powder at T.J. Maxx for only $4.99!!!  I LOVE the smell.  I use it after a shower and it makes my skin feel soft and smelling soooooo good.  I went back to T.J Maxx the next day and found they also had the Lavender scent, so I bought that too.  I am well stocked up on Baylis &amp; Harding perfumed talc.  I&#x27;ll return to T.J. Maxx to troll for more, but I&#x27;ll have to get it from Amazon if I can&#x27;t find it there because I know this is something I will always want to have on hand.</li>
    <li> IT IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR SUMMER. NOT ONLY THE PLEASANT FRAGRANT BUT ALSO THE COMFORTABLE FEELING AFTER USING IT.</li>
    <li> This powder has an absolutely amazing fragrance.  I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it.  Maybe a perfect blend of citrus and green tones.  Its hard to find a non-floral bath powder, so I love it and will be buying more.  The container is beautiful as well.</li>
    <li> Subtle, not overwhelming scent. Keeps me feeling fresh and clean during nasty, humid summer months. I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s enough of it to apply generously.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  Thank U.</li>
    <li> it smells so good and it makes my skin so soft! I like even better than my expensive Estée Lauder!!! I am ordering a couple of more today!</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this talcum powder is delicate, great for daytime. I wish they made a cologne to go with the talc. I tried the matching lotion, but didn&#x27;t like that as much.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent!  Difficult finding scented powder these days. The most widely available is Johnson and Johnson baby pwd. A bit of this lovely powder during the relentless summer heat goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It is probably just me but I did not care for this talc or the scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find nice lightly scented talc/powder. This one is quite nice and feels very good on the skin.  It is a rather large container (which also looks pretty) so this will last a long time. I do like it very much!</li>
    <li> smells nice feels soft to the skin</li>
    <li> Nice silky powder, pleasantly aromatic.</li>
    <li> I love the real baylis and harding powder but what I received off the Amazon website was foul smelling and arrived in a yellowed tin when the real baylis and harding powder is in a snowy white tin. It is not worth the trouble to send it back but I will NEVER order this  online again. It is CLEARLY NOT the SAME QUALITY. It is going in my trash bin.</li>
    <li> Delightful, light, barely there perfumed Talc.  I&#x27;m not sure I have perfumed talc on or my body just adored my shower water.</li>
    <li> Very nice powder, I enjoy the feel and the smell of it.</li>
    <li> A very fresh smell will order again soon</li>
    <li> this is wonderful and great talcum powder.  It is not over powering but has a really pretty and clean smell.  Have bought several others for friends and relatives.  Everyone always wants to know what I am wearing. Hope you keep selling these talcs as they are very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Excellent I will buy again I am Satisfied with the product and services</li>

    <li> Ordered as a gift for mother-in-law.  Can arrived dented, so I&#x27;m using it myself after putting it into a container I can use with a powder puff.  I love the scent and the powder is smooth and nice.  Container not satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I like this body powder but it is very fine and gets everywhere! You must use very sparingly. It has a very light scent that I like.</li>
    <li> OK not a great powder.</li>

Going to try to find someone to give it to that doesn&#x27;t think it stinks :P I went back and got the Rose Honeysuckle one and that smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Good product. Refreshing scent as always. Will order again as needed. Also makes a nice gift for gift basket.</li>
    <li> For some reason it is hard to find nice body powder.  I live in a hot climate and use it everyday.  This powder has a very silky feel and wonderful fragrance.  The fragrance is not overpowering but floral and clean.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> purchased as gift, not my personal preference.  Overly sweet, heavy scent to my thinking.  would choose something lighter for my use</li>
