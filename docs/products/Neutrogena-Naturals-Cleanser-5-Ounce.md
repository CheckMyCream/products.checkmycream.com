### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What doesn&#x27;t work for me, might be awesome for you!</li>
      <li>Cleans great!</li>
      <li>I think this works as a morning cleanser when you just want to freshen up, but it&#x27;s not the best nighttime treatment for removing cosmetics.</li>
      <li>My face felt incredibly greasy after using this product.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to try the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser to see if a great product could be improved upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a keeper and a welcome addition to her acne arsenal.</li>
      <li>This is a great cleanser.</li>
      <li>That is a very nice feature which I have not seen before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, I loved this product.  </li>
      <li>They are a good brand.</li>
      <li>that all that tingles is working to your good.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pleasant, kind of grassy or herbal but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Altogether a nice product I feel good about recommending.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this creamy cleanser!</li>
      <li>Really nice cleansing cream.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is nice and creamy and isn&#x27;t quite as drying as the makeup remover version.  </li>
      <li>It was a nice feeling.</li>
      <li>Feels nice, smells nice, and my skin glows after use.</li>
      <li>Would I buy it again, probably not, but that has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the product just my own inclination to use soap.</li>
      <li>I like using this kind of cleanser that you rinse off with water.  </li>
      <li>But it does not remove my makeup effectively on its own.</li>
      <li>This cream cleanser goes on easily and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s new Naturals skin care line is wonderful.</li>
      <li>The bit of dryness I felt was easily remedied with some moisturizer, and I was good to go.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, smells great and leaves a very clean feeling after use.</li>
      <li>But this is good and cheap.  </li>
      <li>best part: I couldn&#x27;t get over how SOFT my skin felt and very clean.</li>
      <li>Love it, cleans my face and feels very smooth will buy it again.</li>
      <li>As a body wash, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have some of the undesirable qualities, mostly because body skin is tougher.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>and I found that this product was a bit overwhelming for me.  </li>
      <li>Personally, she always looks perfect to me.  </li>
      <li>I love when my face tingles after washing it -</li>
      <li>And oily skin is not something I love.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite cleanser - after 20 years of using Neutrogena cleansers, I have started looking for hydrating cleansers.  </li>
      <li>We also got the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes and she is quite pleased with those, too.  </li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena products......</li>
      <li>like the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser better.</li>
      <li>First it smelled good.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice cleansing cream and I love that the ingredients are clearly marked and explained,esp.</li>
      <li>so if you prefer the more natural route, this is certainly a good way to go.</li>
      <li>Scent too strong and itchy</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lighter Naturals Fresh Cleansing product lathers and produces wonderful bubbly suds that makes it easy to clean your whole face and neck quickly and effectively without having to use much product at all.</li>
      <li>did a fine job of washing my face, but I find the marketing of this one to be misleading.</li>
      <li>Probably still prefer Cetaphil all in all, but this was fine, and if you like the tingling/tight feeling after cleaning you might like this.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and acne free now.</li>
      <li>My skin was clean and the product was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, most cleaners do the same thing.  </li>
      <li>However, it does do a good job removing makeup, and washes away completely leaving no soapy residue.</li>
      <li>I liked it far better on shoulders and arms.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good value as it&#x27;s pretty cheap and does a decent job.</li>
      <li>But every person is unique.  </li>
      <li>While the consistency of Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser is a nice thickness--when applied to the face and water is added, the results tend to be lubricating with an end result that promotes a feeling of softness, the overall scent of the product is too strong for my liking and the tingling left on the skin feels more like an allergic reaction rather than the aftermath of a good cleansing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However this new like of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products is nice.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping to love this product because I enjoy Neutrogena products</li>
      <li>It did not leave a clean feel on my face</li>
      <li>I mean it smells nice, feels great when rubbing it onto my face</li>
      <li>In addition the pump design of the Fresh Cleansing cleaner allows for easy one handed use in the shower, and is easy to pump exactly the amount you need.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser is simply not that good.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Neutrogena has done a nice job of making this a natural cosmetic.  </li>
      <li>For that to be true, in my case, the additional fragrance would need to be removed altogether.</li>
      <li>The ingredients look almost good enough to eat, and the texture on my face felt divine: smooth, gentle, and lightly lathering.</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>It gives a slightly tingly feeling when you wash it off, but then just leaves you with a great clean feel.</li>
      <li>but if your skin is not as sensitive as mine, you might be able to use the product and enjoy it.</li>
      <li>That is very important since I have rosacea and any kind of exfoliating or other irritant</li>
      <li>It leaves your face feeling very hydrated and clean, but somehow it&#x27;s not as easy to use as the lighter Naturals Fresh Cleansing makeup</li>
      <li>Whether you prefer the Purifying Cream, or the lighter Fresh Cleansing product, both leave your face fully hydrated, fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to handle them, thus far, so I do recommend it.</li>

      <li>Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover, 6 Ounce  </li>
      <li>So far, after a few days she is very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>This is good for use with a cloth to slough off the dead cells and leave the fresh skin smooth.</li>
      <li>I found that it gave me a good clean feel to my face, but caused a little redness.  </li>
      <li>and I really did love the way this particular one felt and smelled....</li>
      <li>The price is right.</li>
      <li>Very pure.</li>
      <li>OK, I have to admit that I have near blind faith in Neutrogena based on its brand, so I was very happy to receive a reviewer sample.  </li>
      <li>for normal to combination skin, this could be a new favorite.</li>
      <li>I use it every night to wash my face, and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
      <li>I found is that the cream cleanser is definitely denser, and it goes on more like a lotion.</li>
      <li>I avoided my eyes at first.</li>
      <li>However, you must remove any makeup first as this product will not remove it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the fragrance is more than I personally care for in a cleansing product.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it works better for women who are removing makeup but as a male looking to just remove oils and feel refreshed, this product does NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s a creamy, non-lathering cleanser</li>
      <li>Finally I decided to eat healthier and get a better face wash.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with my more gentle Basis face wash and my Dove Deep Moisture body</li>
      <li>The rest of the time I have used Neutrogena Natural Fresh Cleaning because it&#x27;s the only thing that I&#x27;ve been able to use to on a semi-regular basis without irritation.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it I would squeeze out too much and it took some rinsing to get it all off.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser did not irritate my super sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Neutrogena Purifying Facial Cleanser for years and this is a FAR better option for a natural way to clean ones&#x27; face.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser does a nice job of cleaning your skin without leaving it feeling tight or feeling any residue.  </li>
      <li>I washed my face with this once a day in the morning and then at night I used Neutrogena oil free facial cleanser with salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>It did clean well, and did not dry out.  </li>
      <li>but I could have done with like a dime size for my whole face.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like this face cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have acne, so perhaps, the strength of the product is just too much for my skin type (I am Italian-American with olive</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This time of the year is tough on those of us who suffer from dry skin.I have used this a few times. I have problems with dry skin around my lips and chin. I need something that will take off the dead skin without drying too much. This is good for use with a cloth to slough off the dead cells and leave the fresh skin smooth. The effect lasts for several days. However, you must remove any makeup first as this product will not remove it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does a nice job of cleaning your skin without leaving it feeling tight or feeling any residue.  I like using this kind of cleanser that you rinse off with water.  It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Really nice cleansing cream. Rinsed off well and left skin feeling soft, clean and not at all dry. Especially like the fact that it is not tested on animals.  I am surprised that it seemed to irritate the skin of some other reviewers - not doubting their experience, it just seems that Neutrogena made a point of the fact that it contains no harsh sulfates.  Must be something else that some people could find unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend money on special facial cleansers, as soap and water has done the job for me for decades. That said, I loved this product.  It only takes a small dab to wash up, which makes it economical.  The smell is faintly herbal and fresh, not artificial. The ingredients look almost good enough to eat, and the texture on my face felt divine: smooth, gentle, and lightly lathering. I felt pampered from simply washing my face.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of face cleansers. Some good and some bad. I like this one. I have never had issues with Neutrogena. They are a good brand. However this new like of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products is nice. First it smelled good. Second you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. A little bit goes a long way. I used about a quarter size but I could have done with like a dime size for my whole face. It really did feel like it gave me a deep clean. Lastly, I had a cooling sensation which is probably due to the winterbark and wintergreen used as some of the ingredients. It was a nice feeling. I will probably start getting this brand of cleaner as me daily face cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. It goes on smooth, smells great and leaves a very clean feeling after use.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s new Naturals skin care line is wonderful. Recently, I started using [[ASIN:B004D248U4 Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover, 6 Ounce  (Pack of 2)]], and not only does it remove my daily makeup quickly &amp; completely; but it leaves my face feeling soft, fresh, and full of moisture. So I decided to try the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser to see if a great product could be improved upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found is that the cream cleanser is definitely denser, and it goes on more like a lotion. Consequently, the cream cleanser does not lather up. However, it does do a good job removing makeup, and washes away completely leaving no soapy residue. It leaves your face feeling very hydrated and clean, but somehow it&#x27;s not as easy to use as the lighter Naturals Fresh Cleansing makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lighter Naturals Fresh Cleansing product lathers and produces wonderful bubbly suds that makes it easy to clean your whole face and neck quickly and effectively without having to use much product at all. In addition the pump design of the Fresh Cleansing cleaner allows for easy one handed use in the shower, and is easy to pump exactly the amount you need. In contrast, the tube design of the cream cleanser takes two hands &amp; tends to dispense too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&#x27;s Naturals skin care line is packed with natural \\&quot;bionutrients\\&quot;, there is absolutely no odd scent, or filmy residue. Whether you prefer the Purifying Cream, or the lighter Fresh Cleansing product, both leave your face fully hydrated, fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I have a very difficult time with cosmetics. Between allergies and dry skin it&#x27;s a battle to find something that my skin can tolerate that doesn&#x27;t make it feel like sandpaper. I regularly use virgin coconut oil as an over-night moisturizer. My skin is that dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cleanse my face, for the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleaning + Makeup Remover [ASIN: B004D248U4]. Admittedly, I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day. On the days that I don&#x27;t I just use water to wash my face. The rest of the time I have used Neutrogena Natural Fresh Cleaning because it&#x27;s the only thing that I&#x27;ve been able to use to on a semi-regular basis without irritation. It goes on a little thick though which is why I wanted to try the Purifying Cream Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser better. It&#x27;s smell is a little less intense. When mixed with a small bit of water before applying to wet skin it rinses off very easily. I&#x27;ve included the directions for use a few sentences below if interested. So far I have not encountered any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company states that it is 98% natural and that \\&quot;any additional ingredients are essential to blend the product together and maintain effectiveness.\\&quot; It also says that the product is hypoallergenic. For that to be true, in my case, the additional fragrance would need to be removed altogether. For that, I deducted one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not listed on the tube which is 5 ounces the directions for use are as follows (via the Neutrogena website):&lt;br /&gt;Wet your face and hands with lukewarm water. Pump cleanser into your hands and work into lather. Massage lather onto skin with a gentle, circular motion. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat dry with a soft towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list includes:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Soure&#x3D;Purified water)&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl Alcohol (Source&#x3D;Coconut, Palm)&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin (Source&#x3D;Soybean, Coconut, Palm)&lt;br /&gt;Sucrose Cocoate (Source&#x3D;Coconut, Palm)&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate (Source&#x3D;Corn)&lt;br /&gt;Coco-Glucoside (Source&#x3D;Vegetable)&lt;br /&gt;Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Cetyl Phosphate (Source&#x3D;Coconut, Palm)&lt;br /&gt;Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides (Source&#x3D;Palm)&lt;br /&gt;Xantham Gum (Source&#x3D;Fermented Plant Matter)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic Acid (Source&#x3D;Wintergreen)&lt;br /&gt;Menthol (Source&#x3D;Plant)&lt;br /&gt;Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract (Source&#x3D;White Willow Bark)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Phytate (Source &#x3D;Rice)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream cleanser does not contain harsh chemical sulfates, parabens, petrolatum,dyes, or phthalates. Only 3 of the 16 ingredients are not derived from natural sources. I&#x27;m able to handle them, thus far, so I do recommend it. If a problem arises, I&#x27;ll update my review accordingly.Citric Acid  Potassium Cetyl Phosphate (Source&#x3D;Coconut, Palm)  Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides (Source&#x3D;Palm)  Xantham Gum (Source&#x3D;Fermented Plant Matter)  Sodium Benzoate  Fragrance  Salicylic Acid (Source&#x3D;Wintergreen)  Menthol (Source&#x3D;Plant)  Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract (Source&#x3D;White Willow Bark)  Sodium Phytate (Source &#x3D;Rice)    This cream cleanser does not contain harsh chemical sulfates, parabens, petrolatum,dyes, or phthalates.

    <li> I love this. It does have a bit of a burn, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and tight after I&#x27;m done washing. I&#x27;ve had a cold, so I think the burning is mostly because of a raw nose. Bleh!</li>
    <li> I like the creamy texture and tingling feeling. The price is right. But it does not remove my makeup effectively on its own. I don&#x27;t wear a ton of thick makeup, so I was surprised to need a makeup remover wipe after using this cleanser in the shower. Maybe I needed a washcloth to sort of scrub it off? I think this works as a morning cleanser when you just want to freshen up, but it&#x27;s not the best nighttime treatment for removing cosmetics. One cleanser by Burts Bees is way better at removing makeup - I just hate the price. May have to go back to it though.</li>
    <li> I have used many other Neutrogena products and I really like them.  However, I was really not happy with this cleanser.  It did not leave a clean feel on my face and I did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love it, cleans my face and feels very smooth will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Only clearner I can use without causing problems with my eyes. it is cheaper here than at Walmarts. Thanks</li>
    <li> I like that this has less bad ingredients than most major commercial cleanser. Good value as it&#x27;s pretty cheap and does a decent job. it is non-drying. You don&#x27;t need to use that much so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever dislike a product from Neutrogena, so when I got the opportunity to sample this from Amazon Vine, I strongly suspected I was going to like this. And I do. I use it every night to wash my face, and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
    <li> This cleanser did not irritate my super sensitive skin.  It did clean well, and did not dry out.  After two weeks of use, I didn&#x27;t notice any change, (either for better or worse) in regard to the statement of improved complexion.  It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, but it does have a faint scent, similar to that of hair conditioner, but it thankfully does not linger.</li>
    <li> This is a somewhat thick cream cleanser that is easy to go on, and easy enough to get back off. It gives a slightly tingly feeling when you wash it off, but then just leaves you with a great clean feel. It didn&#x27;t really dry my skin out excessively, and didn&#x27;t make me break out. The bit of dryness I felt was easily remedied with some moisturizer, and I was good to go. Compared to other Neutrogena products, I can&#x27;t really give this much benefit over them, but it does work really well - so if you prefer the more natural route, this is certainly a good way to go.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena cleansers since my dermatologist recommended them in 1994.  This cleanser is nice and creamy and isn&#x27;t quite as drying as the makeup remover version.  It also doesn&#x27;t break me out.  It&#x27;s not my favorite cleanser - after 20 years of using Neutrogena cleansers, I have started looking for hydrating cleansers.  This isn&#x27;t hydrating enough for me and I now prefer Philosophy Purity.  But this is good and cheap.  If your skin is on the oily side, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this after doing a ton of research to find a solution for my acne. I had the occasional acne in high school but then it cleared up. Within the past year, I started having ance breakouts and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. Finally I decided to eat healthier and get a better face wash. I cut out sugars, sodas, fried foods and fast food. This worked wonders. I washed my face with this once a day in the morning and then at night I used Neutrogena oil free facial cleanser with salicylic acid. My skin is smooth and acne free now. I have read a lot of people saying this dried their skin out. It did dry mine out just a little, but remember that everyone is different and it might work great for one person and then not for another, so try it out first. My skin adjusted to it and doesn&#x27;t dry out anymore. Also try it out in the summer if possible because in the winter skin dries out so much easier. I would highly recommended this to anyone who is looking for an over the counter solution for minor and occasional ance breakouts without having to spend a fortune.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t get some of the extreme reactions that other reviewers did, I&#x27;m not wild about what this does to my face.  First, it&#x27;s a creamy, non-lathering cleanser that&#x27;s difficult to rinse off.  Next, my skin emerges taut and shiny, but not moisturized.  After fifteen or so minutes, even after I apply my usual moisturizer, my cheekbone area looks unevenly pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product descriptions doesn&#x27;t call this a &amp;#34;facial cleanser&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;body wash,&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s not clear how Neutrogena expected this to be used.  As a body wash, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have some of the undesirable qualities, mostly because body skin is tougher.  That said, because it doesn&#x27;t really lather, it&#x27;s difficult to tell how much to use for body coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with my more gentle Basis face wash and my Dove Deep Moisture body cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser has a very subtle odor--nothing to get excited about, but the product performance is as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: a cream, not too thick, not too runny, easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling: No burning, itching, nothing alarming. As a matter of fact when I rinse the water off, my skin really does have this &amp;#34;I&#x27;m open and clean&amp;#34; feeling. I&#x27;ve no doubt it&#x27;s truly opening the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup removal: Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allergies: Though I have very sensitive skin, I had no issues with this product. I sampled it on my wrist before using it on my face. When I finally did use it on my face I avoided my eyes at first. The second time I used it I felt confident enough to use it on my eyes. No issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cleansing cream and I love that the ingredients are clearly marked and explained,esp. for those who have sensitivity or concerns about the chemicals we put on our skin. The texture is  the ubiquitous pearly liquid soap in appearance. There were no directions on my tube (nor in the shipping box) so I just guessed on a small pea-sized drop to start. It was enough for me (I have dry skin these days but was combination skin). The fragrance is pleasant, kind of grassy or herbal but not overpowering. It didn&#x27;t really lather up to soapiness, and definitely has a tingly or active ingredient feel as I washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part: I couldn&#x27;t get over how SOFT my skin felt and very clean. However, I did find it was drying and after awhile I debated whether I should moisturize after all. I think the key word in the name is &amp;#34;purifying.&amp;#34; If you have dry, sensitive skin I would be cautious about using this type of cleanser but for normal to combination skin, this could be a new favorite.</li>
    <li> No irritation, breakouts, or uncomfortable dryness (I did still need to use moisturizer as I need with all cleansers) for my sensitive skin!  Feels nice, smells nice, and my skin glows after use.</li>
    <li> Love this creamy cleanser! It leaves my face moisturizers and feeling silky soft. I give this five stars and a big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of things about a cleaner I like.  The cream cleanser is a texture that I enjoy, as it seems thick enough to truly feel that the face is being coated, but yet still wash off easily enough.  And I appreciate natural products and that this is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the fragrance is more than I personally care for in a cleansing product.  While it did not bother my allergies (and is a natural product), I can see how it could aggravate my nose if my nose were already feeling sensitive.  For me, I&#x27;d rather leave the fragrance (especially so close to or right on my nose) to something that I choose to put on, and here Neutrogena has specifically chosen to add in &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; from their Ingredients list.  I wouldn&#x27;t choose this product again, and, while I did not use the product long because of not liking it, I actually wonder if it may have been what caused my skin to look worse.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and I found that this product was a bit overwhelming for me.  After using it, my skin was reddened and felt a tiny bit raw.  To be fair, most cleaners do the same thing.  I was hoping that as it was Neutrogena, made mostly of natural products, and was a cream cleanser that it would be gentle also.  For me, that was not the case.  My skin was clean and the product was easy to use.  I would not use it again but if your skin is not as sensitive as mine, you might be able to use the product and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I really like this face cleanser.  It leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth and soft, without a dried-out tight feeling that my skin feels after using some cleansers. There is no oily residue left either.  This cleanser is non-irritating.  That is very important since I have rosacea and any kind of exfoliating or other irritant will send me into a breakout.  After a week my skin looks smoother and clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena has done a nice job of making this a natural cosmetic.  The label lists the ingredients in a table with the source listed.  That is a very nice feature which I have not seen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a little dab to clean the face so the tube will last a while. When I first tried it I would squeeze out too much and it took some rinsing to get it all off.  Altogether a nice product I feel good about recommending.</li>
    <li> OK, I have to admit that I have near blind faith in Neutrogena based on its brand, so I was very happy to receive a reviewer sample.  It appears to be as high quality as I would expect but I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this should be used.  It feels a little strong for facial use, and I am not a believer that all that tingles is working to your good. I found that it gave me a good clean feel to my face, but caused a little redness.  I liked it far better on shoulders and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is fairly thick and leaves a slightly oily, moisturized softness to my skin.  The Aroma is fairly strong and not overly pleasant but not too bad.</li>
    <li> Very pure. Scent-free. Cleans great! I love it!</li>
    <li> This cream cleanser goes on easily and has a pleasant scent.  I didn&#x27;t find it difficult to rinse off with water, but since I usually use soap to clean my face, this was second nature for me.  Would I buy it again, probably not, but that has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the product just my own inclination to use soap.</li>
    <li> While the consistency of Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser is a nice thickness--when applied to the face and water is added, the results tend to be lubricating with an end result that promotes a feeling of softness, the overall scent of the product is too strong for my liking and the tingling left on the skin feels more like an allergic reaction rather than the aftermath of a good cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product is a no-go.  The scent is overdone.  My skin felt itchy despite the ingredient of Willow Bark that includes acne-fighting salicylic acid.  I don&#x27;t have acne, so perhaps, the strength of the product is just too much for my skin type (I am Italian-American with olive skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? Scent too strong and itchy aftermath crosses this product off my list.&lt;br /&gt;Diana Faillace Von Behren&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;reneofc\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I mean it smells nice, feels great when rubbing it onto my face but it&#x27;s what my face feels like after I&#x27;ve used it that is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;m wearing it. That same creamy feel you get when you rub it into your face, It&#x27;s like that feeling is still there. My face feels really creamy after using it. And that&#x27;s not good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll pass</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser is simply not that good.  I have been using Neutrogena Purifying Facial Cleanser for years and this is a FAR better option for a natural way to clean ones&#x27; face.  I tried to like this cream product but I simply couldn&#x27;t.  Maybe it works better for women who are removing makeup but as a male looking to just remove oils and feel refreshed, this product does NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend at all.  I only gave it 2 stars because 1 star is when a product simply is bad bad bad.  I can&#x27;t hate on this that much, I just don&#x27;t feel like it does anything except maybe help remove some surface dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** NOT RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products...... but this one wasn&#x27;t my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I did like:  The scent.  Yum!  It smells so fresh and clean.  The tingle.  I love when my face tingles after washing it - it just feels so refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:  My face felt incredibly greasy after using this product.  Not right away.  But by the next morning (if I used it the night before), I would notice that my face felt much oilier than normal.  And oily skin is not something I love.  Because of that reason alone, I&#x27;m not a fan of this particular product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I am somebody who always sticks with the same facial washing products once I find something that works for me.  I love to try products, but it seems that I always end up going back to what I&#x27;ve always used in the past.  I was really hoping to love this product because I enjoy Neutrogena products and I really did love the way this particular one felt and smelled.... but it just wasn&#x27;t in the cards for me.  But every person is unique.  What doesn&#x27;t work for me, might be awesome for you!</li>
    <li> My wife has had an on-going battle with skin problems for decades.  She&#x27;s always trying new products and remedies.  Personally, she always looks perfect to me.  So, when I had the opportunity to order this Neutrogena cream she forced me to get it  :-).  She&#x27;s been a Neutrogena fan for years.  So far, after a few days she is very happy with it.  There is a slight burn/tingle sensation, but not enough to deter her using this cleanser.  She has oily skin and this seems to be helping with that so far.  We also got the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes and she is quite pleased with those, too.  As for the Cleanser I think it&#x27;s a keeper and a welcome addition to her acne arsenal.</li>
    <li> This cream cleanser cleans well enough, and is a bit tingly to me (maybe because I use Cetaphil normally and it is very unobtrusive). Makes my skin feel tighter than other cleansers too, but other than that seems to do the job. Probably still prefer Cetaphil all in all, but this was fine, and if you like the tingling/tight feeling after cleaning you might like this.</li>
    <li> Hmm. The packaging on this one is all &amp;#34;Oooh, naturals. Green and white. Minimal. Lookit me being so natural.&amp;#34; Then I squeeze a blob out of the tube onto my Clarisonic, and it&#x27;s all opalescent and perfumey. Huh. It didn&#x27;t look or smell especially &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; I realize that &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; is totally relatively... and in this case it means that on the back of the tube they explain what all the weird lab-produced chemicals are.... but it doesn&#x27;t mean all the weird lab-produced chemicals aren&#x27;t in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a fine job of washing my face, but I find the marketing of this one to be misleading. They&#x27;re trying to capitalize on the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; market, and this looks, feels, and smells like your average drug store facewash gloop.</li>
