      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>The scent is okay</li>
      <li>This is better than what I&#x27;ve been using (L&#x27;occitane Almond Shower Oil).</li>
      <li>lovely soap, great aroma, gentle on the skin.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice but the plain olive oil soap is the best.  </li>
      <li>It seems to clean even better</li>
      <li>yet it washes off really easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy enough with the timeliness of the order, etc.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B000MEA9M8 Pre de Provence Authentic Marseille Soap Cube 72% Pure Olive Oil - 300g</li>
      <li>The true test comes when it&#x27;s winter.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin soft and smooth, better than I thought</li>
      <li>My husband has eczema problems and this has helped tremendously.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin or just love organics you have to try this soap.  </li>
      <li>(glad I did), they are not even completely cured.  </li>
      <li>The embossing on the bars isn&#x27;t as distinct as in the photo either.  </li>
      <li>I am now addicted to these wonderful soaps.</li>
      <li>This is such a smooth and clean soap!  </li>
      <li>First of all - it looks nothing like the picture; it is not a cube, but a rectangle shaped piece.</li>
      <li>I have used this soap many times in the past, and usually love it.  </li>
      <li>I had the same experience as many of the 1 star reviewers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great on all face, body and my thick hair.</li>
      <li>I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time.</li>
      <li>Mild, old school soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just pure soap.</li>
      <li>Though the smell takes a little to get use to, it is good, just not usual.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t show much concern for quality or customer service.</li>
      <li>Not the real one.  </li>
      <li>Very soggy.</li>
      <li>My hands are very supple after I use it.</li>
      <li>And it washes dirt off very well.  </li>
      <li>Very wet, and wrapped in paper that is stuck in many spots.    </li>
      <li>Easy on dry skin.</li>
      <li>It smells clean and basic -</li>
      <li>lovely and long lasting!</li>
      <li>Soap is very soft.  </li>
      <li>It certainly does not dry your skin.  </li>
      <li>To the touch, it was soft, almost of play dough consistency.</li>
      <li>old rancid smell  like moldy.  </li>
      <li>This soap works well for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Have found that using a pouf bath sponge makes it last long &amp; lather very well.</li>
      <li>It must have been damp for some time because the stamps are barely visible and are unreadable.  </li>
      <li>Not dry.</li>
      <li>and it does not dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>Light green, very soft, not aged or dried properly.  </li>
      <li>Nice feeling after using...found it easier to use after slicing it in half &amp; storing the other half for later use.</li>
      <li>Maybe because it&#x27;s natural ingredients and considering how long it has been around??  </li>
      <li>While the picture shows a square soap, with the 72% clearly printed on the package, the soap inside is not green, not white, but a dark yellow color.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product as I&#x27;ve heard good things about olive oil soap and this brand.</li>
<li> a soap would as other soaps just strip my skin of its natural oils and dry me out.</li>
<li> an old school, well made, aged, high quality, hard as a rock type of soap.</li>
<li> Second, it came in wrapped in a wet piece of paper.</li>
<li> I purchased 5 bars and they almost look like &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34;- a little mis-shaped on the edges and a slightly different color.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s little bigger than the size of a cake of Ivory soap</li>
<li> This soap seemed to be very wet and smaller than the same soap I have ordered in the past.</li>
<li> /&gt;Clearly someone would have had to knowingly pack up a wet bar of soap.  </li>
<li> I have ordered this soap before from other sources.  </li>
<li> Definitely won&#x27;t buy again and not sure I&#x27;ll ever finish this one.</li>
<li> But the soap is not aesthetically pleasing and while I understand and appreciate the handmade nature of the soap, it just is sort of slimy and the smell is not the usual Savon de Marseille smell.</li>
<li> but I am having trouble getting over the smell!</li>
<li> I guess I&#x27;m just not sure what all the hype is about</li>
<li> This is very disappointing because we only ordered one bar, so it is almost not worth the trouble to return it.</li>
<li> It is hard to find this type of soap.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it is a bit bulky and awkward to handle in the shower.</li>
<li> Even the texture  is wrong.</li>
<li> Hopefully that won&#x27;t be disappointing.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not that bad, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
<li> However, this batch is a real disappointment.  </li>
<li> Unwrapped, it was covered in mold and smelled horrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> They use just olive oil and ocean water, it doesn&#x27;t get anymore Greek. For a soap that cuts like butter it lasts on the washcloth (I don&#x27;t have to continually reapply) and over time if it&#x27;s in a dish that can strain. It&#x27;s great on all face, body and my thick hair. Shipping doesn&#x27;t go up if you buy a bunch of bars.</li>
    <li> This is soap as good as anything you can buy in France.  Service was great.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap many times in the past, and usually love it.  However, this batch is a real disappointment.  I ordered several bars as Christmas gifts, but when they arrived and I opened them to have a look (glad I did), they are not even completely cured.  The bars are discolored and white-edged and squished around the edges.  Very wet, and wrapped in paper that is stuck in many spots.    Can&#x27;t even read the logo on the bars.  Guess I&#x27;ll keep these for household use, and start shopping again for the daughters-in-law. I&#x27;m happy enough with the timeliness of the order, etc.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap.  Softens and moisturizes your skin.  Never feels greasy or oily.  Rinses off leaving skin silky.  It smells clean and basic - no fragrance.  I also use the olive oil soap that is scented with flower petals - they are great, too.  I&#x27;ve tried the palm oil soap, too and it&#x27;s nice but the plain olive oil soap is the best.  I&#x27;ve also purchased the olive oil verbena liquid soap - fabulous!  I&#x27;m 55 and I&#x27;ve had itchy skin for many years - never found anything to help it.  After using this soap for only a couple of months, I am never itchy!  My husband has eczema problems and this has helped tremendously.  I never want to be without this soap!  Thank you Savon de Marseille and also Amazon for helping me find this perfect soap.</li>
    <li> This soap came and it hadn&#x27;t even finished curing.  This is very disappointing because we only ordered one bar, so it is almost not worth the trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> This company continues to win me over.  I love this cube soap.  I bought the smaller cube and it fits perfectly in my soap dish in the shower.  It leaves my skin moisturized but not greasy.  The scent is really nice.  I will buy bigger next time.  If you have sensitive skin or just love organics you have to try this soap.  Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been doing a research on Marseille soaps recently and have bought several ones from different sources. This one feels like a slap on a face. First of all - it looks nothing like the picture; it is not a cube, but a rectangle shaped piece. Second, it came in wrapped in a wet piece of paper. Unwrapped, it was covered in mold and smelled horrible.  To the touch, it was soft, almost of play dough consistency. I called the customer service immediately and received a refund.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and use nothing else.  I order it from this company several times a year and have always received prompt service and an excellent product.  [...]</li>
    <li> This soap works well for sensitive skin.  Smells like Olive Oil but hey that&#x27;s why they named it olive oil soap.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful soap.  Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I use it all the time now.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000MEA9M8 Pre de Provence Authentic Marseille Soap Cube 72% Pure Olive Oil - 300g (10.5oz)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful soap for Winter time. Easy on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Good value for the size of the product but I am having trouble getting over the smell! Definitely won&#x27;t buy again and not sure I&#x27;ll ever finish this one.</li>
    <li> Not the real one.  Not dry. Very soggy. Light green, very soft, not aged or dried properly.  Not a cube either.  I bought a Savon de Marseille soap 2 years ago from Amazon and it was amazing.  This is no comparison.  I believe it is because of different sellers. I bought a Syrian/Haleppo Olive Oil/Laurel soap which arrived yesterday and in love with. washing my hair, face, body. just a-mazing!! an old school, well made, aged, high quality, hard as a rock type of soap. stay away from this..</li>
    <li> I have ordered this soap before from other sources.  This soap seemed to be very wet and smaller than the same soap I have ordered in the past. from different vendors</li>
    <li> Awesome stain remover especially oil stains on clothes. Good for bathing if you are okay with under fumed smell . Recommended for the above uses.</li>
    <li> I think this soap product is a great value for the money.  The bar was larger than I anticipated.  The scent is okay and it does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice feeling after using...found it easier to use after slicing it in half &amp; storing the other half for later use. Though the smell takes a little to get use to, it is good, just not usual. Have found that using a pouf bath sponge makes it last long &amp; lather very well.</li>
    <li> lovely soap, great aroma, gentle on the skin.  My only complaint is that it is a bit bulky and awkward to handle in the shower.</li>
    <li> old rancid smell  like moldy.  Even the texture  is wrong. I would not buy it  again.. I thought of returning but ... never did.</li>
    <li> These are not the same soaps we order each month. While the picture shows a square soap, with the 72% clearly printed on the package, the soap inside is not green, not white, but a dark yellow color. The soap produces no lather, and broke my wife&#x27;s skin out severely. We will not order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t look like what&#x27;s in the photo. I purchased 5 bars and they almost look like &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34;- a little mis-shaped on the edges and a slightly different color.  The embossing on the bars isn&#x27;t as distinct as in the photo either.  I haven&#x27;t used the product yet. Hopefully that won&#x27;t be disappointing.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience as many of the 1 star reviewers. I received my soap in damp, yellow-stained, moldy butcher paper wrapped in bubble wrap. Upon opening, the bar of soap wreaked of mildew and had a rancid smell. The bar of soap looked as if it had already been used and was cracked. The identifying stamp marks of authenticity weren&#x27;t even readable. I&#x27;m disappointed in this product as I&#x27;ve heard good things about olive oil soap and this brand. I was looking forward to checking it out. Sent the item back immediately.</li>
    <li> This is such a smooth and clean soap!  I have given it as gifts often and it is always loved.</li>
    <li> This soap cleared up my rash. It&#x27;s just pure soap.</li>
    <li> Mild, old school soap. Great for my skin. Not too stripping or drying.</li>
    <li> Been very happy with this soap, rinses off nice and does not dry the skin.</li>
    <li> There is no discernible smell to this and it cleans well with a nice lather. It leaves skin soft and smooth, better than I thought a soap would as other soaps just strip my skin of its natural oils and dry me out. This is better than what I&#x27;ve been using (L&#x27;occitane Almond Shower Oil). The true test comes when it&#x27;s winter.</li>
    <li> I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time. It is hard to find this type of soap. But the soap is not aesthetically pleasing and while I understand and appreciate the handmade nature of the soap, it just is sort of slimy and the smell is not the usual Savon de Marseille smell. On the plus side, it is a big bar and the shipping was timely. I will use the soap- it&#x27;s not that bad, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> As bar soaps go, this is good soap.  It certainly does not dry your skin.  And it washes dirt off very well.  I guess I&#x27;m just not sure what all the hype is about if you compare it to any given liquid hand soap.  Maybe because it&#x27;s natural ingredients and considering how long it has been around??  Anyway, if I was going to use bar soap this would be the one I would use for sure.  UPDATE: Now that I&#x27;ve used this several months I like it even more.  It seems to have improved with age.  It seems to clean even better yet it washes off really easily.  My hands are very supple after I use it.</li>
    <li> I am now addicted to these wonderful soaps. I like the rustic look and my skin never felt better. I think this soap is multipurpose too.</li>
    <li> I use savon soap every bath. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great soap.  If I knew the size before I ordered, I would not have ordered.  It&#x27;s little bigger than the size of a cake of Ivory soap</li>
    <li> lovely and long lasting!</li>
    <li> Arrived wrapped in wet/damp paper.  Soap is very soft.  It must have been damp for some time because the stamps are barely visible and are unreadable.  I could cut through the bar w/ a butter knife.  Not what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly someone would have had to knowingly pack up a wet bar of soap.  Doesn&#x27;t show much concern for quality or customer service.</li>
