<ol>
      <li>Wonderful foot file.</li>
      <li>This file is GREAT!  </li>
      <li>the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This works great after i used the Diamoncel Callous rasp.</li>
      <li>Works great and leaves your heels feeling like butta</li>
      <li>but it did a great job at eliminating the &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; edges on my heals.  </li>
      <li>I received this Diamancel Foot Buffer for Christmas from a girlfriend and WOW - perfect gift - perfect timing.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to follow it up with a great foot cream once you&#x27;re out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled I bought this</li>
      <li>This buffer is very fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many buffers but this one takes the cake.  </li>
      <li>know there is a solution:)</li>
      <li>The #29 gets more skin off the foot</li>
      <li>is more for a finer polish.</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth now that Summer and sandal weather is coming again.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this buffer....</li>
      <li>They love it too.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best tool for your feet available!!</li>
      <li>Wow, this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I am able to keep my heels smooth with this Diamancel file.</li>
      <li>This file has saved me a fortune in pedicures and cheap foot files.  </li>
      <li>so I take really good care of my feet all year long!  </li>
      <li>The Diamancel is definitely the better purchase even though it can be over $30 it saves a lot of money over time, and it truly works!</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>(Do not use on freshly washed feet, as it will not work well.)  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t ever waste your money on the cheap versions!!!</li>
      <li>hope this product lasts for a long time which would make it even more worth the money.</li>
      <li>My advice buy a pumice stone for a lesser price and it would do a better job.</li>
      <li>This file does a great job of removing extra dry skin and calluses from your heels and files them to be baby-soft.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely recommend this to anyone who wants smoother and better looking feet.</li>
      <li>make sure to use it on DRY feet....works like a charm!</li>
      <li>Works very well</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gentle  on feet.</li>
      <li>no matter how much cream I put on them.  </li>
      <li>This thing really works.  </li>
      <li>I am wondering who the people are that gave it such glowing references as it is no better than a cheap emery board, and the interesting thing is there is no way to return it!</li>
      <li>I am glad I got the other one as this</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other types and nothing has worked as well as this.  </li>
      <li>The handle is easy to hold on to and the buffer doesn&#x27;t rip your heel apart - it simply removes the dry flaky skin and leaves it soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the high price tag fool</li>
      <li>Your feet should be clean and dry - I have to wait until about 5 minutes out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I like this product but would like one with just an added more buffing strength as my feet as extra dry.</li>
      <li>Dead skin comes right off - only when your feet are clean and dry.</li>
      <li>With this dry Colorado winter weather my heels really need to be tended to - often.  </li>
      <li>It gently removes calluses and rough spots on your feet</li>
      <li>But I have only used it once because my heals are still soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so it really smooths off the rough skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no miracle cure for dry, cracked feet but certainly goes a long way to helping.</li>
      <li>The manufacturer selling it for the costly price should be in jail for high way robbery.</li>
      <li>I use it every other day and buy a new one every 18 months or so.  </li>

<li> I have really dry feet and nothing worked to keep them somewhat presentable - until this item!</li>

<li> They never seem to wear down either.  </li>
<li> I am not, this product is not worth it at all!</li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t make my feet sore like other callus removal tools that I have used in the past.  </li>
<li> The winter has destroyed my poor skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got a pet peeve with bad looking heels in sassy shoes during the summer</li>

<li> What a disappointment!  </li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> Wonderful foot file. the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s no miracle cure for dry, cracked feet but certainly goes a long way to helping.</li>
    <li> This was an expensive product, but according to the description I decided to order and looked forward to a product that would be far better than anything I had used in the past.  What a disappointment!  I am wondering who the people are that gave it such glowing references as it is no better than a cheap emery board, and the interesting thing is there is no way to return it!</li>
    <li> I received this Diamancel Foot Buffer for Christmas from a girlfriend and WOW - perfect gift - perfect timing.  With this dry Colorado winter weather my heels really need to be tended to - often.  I&#x27;ve got a pet peeve with bad looking heels in sassy shoes during the summer so I take really good care of my feet all year long!  I&#x27;ve used many buffers but this one takes the cake.  The handle is easy to hold on to and the buffer doesn&#x27;t rip your heel apart - it simply removes the dry flaky skin and leaves it soft and smooth.

I promise... you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have turned into a foot buffer addict.  The winter has destroyed my poor skin.  I was so sick of my feet snagging on my sheets no matter how much cream I put on them.  I have tried so many other types and nothing has worked as well as this.  I am thrilled I bought this and it was a lot cheaper than buying from Sephora</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a great product.  Psoriasis runs in my family and although I do not suffer from psoriasis patches, I tend to have extremely dry skin.  The heals of my feet tend to be a little &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; looking although I use foot scrubbers and lotions nearly daily.  I was hesitant to order this because of the price but thought I would try it based on reviews I read at several websites.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the buffer once in the month that I have had it but it did a great job at eliminating the &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; edges on my heals.  But I have only used it once because my heals are still soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product lasts for a long time which would make it even more worth the money.</li>
    <li> Finally! Something that works. I have really dry feet and nothing worked to keep them somewhat presentable - until this item! Your feet should be clean and dry - I have to wait until about 5 minutes out of the shower. Dead skin comes right off - only when your feet are clean and dry.</li>
    <li> Love it. Had to get another  one cause hubby took mine. Works very well and it&#x27;s gentle  on feet.</li>
    <li> I like this product but would like one with just an added more buffing strength as my feet as extra dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the #20 at the same time. I am glad I got the other one as this is more for a finer polish. The #29 gets more skin off the foot and then I finish off with this one.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best tool for your feet available!! I have used just about everything on the market and have never had these results! My feet are even softer than when I go to the salon. I never write reviews but am compelled so other people who have struggled with rough, dry, cracked feet know there is a solution:)</li>
    <li> Works great and leaves your heels feeling like butta</li>
    <li> This so called &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; buffer is a joke! The manufacturer selling it for the costly price should be in jail for high way robbery. The buffer does not work at all. My advice buy a pumice stone for a lesser price and it would do a better job. I am angry because a consumer thinks a better price buffer must be better, wrong, and some of the reviews indicated that, but I thought the were having a bad day. I am not, this product is not worth it at all!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the high price tag fool you- this tool has worked wonders on my feet.  It gently removes calluses and rough spots on your feet but it didn&#x27;t make my feet sore like other callus removal tools that I have used in the past.  I will definitely recommend this to anyone who wants smoother and better looking feet.</li>
    <li> Nothing like diamonds to buff off unwanted material</li>
    <li> This works great after i used the Diamoncel Callous rasp. Nice and smooth now that Summer and sandal weather is coming again.</li>
    <li> Actually this is a foot necessity for me rather than a luxury.  This buffer is very fine so it really smooths off the rough skin.  They never seem to wear down either.  I just bought a second one so that I could have one for home and one for my travel kit.</li>
    <li> This thing really works.  I cant believe it actually works. Had some hesitancy in purchasing but it actually does the job. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This file has saved me a fortune in pedicures and cheap foot files.  I am able to keep my heels smooth with this Diamancel file. I use it every other day and buy a new one every 18 months or so.  The files made from paper or soft metals like nickle are a waste of money and only work a few times or have to be replaced once a month for $10.  The Diamancel is definitely the better purchase even though it can be over $30 it saves a lot of money over time, and it truly works!</li>
    <li> I love this buffer....make sure to use it on DRY feet....works like a charm! My feet have never been smoother!</li>
    <li> This file is GREAT!  But you have to use it on DRY feet for it to work well.  (Do not use on freshly washed feet, as it will not work well.)  This file does a great job of removing extra dry skin and calluses from your heels and files them to be baby-soft.  I have had my file for 5 years and it has never dulled.  I purchased it as a gift for a family member.  They love it too.</li>
    <li> AHHHHMAZING!!! Don&#x27;t ever waste your money on the cheap versions!!!</li>
