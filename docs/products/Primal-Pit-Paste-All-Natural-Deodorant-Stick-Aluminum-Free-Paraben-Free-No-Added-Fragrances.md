      <li>I love it!  </li>

      <li>However, from now on I think I&#x27;ll stick with the kind in the pot instead of the stick.</li>
      <li>It keeps me smelling nice - no rashes from applying it</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I wish they would make a warm scented Amber/sandalwood/musky/vanilla flavor.</li>

      <li>This is the BEST natural deoderant that I have tried............</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing I love it.</li>
      <li>Best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
      <li>At first it worked great</li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the lavender one, but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
      <li>Dr. mist unscented is amazing and works for me all day, fine non sticky mist which DOES NOT sting when applied.</li>
      <li>I was expecting better quality and better smell.</li>
      <li>Plus love how it feels going on.</li>
      <li>I LOVE primal pit paste and the orange scent is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to trying more scents.</li>
      <li>While looking into homemade deodorant recipes I saw that many had warnings concerning the baking soda.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a better , healthier deodorant.</li>
      <li>Wish it had more mainstream feminine packaging though.</li>
      <li>Really like this product - does a great job.</li>
      <li>It is better than most, but not going to buy again.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the creamsicle scent.</li>
      <li>If it has not adverse reaction, then you will really love it, for sure :)</li>
      <li>It glides on more closely to the antiperspirant sticks I have used and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky either.</li>
      <li>I have finally found that the best option for me are the spray mineral salt</li>
      <li>Just an fyi :)</li>
      <li>and I plan to buy more of their deodorants.</li>
      <li>I love how it controls my stinky pits when prescription strength deo did nothing for</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>The Orange Creamsicle scent smells authentic upon application.  </li>
      <li>I love the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll also use the Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals deodorant stick when I want a fresh scent (surprisingly Walgreens has it cheaper than Amazon http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/arm--hammer-essentials-deodorant-with-natural-deodorizers-fresh/ID&#x3D;prod6154905-product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried the kind that you apply with your hands and originally did not like it since I did not like having to use my hands.</li>
      <li>Have heard this works great for others, but if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, beware!</li>
      <li>However, one of my friends experienced the breakout / rash problem when using a homemade natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Great natural alternative to chemicals in store brands.</li>
      <li>Should&#x27;ve gone with the happy pits paste for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The light creamsicle scent is really nice and not too sickly sweet.  </li>
      <li>I love the Orange Creamsicle fragrance, its very light and fresh, it does fade over time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After doing more research Primal Paste says it only says kids on the stick because the fun scents are more appealing to kids.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, very much like an orange creamsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried soooo many brands of natural and organic deodorants, And this one is by far the best in smell, texture and odor prevention.</li>
      <li>I love how it has no bad stuff in it as well.</li>
      <li>They all worked fine for cooler weather.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my mom and she seems to like it just fine.</li>
      <li>USED it anyway and worked fine for me.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a natural metal-less deodorant that will match your stink power with awesomeness - you&#x27;ve met your new best friend.  </li>
      <li>THEN I read somewhere that massaging it into the skin helps it get absorbed better.</li>
      <li>For that reason I won&#x27;t buy the stick version anymore, but the actual formula is great</li>
      <li>it can cause your shirts to stick lightly to the skin under your arms.</li>
      <li>I use this deodorant in conjunction with the doTerra citrus bliss therapeutic oil and my armpits stay fresh and odor free for literally  more than 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>It REALLY works....absolutely NO body odor!!!  </li>
      <li>The problem is that the baking soda in the deodorant raises the pH of the skin of some people too high, causing a kind of chemical burn.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this for my son and he didn&#x27;t end up using it, so I tried it</li>
      <li>It lasts long and smells great.</li>
      <li>I love that it is made of natural things that are much better for my body to absorb than the drugstore variety.</li>
      <li>but if anyone knows how to heal the pits so I can continue using this I&#x27;d appreciate the advice because I love this stuff so much aside from the pain.</li>
      <li>This is the only one to have good odor control AND not stain my clothes.</li>
      <li>It just works, smells fantastic, and now this is my new permanent deodorant-- until a better one is invented.  </li>
      <li>I am more than pleased with Primal Pit Paste and have recommended it several others!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best deoderant ever! Even my husband who is a doctor uses it! He was a huge skeptic of all natural products.</li>
    <li> Kids is the key word on the label of this scent, which I missed and definitely noticed it is not as strong as the other scent I have tried. This will be used when I am not going anywhere.</li>
    <li> This works better than regular deodarderant! It lasts long and smells great. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is the only natural product that has ever worked for me. I buy it for everyone I know!!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this deodorant to me when I told her no deodorant was working for me. I even tried men&#x27;s deodorant. She warned me that when I started using it, things might get worse before they got better. Well, I guess I transitioned quickly. The first day, it did not go so well. I didn&#x27;t have my usual body odor, but I smelled like a barn. It was very strange. But the second day, it was much better. IT doesn&#x27;t really last me ALL day, at least not yet, but it lasts longer than other deodorants, and for whatever reason, it does seem to &amp;#34;contain&amp;#34; the smell when it wears off (in other words, unless you stick your nose IN my armpit (in which case I have to ask, WHY are you doing that?) there is no smell. I like the way it smells when first put on, too. The texture isn&#x27;t great, though, lots of residue I have to run in...so I might not use the stick next time since I have to rub it in anyway. I&#x27;m curious if the texture on the tubbed product is any better. Anyway, we&#x27;ll see what the long term results of this product are, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with the improvement.</li>
    <li> Great natural alternative to chemicals in store brands. I love this product. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations after trying all of the natural deodorants available in retail stores. I felt like they actually made me smell worse. Not this product. It works really well. I highly recommend it. The scent is nice and not overpowering. I wish they would make a warm scented Amber/sandalwood/musky/vanilla flavor. It would be popular with both men and women.</li>
    <li> Like some other reviews, it irritated my arm pits. I had to discontinue use. My wife uses it and likes it. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have not purchased this poduct but i was considering it. However, I saw a lot of people experiencing rashes from this product and it is because of the baking soda. While looking into homemade deodorant recipes I saw that many had warnings concerning the baking soda. Not eveyone will have bad reactions, but if you have sensitive skin I would recommend finding a baking soda free deodorant.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like it but unfortunately it makes my skin itch. No rush though as i read in other reviews. I love it&#x27;s scent, it&#x27;s not too strong and very pleasant. It lasts only for about 6-8 hours for me and i can smell BO on my shirt after work.</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely works for me and met my expectations!</li>
    <li> I LOVE primal pit paste and the orange scent is my favorite. So far it&#x27;s the only aluminum free deodorant I&#x27;ve used that keeps me smelling fresh all day. I will never go back. However, from now on I think I&#x27;ll stick with the kind in the pot instead of the stick. I find that in the stick, it smears off to the side a lot and eventually works its way onto the threads that the cap screws onto. It leaves a bit of a mess and is a little wasteful. One stick lasts me about 4 months.</li>
    <li> Smells great, the kids use it as perfume, but does not work as well as the Primal Pit Paste in a jar.</li>
    <li> It is better than most, but not going to buy again.</li>
    <li> 1 star for expedited delivery.. And because I had to make one but No, I did not like this product at all. It made me feel and smell like I had not applied anything at all to my underarms. Unsatisfied 100 percent. I would like a refund.</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work well for me atleast. Im giving it two stars becuase the orange cream scent was amazing even though it did not last. Now I sweat  just like everyone else, but this did not work for me. I wish it did though because it has no harsh chemicals. I haven&#x27;t done any research on this brand so I do not know if it they sell an antiperspirant, because I would try that. This product I did not buy myself my step mom got a two pack and gave one to me.</li>
    <li> Where do I begin?! This stuff is heaven sent! After searching high and low and spending countless dollars on different deodorants, I have finally found one that actually works! I use this deodorant in conjunction with the doTerra citrus bliss therapeutic oil and my armpits stay fresh and odor free for literally  more than 24 hours.  regular deodorants just have not been working for my body chemistry. after only less than an hour of wearing regular deordorant my armpits would always smell weird and unpleasant. But not anymore since finding this miracle deodorant. THANK YOU PRIMAL PIT PASTE MAKERS!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Being allergic to every deodorant I&#x27;ve used, most of the natural products would be less irritating but really didn&#x27;t work after a couple of hours. Primal pit paste in the stick version, which is the one I tried, works all day with NO irritation despite my concerns about the baking soda that some people were sensitive to. Very happy that my body like this stuff!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time... It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.... Prevents Odor.</li>
    <li> Was sent the wrong scent, wanted orange creamsicle and received lavender. At first it worked great but then it started to darken my under arms and then began to make them raw which induced some peeling of the skin. :(&lt;br /&gt;Has to stop using.&lt;br /&gt;Wish this product would have worked.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the name  - and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re doing themselves any favors by calling it &amp;#34;pit paste&amp;#34; which has a strange hippie sound to it. I bought this by accident and it&#x27;s a great product - works well, no chemical smell or smeariness. Wish it had more mainstream feminine packaging though.</li>
    <li> This is the only clean deodorant that works for me, it&#x27;s a life sever</li>
    <li> This is the BEST natural deoderant that I have tried............and I&#x27;ve tried many!  I will say that I prefer the tub vs. the stick.  The stick is a little too hard to apply easily.  However, still a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Update to my initial review:&lt;br /&gt;After about 1.5 - 2 months of daily use, I began to develop a really red painful rash from this product. I kept using it, hoping it would go away and Id get over the negative skin reaction, but eventually it would flare up immediately after I applied it. So I knew I had to quit using this product.  I have finally found that the best option for me are the spray mineral salt deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried soooo many brands of natural and organic deodorants, And this one is by far the best in smell, texture and odor prevention. I really like the light orange vanilla creamsicle smell, the texture is nice, not slimy and wet as many others feel, and it really seems to neutralize odors. Its a winner! Id like to order this in other scents too.&lt;br /&gt;Some people have said that the baking soda ingredient caused rashes. I haven&#x27;t experienced that yet. I have been using this product daily for about a week.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. It works pretty well too. I love that it is made of natural things that are much better for my body to absorb than the drugstore variety. I do still sweat quite a bit with this, but I don&#x27;t start to smell unless I skip a shower for a couple days :/  so if you are an everyday showerer, this would be great.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick, you kind of have to warm it up under your pit for it to spread easily. I love that they have teenage options. I&#x27;m an adult, but I wanted the orange smell and it works the same :)</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant! I have been looking to get away from the aluminium in antiperspirants but I hate to sweat.  I also hate the idea of breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s. I have been on a quest for several months to find a deodorant that works. Please note that deodorants do NOT keep you from sweating like antiperspirants.  I have tried Deodomom, Truly&#x27;s and Green Tidings. They all worked fine for cooler weather. I did sweat but it didn&#x27;t smell bad. However, when the hot Georgia humidity kicked in, none of these worked so well on odor. I decided to try Primal Pit Paste and I love it! The Orange Creamsicle scent smells authentic upon application.  Yum! It does fade but still no odor at the end of the day and that includes sunning in 90 degree weather for several hours. An added plus is that I don&#x27;t seem to sweat as much as with the other deodorants. It contains baking soda and arrowroot powder so maybe these two help a little with the sweating. It glides on more closely to the antiperspirant sticks I have used and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky either. Looking forward to trying more scents. Glad to find more scents beside lavender too!</li>
    <li> Its a natural deodorant without anti antiperspirants which was very important to me because i have a history of breast cancer on both sides of my family. It smells nice, very much like an orange creamsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside i could find is if you cake on a generous amount (as i have a habit of doing to ensure im fully covered for my 8 hour workdays) it can cause your shirts to stick lightly to the skin under your arms. A slight annoyance and a weird feeling, but i believe its a side effect of the beeswax. Just had to get in the habit of not applying as much as i usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, good product.</li>
    <li> Only natural deorderant that works on me and last all day and it works on my fiancé, who has a job that is very physically demanding and the pits stay fresh up intil he takes his shower at night. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a better , healthier deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have experimented for more than a year with a bunch of natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve purchased or made myself. This is the only one to have good odor control AND not stain my clothes. I will definitely continue using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of natural deodorants, Toms (epic fail), Lavilin (works like a freeking dream, but has a couple questionable ingredients), LaVanila (actually made me smell worse), SoapWalla (AMAZING, but you have to apply it with your fingers). I was happy with this one for a couple of weeks: great ingredients, smelled great, kept me smelling great. BUT I noticed all of my grey t-shirts had become stained in the underarms and now look perma-sweatstained. For this reason I&#x27;m discontinuing and switching back to soapwalla.</li>
    <li> Would definately recommend this product! My skin is very sensitive and I have tried several brands, but was always on the lookout for something better that lasted longer than a couple of hours. This is it!! It lasts me all day and I haven&#x27;t had to reapply every other hour. So glad I finally found something my sensitive skin can handle! I prefer the lavender scent over the Orage Creamsicle, but I am just thrilled to find something that works!</li>
    <li> I loved the lemongrass one, It works great!  However, this orange one doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> This product is working perfect for me. Been using it for several months over summer and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend giving it a try. It getting great rating from EWG so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I did not like it. it was sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell very much. I was expecting better quality and better smell.</li>
    <li> Not recommended it clumps up and gets smelly its like a paste</li>
    <li> LOVE that this deodorant works well and is free of all the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; in other deodorants.</li>
    <li> By the end of the first week, this product began to burn and caused a rash. I&#x27;m not sure why it it did that but needless to say, I was very disappointed. I&#x27;d like to return it because it was not cheap.</li>
    <li> I used this for months with no problem. Then summer came &amp; I started running at the park. I ended up with swollen lymph nodes. I would get swollen lymph nodes every now &amp; again, I didn&#x27;t know why, but I began using the product less and less. I eventually started to get a rash. That&#x27;s when I realized it&#x27;s definitely the deodorant. I&#x27;m going back to using lemons &amp; limes to keep odor away.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells really good. I love the creamsicle scent. It&#x27;s one of the first natural deodorants i&#x27;m trying, and so far i&#x27;m really liking it. But it does kinda wear off if it&#x27;s hot outside and when i&#x27;m working out it never stays on. I just have to keep reapplying it. But if i&#x27;m in the house all day, it&#x27;s very good! I love how it has no bad stuff in it as well. I&#x27;ve heard other people getting rashes from this deo stick but I never had any problems from day 1. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks now. You are supposed to let it heat up for a couple of seonds on your armpit, so that it melts a little. Just an fyi :)</li>
    <li> My main complaint with this deodarant is that it gets hard after the first use and is irritating on the armpit. Otherwise it works as far as a natural deodorant can.</li>
    <li> So great to find an effective product that&#x27;s safe for both me and my pre-teen daughter!</li>
    <li> Better than all the other store bought natural deodorants in regards to keeping me smelling good but hard to put on like a roll on deodorant. To get proper coverage and less waste, I have to use my fingers. Unfortunately, if the price doesn&#x27;t go down, I will not be buying this product from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients. I love the smell. I love how it controls my stinky pits when prescription strength deo did nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like that my pits are bright red, dry, itchy, flakey, and burn as if I applied nair to my arm pits and forgot about it and got chemical burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for a little over a week now. I&#x27;ll keep trying but if anyone knows how to heal the pits so I can continue using this I&#x27;d appreciate the advice because I love this stuff so much aside from the pain.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, but a little hard, so I&#x27;m having to really press and scrape it against my skin to apply.</li>
    <li> About 10 years ago I gave up on my usual brands of deodorant/antiperspirant when I found the oils and chemicals in them actually made my body odor more unbearable for me and others to smell and tolerate.  They made me smell HORRIBLE, the oils just held bacteria in my clothes, I would have to scrub the armpits of my t-shirts and blouses before washing...but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done it all.  From Crystals, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Jasons, you name it, I tried it- worked for a while and then not so much.  I got this in the mail just as I was leaving to my summer camp that I volunteer at for a week in June (in Texas if that gives you indication of how much I would be sweating).  I knew that would be a great time to start a trial on this deodorant.  It&#x27;s thick, and granulated feeling when putting it on and at first feels a little sticky (not my favorite part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, but the results!  I actually have noticed improvement in my underarm skin, and of course-NO ODOR!  I love the Orange Creamsicle fragrance, its very light and fresh, it does fade over time.  If you have lost your faith in your natural deodorants, then Primal Pit Paste is worth a try.</li>
    <li> It REALLY works....absolutely NO body odor!!!  Impressed with the ingredient list too:)</li>
    <li> Smells good but I noticed a rash and itchy patches after a couple of weeks. However, other may not have the same reaction.</li>
    <li> This even worked for my husband in Miami!!!</li>
    <li> unfortunately, it makes me break out. expensive lesson learned. 1 bought 2 and cannot return.</li>
    <li> Had a HORRIBLE reaction to this! :( Usually do not have any issues with different deodorants...but for some reason, sure did on this one! Sooo painful! This was my experience...not saying that everyone will do the same, but I sure could not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It actually works!  I will admit, I put a deodorant to the test.  &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; deodorants typically don&#x27;t work for me. I had used a paste over 10 years ago that actually worked then I could no longer get it in the States. Due to that experience I was excited and hopeful upon hearing about Primal Pit Paste. I have tried the Lavender in the paste form and Orange in the tube form...and one application lasts all day!!!  I am more than pleased with Primal Pit Paste and have recommended it several others!</li>
    <li> Really wanted this to work!  Should&#x27;ve gone with the happy pits paste for sensitive skin.  Have heard this works great for others, but if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, beware!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my son and he didn&#x27;t end up using it, so I tried it and it works really well. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It just works, smells fantastic, and now this is my new permanent deodorant-- until a better one is invented.  It really works on odor, and goes on smoothly, without irritating my skin.  I personally also do not get any rashes from deodorants that contain baking soda.  Maybe, it just has to do with individual body chemistry.  I guess, you just have to give it a try and then you will know how your body will react.  If it has not adverse reaction, then you will really love it, for sure :)</li>
    <li> I used to have to put deodorant on like twice a day and since I started using this I only put it on in the morning and that&#x27;s it, it keeps me smelling good all day long, even after the gym. More expensive than store bought deodorant but definitely worth it, and of course it&#x27;s great bc everything in it is natural, Bo chemicals.</li>
    <li> I finally found the natural deodorant that works for me. I don&#x27;t have to reapply in mid day like with other products. I was really impressed this products kept my underarm smell nothing at the end of day. I know some reviewers had allergic reactions to baking soda, but I don&#x27;t have any. It is worth to try if you have not found any natural deodorant that you like!</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the lavender one, but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great. Our whole family has started using Primal Pit Paste.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I love it.</li>
    <li> Only no aluminum paste that actually works.</li>
    <li> Totally control smell!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and works....for about 6 hours. If I do strenuous stuff like working out of gardening in the heat, this product doesn&#x27;t work for me. I will go back to my Lavilin which works for a week before having to reapply. It&#x27;s a bummer cause I really like the smell and really wanted it to work :(</li>
    <li> Really like this product - does a great job.</li>
    <li> Works, but it left my shirt with grease marks :(</li>
    <li> I love this all natural deodorant. I made the switch to primal pit paste a few years ago and I&#x27;m never going back to grocery store deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been looking for a natural deo that works. Tried everything and this one works. Smells good and over all is grate. Plus love how it feels going on. Not a wet feeling at all.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims and controls odor really well. Will purchase again ! I am very satisfied with this good quality product</li>
    <li> item says it is for kids on the package witch wasn&#x27;t on the description. I was a little disappointed when I READ that after receiving it but i didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of the return process. USED it anyway and worked fine for me. I&#x27;m eat almost completely raw wright now so my body doesn&#x27;t produce much of a smell. when i perspire after a workout it still smells fresh.</li>
    <li> I have tried the kind that you apply with your hands and originally did not like it since I did not like having to use my hands. So i bought this one. The scent is great, but I did not feel that it worked at all. THEN I read somewhere that massaging it into the skin helps it get absorbed better. So now I take some on my hand and rub it in and it works amazingly and lasts basically all day! Go figure. For that reason I won&#x27;t buy the stick version anymore, but the actual formula is great and I plan to buy more of their deodorants. You just need to get over the fact that you need to use your hands to apply.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, after 3 applications i began to develop a rash from using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she seems to like it just fine. I did smell it first before she used it and it smells exactly like an orange creamsicle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to regular deodorant. It says kids on the label (I didn&#x27;t see that before purchasing) but it works for me. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After doing more research Primal Paste says it only says kids on the stick because the fun scents are more appealing to kids. It&#x27;s still the same ingredients as all the other scents.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a natural metal-less deodorant that will match your stink power with awesomeness - you&#x27;ve met your new best friend.  I wear crystal roll ons for my daily work, but when it comes to hot yoga - crystal roll ons just don&#x27;t cut it at all.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants and this is by far my favorite for a nice sweaty workout or hot summer day.  It keeps me smelling nice - no rashes from applying it (some natural ones get air bubbles that are sharp and make skin irritated), and it applies very smoothly.</li>
    <li> The product does work as advertised.  Similar to other reviewers. if I used the product for multiple days in a row then I also started a rash on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I&#x27;ll &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; with my Crystal Body Deodorant Stick that is 1/2 the price and lasts way longer (http://smile.amazon.com/Crystal-Deodorant-Travel-Stick-Unscented/dp/B00ULVPHHO/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0NBVDSPW5NHDKKDHXQ2D). The trick with the Crystal stick is to rub it under the arm until it&#x27;s completely dry even if it takes 1 minute per arm.  I&#x27;ll also use the Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals deodorant stick when I want a fresh scent (surprisingly Walgreens has it cheaper than Amazon http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/arm--hammer-essentials-deodorant-with-natural-deodorizers-fresh/ID&#x3D;prod6154905-product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also another company that sells natural deodorant which is organic like the Primal Pit Paste.  I haven&#x27;t tested it that long but it appears that it would last longer than the Primal Pit Paste but as noted before, I&#x27;m sticking with the Crystal rock and the Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;http://greenbodydeo.com/products/natural-deodorant-athletic-scent</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT: I Wanted to like this product as it is all natural, but i couldn&#x27;t...&lt;br /&gt;TIP: try regular baking soda in water and apply to underarms... if that down not control your odor then this won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Baking soda is irritating and does not cover my odors, test it out first or will disappoint. Also for people who shave... baking soda is a bad idea. This smells nice on but it was so thick it gave bacteria a place to live... smelt way worse than I ever do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT WORKS FOR ME: Dr. mist unscented is amazing and works for me all day, fine non sticky mist which DOES NOT sting when applied. I pair this with oral chlorophyll which works as an internal deodorant and rids of practically all bodily smells.</li>
    <li> But I was pleasantly surprised! I have tried several \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; versions of drugstore brands to no avail.  I definitely still sweat while wearing this Pit Paste, but it doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.  Actually, the deodorant has a light scent in the tube, but after a few minutes of wearing it, it has no scent at all.  I don&#x27;t notice any body odor or any fragrance from the deodorant on me hours later, even after sweating.  The light creamsicle scent is really nice and not too sickly sweet.  I have only been using it for 3 days, but so far no rash like others have experienced.  I tend to have sensitive skin, so I will update if I have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* I have been using the Pit Paste for two weeks now with no problems.  However, one of my friends experienced the breakout / rash problem when using a homemade natural deodorant.  The problem is that the baking soda in the deodorant raises the pH of the skin of some people too high, causing a kind of chemical burn.  If this happens to you, try spraying a little bit of apple cider (or plain) vinegar on your skin before applying the deodorant.  The mild acidity of the vinegar will neutralize the baking soda&#x27;s alkalinity, lowering the pH.</li>
