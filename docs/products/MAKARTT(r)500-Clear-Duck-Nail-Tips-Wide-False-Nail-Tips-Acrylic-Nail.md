    <li> I haven&#x27;t even study these. I hope that they have the ridge line...</li>
    <li> love these duck/flare tips!  they are not too thick and not too thin...love them..they are comfortable. easy to use...i have recommended these to other people who are professionals and they have purchased them....i need to get these in white too..EXCELLENT product.</li>
    <li> The tips where very hard plastic and did not stick well to clients&#x27; nails at all, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing them from here.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loves this also</li>
    <li> Great tips...but don&#x27;t shorten from wide end because that defeats the whole purpose of flare nails. First set fell off with in days so make sure that you prep nail bed well.</li>
    <li> good quality. not to thick, not to thin... not a long tip so if your looking for Jersey shore length these are not them..LOL... but my clients who wear them are happy.. like a medium length.</li>
    <li> Awesome Buy !!!! Fantastic customer service !!!! Beautifully packaged !!!!</li>
    <li> The nails came in sooner then I expected the nails are really good quality I love them I would totally recommend them an they&#x27;re a really good price</li>
    <li> Had an issue due to the fact that I did receive toe nail tips for some reason. But the company did work with me to ship out the correct nails. I now have my clear flare nail tips in hand. they are pretty nice quality for the price and you get so many of them so you can&#x27;t complain that much. also have to mention that after reaching out to them about getting the wrong shippment when I got my flare nails in the mail it came with a nice gift. They attached some nail stickers to it as well so that was a nice gesture.</li>
    <li> I got toe nail nails instead. NOT AT ALL HAPPY. They did issue me a refund.</li>
    <li> My nails aren&#x27;t clear there natural. And I ask for clear like showing in your picture</li>
    <li> I love them, but they&#x27;re hard to get glued on properly</li>
    <li> Nice especially if you have wide fingernail beds</li>
