      <li>It is the perfect color for my skin so far so good, but I have only used it once.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anywho, I really do enjoy this product for makeup on most occasions.</li>
      <li>This product is good if you don&#x27;t have much to cover up.  </li>
      <li>Pretty nice.</li>
      <li>and since this is New York that&#x27;s a good nine months</li>
      <li>This works great for my complexion, but a slightly lighter shade would be nice.</li>
      <li>I like the concept of bb cream because I like just a light coverage</li>
      <li>It is light like I am not wearing make up at all</li>
      <li>If you want light makeup, use it.</li>
      <li>Light covererage but is buildable.</li>
      <li>This is light and does even out my skin tones.</li>
      <li>Its perfect for the summer if you dont want to add all that make up on your face, and its also perfect for little girls or younger women who are beginners at make up and want a natural even glowing look.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d prefer better and more natural coverage.</li>
      <li>This product does give a dewy look which I think will be great for those with dry skin but for my combo/oily skin...</li>
      <li>This product does give a dewy look which I think will be great for those with dry skin but for my combo/oily skin...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good about not getting on clothes and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>It would be great for someone with dry skin though!</li>
      <li>well, she was right!</li>
      <li>Im pretty sure its the bb cream because i rarely get pimples.</li>
      <li>Not a fan of too much make up so this light coverage is great when I feel like being extra.</li>
      <li>I also mix between clinique, smashbox, loreal true match and this.  </li>
      <li>I wear L&#x27;oreal true match creme cafe for color comparison).</li>
      <li>I decided to try one more brand, Maybelline New York Dream Fresh BB Cream.</li>
      <li>I really like this product for light make-up.</li>
      <li>it will be Smashbox medium have fun</li>
      <li>This product is only good if you already have decent skin.</li>
      <li>This was the first American BB cream that I ever tried, and though I applaud Maybelline for having the widest range of color choices available, I can&#x27;t help but think there is something even better out there in the BB Cream world.</li>
      <li>Blends well with my skin and the price is right.</li>
      <li>Really nice fit for my dark island girl skin.</li>
      <li>I am an NC45 in MAC foundation, and this BB cream is a good 3 shades too dark; So, I tried</li>
      <li>I use this product daily and love it, so I decided to buy it online</li>
      <li>My biggest tip is that you should figure out your undertone first before purchasing.</li>
      <li>Love the texture, is very fluid</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is light and doesn&#x27;t make me sweat and also the shade &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34; which I bought because I am dark skinned is very true to shade.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I liked it, haha.</li>
      <li>The packaging was great and it was slightly cheaper than in my local stores.</li>
      <li>the consistence is wonder and dries well.. like the fast shipment</li>
      <li>I was really anticipating when Maybelline would release this BB creamt to us in the states.</li>
      <li>Also, it leaves my face really oily by the end of the day, which I do not like.</li>
      <li>Out of all of them, I really like how this BB cream brightens my face.  </li>
      <li>Fast and just one step.</li>
      <li>Oh well....i really DID like it though.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in my skin tone after application</li>
      <li>If you have acne, it is not going to do much in terms of covering it up.</li>
      <li>It does, however, apply evenly and provide better coverage than the other</li>
      <li>After many trips to walmart and other places I didn&#x27;t see it</li>
      <li>the BB cream is very easy to apply, it&#x27;s like putting on lotion cut my make-up applying time in half!</li>
      <li>I only use full coverage foundation when I want an all day look.</li>
      <li>but this cream makes my oily skin shine like a new penny by the end of the day!  </li>
      <li>I was trying to try something new, heard so much about bb creams.</li>
      <li>(I went with deep, when medium deep would probably have suited me better -</li>
      <li>Its okay but not a full coverage and not for the oily skin.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love this product and will definitely buy more in the near future.</li>
      <li>This has remarkable stay power and is light enough that I don&#x27;t think my skin is suffocating.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly a tinted moisturizer, I like it a lot since I don&#x27;t like heavy makeup.</li>
      <li>give them credit for such cute packaging and ease of use, but I don&#x27;t like it enough to warrant a second purchase.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin look natural!</li>
      <li>First I have to say that It is really tiny</li>
      <li>Looks good for a few hours then my face turns into a shiny mess.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it. If you want light makeup, use it. It makes my face glows and even. The only person that knows I was wearing anything on my face was my boyfriend.  If you have acne, it is not going to do much in terms of covering it up. Also, it leaves my face really oily by the end of the day, which I do not like. I&#x27;m just happy this really blends in with my skin tone. FInally!!</li>
    <li> Decent, extremely minimal coverage. You will have to blend excessively to get results.</li>
    <li> Its okay but not a full coverage and not for the oily skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mostly a tinted moisturizer, I like it a lot since I don&#x27;t like heavy makeup. I think its great, really light!!</li>
    <li> I am a 58 year old woman and have never been a big make up wearer. I am at the age where I&#x27;d like to brighten my skin, hide a few flaws, yet not look like I am applying makeup with a trowel.&lt;br /&gt;  This product is perfect for my needs. I have sallow tones in my skin and I bought the medium tone one. It blends in perfectly, not yellowing or chalky look.  Just a healthy moisturized appearance.</li>
    <li> I really love this bb cream. I wanted something to even out my skin and give me a dewy glow since I have dry skin. I also have the habit of getting foundation all over my clothes and I don&#x27;t have it with this. This has remarkable stay power and is light enough that I don&#x27;t think my skin is suffocating. It also matches to my skin nicely and it&#x27;s a good price too.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have been using it for over a year now. I use it for my daily beauty routine, it replaces the need for a foundation. I just use this and a little concealer and I&#x27;m good for the day. It&#x27;s perfect for summer days when you don&#x27;t want to have too much on and still want SPF protection.</li>
    <li> Excelent product... Love the texture, is very fluid so you don&#x27;t have to use too much of it, and it was carefully delivered on time... Completely recommended...</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and love it, so I decided to buy it online so I could get it automatically.  I ordered it just  before vacation and didn&#x27;t open it until time to go.  It was runny and about five shades darker than usual.  I had to go to a store an purchase another tube.  Really sorry this didn&#x27;t work out and even sorrier that I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Good colour selection.  As a nurse, I tried to limit my makeup.  This is light and does even out my skin tones.</li>
    <li> Really nice fit for my dark island girl skin.</li>
    <li> Love this one goes on very smooth</li>
    <li> I have tried the medium deep but it was too lite I hope to have better luck with this color .... the consistence is wonder and dries well.. like the fast shipment</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, you cannot even tell you have the product on and also I received the product in a timely fashion!</li>
    <li> I am a  Caramell color and I usually use Smashbox medium but for the summer I will be using this jeep because I usually got a slight sunshine and this color will be perfect for my summer but for the winter and since this is New York that&#x27;s a good nine months it will be Smashbox medium have fun</li>
    <li> I am an African American women with brown skin. This product works to add a little coverage, glow, and pore minimizing to skin. Do not expect it to coverage blemishes or pimples. The packaging was great and it was slightly cheaper than in my local stores. Plus I could not find deep in any other store.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect color for my skin so far so good, but I have only used it once.</li>
    <li> This is so perfect. It hydrates my face so well gives me an amazing glow, evens my skin tone, I mean it does absolutely everything it says! Its perfect for the summer if you dont want to add all that make up on your face, and its also perfect for little girls or younger women who are beginners at make up and want a natural even glowing look.</li>
    <li> This was the first American BB cream that I ever tried, and though I applaud Maybelline for having the widest range of color choices available, I can&#x27;t help but think there is something even better out there in the BB Cream world. The best way to describe the Dream Fresh BB is by calling it a tinted sunscreen. There is enough color in the product to keep it from making my face look ashy-white, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t eliminate blemishes and all those other things that it says it can do. It didn&#x27;t make my acne worse, but it certainly made my oily skin that much more greasy by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give them credit for such cute packaging and ease of use, but I don&#x27;t like it enough to warrant a second purchase.</li>
    <li> When I opened the tube I noticed the tint is slightly darker than I expected (I went with deep, when medium deep would probably have suited me better - I wear L&#x27;oreal true match creme cafe for color comparison). However, it doesn&#x27;t matter that much because the coverage is very thin.  It started to feel dry on my face and later I noticed flaking.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice. But I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in my skin tone after application</li>
    <li> First let me say, I am not a huge makeup person. With that said, this BB cream wasn&#x27;t as natural as I expected it to be. It&#x27;s very orange in tone, a little ashy and you definitely will notice that it is on your face. There&#x27;s also a slight shimmer to the BB cream. My biggest tip is that you should figure out your undertone first before purchasing. This BB cream wasn&#x27;t bad but I&#x27;d prefer better and more natural coverage.</li>
    <li> I picked up this item at my local drugstore as my 3rd try on a BB cream that would replace my missing Garnier Skin Renew BB cream, and it turned out to be just another disappointment.  I am an NC45 in MAC foundation, and this BB cream is a good 3 shades too dark; So, I tried the Medium/Deep shade- 2 shades too light! The cream doesn&#x27;t blend with the skin half as well as any other cream, so this alone made the cream unwearable. The cream is also very thick, thick enough to create the same &#x27;cakey&#x27; look as most heavy duty foundations. It does, however, apply evenly and provide better coverage than the other creams.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t bring myself to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. It didn&#x27;t even my skin tone, in fact it did not look like I had anything on at all it just looked like my natural skin.</li>
    <li> This product does give a dewy look which I think will be great for those with dry skin but for my combo/oily skin...I have to do some blotting. It does give a nice glow and whatnot. This is definitely great for the summer months because heavy foundation in the sumemr can be uncomfortable. I would repurchase but I think they should make the product bigger especially looking at how much it costs.</li>
    <li> Now i use to be a heavy makeup person and now with this bb cream its just what i was looking for and im obsessed...its so light and great coverage.Also it gives me that meagan goodglow i was looking for</li>
    <li> I was really anticipating when Maybelline would release this BB creamt to us in the states. After many trips to walmart and other places I didn&#x27;t see it so I went ahead and ordered it online. First I have to say that It is really tiny, I somehow thought it would be bigger than that. I like this product and it is a perfect match but listen to other people when they say it is more like a tinted moisturizer so if you have blemishes and all that you might have to use concealear to cover up the problematic spot. It is nothing like the Asian BB creams. I actually own one of them and wear it underneath my foundation as primer since it is way too light to wear by itself. This product does give a dewy look which I think will be great for those with dry skin but for my combo/oily skin...I have to do some blotting. It does give a nice glow and whatnot. This is definitely great for the summer months because heavy foundation in the sumemr can be uncomfortable. I would repurchase but I think they should make the product bigger especially looking at how much it costs.</li>
    <li> This product is good if you don&#x27;t have much to cover up.  I am of african american decent.  I use Mac NW 45 or NW 50.  I only put that because that helps me when I have read other reviews on make up products.  The color of the product is good for my complexion.  It does get oily after a while so you will need to set with a powder and use concealer if you have spots...</li>
    <li> the best love how i can wear it alone</li>
    <li> I really like this product for light make-up. I used it as a foundation instead of a tinted moisturizer. I only rated it 4 starts, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, but the directions do say to reapply every 2 hours.</li>
    <li> GOOD BB CREAM. I WILL BUY IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> I loveeee this product. I was a bit worrisome about the color being too dark, but it blends very well with my skin tone.It is very light almost as if I&#x27;m not worry makeup at all. You don&#x27;t really need a lot of it to cover your face and your neck just a little dab here and there, rub it in, and you&#x27;re ready to go. My only compliant is that it doesn&#x27;t conceal dark spots like how I want it to, so I had to go over my dark spots with my press powder. Other than that, I love this product and will definitely buy more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I got this based on reviews and gone back to get my 3rd tube. It works well for my skin and stays on.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and it makes my skin glow.  Would recommend this to anyone who needs some type of coverage that does not transfer when you touch your face.</li>
    <li> Love this bb cream it doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily or shiny and gives it a nice glow. The shipping was fast and cost a little less then what I pay for at the stores in my area. I reccomend this to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the girlfriend</li>
    <li> This bb cream is good if want even color and coverage for your face! it evened out the color of my face and gave me a dewy look too. i love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I only wear this as my make up instead of powder, and foundation. I will definitely buy again. It is light like I am not wearing make up at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy. And I didn&#x27;t like how it looked on my skin. Pretty awful. I whas disappointed. I don&#x27;t recommend it. I was trying to try something new, heard so much about bb creams. Well I wasn&#x27;t impressed by this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad there are a couple shade options for darker women. This works great for my complexion, but a slightly lighter shade would be nice. I find that medium tint is too light, and &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; is nice, but it could be just a TAD lighter. An inbetween shade and a darker shade would probably catch a lot more people, but I don&#x27;t work for Maybelline. I guess you can&#x27;t have it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I really do enjoy this product for makeup on most occasions. I only use full coverage foundation when I want an all day look. I apply the BB cream and then a setting powder because I don&#x27;t like the dewy look it gives. It&#x27;s pretty good about not getting on clothes and looks very natural. I&#x27;ve probably bought 3 or 4 of these from various retailers and so long as they don&#x27;t stop making it, I probably won&#x27;t stop buying it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a foundation.  I also mix between clinique, smashbox, loreal true match and this.  Out of all of them, I really like how this BB cream brightens my face.  It&#x27;s not full coverage but its just enough to do the trick and when I use concealer and powder, I&#x27;m all set.  My only complaint is the texture its just too runny almost like a water consistency.  If they could change this, I would be hooked.</li>
    <li> My BB cream tube actually came slightly open. I was truly upset by that. Next time I know to buy this product in store.</li>
    <li> Nice makeup probably the best BB Cream for a drug store bought brand.</li>
    <li> Not enough coverage. I don&#x27;t see anything amazing about this product.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of too much make up so this light coverage is great when I feel like being extra. Blends well with my skin and the price is right.</li>
    <li> This product is only good if you already have decent skin. It does not cover blemishes or pimples but it does help to even out tone.</li>
    <li> I was new to BB Creams and so tried a few to see which one will do for me. I almost abandoned the idea of using BB creams as they were heavy and made me sweat terribly. I decided to try one more brand, Maybelline New York Dream Fresh BB Cream. Ordered it off Amazon, tried it several times and the truth is you hardly know you have it on! Actually I watched a girl recommending it on Youtube that you could sleep with it on your face..... well, she was right! I like the fact that it is light and doesn&#x27;t make me sweat and also the shade &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34; which I bought because I am dark skinned is very true to shade. Makes my skin look natural! I am stuck with Maybelline and will discover more of their products!</li>
    <li> Looks good for a few hours then my face turns into a shiny mess. Way too oily and made me break out.</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash, I have sensative skin. stay away from this one</li>
    <li> I liked this product until I had an allergic reaction and my face broke out horribly. I had to see a dermatologist. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before. Other than that, I liked it, haha.</li>
    <li> the BB cream is very easy to apply, it&#x27;s like putting on lotion cut my make-up applying time in half!</li>
    <li> I like the concept of bb cream because I like just a light coverage but this cream makes my oily skin shine like a new penny by the end of the day!  I have to wear an expensive mattifying cream underneath it just to wear this cream.  It would be great for someone with dry skin though!</li>
    <li> Great product. Brightens my skin and leaves it nice and dewy. Light covererage but is buildable. I wear this to work almost everyday. Fast and just one step. Put on my mally mascara, lipbalm and im done.UPDATE: i have stopped using this product. I have started to break out in tiny pimples on my face. Im pretty sure its the bb cream because i rarely get pimples. Oh well....i really DID like it though.</li>
