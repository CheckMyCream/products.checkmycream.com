### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They are so great!</li>
      <li>I use the &amp;#34;face brush&amp;#34; for powder bronzer, i used the &amp;#34;contour brush&amp;#34; on my eyelid cream primer and the &amp;#34;eye brush&amp;#34; is perfect for blending eyeshadow on the crease.</li>
      <li>Really happy to have purchased this!</li>
      <li>The eye brush is the best I have ever used for blending shadow into the crease of the eyelid.</li>
      <li>Good brushes good value for money!!</li>
      <li>and now she is so happy with them</li>
      <li>If you want a very light application, these would be perfect.</li>
      <li>These caught my eye because they&#x27;re gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Good brushes have seen these at ULTA, cheaper here.</li>
      <li>They are good quality though.  </li>
      <li>Good deal and love using it for powder at the end!</li>
      <li>its so wonderful and soft.</li>
      <li>All of these brushes are great for a very well blended look!.</li>
      <li>I love love love love love these brushes &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like the a lot more.</li>
      <li>she read  alot of reviews and watch many videos on youtube</li>
      <li>feel like if these were just the slightest but more dense</li>
      <li>Would have preferred to have invested my money in more of the originals.  </li>
      <li>The application is okay</li>
      <li>They do blend rather well, that being said the face brush seems to be nothing more than a brush you&#x27;d set your foundation with.</li>
      <li>For those starting out with makeup, or just want to test out more brushes, these are amazing!!!</li>
      <li>All these brushes are very unique to me, and I have nothing like them in my collection, which is very rare for me to say!</li>
      <li>Really beautiful set of brushes and soooo soft.</li>
      <li>LOVE Real Techniques and this special set is as great as others.</li>
      <li>They are great brushes as far as the bristles and size and price</li>
      <li>The construction, like all real techniques brushes, is amazing and sturdy.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like them like I do the original RT brushes.</li>
      <li>The shadow brush is amazing for darker colors you want to apply more sheerly for a well blended look.</li>
      <li>I bought these brushes because i loved the basic  real technique i owned before ,, its ok</li>
      <li>Let me preface this by saying I love all my Real Techniques brushes.</li>
      <li>The only one I can use is the biggest one, Makes a good bronzer brush.</li>
      <li>Like all of the Real Techniques brushes, I love them.</li>
      <li>Im not a big fan of the eye brush but for the larger brush i use it for my blush and for the contour brush its just wonderful.</li>
      <li>Very good brushes for a heavy hand!</li>
      <li>I love the colors, very classy.  </li>
      <li>Great little brush set</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s smaller, because it makes applying blush easier at time when I want to be more precise.</li>
      <li>I wash all my brushes the same: organic soap and olive oil and then luke warm water.  </li>
      <li>but I have other real techniques brushes and they&#x27;ve always been great after I washed them.  </li>
      <li>has I tried them first.</li>
      <li>and i didnt know how to use the smaller one i might need to work with more to get used it</li>
      <li>Love these brushes, use them daily.</li>
      <li>I use these as my travel brushes-and they really are all you need!</li>
      <li>The eye brush is a little scratchy, but it&#x27;s nice for blending out colours in your crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it dont pick much product</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I really like the Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
      <li>Being a real techniques fan, as soon as I heard these were avaliable I wanted them.  </li>
      <li>On my daily basis is fantastic since they are a no brainer when i am in a hurry.</li>
      <li>I love this brush set so much that I bought a second one as a back up.  </li>
      <li>Pretty, soft, and work well.</li>
      <li>, it actually adds more color eve though duo fiber brushes usually sheer things out.</li>
      <li>No shedding, feel very soft, and have not lost their shape after continued use and washings.</li>
      <li>This set is quite a bit more expensive that the original</li>
      <li>I usually use the RT blush brush for powder, but that&#x27;s for when I want more powder on the face.</li>
      <li>They are soft.</li>
      <li>BUT it is true that the printed writing begins to rub off after a few uses.</li>
      <li>Apparently this is not the way to go with these.  </li>
      <li>I have most of the real techniques brushes, these were a bit disappointing.</li>
      <li>We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i bought this for my sister i personally did not use them so i dont know how is but she told me to give it a 5 star before she asked me to buy it for her she read  alot of reviews and watch many videos on youtube so finally i bought them for her and now she is so happy with them she cant stop wearing makeup just to use them</li>
    <li> LOVE Real Techniques and this special set is as great as others. Duo Fibers are designed to pick up the product and only apply a small amount on the skin. On my daily basis is fantastic since they are a no brainer when i am in a hurry. I use the &amp;#34;face brush&amp;#34; for powder bronzer, i used the &amp;#34;contour brush&amp;#34; on my eyelid cream primer and the &amp;#34;eye brush&amp;#34; is perfect for blending eyeshadow on the crease.</li>
    <li> I use these as my travel brushes-and they really are all you need!</li>
    <li> They are great brushes as far as the bristles and size and price BUT it is true that the printed writing begins to rub off after a few uses. Ive only used them 3 times and this happened. 😕</li>
    <li> Picked it up while my hands where wet and this happened.  I&#x27;m not sure if they are the really real techniques brushes or not. They are soft.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use them for powder product</li>
    <li> Good brushes have seen these at ULTA, cheaper here.</li>
    <li> Good deal and love using it for powder at the end!</li>
    <li> Really happy to have purchased this! I usually use the RT blush brush for powder, but that&#x27;s for when I want more powder on the face. Sometimes I want the glow from my foundation to show through, and I did not have a brush for that till now. All of these brushes are great for a very well blended look!. The middle brush I use for blush, because it&#x27;s smaller, it actually adds more color eve though duo fiber brushes usually sheer things out. But i like that it&#x27;s smaller, because it makes applying blush easier at time when I want to be more precise. The shadow brush is amazing for darker colors you want to apply more sheerly for a well blended look. Which I also have nothing like this as well. All these brushes are very unique to me, and I have nothing like them in my collection, which is very rare for me to say! For those starting out with makeup, or just want to test out more brushes, these are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Good brushes good value for money!!</li>
    <li> Pretty, soft, and work well. The bristles are a bit long for me</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, use them daily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I really like the Real Techniques brushes.  This set is quite a bit more expensive that the original but is duo fiber.  The application is okay but it does steal quite a bit of product and only applies a sheer amount.  Perhaps this is its purpose but I am not a fan.  Would have preferred to have invested my money in more of the originals.  They are good quality though.  No shedding, feel very soft, and have not lost their shape after continued use and washings.</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for a heavy hand!</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with RT brushes!</li>
    <li> Like all of the Real Techniques brushes, I love them. There was a video that one of the twins did about how to use the brushes and, If I remember correctly, they are to be used for blending, NOT to apply. That&#x27;s what I use them for. The small one for my eyes, the middle one for my blush and bronzer, and the other for my powder. They are so great!</li>
    <li> Really beautiful set of brushes and soooo soft.</li>
    <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
    <li> Great little brush set</li>
    <li> I love this brush set so much that I bought a second one as a back up.  The big brush works  extremely well with powder, especially the Urban Decay Naked loose powder.  The medium  contour brush  I have used with both  Urban Decay powdered blush and creme blush.  The eye brush is the best I have ever used for blending shadow into the crease of the eyelid. I only use Urban Decay eye shadows, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works with the formulas from other manufacturers.  I wash all my brushes after each use,  and unlike some other brushes I have owned, these never shed.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saying I love all my Real Techniques brushes. They&#x27;re among my favourite. These caught my eye because they&#x27;re gorgeous. There&#x27;s just something about the white handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this set just .. doesn&#x27;t call to me like my others. If you want a very light application, these would be perfect. They do blend rather well, that being said the face brush seems to be nothing more than a brush you&#x27;d set your foundation with. The contour brush is the highlight of this set, I have no complaints with it. The eye brush is a little scratchy, but it&#x27;s nice for blending out colours in your crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like if these were just the slightest but more dense I&#x27;d like the a lot more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about these but I don&#x27;t like them like I do the original RT brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because i loved the basic  real technique i owned before ,, its ok but it dont pick much product and i didnt know how to use the smaller one i might need to work with more to get used it</li>
    <li> I love love love love love these brushes &amp;#60;3 Oh my goodness its so wonderful and soft. Im not a big fan of the eye brush but for the larger brush i use it for my blush and for the contour brush its just wonderful. I definitely recommend these brushes ! Plus the color is perfection.</li>
    <li> Being a real techniques fan, as soon as I heard these were avaliable I wanted them.  I love the colors, very classy.  The construction, like all real techniques brushes, is amazing and sturdy.  BUT after washing the two small brushes, they lost a lot of their softness.  The medium sized one is actually a bit scratchy now.  I was soooo disappointed.  I wash all my brushes the same: organic soap and olive oil and then luke warm water.  Apparently this is not the way to go with these.  I think I&#x27;ll just spray the larger one with rubbing alcohol and wipe it down.  I&#x27;m not sure how, but I feel guilty, like I ruined these brushes...but I have other real techniques brushes and they&#x27;ve always been great after I washed them.  Such a shame!</li>
    <li> These brushes poke me I have most of the real techniques brushes, these were a bit disappointing. The only one I can use is the biggest one, Makes a good bronzer brush. Would not have purchased these has I tried them first.</li>
