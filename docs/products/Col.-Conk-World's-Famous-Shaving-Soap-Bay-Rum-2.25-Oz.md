<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smooth and light fragrance not bad.Lather up fine!</li>
    <li> I remember my father shaving with a straight razor and I find that I get a good shave using the old shaving mug and this soap, I get a better shave also, of course I use a safety razor but the shave is great and the razors last longer too</li>
    <li> I chose to switch from shaving jell because last couple of Gillette shaving jell cans last the pressure and I was stuck with a full unusable can. Therefore, I decided to go old school brush and soap. Did little research and learned that wet shaving is better for your skin, closer shave, less ingrown hair. Finally you get to use all your product that you pay for.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this brand out after a few recommendations from friends. It smoked the previous soap I was using. Creates more lather, the slight Bay Rum scent is great. Makes for a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 pack will last a long time. Since I started using the [[ASIN:B000NHSAVQ Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor - Open-#41- Made in Germany]] I now only have to shave every 2 days. Fast shipping, and great packaging as always!</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot to say here, just shaving soap and it lathers up well but I&#x27;ve also used Ivory soap and it worked just as well.  I gave it 4 stars because it is soap.</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice fragrance and creates a perfect lather for a wet shave.</li>
    <li> I am one of those dinosaurs that uses a shaving cup and brush to work up a good lather. This is very important to me as I am very fair complected, and using a razor will irritate my skin, especially if I am wearing a tie, or it is a very hot or blustery day.  Col. Conks Bay Rum soap makes a creamy very aromatic lather which makes shaving a dream.  The price is right, and it works as well or better than any other shave soap I have used.[[ASIN:B001OMVB38 Col. Conk World&#x27;s Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum * 3 - Pack * Each Net Weight 2.25 Oz]]</li>
    <li> I switched to straight edge shaving a couple of years ago and this is so far the best shaving soap I have ever used. After using this, you may wonder why the canned shaving creams are still legal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates a rich delightful lather. A pleasant scent without overpowering perfume. Just don&#x27;t rush it, take your time creating the lather with a good brush. Your face will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> I already had tried Col. Conk Bay Rum shaving soap. I already knew it was my favorite. So, when I needed more and saw that I could get 3 pieces for cheaper, it was a no-brainer. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of all the Col. Conk shave soaps. Always lathers well and makes for a great shave. 3 pack is the way to buy.</li>
    <li> I have used Col. Conk soaps for the past 9 months.  There are better soaps out there, but they will cost sufficiently more.  I would consider Col. Conk&#x27;s a \\&quot;utility soap\\&quot; that is economical and does the job just fine for daily shaving purposes.  The soaps loose their scents within a week or two, but I don&#x27;t expect too much for the price.  I don&#x27;t know of better options in this price range.</li>
    <li> The name just says old timey soap. Which is both reassuring in a sense, and scary as well. Like anything related to wet shaving, there is always a fear that because its an older technique its not as good as the modern products. Of course you wouldn&#x27;t be reading this if you weren&#x27;t already sold on the concept of wet shaving. This was my second soap.     The first being some soap that came with my first shaving kit. This had a much better lather and more of a scent. I was expecting(really fearing) a stronger scent, but its very mild and pleasant. The Rum scent will not make you smell like an alcoholic. Just a wise man who knows how to shave himself like a man.    For the alcoholic scent, you may need to buy the Col Conk bay rum after shave. Or for true alcoholics, Just apply Captn&#x27; Morgan or Malibu.</li>
    <li> With so many products disappearing over time, it&#x27;s really great knowing that this one hasn&#x27;t. Used to think that product \\&quot;P\\&quot; was great and then they discontinued it and started with product \\&quot;P\\&quot; in a tube until they discontinued it, except in Europe. Since shaving hasn&#x27;t gone out of style quite yet ... decided to give this one a \\&quot;go\\&quot; and wait for it to arrive. Well, my first purchase was almost one year ago and wouldn&#x27;t switch to anything else which is why I&#x27;ve stocked up. Speaking of that, with the packaging technique, it&#x27;ll store in a cool dry place really well. This IS \\&quot;THE\\&quot; product for every man ... maybe women too, but don&#x27;t tell them. ~:-}</li>
    <li> The best shaving soap!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for my husband for the last few months and we saw what a great deal amazon.com had to offer instead. The product is excellent, the shipping was beyond fast, and the price of the product and shipping is well worth it all. We will continue to purhcase these products online through amazon.</li>
    <li> I switched from Gilette products earlier this year (2014).  Previously, I was using gel with aloe vera and other sensitive skin formulas and in spite of that I still consistently had razor burn...and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience shaving with Colonel Conk&#x27;s Shaving Soap was like an epiphany.  It is a remarkably different shaving sensation and is unbelievably smooth.  The glycerin lubrication is awesome.  My shaving process or preparation was the same as before (showering first, then shaving immediately afterward), but the experience was totally different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasing, but above all the shave quality is above and beyond anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.  The chronic razor burn of the past is non-existent now.  The only time I get razor burn now is if I use an old razor and/or don&#x27;t shower first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last a good while, too.  I use a badger brush and shave every three days, and it took me from March until nearly October to go through the first &amp;#34;puck.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of great shaving tutorials online nowadays with a resurgence of interest in classic shaving techniques and products.  Mixing up a good lather is fun, and easy, and it really doesn&#x27;t add that much time to any shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get excited about a product I like to share, so I bought these for my dad, who was blown away after trying mine while visiting.  Shaving was never a comfortable experience for him until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor.  Get these.</li>
    <li> Husband likes this soap. He&#x27;s tried two other brands but he&#x27;s not picky.  It was a great deal for 3 of them. He&#x27;s set for over a year now.</li>
    <li> Anybody who does not shave using a brush and lather is crazy.  Reasons:  1.) Any of the shaving creams and bars seem to work as well as a creams in the can.  2.) The brush applies the cream to your face.  In the can, you have to smear it with your fingers and wash your hands.  3.) A single shaving bar will last you four to six months; the can will last 4 to 6 weeks.   4.) A shaving bar is much more ecologically sound  and stable than the can, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking over the soapdish, which holds the bar.  5.) You don&#x27;t have to worry about white foam left in your ear....  6.) a shaving brush lasts forever, as does the bar, saving you lots of money.                                                                                     Now some tips:  I&#x27;ve read all the reviews on all the shaving soaps.  The few that I&#x27;ve tried all seem to work about the same. Many manufacturers would have us believe that the recipes for shaving cream are carefully guarded secrets. However, the secrecy revolves mostly around the quantities in which standard ingredients are used, and the choice of substitutes for the few ingredients that are variable. If you want to see the history and how these are made, go to [...] .  So I decided to buy American.  When I compared weight to cost, I chose Creamo.  Unfortunately, it is mostly water, and lasts about a month.  So I recommend the solid  shaving bars, and buy a soapdish from Wal-Mart to put it in.  Colonel Conk World&#x27;s Famous SUPER BAR Shaving Soap, Manumission Skin Care Shave Gel, [...]  ,  [...]   , [...] , and probably many  others have American made products. Why send your money overseas, just for a  Name?  If any of you other companies manufacture shaving bars here in the USA, please note this in \\&quot;comments\\&quot;.  Buy any natural, good shave brush. Don&#x27;t waste your money on those fancy shaving containers. The lids often don&#x27;t have handles, and the Walmart stuff works as well. I also bought a cheap tooth brush carousel, witha metal top, with some large holes, and cut out just enough of one of the larger holes for the shaving brush handle to fit in. I place my toothbrush, razor, and shaving brush in it, and the collector, at the base of the carousel, catches any drips from those 3 items.   You can buy a Burma Shave brush, a puck of Williams Shaving Bar, and Personna razors from Wal-Mart .  Wah-lah!  You are set for the best shaving experience.</li>
    <li> These is an excellent shaving soap with an amazing scent. I have noticed that the bars are a bit on the small side but still will last a very long time since I don&#x27;t shave everyday. I wish they sold all types of products, body soap, shampoo, etc., in that scent. It is delicious. I originally went with making the foam in a mug but have switched to making the foam directly on my face which I feel is more efficient (less to clean up). I definitely recommend this for anyone, safety razor user or not.</li>
    <li> I had bought one, then bought a three pack when I needed to replace it! I love the subtle smell and ease of working up a lather.  Makes me feel fresh every time I shave.</li>
    <li> Using a brush and cup to make a warm, soothing lather makes the morning shave civilized. Col. Conk&#x27;s soap is mildly fragrant and it makes a rich lather.  Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> This product performs well it has a nice lather and lasts a long time. And a plus is no Aluminum in the mixture.</li>
    <li> Great scent, fine lather, leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I love it. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, because I suffer from that problem myself.</li>
    <li> As others have said this soap builds a good lather quickly. The scent is not strong, and does not linger. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Until now the only shaving cream/soap that I have used have been from a can (Barbasol, Gillette, etc) and some regular glycerine soap from the grocery. This is much nicer with a great subtle scent that is masculine. It gives a great glide and nice lather when used with a quality badger brush (I purchased the Tweezerman, which has also been great). As previous reviewers have posted, there is the smell of wet dog/animal (badger I guess in this case) with the new brush, but it seems to be fading. This is also my first experience with DE shaving, and it has been great! A bit slower, but nice ritual and experience!</li>
    <li> The soap has an awful smell, it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well either, I would never consider purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 different brands of shaving soaps and 3 different cremes.  Colonel Conk&#x27;s provides the smoothest shave out of all of them.  I haven&#x27;t tried any scent other than the Bay Rum - which I absolutely love.  Normally I&#x27;m more of a citrus scent guy but, when I was preparing to buy my first Conk&#x27;s a few months ago, it was more expensive so I went with the Bay Rum.  So glad I did - the scent is just the best.</li>
    <li> Hard to lather up and doesn&#x27;t really smell of bay rum</li>
    <li> Since getting frustrated with TSA throwing my cans of shave cream in the trash, I have been searching for the perfect shave soap.  The Col. Conk line of soaps are all good and I think the Bay Rum has the best scent.  The three pack provides the best value.  Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell this shave soap in regular drug stores.  Builds a good lather quickly.  Great shave soap.  I use this soap exclusively when traveling.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap before from Amazon and I needed another supply. So, I went back to Amazon and ordered another batch. The product came quickly and, like before, it performs as I expected. The lather is quite full and makes shaving a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I do my entire head daily.  Works well as both a wet lather or as a thin, dryer lather.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the recipient loves the Col. Conk&#x27;s Shaving Soap. I have purchased some of these before.</li>
    <li> This is great soap.  It&#x27;s rich in glycerin for a smooth shave and works up a good lather that does not collapse too quickly. I especially enjoy the scent.  The bay rum is subtle but noticeable.  I like to pair it with a bay rum aftershave for a depth of scent that won&#x27;t overwhelm.  I like colonel conk&#x27;s bay rum, but pinuad makes a great and affordable bay rum aftershave as well, which goes very well with this soap.</li>
    <li> The smell is real good and i like it.</li>
    <li> Best bar shaving soap I have used.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers great.  It lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;And my wife likes the smell of it, a win win.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving using the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; method for many years and was using a different brand of bay rum shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they stopped making it and I was &#x27;forced&amp;#34; to use other shaving soap with &amp;#34;foofey&amp;#34; aromas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;until I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; Col. Conk&#x27;s bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the soap cake is perfect for fitting into a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; shaving mug I have, and it lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also mention that getting it through Amazon is a bargain, compared to prices of other brands.</li>
    <li> The soap lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.  The scent is awesome!  Smells like a good spiced rum and bay.</li>
    <li> bought the 3 pack from amazon, shipping was horribly slow.  product is excellent, i&#x27;ve been straight razor shaving for a year and mix up lather in a cup with soap and brush....  tried the amber first, was very hard to lather.....but the bay rum is easy to lather and looks like a hockey puck bar of soap....  it lasts a really long time too...\  smells terrific, not too strong at all.  on a side note, if your looking to switch from a mach with 15 blades (they must be upto that many now)......try straight razor shaving....it is by far the best shave ever and makes you feel more manly than you can imagine. but beware! there is a STEEP learning curve, do some research and please go slowly, you will bleed, possibly alot but after ahwile you zip through it if you stay with it..  ;)</li>
    <li> Good value. I would only order the single soap.  Order the Three-Pack, and you&#x27;re likely to still get only one.  (Happened to me...)</li>
    <li> I used a brush and soap bowl for many years before being seduced to the dark side of squirt cans and expensive, thick goopy shave cremes in tubes. I finally had enough and got a Col. Conk shave bowl and soap, and I will never go back. First, just the idea of whipping up warm wet lather for shaving makes an otherwise boring chore fun. Second, unlike gluey products from tubes, soap from bowls rinses cleanly from razor and face. Third, it gives a wonderful close shave with no irritation. Cans are a lot cheap, but money isn&#x27;t everything. I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody looking for a return to our roots and an opportunity to slow life down a little and enjoy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son because he&#x27;s allergic to everything.  He loves this and is all he uses now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Col Conks for a number of years. It gives a very nice shave and the bay rum smells like barber shops did back when straight shaves were legal. My only objection is the price, it&#x27;s just a bar of soap, it should be priced like a bar of soap not 10X the price.</li>
    <li> These three little soap cylinders, I could tell you will last a few yrs.  I&#x27;ve been using one for a few months now without the soap disintegrating on me, I&#x27;m not even half through the soap yet!  It&#x27;s a great product that lathers really well, just need to add the correct amount of water for that rich lather to build up!  The soap itself has no smell which is good for me, but they do have different flavors of soaps you could purchase.</li>
    <li> Lathers great, but the scent is nearly undetectable, not noticeable at all after the shave. Much different from the experience in my younger days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better success with Woodsprite Organic Body&#x27;s Bay Spice Organic Shea Butter Shaving Soap. It also has a wonderful scent which it&#x27;s more noticeable and lasts much longer even after the shave. It&#x27;s much more expensive, however.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff.  Shaving soap has two purposes: softening the beard and lubricating the skin so the razor can slide easily.  When applied with a good quality shaving brush this soap more then fulfills those tasks.  In addition the fragrance is quite nice.  I recommend this soap to all my friends and have purchased it as a gift for others.</li>
    <li> Great smell lathers well and all for a good price. I have tried the other scents too which are just as good but bay rum is my favorite.</li>
    <li> The lather is weak holds little moisture, and bars don&#x27;t last long if you shave more than once a month!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that works for me right now without getting razor bumps!  I&#x27;ve used other products, this is the best!</li>
    <li> If you have not tried Col. Conk Shave soap, you should.  Glycerin based it is easy to use as is right from the container it comes in, or like me easy to melt in the microwave to fill out into my soap / lather bowel.  They offer several blends of this, I prefer the Bay Rum.  The scent is not overpowering, mild so as to complement an aftershave, or not interfere with it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers up very well, and provides a very nice shave experience as it lays down a moisturizer for your whiskers, and slick base over which the blade can glide.  Once you try this soap you will order it again, the three pack makes a great option to purchase them at a much lower price than the single pack.  They do have an expiration date, but that is a two year shelf span and although these last a long time (about four months per pack, shaving four times per week) you will go through them all within that time - they make excellent gifts as well so you will not be wasting either product or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a down side - the glycerin base does leave a film in the sink, even with hot water rinse.  Once a week I just dampen my sink, and use some hand soap to clean it all away, I should note that bar soap &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34; leaves a similar residue so do not take away the impression this is unique to  Col. Conk products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a repeat user of Col. Conk, and the Bay Rum soap in particular - if someone is a repeat customer that should say a lot.</li>
    <li> 1 star off for not using recyclable plastic packaging.  Granted this is minimal packaging, but still...  Great product, good lubricating lather and smells good without being overpowering or cloying.</li>
    <li> I love this shave soap! I&#x27;ve tried multiple products from creams to oils. This one is the best I&#x27;ve found! I apply the soap with my shave brush, after I apply a little bit of pre-shave oil, from the art of shaving. The soap alone would be fine but I have extremely sensitive skin, especially on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;The bay rum smells great and if you order the 3 pack, it will last you a long long time. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months now and I haven&#x27;t even used a 1/4 of my first bar.</li>
    <li> I have used shaving soap off and on for over 50 years. I have used many brands some of which I guess are no longer manufactured. Col. Conk is my favorite, it lathers very well and does not dry to fast when applied to the face. I would recommend this soap to anyone. And by the way, it&#x27;s economical.</li>
    <li> I have used Col Cronks Bay Rum for several years at home and when traveling. It creates a nice lather and does not dry out my skin. It goes right into your carry on for airport travel.</li>
    <li> I reverted to shaving with a safety razor some time ago.  I also switched from shaving cream in a can to a mug and brush.  I tried two of the shaving soaps still available at local drug stores, but I was disappointed by their poor lathering and run-of-the-mill scents.  I finally tried Col Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum Shaving Soap and have been using it now for about two years.  The scent is pleasant but not overpowering, it lathers great, and a bar lasts a long time.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for old-time quality and value.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal i&#x27;ve found so far when it comes to these shaving soaps. Will absolutely purchase from here again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers up really good. Son has gotten into shaving now and loves this soap as well.  Highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap has a subtle scent, not over powering. This soap makes excellent an lather with a good brush.</li>
    <li> Nice quality soap with a mild fragrance.  Lather&#x27;s easily and does a great job with my shave, will never go back to spray foam.  Ever.</li>
    <li> The smell of Col. Conk - Bay Rum,is FANTASTIC! Works up a great lather without an incredible amount of work. I gave it 4 stars because of the post shave. Do not shave once you have made a single swipe, as there will not be a slick remaining and you will most likely cut yourself.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  He really likes this brand and has tried several different scents.  He&#x27;ll be getting refills in his Christmas stocking, for sure!</li>
    <li> Good sent not overwhelming and I buy mostly unscented items.  Lathers well and makes for an easy glide for the razor.</li>
    <li> I was looking for another brand of shaving soap that was natural that used to get, when I found out it was discontinued, and the prices way to high for soap, I decided to look else where. The only one thing I really wanted from a shaving soap is that \\&quot;Bay Rum\\&quot; smell. I came across Col. Conk&#x27;s. The price is right, the ingredients are great, it has the right smell(you can even this soap offered in other scents). I purchased it. At first it reminded me a lot of the \\&quot;soap on a rope\\&quot; that my older brother got every x-mas just by the size and shape, but that was it. Shave time! It lathers great and feels great on my face, rinses off clean and smells wonderful(not strong at all)! I really love this shaving soap! I really recommend a badger brush, but boar bristle will work in a pinch, to get the most from this soap. The first time I bought one bar, now I buy the 3 packs and share them.</li>
    <li> I was expecting these shaving soaps to smell as they were advertised like Bay Rum,.These had a funky off smell...to the point that I ended throwing them all away</li>
    <li> Excellent shave soap. Works well for a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these</li>
    <li> I am a complete convert to \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving soap. No more will I use shave cream dispensed from a can.  I have even given up using Kiss My Face pump-dispensed shave cream.  Not only is it emotionally soothing to take a few moments to whisk up a nice head of foam, the actual shave you get from this product is second to none.</li>
    <li> For the shaving soap aficionado, this is not the best, but certainly makes good lather.  These soaps are not hard milled, therefore, while they make fine, thick lather, they don&#x27;t last as long as a hard milled shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  I could never stand the sticky feeling left over from conventional shaving cream or gel and during my time in the Army it was totally useless in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lets me shave with soap and does not dry out my skin.  Not exactly sensitive but no point in looking like you have mange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great lather, nice shave.</li>
    <li> Great shave solid with a great smell</li>
    <li> While always willing to try new things to discover a better shave in terms of closeness and lack of irritation, not to mention value, I haven&#x27;t come across the product yet to knock Col. Conk from my favorite status.  Whether used with a pre-shave oil or not, safety razor or disposable, the Col. teamed up with a good quality brush are the team to beat.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years. They lather well and last a reasonable period of time. I will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> But this is a pretty weak soap.  doesn&#x27;t provide the cushion i get from higher priced soaps.  Good for the price, but I&#x27;ll spend more on better products in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great. makes food lather.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving.  And worse yet, I can never find mug soap at stores anymore.  But, Thank You CONK BAY RUM SHAVING MUG SOAP.  I love shaving with this soap.  It&#x27;s smooth on my skin, like a silk mask.  The smell is very pleasant and my old razor shaves like new.  Don&#x27;t ever, ever, stop selling this mug soap.  It&#x27;s the best.  I use the soap in my Old Spice mug.  Another long gone favorite.  Shaving is good for me now.  No more skipping shaving.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Lathers well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and have been happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered from this company a few times, quick turn around.</li>
    <li> Great lather, good smell. These are the little bit smaller pucks of Col. Conk, but they fit in my shaving mug just fine, and seem to last a good long time.</li>
    <li> I used to buy expensive shave soap.  When that price went to over $30,  I tried this it works, gets the job done.  I&#x27;ve ordered twice and will continue.</li>
    <li> great buy and its my favorite stuff. Works well and smells awesome. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Better than canned.shave cream!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the soap yet, but the soap is large and could last me 5 years.  The shipping was good. The price was good.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff overall.  I expected a little more scent, and have noticed that the consistency of the foam is thinner that others I&#x27;ve purchased. Having said that, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - so I  can&#x27;t complain, and I felt that the price was fair.</li>
    <li> I only have the basic Van der Hagen to compare to, but I like this soap better after just one shave. It seemed like it lathered better and had a more pleasant scent.  I really enjoy the bay rum scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently went back to old school and really haven&#x27;t experimented  to much with the different brands but this is tried and true and works for me.</li>
    <li> Its good. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as Williams but gives a good shave. It doesn&#x27;t have as thick a lather and won&#x27;t last as long as Williams.</li>
    <li> This is becoming an annual Christmas stocking stuffer gift, my husband loves these for shaving.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Lathers well and the scent is nice but not overpowering.  Microwaving for a few seconds in the mug melts it and never have any loss when adding a new cake.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am always satisfiedwith the performance and results. I think you will like it also.</li>
    <li> I do not personally like it, I don&#x27;t use it. The recipient likes it, it is a good soap. I don&#x27;t know about World Famous, but most make the same claim. World famous chili, world famous ribs, world famous chicken...and nobody in the world ever heard the claim except those marketing it, eh?</li>
    <li> I have used other brands before, someone recommended to try Col Conk&#x27;s and let me tell you it is like going from a compact car to a Lincoln.  Great lather it feels so good when you apply it on your face for shaving,  you to will enjoy shaving when using this product.</li>
    <li> Quick order fulfillment and excellent product! I have used this product for 3 years for shaving - its economical and inexpensive</li>
    <li> Did not smell like rum at all....dunno what they were thinking, unless I got a bad batch?  Not taking another chance with this product.</li>
    <li> great product!! i tried a different shave soap for a little bit and i regret it. so glad i found this three pack!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as part of  a set for his birthday. He recently decided to start using solid shaving soap and I also got him a boar bristle brush and a mug. This soap smells really good in a classic manly way. I love it. He does too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Rich lather for the brush shaver. Great aroma permeates a mans bathroom. Provides great, old fashioned shaving enjoyment. Costs a lot less per shave than those messy, unsatisfying foams or gels.</li>
    <li> title says it all can&#x27;t go wrong with the colonel. but soaps are personel what one person like&#x27;s another won&#x27;t personally i like</li>
    <li> Great soap and great subtle smell.  Excellent shave.  Excellent feeling after the shave. I would give five stars, but its a smaller container than I was expecting.  My brush barely fit &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; the container to work up a lather.  Probably best if you put the round puck into a different (larger) container for use.</li>
    <li> I up picked the travel version of this because I recently started shaving with a double-edge razor, and wanted to continue using mug soap and a brush. Col. Conk&#x27;s travel soap seemed like the way to go. The actual shave experience is all pretty good - the bay rum scent was pleasing, it lubricated the blade well enough, and I had no problems achieving a decent lather. My first shave with this soap was in New York. I noticed that it didn&#x27;t want to rinse cleanly, and suspected that maybe it was the local water. So, I tried it at home, and had the same result (I&#x27;m used to Detroit water, and the water here is pretty soft.) I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever buy this for home use, and I might purchase a different brand for travel (not because it&#x27;s bad...  it&#x27;s just not great.)  Over all, I think I like Van Der Hagen&#x27;s Luxury shave soap more.  About the same price, same experience, but it rinses off way easier.</li>
    <li> great shave soap; not too overpowering; makes good lather for a comfortable shave; long lasting</li>
    <li> Been shaving w/ a DE razor for almost 2 years now.  I have tried a few different shave soaps.  I have fairly sensitive skin, so I need something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and suds up nicely.  This does both, while having a nice, but far from overwhelming scent.  And a damn good price for 3 shave pucks as well.  If you&#x27;re reading this review, you prolly are buying anyway.  Just do it.  C&#x27;mon.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. After using the soap, your skin feels smooth and refreshed. The bay rum smells great.</li>
    <li> Good scent and rich lather. Thus far, it is my favorite shaving soap. I&#x27;ve tried Williams and Van Der Hagen glycerin (which is my second favorite).</li>
    <li> This is the umpteenth time I&#x27;ve reordered this, so you know it&#x27;s good.  The Bay Rum scent is very masculine, The shaving soap lathers well and promotes a close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Col. Conk Bay Rum Shaving Soap on several occasions now and it has become my favorite. It lathers well and has a good scent when being brushed on. The smell is not so strong as to interfere with one&#x27;s choice of aftershave.</li>
    <li> Great scent great lather. Have been using the stuff for years.  Nothing like it.</li>
    <li> I think what I love best about Col. Conk&#x27;s shaving soaps is the fact that spreads evenly across my face and give me a close clean shave. The bay rum scent is a nice pick-me-up in the morning. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Quality product - I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> everything was as advertised.  no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I says I need 14 more words so I will make up stuff. One more.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap is the best. I have been using this product for some time now.</li>
    <li> This is a great Shaving soap. I purchased both the Colonel&#x27;s Bay Rum and The Lime scented Glycerin soaps to see which I would like better. The Bay Rum is very nice and the lather is very slippery which makes for a comfortable shave. The lime is also very nice but the Bay Rum is much nicer in my opinion. Both scents have a slightly citrus odor which smells clean and fresh but the Bay Rum is a little more Manly. However, I often allow my wife to use my DE Safety razor to shave her legs and She likes the Lime scented soap because it has a very Gender Neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t clash with her other lotions and perfumes. So in the end I am glad I purchased both.</li>
    <li> Nice mild scent, real rich lather buying again</li>
    <li> Good lather and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have bought these before and loved them. The soap smells good and lathers well.</li>
    <li> My go-to shaving soap for years now - love the easy foaming and wife likes the smell :-)</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the world&#x27;s greatest shave soap.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Pretty much the standard for quality shaving soap at a good price, you can use this soap to shave just about every part of your body.</li>
    <li> This soap is ok for the price. It lathers well enough and works as a shave soap. The scent is weak so if your wanting a lasting scent look elsewhere. All in all its ok for the price. For myself if were looking for a low end soap I would spend a little bit more and get the Van der Hagen luxuay.</li>
    <li> Quality shave soap, lasted a long time and did the job. It was exactly what I was looking for in a soap.</li>
    <li> Good lather, nice scent, but not overpowering. Much better than the cheap stuff I could sometimes find at local drug store. Last a long time!</li>
    <li> Love the lather and mild scent.  A hot later shave is one thing that makes getting up and at &#x27;em liveable.</li>
    <li> Good price for a three pack, ordered for my dad, it&#x27;s his favorite shave soap.</li>
    <li> The Bay Rum scent is pleasant and has the &#x27;old barber shop&#x27; vibe, lathers well and provides for a close shave. I&#x27;m bald so I have more area to shave than most people (men anyway).</li>
    <li> IF YOU BUY A SHAVE SET YOU SHOULD INVEST IN THE EXTR SOAP TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED USE OF THE SHAVE SET</li>
    <li> I got this to try in a few ways.  I have used it in conjunction with my TOBS Jermyn Street shave cream to add a little glycerine and alone as I travel.  It has worked pretty well in addition to the TOBS, but alone, the lather isn&#x27;t super thick.  I can get a good lather, but it&#x27;s not nearly as thick as a shave cream.  I have pretty good shaves with it, but not spectacular like with a cream.  I do like to travel with it because it is small enough to pass through the TSA requirements.  Overall, the shave is better than with the gel I used to use, but not as good as the shave creams I&#x27;ve tried.  The smell may not be for everyone, but I really like it.  The Bay Rum is a very distinctive smell and to me it&#x27;s a very manly smell, but I can see why it&#x27;s too strong for some users.  Overall, I would recommend it because it&#x27;s better than the mass market gels, but if you&#x27;re looking for the absolute best shave, this probably isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> first shaving soap i&#x27;ve used, so i have no comparison, but i do enjoy it over shaving cream. smell is nice without being overwhelming and i haven&#x27;t had any trouble working up a usable lather.</li>
    <li> Value priced and great quality. It does the job of higher priced &amp;#34;mall brands&amp;#34; at a fraction of the cost. Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and lathers up very well.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely and the scent is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Smell good and lather well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the lather of these soaps and I love the smell.  Yummy! Jadene Stensland</li>
    <li> Absolutely  Excellent ...&lt;br /&gt;This produces a thick luxurious foam.&lt;br /&gt;Consequently paired with the correct badger brush and shaving technique.&lt;br /&gt;You will have a face as smooth as a babies butt.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it with a safety razor with a Bluebird blade.</li>
    <li> Not too shabby. Good lather, and a nice barbershop fragrance. Wish it was a little stronger, but I&#x27;ll still give it 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Good lather, easy on the face, good moderate scent.  As mentioned by others, use a good shaving mug and, when the current soap gets low, just drop another one in, microwave for 15-30 seconds depending on power, and it will melt together.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!  Feels great. Great Packaging!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ha Conk a conk chonk conk conk ka.  Jim Morrison</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen soaps costing 4 times as much, and I cannot justify spending $25 or more on a cake of shaving soap, can you? This stuff lathers well, is easy on the face, softens my manly beard, and smells terrific (Bay Rum).  That&#x27;s about all I can think of to write about shaving soap... :)</li>
    <li> I have had an old shaving brush and soap jar for years and really only used them until the initial soap ran out and went back to shaving cream. After finishing the last can of the four pack edge from costco I thought I&#x27;d give it one more try - it&#x27;s a lot lees expensive and provides 3-4 times the shaves as 4 cans of the large size edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it works very well, has a great old school smell that&#x27;s not overpowering or lasts really at all after your done shaving, foams up fairly well (four star) and works as good as any foam I have ever used  - 35 yrs of experience here! I think it&#x27;s important to have a high quality Badger Bristle brush -I&#x27;ve had mine for 35 years and was my fathers before hand - it&#x27;s probably 60 years old - and it has every bristle still intact - the good brush is critical in getting a good lather for the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the three pack - when I&#x27;m on the last one I know to re-order, which I have. The come individually packaged so they stay fresh and dry - only downside is they are not very travel friendly- the typical soap jar doesn&#x27;t have a lid and would create a bit of a mess in the shave bag - so a small can of shaving cream still has some value there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real men use a razor - just ask a woman.</li>
    <li> The Good: I love this shaving soap and will continue to buy.  Its a great deal price-wise and since it&#x27;s a three pack, it lasts for quite a while.  I shave every day and one bar lasts for well over a month.  The soap itself foams up nicely with a little while and a brush and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean after my shave.  There is no need to wash your face after you shave like with a chemical gel.  I have never tried the different &amp;#34;favors&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m sure they are all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  The only problem is that even though it comes in a plastic container, you will need to pop it out and put it in a cup.  The plastic container simply doesn&#x27;t serve as good shaving cup, though it might in a pinch if you are traveling.  This is a very minor point, however, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the Col. Conk line of soaps.  As much as I love bay rum, however, I felt like I got a slicker shave out of the amber scented soap.  Still a really good soap though.</li>
    <li> Great shave smells great too. I was pleased with this product the seller and my whole experience with this product. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice transaction. Liked the product</li>
    <li> I love the scent, kind of a traditional barber shop smell, but not overly strong or flowery.  I&#x27;ll be interested to try the almond one too.  I use a bowl to mix my lather, I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work trying to do it directly on your face.  I melted mine for 15-20 seconds in the microwave and poured it into a small plastic storage container with a screw-on lid, which is much easier to use and keep clean than the package it comes in.  Makes a decent lather that holds on long enough to get a shave.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth but not greasy and rinses off easily with cold water.    I deducted two stars from the rating because there are no ingredients listed on the packaging anywhere, and the company doesn&#x27;t make it easy to find (couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere on their website either).  These days with increased sensitivity to the chemicals we soak into our bodies through our skin, it&#x27;s really not okay in my opinion that an American company that makes shaving soap would not proudly display the ingredients of their products on the package.  Seriously, I&#x27;d rate this a 5 star product if I knew what I was putting on my face...    If anyone from the company is reading this, I&#x27;d happily buy a shaving soap/cream from a company that is completely non-toxic and doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli!</li>
    <li> Good lather, nice scent, good price, arrived quickly.  Nothing bad to say about this product.  I use a safety (double edged) razor and have so for years now.  This soap works very well with that discipline.</li>
    <li> very good just what i ordered  Has a good fragrance and lathers extremely well will order again when I run out</li>
    <li> This is my go to shaving soap.  Use it for travel and at home.  Nothing else, touches my grizzly face!!  Makes the best lather, I have ever known.  I am very partial to the Bay Rum.  Manly smell and my lady loves it!</li>
    <li> Really like the fragrance of old fashion Bay Rum.  Also appreciate the generous lather produced by the soap.  Brings back that real shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Lathers well,lasts,and get a good shave..Will buy this product again when I run low.Good buy for the money and smells good.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3-stars because of the price.  It is the most expensive shaving soap.  That said, it is also the best, better than say Burts Bees.  At $5.50 a pbar this is pricey.  Next time I will buy two Urban Cowboy.  Not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it works great for me</li>
    <li> The soap will give you a quality shave. It has a nice pleasent smell. Capable of working a good lather and the soaps should last you awhile.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, it&#x27;s quite subtle and reminds you of the good old days.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to figure out how to get a good lather from shaving soap. I ended up using a shaving cup to whisk up a lather from this soap and it was rich and creamy like I desired. The resulting shave was the smoothest I&#x27;ve ever had. I definitely recommend this soap. It&#x27;s great quality for a great deal.</li>
    <li> The soap meets all expectations.  Good lather and love the fragrance.  I would buy it again when I need shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Like most glycerin soaps, the lather is decent but not great. However it does lather well in mildly hard water and the scent is excellent for a bay rum with out being too strong. I also am sensitive to a lot of citrus scents and this bay rum does not irritate my skin. It is a great base as well for a &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; lather.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of the same product. I am completely happy with it. Good lather, nice scent.</li>
    <li> Better than what you get in a can, but way below the higher end products. The price is definitely right. If you are on a budget, get this and some cheap pre-shave oil. Heat the oil up with your girlfriend&#x27;s hair dryer, then apply to your wet face, then give a good once over with this soap, and enjoy a decent shave that your grandfather would envy.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is my zen time, my quiet time, my peace time, my reflective-introspection time, my 15 minutes. If you feel the same way, learn to shave correctly, and take your time. This product can help you get there without spending a ton.</li>
    <li> Its col. Conk. Smells great, rich lather, non irritating, arrived on time, and melts quickly in the microwave. Try it out. If you don&#x27;t like it, there are other brands. This is my favorite is this but other options like tayor of old bond street might also  interest you.</li>
    <li> I have used the Lime - Col. Conk as well, and it did do as well in my opinion, than the Bay Rum. This is great shaving soap. It lathers really well, I end up using less, which means money in my pocket. I will definitely order this again. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because- I reserve that for items that really impress me and are new.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers up well and its smell is mild and pleasant.  I can&#x27;t wait to try different Col Conk shaving soaps.</li>
    <li> I shave daily, and one of these little bars of shaving soap lasts several months, and is infinitely more satisfying to use than traditional shaving cream. I use a regular old Gilette razor, as a daily shave (don&#x27;t have the time to do a straight razor or even safety razor on workdays) and this really is a nice little treat. Can&#x27;t say enough positives about it. They also have a nice little travel one too that you can throw in your dob kit.</li>
    <li> The rich thick lather that one gets with using Col. Conk shaving soap makes for a great shave and experience.</li>
    <li> This stuff lathers quick and thick. It leaves a pleasant after smell. It&#x27;s still soap so it may dry your face a bit.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. Lather is excellent, and probably the slickest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Love the scent also. Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I got a brush for father&#x27;s day a few years ago and he loves the bay rum scent and shaving with this soap!</li>
    <li> I love the scent. It has a great lather. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face, doesn&#x27;t dry it out either.</li>
    <li> I AM A REPEAT CUSTOMER!!! NUFF SAID!!</li>
    <li> These soaps are great.  The smell is nice though I wish it lasted longer.  Ordering was simple and the soaps were a great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok would buy again.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Lathers up nicely. Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by stating that if you like Gilette gel, use fruity-scented creams, or shave your face with women&#x27;s Venus razors...then Colonel Conk packs too much testosterone for you. Let&#x27;s look at the facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Colonel Conk is world famous.&lt;br /&gt;2. Bay Rum is to women as flames are to moths.&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes elbow grease to create a lather. But it&#x27;s satisfying work.&lt;br /&gt;4. Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;5. It turns stubble into rubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever doubted your masculinity, do the Colonel a favor and don&#x27;t buy his product. However, if you enjoy urinating while standing and think Hillary would be a terrible president, then shave with glycerine soap. It&#x27;s made in America. It&#x27;s made for men. It&#x27;s like VE day for your face each time you shave. Buy it, use it, live it.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this soap. Bay rum scented and a great deal for a three pack. A little harder to lather up than Proraso.</li>
    <li> I attempted to get this locally, I could not find a store that sold it anymore. I was pleased to find it. It was just what I was looking for.</li>
