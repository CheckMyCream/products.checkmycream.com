    <li> I make my own cleaners for around the house and this makes the cleaners smell lovely. Everyone says my house smells nice and clean when the come over after I use this. I make put this in my cleaners for the countertops, floors, bathroom etc.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleaner! Effective and therapeutic at the same time. It makes me love cleaning!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Eden&#x27;s garden oils. The cleaning is the oil I have in my diffuser almost every single day.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day!!!! Love it!! I add it to my dish washer, laundry, clean my floors, use it in my toilet, and use it in my dishwasher to sanitize and clean baby toys and other things in my house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it as suggested on the label to make home made cleaner with white vinegar and distilled water. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and  stopped using any other cleaner in the kitchen and living areas. My professional cleaning angel, which was a bleach addict now doesn&#x27;t want to use any other cleaner anymore in my house except in the toilet bowls where we both still opt for conventional cleaners. The scent is lovely and during flu season I actually add Four Thieves oil to the mix for additional protection which smells just as wholesome. This cleaner really does the trick, even on a glass top stove. Worst case, it has to sit for a couple of minutes to penetrate before the mess can be wiped off but that&#x27;s so worth it considering there is nothing toxic ever in my food prep area again.</li>
    <li> My favorite blend. Super easy to make homemade cleaning spray that smells amazing. I get compliments on how great my house smells.</li>
    <li> I have eliminated store bought cleaners in an effort to control my families allergies and my constant headaches.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that my headaches are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;This oil blend has my whole house smelling fabulous!!&lt;br /&gt;The directions are on the bottle. I use vodka or rubbing alcohol instead of vinegar as I have granite and travertine.</li>
    <li> Wow! This cleaning blend is amazing. I love that I can clean using all natural ingredients without any chemicals Just mix with a little vinegar and purified water, put in a spray bottle and clean away.</li>
    <li> The Cleaning synergy blend is one of my many favorite oils from Edens Garden. I buy it in the 30ml size because we use it for all our cleaning needs. I like to mix it with water and a bit of Dr. Bronners Castile soap for a all purpose spray.</li>
    <li> WOW, brilliant mix of oils for a fantastic scent.  Not overwhelming and gives a room/home an elegant and clean aroma.  Love this one.</li>
    <li> I love my new homemade cleaning spray! So much healthier than bleach amd smells so much better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleaning oil like crazy! I mix it with a 50/50 mix of water and vinegar. I feel good about not using chemicals to clean and it really cuts the smell of the vinegar (which reminds me of coloring Easter eggs).</li>
    <li> Love it! Got rid of all my harsh cleaning solutions and I only use this now. And the scent it leaves behind is pleasant.</li>
    <li> Just a few drops of this oil in a gallon of water and 1/2 cup of white vinegar, makes a great smelling cleaner,, which also disinfects because of the vinegar.

    <li> I put a few drops in my kids&#x27; bath each night and the whole house smells wonderful. Sometimes I also put a drop on a tissue and carry it in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell of lavender and love to have it with me.</li>
    <li> This makes vinegar cleaner smell fantastic. While all of their blends that I have tried were great, this one is my favorite.</li>
