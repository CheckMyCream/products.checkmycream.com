      <li>excellent product!!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>perfect fragrance and works well</li>
      <li>pump mechanism works perfectly well and is generous--</li>
      <li>It smells great!</li>
      <li>I purchased it with a coupon and additional S&amp;S discount and was also very happy with the price.</li>
      <li>Fits that bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>the pump bottle works great</li>
      <li>Great bottle as well</li>
      <li>The mandarin (orange) scent is very nice.</li>
      <li>But the price with coupon was so good I could not pass it up.  </li>
      <li>Have loved this product for years.</li>
      <li>I also like that it has a very light, pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>I really love Seventh Generation products!</li>
      <li>I love the way this soap smells!</li>
      <li>I just feel like the mandarin is the more pleasant of the two when comparing them together.  </li>
      <li>It is the kind of hand soap where you smell you hands after you wash them.  </li>
      <li>You get three nice sized bottles.</li>
      <li>Eco friendly and at a great price.</li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves hands feeling clean.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Light pleasant scent, earth and body friendly ingredients, no harmful &amp;#34;anti-bacterial&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Jason hand soap products are better.</li>
      <li>We typically love Seventh Generation&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>The mandarin scent is lovely.  </li>
      <li>This one is our favorite.</li>
      <li>This one is relatively safe and it works well.</li>
      <li>I love this hand soap.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and cleans off all the dirt, but I will definitely not use it again.  </li>
      <li>However, in this product, the smell was okay</li>
      <li>I love this non-toxic hand soap for my family.</li>
      <li>The scent is agreeable and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love just about everything</li>
      <li>This hand wash can be found on EWG&#x27;s website for safe hand wash.</li>
      <li>I just ordered more from amazon.</li>
      <li>I called poison control, telling them what kind of soap she had used, and they had us rinse her eyes out as a precaution, but sounded very calm.</li>
      <li>been using Seventh Generation diapers, detergent, and their cleaning products since our son was born and I&#x27;ve been really happy with everything they&#x27;ve offered so far.</li>
      <li>Great, eco and health conscious hand wash-and at the price I paid it was a STEAL.  </li>
      <li>and I thought it would be better than the alternative anti-bacterial hand soaps available.</li>
      <li>like most Seventh Generation products, and greatly appreciate their corporate philosophy of sustainability.</li>
      <li>It has a light citrus sent.</li>
      <li>The mandarin seemed to fit in both my kitchen and in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>But this is made by Seventh Generation, and I enjoy all their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather and consistency is important to me.</li>
      <li>I can deal with smell if it is that cheap</li>
      <li>The smell is a light citrus scent and</li>
      <li>pump mechanism works smoothly and one pump is plenty for washing with the water here in the mid-atlantic (Maryland).</li>
      <li>In my experience, this has been proven to be a very gentle and safe product, too.</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try out the handwash.</li>
      <li>This product would be great if it didn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  </li>
      <li>This soap makes you feel clean without all the anti-bac stuff.</li>
      <li>Pros: cleans hands, lathers well (without too much lather), naturally derived safe ingredients, larger container to reduce environmental impact, no Triclosan, very pleasant mandarin</li>
      <li>Regardless, I really like how well the product works and the scent doesn&#x27;t keep us from using it, just not our favorite.  </li>
      <li>I got a good enough deal on three and with Prime, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.</li>
      <li>so I stopped using the soap and went back to good &#x27;ol Dove soap until I discovered the Seventh Generation</li>
      <li>Seventh&#x27;s generation produces a good lather as the soap adheres to your skin, and runs enough that the lathering process is quick as the soap&#x27;s already begun spreading.</li>
      <li>My hands distinctly feel clean when I&#x27;m done, and I prefer to put on a lotion of my choice rather than have moisturizers in the soap leaving a coating on my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to chemicals and fragrances and found this completely non-irritating and pleasant.</li>
      <li>So far, this is in the bathroom most my guests use and closest to the pool.</li>
      <li>It seems rather strong for my liking, and I do tend to like highly scented sometimes.  </li>
      <li>Oh, and I like the scent too, very citrus clean like.</li>
      <li>Their products are worth the premium, although I did find a coupon for my first order of this hand wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>I was researching products and this one beats out other hand soaps as far as safety and it smells great.</li>
      <li>I think the product is a very high quality product and worth trying.  </li>
      <li>The lavender is a fresh lavender sent, like real lavender smells or lavender oil.  </li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK for occasional washing, but not as often as I use the ones at home.</li>
      <li>If you are only using it once or twice a day, I think it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>I love the smell - it&#x27;s a sharp, crisp citrus that makes you feel clean.</li>
      <li>I have found that this soap is a great balance between being super delicate on my hands and feels like &amp;#34;real soap&amp;#34; in terms of cleaning hands that have been busy cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: Bottle isn&#x27;t too pretty to look at; would be nice if had some sort of decoration or less utilitarian looking packaging.</li>
      <li>Purchased because we are trying to get away from &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; hand soaps and this fit the bill and was more natural than other products.  </li>
      <li>I am very particular about hand soap and this fits the bill.</li>
      <li>I also like that it comes in a large bottle.</li>
      <li>My sensitive-skinned husband doesn&#x27;t much appreciate it, either.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem unusually drying to me, and does not irritate my fragrance-sensitive</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really mind this, though...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Verdict: Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I like this hand wash and would buy it again at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>It is not moisturizing, though, so in the winter it drys your hands just like most other hand soaps.</li>
      <li>I liked the smell well enough, but found that this product leaves my hands dry.</li>
      <li>We are about halfway through the first bottle and so far we have not had a problem with it drying out our skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I went to Whole Foods looking for a natural hand soap.</li>
      <li>I actually like lavender and own several lavender oils and such.  </li>
      <li>reviews here complain that this handwash is \\&quot;drying\\&quot;, but I actually prefer that it acts/feels like real soap-- capable of getting scents, oils, and chemicals off my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also fond of Seventh Generation&#x27;s laundry soap, since my husband has very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Each bottle is generously sized (in comparison to what you would buy at the store), and rightly so as the price is a bit higher than your average soap.</li>
      <li>so when you fully depress it, you end up with more soap than a single hand wash needs.</li>
      <li>Yum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used about half a bottle so far, and with two more I see this soap lasting quite a while.</li>
      <li>One day, I heard my 3 year old scream from the bathroom and for some reason she had put soap in her eyes.</li>
      <li>We used to use the so called natural &amp;#34;Method&amp;#34; soap from Target.</li>
      <li>a larger, convenient size and a VERY neutral</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, there is nothing natural about Method soap (if you read the ingredients you&#x27;ll know).</li>
      <li>A new version of Seventh Generation&#x27;s handsoap, with a larger size than before and a strictly neutral, natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the mandarin soap on a lark - with a coupon, it was the same price for the comparable refill of normal Dial/Softsoap soap from the store.</li>
      <li>The soap is also clear, and smells moderately of mandarins.</li>
      <li>This is better than all of those fragrance soaps with all of the chemicals that lately have a tendency to dry and hurt my skin.</li>
      <li>It smells good, but very tough on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have a few friends that are allergic to lavendar and other strong scents.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent product!! My hands no long get dry after washing.  The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Out of production - bought up what I could because their new formula dried out my skin.</li>
    <li> The mandarin scent is lovely.  I like this hand wash and would buy it again at a reasonable price (the sale was half price at the time that I bought this item).  It is not moisturizing, though, so in the winter it drys your hands just like most other hand soaps.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves hands feeling clean. Great bottle as well, just doesn&#x27;t look like a soap bottle when you glance at it.</li>
    <li> I expected the Mandaring to be a little bit sweeter scent I guess....it was a little too &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; for my taste.  Regardless, I really like how well the product works and the scent doesn&#x27;t keep us from using it, just not our favorite.  Purchased because we are trying to get away from &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; hand soaps and this fit the bill and was more natural than other products.  Fits that bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> I got a good enough deal on three and with Prime, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping. This is better than all of those fragrance soaps with all of the chemicals that lately have a tendency to dry and hurt my skin. I think that I was developing excema from the fragrance soaps from the big soap/lotion store at the mall. This soap makes you feel clean without all the anti-bac stuff.</li>
    <li> This hand wash can be found on EWG&#x27;s website for safe hand wash. I research all the products my family uses before buying them. This one is relatively safe and it works well. Will continue buying.</li>
    <li> Smell of this is nasty.  But the price with coupon was so good I could not pass it up.  I can deal with smell if it is that cheap and it cleans well.</li>
    <li> This product would be great if it didn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  I actually have to put lotion on after every use.  It smells wonderful and cleans off all the dirt, but I will definitely not use it again.  Jason hand soap products are better.</li>
    <li> Pros: cleans hands, lathers well (without too much lather), naturally derived safe ingredients, larger container to reduce environmental impact, no Triclosan, very pleasant mandarin smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bottle isn&#x27;t too pretty to look at; would be nice if had some sort of decoration or less utilitarian looking packaging. I don&#x27;t really mind this, though...it&#x27;s the only con I could come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the lavender.  The lavender is a fresh lavender sent, like real lavender smells or lavender oil.  It seems rather strong for my liking, and I do tend to like highly scented sometimes.  My daughter (age 10) even made a comment that the lavender hand soap doesn&#x27;t belong in the kitchen, but maybe in the bathroom.  I actually like lavender and own several lavender oils and such.  However, in this product, the smell was okay, I just prefer the mandarin in this case.  Now it&#x27;s not so bad that I won&#x27;t use it. I just feel like the mandarin is the more pleasant of the two when comparing them together.  The mandarin seemed to fit in both my kitchen and in the bathroom.  It is the kind of hand soap where you smell you hands after you wash them.  I think the product is a very high quality product and worth trying.  If I were to repurchase these hand soaps, I would return to the mandarin.</li>
    <li> A new version of Seventh Generation&#x27;s handsoap, with a larger size than before and a strictly neutral, natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews here complain that this handwash is \\&quot;drying\\&quot;, but I actually prefer that it acts/feels like real soap-- capable of getting scents, oils, and chemicals off my skin. My hands distinctly feel clean when I&#x27;m done, and I prefer to put on a lotion of my choice rather than have moisturizers in the soap leaving a coating on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem unusually drying to me, and does not irritate my fragrance-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump mechanism works smoothly and one pump is plenty for washing with the water here in the mid-atlantic (Maryland). The word \\&quot;handwash\\&quot; is embossed in the plastic, in case you&#x27;re one of those people whose guests are confused by the lotion/etc pumps in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like most Seventh Generation products, and greatly appreciate their corporate philosophy of sustainability. Their products are worth the premium, although I did find a coupon for my first order of this hand wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I had this on my subscribe and save list but they were removed because they&#x27;ve been out of stock for a few months. I&#x27;m sensitive to chemicals and fragrances and found this completely non-irritating and pleasant. Haven&#x27;t tried the lavender but guess I might if this doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell well enough, but found that this product leaves my hands dry. It&#x27;s OK for occasional washing, but not as often as I use the ones at home. I got a 3-pack and brought it to work for our kitchen, and no one seems to be complaining. If you are only using it once or twice a day, I think it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about hand soap and this fits the bill. Light pleasant scent, earth and body friendly ingredients, no harmful &amp;#34;anti-bacterial&amp;#34; crap added, and fairly easy on my sensitive skin. I purchased it with a coupon and additional S&amp;S discount and was also very happy with the price.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but very tough on my dry skin. My hand becomes rough within days. Amazon tightly wrapped three bottles in a plastic wrap with no extra protection, and not enough fill in shipping box. When I received package, one bottle&#x27;s nozzle was broken and caused leak. At the sales price I paid, I didn&#x27;t bother to return.</li>
    <li> I bought this because we have septic and I thought it would be better than the alternative anti-bacterial hand soaps available. In my experience, this has been proven to be a very gentle and safe product, too. One day, I heard my 3 year old scream from the bathroom and for some reason she had put soap in her eyes. I called poison control, telling them what kind of soap she had used, and they had us rinse her eyes out as a precaution, but sounded very calm. Later, I looked up the product&#x27;s material data safety sheet which stated that it might cause eye irritation, but no permanent damage would result. As long as I have little ones in the home, I will always buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this hand soap. You get three nice sized bottles. The mandarin (orange) scent is very nice. This soap cleans just as well, if not better than dial soap, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Great, eco and health conscious hand wash-and at the price I paid it was a STEAL.  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought the mandarin soap on a lark - with a coupon, it was the same price for the comparable refill of normal Dial/Softsoap soap from the store. I&#x27;m also fond of Seventh Generation&#x27;s laundry soap, since my husband has very sensitive skin. I love the smell - it&#x27;s a sharp, crisp citrus that makes you feel clean. It definitely gets gunk off. Unfortunately, my hands are now extremely dry - and I never have dry skin (quite the opposite). My sensitive-skinned husband doesn&#x27;t much appreciate it, either. I might try adding a dollop of lotion to the container and shaking it up, since I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the trouble of returning for the price. But I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Our family loves this soap! Sad to see that I can get a subscription for it anymore on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This mandarin scent isn&#x27;t identical to their other &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scent, and it&#x27;s inferior to the citrus. I don&#x27;t mind it, but I was hoping this scent was the same as their &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; when I ordered it, as I had not seen the mandarin scent in stores. Oh well. I like Method&#x27;s hand soaps, and wish I could buy them in refill packs, rather than in all of the wasteful packaging.</li>
    <li> I have a few friends that are allergic to lavendar and other strong scents. So far, this is in the bathroom most my guests use and closest to the pool. I&#x27;ve yet to get complaints, and I think I am an open enough person where they might politely let me know if this bothers them... plus their reactions are usually visible. Oh, and I like the scent too, very citrus clean like.</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap smells! Highly recommended. I have one of these next to all of the sinks in my house!</li>
    <li> Eco friendly and at a great price. I may try using this soap to fill my liquid foaming container and see if it works there too. My only complaint would be is that the pump is too long so when you fully depress it, you end up with more soap than a single hand wash needs.</li>
    <li> I went to Whole Foods looking for a natural hand soap. I smelled them in the store and came home with two different types. This one is our favorite. It smells great! It has a light citrus sent. I also like that it comes in a large bottle. We are about halfway through the first bottle and so far we have not had a problem with it drying out our skin. I just ordered more from amazon.</li>
    <li> We used to use the so called natural &amp;#34;Method&amp;#34; soap from Target. Let me tell you, there is nothing natural about Method soap (if you read the ingredients you&#x27;ll know). Plus, my hands started pealing and feeling extremely dry whenever I used Method soaps so I stopped using the soap and went back to good &#x27;ol Dove soap until I discovered the Seventh Generation soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using Seventh Generation diapers, detergent, and their cleaning products since our son was born and I&#x27;ve been really happy with everything they&#x27;ve offered so far. I would recommend trying this soap and some of their other products as well.</li>
    <li> I love this non-toxic hand soap for my family. I was researching products and this one beats out other hand soaps as far as safety and it smells great. I have not noticed it drying out my hands as other reviewers have stated.</li>
    <li> I received three bottles of SG&#x27;s hand wash, Mandarin &#x27;flavored&#x27;. Each bottle is generously sized (in comparison to what you would buy at the store), and rightly so as the price is a bit higher than your average soap. But this is made by Seventh Generation, and I enjoy all their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather and consistency is important to me. Runny soap produces a crummy lather, and thicker soap tends to crunch up on the nozzle and just fall off my hands into the sink when I try to wash. Seventh&#x27;s generation produces a good lather as the soap adheres to your skin, and runs enough that the lathering process is quick as the soap&#x27;s already begun spreading. The soap is also clear, and smells moderately of mandarins. Yum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used about half a bottle so far, and with two more I see this soap lasting quite a while. I may try to hop in on the next sale for these items.</li>
    <li> I love just about everything Seventh Generation so I was excited to try out the handwash. The smell is a light citrus scent and the pump bottle works great, however, I do find that is does dry my hands out. I have really sensitive skin so it may just be me. But if you can afford this and want to get rid of nasty chemicals on your hands, try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> We typically love Seventh Generation&#x27;s products. This handsoap is no exception-- a larger, convenient size and a VERY neutral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; of my skin. I have found that this soap is a great balance between being super delicate on my hands and feels like &amp;#34;real soap&amp;#34; in terms of cleaning hands that have been busy cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump mechanism works perfectly well and is generous-- one pump is plenty for washing hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> perfect fragrance and works well</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the soap a lot. It doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of the scary ingredients that so many commercial soaps contain nowadays. I also like that it has a very light, pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> I use this in the bathroom of our house as both a guest hand-cleaner as well as a face wash (believe it or not!). The scent is agreeable and refreshing. I really love Seventh Generation products!</li>
    <li> Have loved this product for years. Keep it at the kitchen sink and use it quite often during the day.</li>
