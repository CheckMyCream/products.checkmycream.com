    <li> Been using this of more than 5 years. Love it. Just the right amount of grit makes for an invigorating shower. Also love the smell. Will continue to buy and use.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed in the fragrance. Not as strong as I hoped it would be but I guess if you get the textured gel then you loose something along the way.</li>
    <li> I have random hot women throwing themselves at me on a daily basis because of this shower gel.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel I buy it a lot!!</li>
    <li> Wash with this and you will feel like a new person. Refreshes, and revitalizes.</li>
    <li> Bought for boyfriend for Christmas. You are the only one selling it and best price ever! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, sudsiness and grit factor of this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s not just for men. (Well, maybe it is, but I&#x27;m a woman and it&#x27;s my favorite body wash of all time.)</li>
    <li> Smells good, great price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Axe body wash. It&#x27;s got the grit to make you feel really clean. Please keep it available.</li>
    <li> Bought this for welder husband because my research said it would scrub the slag and funk off of him well. It does and it makes him smell pleasant. It keeps him nice and exfoliated, but I&#x27;m pretty sure exfoliation isn&#x27;t something he thinks about on the daily. No complaints about it drying his skin at all. He uses it from tip to tail some nights...even washes his hair with it.</li>
    <li> This is hard now to find in stores. My fiance loves this one. It smells awesome. It arrived on time and nicely packaged. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at Wal-Mart for my husband.  I only bought 1 bottle of it just in case he didn&#x27;t like it.  As it turns out, he loves it and we have traveled over 40 miles 1 way just to try and find this product locally.  We could not find it so I rely on Trusty Amazon.  but the price is double of what Walmart was on the first bottle.  Even so.........He loves this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dottye</li>
    <li> I Love the scent and my husband loves the scrubbing beads. Very nice product. He&#x27;s been using it fior years.</li>
    <li> This smells horrible! Like a mixture of vomit and bug spray.</li>
    <li> Thank you for carrying the Axe snake peel in your line of shower gels. I could not find it at any of my local stores like I used to. No body seemed to carry it any more. I purchased enough so I would not run out for a while. Your shipment arrived a few days before expected so that was great. It was an overall pleasant experience dealing with Amazon for the first time.</li>
    <li> Great smell and the &amp;#34;Snake Peel&amp;#34; I assume is the little tiny gritty objects that work very well to get rid of dry skin. Good product!</li>
    <li> I used to have the &amp;#34;AXE Cool Metal&amp;#34; shower gel , which I didn&#x27;t like that much so menty and U&#x27;ll feel a slight burn in UR genital area , BUT this one , Oh My God , I LOVED the scent , so manly and fresh , I&#x27;m difinetly buying it again .</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only place I can find this item. My husband thinks this is the best body wash ever. And he&#x27;s a bit picky 😜</li>
    <li> The product itself is great and I love the smell, this has been my go to for sometime, however its not longer sold anywhere in stores by me so I had to come here and purchase it.  The price here is high for sure but you do get a lot of product and its a two pack.  If you like the smell and the way this gel feels than its an easy purchase</li>
    <li> Axe Snake Peel is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product my husband loves it!! He uses it every day, a little hard to find. It smells great and it exfoliate the body!!</li>
    <li> My son loves this body wash. I cannot find in the stores. Thank you, he&#x27;s young and thinks its cool to have Snake Peel. Since, he likes Snakes. Scary for me lol.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon the Snake Peel shower gel in a combo pack that I received as a gift.  The lather and scrub achieved by this product invigorates the dermis and the citrus scent will wake you up while showering.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but it is one of the better products on the market.  When paired with an Axe Detailer, there is no equal in this price range.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I  absolutely love this stuff, and Amazon is the only place I can find it at a reasonable price.  All my local stores quit stocking it. I just hope that Axe doesn&#x27;t quit making it. Do yourself a favor and just give it a try, you will love it as well. It has a great smell, gives you a good scrubbing, and leaves you feeling great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The scent is nice, the gritty little particles provide a good, but comfortable, scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get at retail stores anymore.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, good stuff</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and uses it every day....leaves him smelling and feeling clean.  I will reorder this again in the future.</li>
