<ol>
    <li> Great soap. Helps with itchy rashes.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works. I still itch and soap also smells like eggs</li>
    <li> Great product, I think it&#x27;s good enough that I will start selling it myself.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this. It cleared up my keratosis pylorus (tiny red bumps on arms &amp; legs). It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It&#x27;s a little drying, but not too bad. Just alternate using it every other day, or every 3rd or 4th day, once you get the desired effect.</li>
    <li> Works great. No more zits and it doesn&#x27;t bleach my sheets like the medicated stuff.</li>
    <li> Works well for acne and minor skin problems..notvdrying like regular soap..Will buy again....</li>
    <li> The people who said this soap does not smell need to get their nose tested. Smells awful.</li>
    <li> Came in a nice plastic jar and seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> Was not at all satisfied with this product had used something very similar fir over 30 years and this was not at all a good choice</li>
    <li> I bought some of this sulfur soap to help my father and myself with skin problems. It is great. My face, arms, and legs have cleared up and so has my fathers. I love this soap.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  you can literally feel it working. My skin feels amazing after 2 weeks of use.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Simply this product does a great job and I would recommend it to all. For those who have acne problems this product is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, it delivered the results I was expecting, I think that if you have any skin problem, you should give it a try, it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to combat my Tinea Versicolor.  The first week I used it I saw an improvement.  However, continuing to use showed no further improvment.  The one thing that did get rid of my Tinea for about 6 months was a selenium based lotion (RX by doctor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it works quite well.  My skin felt clean, and acne was rare. Armpit odor is caused by bacteria, so this product made me stay fresher for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product about one time per day as per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will smell like sulfur (not excessively, so be sure to use some body spray.)</li>
    <li> I wanted sal3 salicylic acid... And got - sulfurne... I&#x27;m mad</li>
    <li> I have a weird scalp. Every once in a while it is itchy and oily. I do not dye my hair or use any hair products so I didn&#x27;t know why this was happening. I would use Selsin Blue, which helped, but it is pricey and has dyes in it which can further aggravate sensitive skin. I did some digging around online about my condition and how to treat it without pricey gimmicks or prescription medications. A lot of people said try SAL3. The price is good so I gave it a shot. I am not disappointed. I have used it twice in the past week and have not had much itch on my scalp. It has not dried out my hair like I suspected it would. I also use it on my face and body and it has worked well for my mild cystic acne as well. It comes in a plastic tub for storage as well, which is great. I suspect this bar will last 2 months, even with using it all over. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A REFILL ....I&#x27;m buying more !</li>
    <li> not quite what I was expecting for tineaversicolor</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and the company</li>
    <li> I have used up three bars of this, I use it for everything shampoo, psoriasis and general washing. I would really recommend Sal 3 to anyone who would like an all around product that really performs. I like to buy local, and this product is, but would buy it even if it was not, it fulfills my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> It has no effect on dandruff.</li>
    <li> Great soap, delivery took 3 weeks don&#x27;t who&#x27;s fault was it but I like product.</li>
    <li> This lathers nicely and does not seem to have a fragrance.  It seems to be helping with cystic acne.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best!!!! It has really cleared my skin 100% I also use the sulfur butter by Braunfels labs.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have found for adult acne,I wish they sold it in stores since my kids (in their early twenties) also love this soap!</li>
    <li> smells like sulfur, works like sulfur. Came nicely packaged. I use it for tinea versicolor and imperfections on the skin. It works very well if instructions are followed carefully</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was never able to use this properly as the bar I received was as rough and dry as a pumice stone but without any of the benefits of an actual pumice stone. (I did not order from this seller.) Pleas to the manufacturer for help fell on very deaf ears.</li>
    <li> this soap pretty much cancelled out all of my acne meds/washes. i have oily/combination skin. this soap works and the bar lasts a while-with two washes a day</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this soap did anything for me hence the 2 star..it peeled my skin which I though was good but I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very very good product this soap exfoliate the skin but doesn t burn it ,,,i love this soap and it comes in a plastic box very clean !</li>
    <li> Awesome.. saw improvement in one week. My face has a soft touch and clean look all day..</li>
    <li> Nice smelling product that is helping</li>
    <li> I used to use Selsun Blue daily for keeping my TV at bay but the blue coloring really started to annoy me. So, I switched to SAL3 and it has been working great. The smell isn&#x27;t bad I think it is somewhat odorless. I really liked how it came in its own plastic case so I can leave it in there when not in use. Overall excellent experience</li>
