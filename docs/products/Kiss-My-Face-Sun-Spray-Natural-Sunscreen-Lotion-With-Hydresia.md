### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this is the best mineral based non chemical sunscreen spray that I have bought.</li>
      <li>Nice job, KMF!!  </li>
      <li>This product is great</li>
      <li>and it provides great sun protection.  </li>
      <li>My Face SPF 30 spray that we loved -</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>You would do better getting a tube.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen for myself, husband &amp; kids.</li>
      <li>My family is allergic to most sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Seems to work well as a sunscreen, but the spray is more of a &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; that you have to rub in and isn&#x27;t the easiest.  </li>
      <li>Nicely scented and light...</li>
      <li>It works okay.</li>
      <li>Stayed on well, fragrance is very mild and very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I find that it goes on easily, does not have a strong odor and is not at all greasy.  </li>
      <li>so I have no idea how this was ever successfully manufactured as a sunscreen since you need to remain indoors in the AC for it to actually stay on your skin.</li>
      <li>I was pleased that I could read the ingredients and knew exactly what was in the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>ie it goes rancid quickly and can cause free radical damgae to your skin.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to buy the Honest Co sunscreen and my local store was out, so glad I got this instead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My family spent a very hot 4th of July weekend in the sun and this sunblock did a great job.</li>
      <li>Tried it out last year because I didn&#x27;t like all the junk in most sunscreens and going to buy more for this year.  </li>
      <li>Comes right off in water AND contains sunflower seed oil which is quite unstable</li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural chemical free sunscreen for my toddler boy.  </li>
      <li>We are still on our first bottle</li>
      <li>Spray bottle broke first day, sunscreen works well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve liked the other Kiss</li>
      <li>but when it runs out, we will certainly order again.</li>
      <li>I would love it if it sprayed more like a mist with only a little need for rubbing in.</li>
      <li>It works very well and applies well.  </li>
      <li>Very ting.</li>
      <li>After using it , my skin still become darker from the sun, i didn&#x27;t get sunburn, but I need a screen which doesn&#x27;t make me darker, this doesn&#x27;t really work like that.</li>
      <li>Nice to have a spray option (even though its not a fine mist).  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to reapply more than any other sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>this would be good for maybe taking a stroll in the sun, but if any sweating is going to happen, not a good idea.</li>
      <li>only the pump handle is super flimsy.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.....</li>
      <li>Other brands of broad spectrum sprays did much better.</li>
      <li>Luckily as soon as I&#x27;d had enough of wearing this sunscreen, I only had to run my hands and arms under a faucet and it was gone in seconds.  </li>
      <li>At the very first droplet of sweat, water, rain, condensation on your upper lip, it begins washing away, leaving rivers of white streaking across your skin-</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t the least bit appropriate for anyone who sweats-</li>
      <li>Did not protect from sun like the old one.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about my kids burning with Kiss My Face Natural Mineral Sun Spray.</li>
      <li>Stays very thick and white on your skin kind of like wearing zinc oxide, No burns though.</li>
      <li>We have the old packaging product and possibly the old recipe.</li>
      <li>one application for the entire day) - myself, my husband, my mom and my 1.5 yr old.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about to buy another bottle to make sure I always have this on hand if the other bottle gets misplaced!</li>
      <li>Its not greasy and while it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, its not white (unless you put on too much), sticky or heavy</li>
      <li>Also, it is super greasy and hard to rub in.  </li>

<li> Also, it is super greasy and hard to rub in.  </li>
<li> You end up with a strange white coating on your skin that gets all over clothes, towels and swim toys but doesn&#x27;t last at all once in the water.  </li>
<li> This was a complete waste of twenty bucks for multiple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
<li> This new bottle isn&#x27;t cheap and it goes on like white paint and stereos really badly.</li>
<li> We are in the water all day long in the summer</li>
<li> N,o it is not good for swimming as it comes right off in the water, but for everyday use on the kiddos</li>
<li> This is also the ONLY sunscreen they&#x27;ve been able to wear this season that hasn&#x27;t caused them a horrible rash (they have very sensitive skin).</li>
<li> Yes, you do look a little purplish/white with initial application but that goes away as it soaks in.  </li>
<li> I just purchased this the other day and it did not disappoint.</li>
<li> Thumbs down.</li>
<li> I had a previous bottle of the Kiss</li>
<li> It never fully feels dry, and remains as a weird powdery white coating on your skin no matter how hard you rub it in or how long you leave it to</li>
<li> When applied you can see a little chalkiness, but that seems to fade as it soaks in.</li>
<li> Its not sticky or greasy like the ones I have bought in the past.</li>
<li> I was not pleased with this purchase.</li>
<li> It gets everywhere, is hard to clean up, has an awful texture, is impossible to rub in, and appears both chalky and greasy white.</li>
<li> , that&#x27;s sucks, I need it for beach and swimming!</li>
<li> I need spray sunscreen for my wiggly toddler, but it&#x27;s difficult to find all mineral sunscreen in a spray.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately this sunscreen is awful!  </li>
<li> Very disappointed in this one.</li>
<li> This stuff is disgusting.</li>
<li> When my daughter had a horrible reaction to Neutrogena the doctor recommended we try a mineral based sunscreen.  </li>

    <li> This is not waterproof at all. it also stings when it drips into the kids eyes.  this would be good for maybe taking a stroll in the sun, but if any sweating is going to happen, not a good idea.</li>
    <li> Stays very thick and white on your skin kind of like wearing zinc oxide, No burns though.</li>
    <li> Its like lotion in a spray bottle, i still have to spread it with my hands to evenly apply to my skin, so to me is not reallya mist spray sunscreen. Also Not water resistant at all, melt when in the water, that&#x27;s sucks, I need it for beach and swimming! After using it , my skin still become darker from the sun, i didn&#x27;t get sunburn, but I need a screen which doesn&#x27;t make me darker, this doesn&#x27;t really work like that.</li>
    <li> I need spray sunscreen for my wiggly toddler, but it&#x27;s difficult to find all mineral sunscreen in a spray.  This stuff sprays well and hasn&#x27;t gotten clogged yet.  It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming fragrance.  But like all mineral sunscreens it leaves a white cast on your skin.</li>
    <li> We have the old packaging product and possibly the old recipe. This new bottle isn&#x27;t cheap and it goes on like white paint and stereos really badly. Did not protect from sun like the old one.  What happ?</li>
    <li> My family is allergic to most sunscreens.  When my daughter had a horrible reaction to Neutrogena the doctor recommended we try a mineral based sunscreen.  This is what we got.  It works very well and applies well.  You do have to rub it in after you have sprayed it on but you are supposed to do that with all spray on sunscreens.  I was pleased that I could read the ingredients and knew exactly what was in the sunscreen.  We are in the water all day long in the summer and I don&#x27;t have to reapply more than any other sunscreen.  Yes, you do look a little purplish/white with initial application but that goes away as it soaks in.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about my kids burning with Kiss My Face Natural Mineral Sun Spray.</li>
    <li> My kids wore this all week at camp, swimming, sweating, playing and had zero sunburns. This is also the ONLY sunscreen they&#x27;ve been able to wear this season that hasn&#x27;t caused them a horrible rash (they have very sensitive skin). Highly recommend.....I&#x27;m about to buy another bottle to make sure I always have this on hand if the other bottle gets misplaced! Can&#x27;t be without it. When applied you can see a little chalkiness, but that seems to fade as it soaks in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked the other Kiss My Face sunscreens I&#x27;ve purchased and this does not disappoint.  Nice to have a spray option (even though its not a fine mist).  Its not greasy and while it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, its not white (unless you put on too much), sticky or heavy and it provides great sun protection.  Went to the zoo recently with my family and everyone used this sunscreen (one application for the entire day) - myself, my husband, my mom and my 1.5 yr old.  We even put it on our faces.  Nice job, KMF!!  We are still on our first bottle but when it runs out, we will certainly order again.</li>
    <li> Tried it out last year because I didn&#x27;t like all the junk in most sunscreens and going to buy more for this year.

N,o it is not good for swimming as it comes right off in the water, but for everyday use on the kiddos I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great only the pump handle is super flimsy.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it in a tube is possible.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for myself, husband &amp; kids. Stayed on well, fragrance is very mild and very easy to apply.

    <li> Nicely scented and light...</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural chemical free sunscreen for my toddler boy.  Unfortunately this sunscreen is awful!  It is NOT  a spray on sunscreen- it comes out in big splotches and does not distirbute evenly so you still have to rub it in.  Whats the point of having it in a spray bottle then???  You would do better getting a tube.  Also, it is super greasy and hard to rub in.  Comes right off in water AND contains sunflower seed oil which is quite unstable ie it goes rancid quickly and can cause free radical damgae to your skin.  I would definitely not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It works okay. Very ting. Should have looked at size</li>
    <li> This stuff is disgusting. It gets everywhere, is hard to clean up, has an awful texture, is impossible to rub in, and appears both chalky and greasy white. Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle broke after 2 uses.  I was not pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this the other day and it did not disappoint. It is creamy and not a mist but I just spray it into my hands and then rub it on.  I think the mist sunscreen sprays are all chemicals. this is the best mineral based non chemical sunscreen spray that I have bought. Its not sticky or greasy like the ones I have bought in the past. I used it at the pool and I didn&#x27;t find that it came off in the water.</li>
    <li> Spray bottle broke first day, sunscreen works well</li>
    <li> Seems to work well as a sunscreen, but the spray is more of a &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; that you have to rub in and isn&#x27;t the easiest.  I would love it if it sprayed more like a mist with only a little need for rubbing in.</li>
    <li> The SPF Mineral spray did not work.  My son-in-law was burnt after being in the sun at the beach.  Other brands of broad spectrum sprays did much better.</li>
    <li> I had a previous bottle of the Kiss My Face SPF 30 spray that we loved - when I went to purchase through Amazon it is now a &amp;#34;Mineral&amp;#34; formula.  I agree with another reviewer who talked about the white smear that gets on everything.  This is a completely different formula.  it doesn&#x27;t spread on well and it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin.  You end up with a strange white coating on your skin that gets all over clothes, towels and swim toys but doesn&#x27;t last at all once in the water.  Very disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of twenty bucks for multiple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. This leaves your skin feeling chalky and damp.  It never fully feels dry, and remains as a weird powdery white coating on your skin no matter how hard you rub it in or how long you leave it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. At the very first droplet of sweat, water, rain, condensation on your upper lip, it begins washing away, leaving rivers of white streaking across your skin- and staining everything you&#x27;re wearing. It isn&#x27;t the least bit appropriate for anyone who sweats- so I have no idea how this was ever successfully manufactured as a sunscreen since you need to remain indoors in the AC for it to actually stay on your skin. Luckily as soon as I&#x27;d had enough of wearing this sunscreen, I only had to run my hands and arms under a faucet and it was gone in seconds.  Unluckily, even an hour after applying, it has left the inside of my car streaked with white, along with my clothing, purse, sunglasses...&lt;br /&gt;3. This isn&#x27;t a spray. Instead, it&#x27;s a runny cream in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;If there were any way for me to return this, I would.</li>
