      <li>As someone who went to the salon 2 times a year for almost 10 years for a $200-$300 straight perm, I have to say I am really pleased with this at-home version.</li>
      <li>You should always do a test before you use this as there have been times when my hair was not in good enough shape to use it.</li>
      <li>twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The good times didn&#x27;t last forever....</li>
      <li>Genuine exactly like the original from the box.. shipping is excillent..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works great but don&#x27;t leave on too long. I&#x27;ve used this product twice to straighten my hair. My hair has a lot of curl in the back and very wavy everywhere else. It will straighten your hair. The first time I used it I left it on too long as I assumed it may not work great. But it did. I fried a a little section but not a big deal. The second time I left it on as recommended for my hair type and no longer. I also combed very gently as if you pull on your hair while this is on it will also damage your hair. This product does what it claims! Easy to use too.</li>
    <li> My hair is super frizzy this product makes it smooth and straight. gently</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good on my dry, damaged, bridle hair. Ogilvie took out a lot of the wave leaving my hair lighter and softer. The softness lasted for three or four days. This worked fine considering several months of using a hot flat iron on my hair daily.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Been using it every 3-6 months for about 6 yrs. I have curly, frizzy fine hair, and when it gets humid out, or rains, my hair gets very curly and frizzes out on my top layer. I&#x27;ve been using this and it completely gets rid of the frizz. My hair looks normal, and smooth. Love it. Used to spend a lot at the salon for smoothing treatments. For 12 dollars, it works just as well. And I save my unused creme and use it for my next application. It smells for a few days, but not bad. I also want to add, that i&#x27;ve been using the gentle straightener the past 6 months, (2 times) and its not as good as this stuff.</li>
    <li> The only straightener I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 15 years, have it down to a T... Can&#x27;t live without it!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work good for me at all.  Washed out in a few showers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same product for the last several years, not so much in the last year, but definitely the 6 before. It has the normal perm smell which can be unpleasant in a small area but it&#x27;s never really bothered me. I used it for so long because it did work without tearing up my hair or making it break, though I will say it gets harder to do alone the longer your hair gets. Great product for diy&#x27;ers. Would give 5 stars if it took out more wave, it really tames my thick tight curls though.</li>
    <li> Read instructions carefully I lost a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time. It works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and went straight home to use it and it was AWFUL. There are about a million steps to follow and it smells so unbelievably bad. You have to do the most ridiculous things and it takes so long. When I finished putting it in my hair and letting it dry I realized it didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING. It&#x27;s a waste of money and time. Also I read the ingredients more carefully and saw that it has AMMONIA! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair straight but it did kill the friz and change the texture of my hair. It&#x27;s much softer and manageable, I don&#x27;t hate humid days as much lol I&#x27;ll try it again in 6 months or so with my natural hair color (dark brown). I had the ombre with blonde ends and had to cut the blonde off because it fried it, should&#x27;ve probably done it before applying the product but it was time for a hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;This probably works best for untreated hair with no bleach.</li>
    <li> love this product.  don&#x27;t know why they took it off the shelves.  makes my hair soft and more manageable.  love it</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product  worked and my hair was straight.  But somewhat too straight in places and I lost all of my curl.</li>
    <li> For the price it works decently.  I have very curly hair and it at least got it to be wavy.  However, I work out daily and after a few good sweats the curls began returning.  So, if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot you&#x27;d probably have longer lasting results.</li>
    <li> I permed my hair and I got sick of it (I naturally have stick straight hair). This is the same chemicals used in perms so it&#x27;s safe to use on permed hair (relaxers aren&#x27;t I think). So I straightened my hair with this and it&#x27;s back to being almost as straight as before! I had dyed blonde hair. I waited a month after the original perm and two weeks after dying it before straightening it. I also used deep conditioners containing keratin and coconut oil like 2-4 times a week the month beforehand. I only left the straightener on for about 7 minutes and I immediately followed the treatment with a coconut oil hair mask. My hair looks less damaged than before, but I think straight hair tends to just look like that. It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I straightened it and it still looks great. I switched to brown non permanent hair dye and I deep condition it about once a week. I flat iron it nearly every day on a very low setting and it takes about 5 minutes to get it all straight. I use this keratin heat resistant spray on it beforehand (along with kahm daily smoothing treatment and lavender oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also cut about four inches off my hair (it wasn&#x27;t damaged, I just felt like it) before straightening so this probably reduced my risk of split ends. I might also have abnormally resilient hair. All in all, I think this is a great product for getting permed hair straight as long as you make sure to deep condition it often. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a before and after photo so the blonde hair is BEFORE straightening it.</li>
    <li> This product works great!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Broke my hair right off on one whole side of my head.</li>
    <li> So happy bought for my 11 year old. For years I was desperate to find a product safe enough and thatbwould actually workm my daughter&#x27;s hair was so kinky and nappy. The poor girl broke brushes just to brush! Well we found this product and my daughter&#x27;s hair came out amazing not damaged and better then ever. She can brush her hair with ease and finally her hair falls down. She loves it so much she said she feels like a new little woman. I will always use this product and am so happy we found it!</li>
    <li> I only left on for 8 minutes. My hair is so completely ruined I fear I am going to have to cut all off. My hair is long now and all is ruined! This is not for all hair types</li>
    <li> Love this :) Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants straight hair in an instant. Excellent product and great results!</li>
    <li> Not good at all it didn&#x27;t work at all and it stripped my hair of its color now my hairs pink</li>
    <li> I live by it.  I have a fancy Hollywood &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; who loves it on my hair.  It saves me 45 minutes in the chair and $125.  It takes no time, you can control the level of straightening.  I was told to get if by the former Beauty Director of Nord****m.</li>
    <li> This product does not work on all hair type&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very tick an wavey. I followed all the direction. All I got was hair breakage&lt;br /&gt;Actually I purchased two boxes only used one. I would like to return the other box.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. Annette.</li>
    <li> As someone who went to the salon 2 times a year for almost 10 years for a $200-$300 straight perm, I have to say I am really pleased with this at-home version. I may have left the product on for slightly less time than recommended, but I wouldn&#x27;t know because my box didn&#x27;t come with instructions. I was hesitant to use it for that reason, but I found one Yahoo Answers post with times that sounded about right. I also decided to risk using it anyway because I had about half new growth but still some old that had been colored and was weak/damaged. I tried to not get Step 1 on the ends/old growth until the very end. For the price I paid for this box, I was amazed at how straight it looked when I rinsed it out. As for comments about the smell, it smells exactly like it did in the salon so that&#x27;s just part of the package if you want a chemical relaxer.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed felt like glue going on  could not pull comb thru without pulling hair out I used to use curl free and cannot locate now so settled for this one&lt;br /&gt;I should have known product was probably expired&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy from this ‚ÑÖ again sorry</li>
    <li> I called the company and they say they have not changed the formula, but I used to be WAY straighter after using this.  I feel it barely took out much curl.  Will need to re-do...they said 2 months minimum to wait...and they will send a coupon.  I guess that helps.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any other brand suggestions, I am open.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is so strong I almost throw up and feel suffocated.&lt;br /&gt;And the result wasn&#x27;t good at either. Wasting my time and money. Never wanna try again and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy, unprocessed hair and wanted to take away some the frizzness around the front of my hair. Thought this product would do the job from the reviews I read on this website. I applied the product from the hairline to ear and only let it process for 10 mins. The results were okay... it gave me straighter hair, but left it flat and lifeless. However, weeks went by I started noticing a bunch of broken hairs on the area I applied the product. Wish I never used this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this straightener for years, and I think it works pretty good as straightener&#x27;s go!  I recommend it</li>
    <li> Fantastic product-fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve hated having curling hair so I figured I give this a try. After reading some of the negative reviews I was a bit nervous but I did it anyway and I am very happy with the result. The only thing that would be negative about this product is the smell. It smells very strongly of maybe something like sewage or garbage. For the first couple of washes, when I got my hair wet it would smell really bad again and keep smelling until it dried. The smell does not seem to be too strong anymore though. This did not damage my hair at all but left it straight and so easy to work with. One week after using it and I am still very happy with how my hair is. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> It says for every hair so i took a chance and went bald, literally!! I lost all my hair in the center of my head. I am bald!! I have no idea what happen and i am not saying i was perfect with the install but are you kidding me!! BALD!!!!</li>
    <li> The best straightener and is so easy to use!!</li>
    <li> On time no damage will buy again</li>
    <li> nothing change , lost money, time and the smell is too terible</li>
    <li> Works great in relaxing curls, just use 1/2 the time and instead of combing hair completely straight, finger comb how you would normally wear your hair.  Controls the frizzies as well.</li>
    <li> This product works great if you don&#x27;t want curls in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have wavy  blonde hair and wanted to get the sleek shinny look without flat ironing my hair so often, so I came accross this product and I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I bought it at a LA Air Force Base, and when I came home I was skeptical weather I should do it or not, especially after I read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as intstructed on the package.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I feel torn on how to rate it. My hair looks great, BUT my ends are ruined.&lt;br /&gt;I have to go tomorrow and get a hair cut because half of my hair looks good but everything from the shoulders down is damaged.It looks and feel terrible.&lt;br /&gt; I suppose I get a cute bob.&lt;br /&gt;Would I reccomend it? No.</li>
    <li> I used this product to get rid of a perm I&#x27;d had for a while. As long as you follow the directions it works wonders. The first day or so, your hair might be a little flat, but it&#x27;s great after that. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product works very well on my moderately frizzy hair.  Makes it soft and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my Hispanic  wavy hair during the high humid summer. It calms the frizz. Used to buy at drugstore for 8 to 9 dollars but I can&#x27;t find in stock any where any more</li>
    <li> Does damage hair some but anyone who colors or perms their hair already knows your gonna get some damage.  Hard to do without help if you have really long hair like me. I got the results I wanted though. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like others straighteners do. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> the product got here quick so there&#x27;s a plus. i bought this product hoping to get naturally straight hair that would require little to no effort for the day&#x27;s do. when applying this, my ends were really the only thing that changed. my roots were still curly. the smell of this product is horrible. it made my whole house smell for hours like eggs. the only that changed with that product was the smell of my house. product is a waste of money so it&#x27;s a no for me.</li>
    <li> It straightened my hair a little. My natural hair is pretty curly so I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be completely straight but the stuff did calm my hair down  a lot. I didn&#x27;t have a huge hair loss problem like in other reviews and it didn&#x27;t smell bad after you rinse your hair. Overall, it worked pretty good and I will use it again after the 3 month wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; now (both online &amp; @ stores). I use at least once a month specifically on whatever problem area POPS UP (those with my issue know what I&#x27;m talking about). I only leave on #1 about 5 min (my hair&#x27;s very dry) &amp; #2 the 7 min recommended. It&#x27;s nice to be able to wear &amp;#34;a style.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It was ok. Not the best one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my friend so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have long (4in past shoulder) black Asian hair that is thick, coarse and naturally wavy. When I wash my hair and let it naturally dry, it tends to frizz and have random waves. I have to blow dry and straighten my hair almost on a daily basis. I saw this product at Walmart and did not even know home straightening kits were available. I never really looked. It was about $8 plus tax so I figured it was worth a shot. My sister applied the product following the instructions. I left the straightening solution in for 20 minutes because of my long, thick and coarse hair, followed by a warm water rinse and then neutralizer solution, followed by another rinse. I let my hair towel try and I noticed parts of my hair dried slightly frizzy and still wavy in the back. I had half of each solution left so I decided to do a second round. This time I did it myself and left the straightening solution for 30 min and neutralizer for 20 min. This time, my hair was drying with less frizz but still that stubborn wave in the back. I air dried my hair and went to bed. The next morning, my hair was more or less the same as the night before but no random \\&quot;medusa-like\\&quot; waves or bed-head. I still had to use the straightening iron and styled my hair. It was rainy and humid out today but my hair didn&#x27;t frizz, looked shiny and felt soft and smooth! I think my hair use another round if I really wanted it straight from the bottom, rather than have to do additional flat-ironing but it did help a lot in changing the texture of the hair.</li>
    <li> so i bought a box..not from amazon but walmart...which is cheaper by a couple $s...i had my hair stylist do it for me...i&#x27;m only partially ok with the results...1st i didn&#x27;t think to ask how long she was leaving it in for so 10 mins was NOT long enough i was thinking along the lines of 20..but not the suggested max of 25...i have wavy thick and in some places curly hair..like the back of my neck i have ringlets every where else is just wavy, but it turned out OK when i let it naturally dry which is every day..since i&#x27;m a wash n go kinda girl..and a new mom so i have NO time to do my hair...it turns out a little wavy but not as much as it used to be...by the end of the day i get home..its a little greasey from sweating in this crazy heat...its a little less wavy and a little flatter to my head..i like it more then...i DID want it pencil straight...i guess just having wavy curly thick hair all my life i want the opposite...its not as frizzy or \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; i call it...but i think before i either decide its for me ...or to call it quits and try another...i&#x27;ll give it one more shot in the 3 months suggested...the box does say the 2nd application should give you more of the results you wanted if you didn&#x27;t get them with the first application..and i usually give hair products 2 uses before my final judgement..so i say give it a try but DO get help...my bf wouldn&#x27;t help me..so i ended up paying my stylist her 25$ wash, dry and style fee...thats ok though b/c she knew what she was doing...so get a friend to help one that wont complain about having to constantly brush your hair straight for the whole time ...</li>
    <li> IT damaged my hair and now I have to buy remedies for what it did to me</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks and takes a good 1.5 hours to use but it works wonders on my very curly and frizzy hair.  I can&#x27;t find it locally so I am willing to pay the premium price on amazon.  I did not have any problems with using it and my hair is still soft and not damaged.</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well on my hair.  I like it because you can control the  amount of curl you takeout by the amount of time you leave it on.  My hair is fine but I have a lot of it,  Salon straightening left it too straight and with no body, so this works better for me because I can control the timing.  It also has a nice conditioner with the kit  that keeps hair from getting to dry.  It&#x27;s easy to use for me but I do have short hair,  long hair may be harder or require more than 1 kit.</li>
    <li> I used it today and it&#x27;s so nice.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 35 years and have always had good results. You should always do a test before you use this as there have been times when my hair was not in good enough shape to use it. It does leave a slight chemical smell that lasts for just a few days but after all, this IS a chemical straightener. The results are permanent until your hair grows out. Be careful on how long you leave this on. Too long and your hair will have absolutely no body at all; and I mean straight! My hair is very thick and curly and when it was past my shoulders, I used two boxes to make sure my hair had plenty on it.</li>
    <li> One star is too generous. Called Amazon for a shipping label and they credited my account.&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT the original formula. Threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Description should indicate the formula has changed.</li>
    <li> I always straighten my hair with this product.  It works great.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This brand is the only brand i use. It straightens my hair and minimizes frizz without damage to my hair. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> i use this every 3 months on my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have wavy/curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is just potent enough to knock the frizz out of my hair but i still have some body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;started buying online cuz i got tired of hit or miss finds at the store.</li>
    <li> Great product! Discount es every where , s√∫per excited it was Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past more than a handful of times and I have never had an issues with the end result. I have very curly hair and what the product does it leaves my hair in soft waves and more manageable which cuts back on my blow drying time by half. I have never exprienced hair loss or breakage from using this product like others have stated. The only down side is the smell, if they somehow managed to make a formula that does not leave such a strong order behind it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for many years. I have very curly hair. At first I was disppointed at how it still curled. Then I learned that what it actually does do is change the texture of my hair. It doesn&#x27;t frizz when it&#x27;s humid/rains. I can blow it dry striaght and unless I get caught in the rain, it stays the way I styled it and even looks better the next day. I actually like the way my hair feels now (soft)and now have long hair that I am happy with and don&#x27;t get frustrated with for the first time in years. I don&#x27;t fight with my hair only to be dissappointed when I go outside, especially  in humid weather of August here in n.j. Please don&#x27;t leave the product on longer thinking your hair will be that much more straigt. Also try to leave applying the product to the ends of your hair for last, they seem to burn quicker if you are not careful. I use the product about once every 6 - 8 months. Sometimes I only touch up like you would hair color . Oh yeah, and wait AT LEAST 2 weeks befor you color your hair. The striaghtener makes your hair more pourous and will change the hair color. The odor of the product will also be with you until you wash it a few times.It&#x27;s a bit of work, but worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> I made the stupid mistake of ruining my natural Asian straight hair by getting a &amp;#34;wavy perm.&amp;#34; After a month of clarifying shampoo and olive oil, I used this product. It is simple, quick, and easy to use. End result: my natural Asian hair is back!! It feels softer and straighter than before, and I didn&#x27;t even use the leave-in conditioner provided. Also doesn&#x27;t have the horrific smell lingering too boldly after you wash it out. Really satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is quick and easy to use and leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I had previously tried Easystraight on my long, medium curly, thick hair.  It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me at all.  I decided to try Ogilvie.  It worked pretty well.  My hair is about 95% straight.  I combed it gently the entire 20 minutes that the product was on my hair.  I think next time I use it, I think I&#x27;ll be able to get my hair completely straight.  My hair is in pretty good condition - the ends are dry but that&#x27;s about it.  I will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> I am mixed race and have had problems with my kinky, curly, thick hair and straightening products. I had been using the products in a jar made for black hair. That stuff smelled like crap, and made my hair dry and brittle. This particular product did the best on my hair. My hair comes out straight and smelling nice. Sure you have to comb the hair straight and make sure you rinse it well - just follow the directions. After using this straightener for a few years now, I am very pleased with the results. Especially since I have never burned my skin, even without using petroleum jelly around the scalp. I have \\&quot;good hair\\&quot; now - shiny and straight.</li>
    <li> It helped my curly hair but didn&#x27;t completely straighten it.</li>
    <li> This was amazing works excellent very ,,,,,, easy but block your nose</li>
    <li> I have mixed race hair.  Tiny little frizzy spirals that could not be tamed with even the most expensive gels, creams, anything.  Until I tried this in 10th grade...&lt;br /&gt;It was my miracle product.  No more flat irons, heavy gelling, hats when it was raining, rushing to the nearest mirror to tie it down with bobby pins after the humidity attacked it-- nope, just a lovely head of soft waves only needing a quick combing twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The good times didn&#x27;t last forever....&lt;br /&gt;About a year and a half ago, I happily went online, ordered this perm, and got it on my head for my bi-yearly treatment.  As soon as I washed it off, my soft waves were replaced by crunchy, hard twists bent in all kinds of crazy angles.  Even after a double conditioning, hair mask, and a few homemade remedies, my hair was still doing a fine impression of the bristles on a ratty toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been a while, and although half of my natural hair has returned, I still can&#x27;t wait for the day I don&#x27;t have to use the bottoms of my ponytails for scrubbing the grime off of pans.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, BE CAREFUL IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS NOWADAYS!! I checked my package, the date was fine.  I even got myself another pack 4 months after just to see how a strand test would do.  That strand was hard enough to be classified as a weapon T_T</li>
    <li> just what she ordered</li>
    <li> Great product to smooth and straighten your hair. Been using it for years!</li>
    <li> when the lable says usable on all hair types, that was a very true statement. for thicker/longer hair, i recommend using two boxes</li>
    <li> This product works great on my fine, very curly, frizzy hair. I do not do my whole head...only bangs and few wispy front pieces. Perfect so I can wear my hair up in Summer months but have the hair around my face sleek and smooth. If you follow the directions and start out leaving product in for minimal time you should have no problem.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  My hair is soft and straight (no frizz).  Exactly what I wanted.  Tried getting my hair straightened professionally (very expensive) and I like Ogilvie much better.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product works great to relax too much curl in your hair.  I have always used it, however where we live now, which is very rural, I cannot find it.  Good price, fast shipping.  Thank you for filling a need for folks like me who don&#x27;t have a lot of shopping options and for doing it at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Genuine exactly like the original from the box.. shipping is excillent..thanks</li>
    <li> dried my hair out. won&#x27;t use again</li>
    <li> This was for all hair types but it didn&#x27;t work for mine. I used it according to the directions. I wish I could of rated this better.</li>
    <li> Good to straiten mildly curly hair easy to apply, makes your hair feel dry so be careful</li>
    <li> even though it worked on straightening my hair it ruined it so I had to go to a hair dresser anyways:/</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and it did not do it for me. It was straight for about 4 hours...just a little sweat brought back the curls.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I used. I did leave it in longer because I wanted to make sure my hair came out straight. I will definitely use this product again. It works better then karatin. Also, it stays straight and does curl when wet or washed.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and just wanted to relax the curl over the summer when I have to fight high humidity. I didn&#x27;t want to lose all the curl so I only kept it on for minimal time- worked great but wish I could use it again before my beach trip but have to wait 3 months.</li>
    <li> worked great and it was so easy to apply i had no problems with it ,i would definitely recommend it for anybody</li>
    <li> This product not only fried my hair, but made it so frizzy that I&#x27;m embarrassed to be seen in public with it. DO NOT BUY THIS HORRID PRODUCT</li>
    <li> excellent for soft curly hair.</li>
    <li> My natural hair is very straight but I recently got a perm at a local hair salon thinking I wanted curly hair for a change. The process was painful, long and awful at the salon. After tolerating the way too tight and unmanageable mess my hair became I decided to go back to my natural straight hair through whatever means possible. I was wary that I would melt my hair off from over-processing it or doing something wrong but i followed the instructions and I have my hair back! Quick and cheap and does the trick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times before. It can be found at Walgreens. It&#x27;s great when you just want some curl straightened. Your hair is still left with lots of body. Using this once or twice a year will suffice if you don&#x27;t want your hair too straight. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is THE best permanent straightener. I have used this many many times and have never had ANY breakage. My hair looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great product,  fast shipping</li>
    <li> Didnt work for my hair and ruined the natural shine on it. Its been 2 wks and hair came back to curly. Worst buy ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must be because its cheap. First time use of a straightening product and it was the worst. I read other straightener you have to flat iron hair to make sure its straight. This one I knew wont work because yoou only use a comb to straighten hair. The worst part is it hurts because you are pulling your hair while it has the product on. I felt I lost a thousands of hair wen I did this.</li>
    <li> So glad to be able to find this product as it works so well for me ...</li>
</ol>
