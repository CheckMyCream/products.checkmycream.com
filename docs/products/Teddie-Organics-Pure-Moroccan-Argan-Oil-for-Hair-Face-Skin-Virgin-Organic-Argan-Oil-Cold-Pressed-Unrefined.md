<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived quickly and it is exactly as described. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a substitute for another organic product that I was purchasing from a Vitamin Shoppe and I like this one better. It has a natural scent and it works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argan Oil for just a few days and notice that my skin feels smooth, soft and perhaps a bit brighter too.  With continued use, I hope some wrinkles will disappear.  I really like this Argan Oil.  Also, the seller has been very responsive in following up to make sure that I&#x27;m satisfied and I am!</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil on my skin for over a year because I love the results I get - clear skin, that is smooth moisturized, and increased in firmness. I have experimented with a variety of brands from very expensive to cheap. I will continue to use Teddie Organics because of their excellent customer services, high quality product and reasonable price. THANKS!  Lyn</li>
    <li> Lovely!  It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything (a big plus, I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents) and it absorbs very quickly into skin, hair, and scalp.  I mixed a few drops of this with lotion yesterday and used it all over and my skin is soooooo soft now, but not greasy.  As many stars as possible to this!  Expensive, yes.  But you don&#x27;t need a lot for the results, and I would rather spend a few extra bucks to go organic and support a family business.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery &amp; nice packaging.... All good! Thanks</li>
    <li> I was offered this product at a reduced price.  I share that with you because I&#x27;m one of the few people that hadn&#x27;t incorporated oils into our lives. Many of my girlfriends have been posting about the oils they use and the amazing benefits... It took a little nudge but now I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m here!  Organic Argan Oil has become part of my relaxation &amp; get ready prep with my little girl.  We&#x27;ve focused on using Argan Oil in the morning - first we wash our faces, dry and then gently massage the oil on our face and neck.  I say we use it in the morning because we also use another drop or two and run our oiled fingers through our hair -- It helps with fly aways!! My daughter has super fine, VERY curly hair. Adding product can weigh it down or make it crunchy only to leave it looking a little &amp;#34;bozo&amp;#34; like at the end of the day. Yet with this product it really doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down, make it greasy or have an undesired look at the end of the day.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and recommend it to you for dry skin, to aid in the reduction of fine lines and help with fly aways!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I used this on a dry spot I had that has been bugging me for over a month and it left my skin so soft and pretty much instantly cleared up the dry patch. I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this oil, makes my hair feel soft and shiny, not greasy. I have thick curly hair and they get dry and frizzy this oil works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to use as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s quickly absorbed by the skin and it feels great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Zapped my babys small eczema outbreak quickly. Great facial moisture...soaks it quickly without any greasy residue. Restored my cracked hands from frequent handwashing overnight. Will definitely repurchase and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Attentive sellers and fast shipping.  This is my first time using argan oil, so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality compared to other argan oils, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I tried using a cheaper  argan oil but it just wasn&#x27;t right..I decided to go back to a better , more expensive oil. A BIG difference I  use it all over  every other shower and my skin is wonderful, no dry spots, reduced wrinkles and the elasticity is 100 percent better.</li>
    <li> Always used Josie Maran prior to purchasing Teddie.  Equally as good and more for your money.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Quality organic argan oil</li>
    <li> Its good to use if applied in small quantity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using different kinds of oils for my hair, face and body and Argan Oil is one of them. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Teddie Organics Organic Argan Oil and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I&#x27;ve used this oil after I cleanse my face before I apply moisturizer. This Argan oil makes my face smoother and softer. I&#x27;ve also used it on my cuticles and nails, which I have to admit were a mess. I&#x27;m not one to do my nails or anything so they are abused. After a few days of using this Argon Oil on my cuticles, they looked 100% better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Argan OIl on my hair. I&#x27;m kind of a no nonsense woman when it comes to hair styles. My hair is long, past my shoulders, just long enough put in a pony tail. What I hated most about my hair, especially in the winter time, is right after I wash it, when it dries it&#x27;s all fly away and frizzy. Since I&#x27;ve started using this on my hair after I comb it out after my shower, my hair really looks a lot better and I can control it better. It&#x27;s so much better than it flying around every where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I highly recommend this Argan OIl for anyone that has a need for this multi-purpose Argan Oil. I love it and I bet you will too.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this for quite some time now but, honestly, I could not pay that high of a price. Then I found the Argan Oil on Amazon and, being a prime member, I could FINALLY get it!! Then I came across the GREAT opportunity to try this to review and could NOT resist!! I mainly wanted to get this for my uncontrollable frizzy hair. When I read up on this, I was even more convinced to try it when I found out it&#x27;s Organic and NOT just for frizzy hair nor dead, broken ends but also can be used as a moisturizer for sensitive skin, and as a nail strengthener. It&#x27;s has so many versatile uses it is well worth the cost. Not to mention, you only need a couple drops so it lasts a while making it the more worth my while. Upon reading the ingredient (notice that is NOT plural), I was astonished to find it is pure, unrefined, organic, Argan Oil!! (Most everything I have come across before, has so many ingredients that you can barely pronounce, I did NOT want to put it in my hair let alone on my skin or nails!!) My hair is so soft now, next to NO frizziness after just a couple days!! I cannot speak highly enough of this Argan Oil!! I WILL continue to use this on a daily basis for as long as they continue to make it. (I received this product at a discount but this review is solely my opinion and the information provided is based on my personal experience.)</li>
    <li> I have used Teddie Organic products in the past and I love them! They are 100% organic and unrefined so you know you are getting a quality product. I really like the Argan oil because it has so many uses. I like to use it on my hair to help keep it strong and give it a nice healthy shine. I also like using it on my face. My dry skin just soaks this amazing oil up and keeps my skin hydrated and gives it a healthy glow. I like the eye dropper style that this comes in so I use only what I need and none of it gets wasted. This is really a great product. The statements made in this review are solely my own and I was happy to receive this product to test and give my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Argan oil. It does wonders for my skin and hair. I use it on my face at night after cleansing and wake up to soft, moisturized skin. I apply it to my hair daily and it leaves it shiny and silky soft. It only takes a few drops to cover your entire face. I use a squirter full for my hair because I only need a light coating. The best feature of the bottle is the squirter. It keeps me from being wasteful with the oil. It also makes the oil stretch farther. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell so it can be easily mixed with your favorite essential or fragrance oil to have a lasting aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about a week as my everyday moisturizer.  I wanted something simple, organic and easy to use and this fills the bill nicely.  It is soaked in immediately by my skin and does not leave an oily shine.  I love those two qualities because you don&#x27;t often find them together.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell.  But it fades away almost immediately and at least you know there is not a fake ingredient in it that is going from you skin to your bloodstream.  The product arrived quickly and in good condition.  So far this is an ideal moisturizer for me.</li>
    <li> Lovely oil!  Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil by Teddie Organics is great! My husband has very dry elbows so when I was offered this product during a promotion I was happy to test it out. After using the Argan Oil for two weeks we REALLY see an improvement in the skin on his elbows. Before, his elbows were very grey in color and would bleed during the coldest days of winter or when he got caught in the wind for a long period of time. The skin on his elbows would catch things like blankets and shirts and rip. Now, the color is coming back to his skin! He has not had issues with his elbows bleeding for the last week and a half. I am REALLY thrilled with this product, because he feels so much better and is not complaining about pain and discomfort any more. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Works as described and at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have used other Argan oils due to the fact I work in a day spa. I really liked this product. Not only did my skin feel better, healthier ..my nails and hair did too. It absorbed well so I didn&#x27;t feel greasy. People around me made comments about my skin looking wonderful. very happy.</li>
    <li> This is the second product I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using by Teddy&#x27;s organic products. Like the other, this one did not disappoint either. Argan oil works so wonderful on my dry coarse hair. It makes it so smooth and shiny. I put this product in my damp towel dried hair. Unlike other products, this rand do not leave my hands all sticky. My hands were actually so so soft that it made me wonder what it would do for my skin. I had to find out, so I applied it to my face, neck, chest and arms. Just like my hair, my skin was so very soft. The fact that this brand is 100% organic is a bonus.  This is a great product, and I highly recommend this, and other teddy product. This is my honest unbiased experience, and opinion with this product as a result of receiving it at a promotional, discounted price.</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service. The seller sent email to confirm that product had arrived and was satisfactory. Will absolutely order again.</li>
    <li> Not sticky. Absorbs quickly, but the moisturized feeling stays for hours, especially if you use it on freshly washed skin &amp; hair.  No strong smells. No allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems to like it even more than my hair does.</li>
    <li> During the past year, I have done a lot with essential oils and trying different kinds and seeing what effect they have on my hair. Argan oil was one I had not tried yet(and boy am I kicking myself now), so when I was offered a sample to test for quality before it was released to the public, I could not say no. Using coconut oil as my carrier, I added Argan oil as well as a few other essential oils that I had been using, and my hair never felt so soft! And when I started to get flyaways, I just rubbed a few drops in a dallop of cocnut oil it did a great job at combatting frizz. I also added a few drops of this oil to my deep conditioner and loved the results. However, argan oil is not only good for your hair, it is good fr you skin and nails as well. It can be rubbed into the cuticles to moisturize them and placed on the skin to combat fine lines. I also loved that it had a dropper cap. It makes it so easy to control how much you are using, and trust me, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, with the wrong products I break out in a rash.  I&#x27;ve used this organic Argan Oil and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth, I have not had any type of reaction, I&#x27;m sure its due to the organic ingredients used.  I&#x27;ve also had a problem with a very itchy and dry scalp and since applying a few drops each night before I go to bed it has made a big difference in the feel of my scalp no more itchiness and no more dryness.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the rave reviews and i am extremely disappointed. It stinks to high heaven!! It smells like a barnyard! I asked my boyfriend to smell it and he said it smelled like &amp;#34;cows and goats&amp;#34; i tried it despite the smell and i just cant get past the smell.. I would not use this again nor would i recommend it to friends or family</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Great high quality organic argan oil.  I have used this daily and have had wonderful results on my skin.  Highly recommend any product from this company!</li>
    <li> Just started using it. Seems to be working as planned!</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair, face and dry nails.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I really love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> Lovely oil. Works well on skin and hair</li>
    <li> I love it and have many uses!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but my face looks healthier already. The dropper is great. After microneedling my face, I just smooth four or five drops in an upward motion and I&#x27;m done. If I keep seeing great results, all of those other creams and lotions will be taking a trip to the garbage can!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just gotten on the Organic bandwagon lately. I used to think it was a bunch of hogwash until I started seeing results in my body and skin using and eating organicly. This product works great in my frizzy hair but too oily for my face. It does have a scent that I&#x27;m not very fond of but I still use it anyway on my legs. It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing. The multiple uses for this product are truly your preference. I swear by it for my hair. It no longer breaks. Thanks Teddie for the special opportunity to test your product at your Amazon launching. Congratulations on another fine product. My advice would be to work on fragrance. This is solely my opinion.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is nature&#x27;s miracle oil. It&#x27;s great for skin and hair. This argan oil was provided to me by teddie organics. I&#x27;m very very happy with this oil and seller. The oil comes in a dark Amber colored bottle with an easy to use dropper. Very little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair and its a great natural frizz controller. Will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has a mild scent but it works wonderfully in dry skin and hair to heal it quick. I have been using it for almost a month and will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> A girlfriend of mine has the most amazing skin and healthy shiny hair-when I asked her what her secret was, she said she uses argan oil on her face and hair every day. I saw this product on Amazon and decided to order this particular brand since it was reasonably priced and organic. After receiving the oil, I began using a few drops on my face and skin after showering and in my hair before drying. I could tell an immediate difference in moisture and shine. Not only do I love this product, Teddie&#x27;s customer service is beyond outstanding! I have never received a personal email from a company checking to see how the package arrived and how I liked their product. I will definitely reorder from this company in the future and will recommend to my friends to order from Teddie Organics! I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Favorite argan oil, on hair with lavender oil, all dry skin areas, and mixed with other e.o&#x27;s for face</li>
    <li> I love argan oil it leaves my hair so soft and shiny and it has also helped with my split ends and to keep my hair more straight&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this oil it is very thick but once you blended into your skin or hair it disappears and does not leave a greasy&lt;br /&gt;Very nice, I love it</li>
    <li> I use this to mix with rose hip oil from teddie organics and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!  A noticeable difference in my skin (face) after the first application—unlike most products you buy out there on the market.  You can’t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I finally found an argan oil that smells, looks, feels, and works like argan oil should when it&#x27;s correctly cold-pressed and pure! I&#x27;ve tried so many in an attempt to match my delight in JM argan oil products. I also know argan oil isn&#x27;t obtained easily and cheaply either though, again, if done correctly. I have not been happy with the varieties I&#x27;ve ordered recently, and legit reviews are being drowned out by those that receive free products for leaving the reviews. I HAVE NOT received or been offered anything! I can say my complicated skin is happy with this oil, and I really like the mix of it with a quality rosehip seed oil. Argan oil is noncomedogenic, and it&#x27;s also safe for oily skin, which surprised me when I opted to try it for my rosacea in spite of my adult acne and oily t-zone. Argan alone can dry out already dry skin, so the blend with rosehip works wonderfully for me. There are other options for your skin specifically, or this may work on its own. Its great for hair too, though I am stingy and save it for my face/neck/derrière.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still just getting started with this, but the first thing I noticed was that it smells like, well, feces. I&#x27;ve been diluting it with another oil before using it to reduce that factor, but unless this stuff literally works miracles, I&#x27;m definitely not reordering. Not sure if the bottle I got had something wrong with it or if everyone else just doesn&#x27;t notice the smell as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Very Hydrating! This is great for dry skin during the winter months. I also tried some on my hair and it made it feel silky smooth. It also has a money back guarantee! Not many companies give that anymore. I have been very impressed with Teddie products and own several of them!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product that I got when it was discounted.  It&#x27;s great for you hair, skin or nails and is 100% satisfaction guaranteed. I use it after a nice hot shower and it just soaks into my skin. It has a nice light smell too so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of other products that you might use. It comes in a nice bottle with an eye dropper for getting just the right amount that you want to use. This product is 100% Argan Oil and that is hard to find in many products on the market. This review is solely my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try this product because out of all oils I have used this one I never tried. I decided to put a few drops of it in a oil blend. I used it several times to oil my scalp. I have used products with organ oil but by itself it gave me perspective on how it works. I loved the way it made my scalp and hair feel. I will definitely repurchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to gush over products usually but this stuff is AMAZING. I use just a drop or so in my hair which gets flat and lifeless looking in the winter and it brings it back to life! I don&#x27;t know--I guess it&#x27;s just really moisturizing because it makes my hair look shiny and healthy. Woo-hoo! I gave some to my mom to put on her cuticles because she always has trouble with her nails and she&#x27;s thrilled with it also.  This is the real deal--I just started using it on my face and it already feels smoother and younger.  Great price and a little goes a really long way.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out 100% Argan Oil on my face as part of my skincare routine. I had read a lot about how great Argan Oil is for your hair/skin. I am on a budget and didn&#x27;t want to purchase a 1 oz bottle for nearly $50!!! I ordered the Teddy Organica because it was the most affordable. I&#x27;ve been using the product on my face at bedtime and in the morning as a moisturizer (3-4 drops for my entire face and neck) for about 1 week now. So far I have not had any reactions.. No breakouts whatsoever. So far am liking it. I will most probably order from them again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I really love anything Argan. This organic Argan Oil is great. It is made organic. Use it on your skin or hair.</li>
    <li> Wow. I don&#x27;t even know where to start.  This is my first argan oil purchase and I am glad I chose this brand because it is organic.  I used this on my face after cleansing and before eye cream and moisturizer.  I am in my late 20&#x27;s, female, normal or combo skin, and I have red pimples on my chin, every once in a while I&#x27;ll get one on the rest of my face.  At the time when I first tried this, I had a cluster of 3 raised, red pimples on my right jawline by my chin. I washed my face, then applied this oil all over it.  In the morning the pimples looked smaller and almost like they were starting to &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; even though this oil is moisturizing and not drying.  I really love it.  I love how soft it makes my skin, I love how it soothes it, I love the pleasant smell.  Next I will try it in my hair, but mostly I will use this on my face every single day.</li>
    <li> I was hoping since it said it was 100% argon oil this would be a nicer oil but it&#x27;s really not the fragrances not nice consistency is not nice it&#x27;s not reacting with my skin and hair well I hope that it&#x27;s just me and that it works well for anyone else who tries it</li>
    <li> LOVE Teddie Organics products!!! I got rose water from them first- so could not pass them by when I was looking for Argan Oil! I use organ oil on my skin and on my hair for deep conditioning/moisturizing. Some of it has funky( to say the least) smells that I can&#x27;t stand- but I use them anyway because of the healing properties. This one amazingly enough does NOT smell funky!!! YAY! Great oil, great quality, I will gladly buy again. I totally trust Teddie Organics- can&#x27;t wait to try more stuff they make!!!</li>
    <li> The winter weather does not like me and I tend to get really dry itchy patches that wont clear with any moisturizer I have purchased; I normally just have to wait out the winter months so my skin will clear. So, when I received this product I wanted to know what it would do for my dry patches on my skin. (As you can see from the photos, those red dry patches look hideous and can be quite bad). The first day I applied the oil I was very pessimistic; I was thinking &amp;#34; another product that is not going to work&amp;#34; , but it was worth a try. I applied the oil in the morning and the spot brightened even redder in color as the Argan Oil absorbed into my skin. The spot was smoother to the touch; but my big question was &amp;#34; is this going to work.&amp;#34;. I applied it at night and in the morning as the directions suggest. I became more optimistic by the second day when the color of the spot was lightening and it was not itchy like before. By the morning of the fourth day the spot has lightened greatly and it is going away!!! I am excited to say I have found a product that will work for those dreadful dry patches and I no-longer have to worry if people see my legs. (who wants everyone to be looking at their dry blotchy legs when wearing a dress.)  Teddies Organic Argan OIl can also be used for unruly hair that is dry or flyaway; just apply a little to your hair when its damp and it will work all day to tame your hair.I did try this; though I forgot to take photos and it worked for my flyaway little hairs that like to stand up even when I use my flatiron. This is Awesome and I would gladly purchase this product again! This product does have a slight scent to it which actually dissipates quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest opinion and review of this product.</li>
    <li> I have never tried Argon oil till now and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My favorite use for this oil is on my hair. I have naturally wavy hair and at times it can get really frizzy, as if I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. Just a little drop or two works wonders. I put it in the palm of my hands and massage it through my hair, into the ends. It&#x27;s been less than a week and it has already diminished the look of spit ends. I washed my hair this morning and didn&#x27;t have time to blow dry it, so I used a few drops on my wet hair and let it air dry. My hair looks fabulous. ;-) I&#x27;ve also read somewhere that it can be used with your make-up foundation. I tried it with my foundation stick. I put one drop on the top and used a foam blender to apply it on my face. It went on smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s amazing! I was given this item on promo and I&#x27;m so glad I took advantage of it.</li>
    <li> This oil keeps my skin nice &amp; smooth.  It&#x27;s easy to apply just a few drops--a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice.  It melts into my face very well.  Also have been using on my cuticles.  Wonderful consistency.  I was excited to be able to try this during a product launching promotional period.  Will definitely order from this brand again.</li>
    <li> I like this product because its organic. I use other Teddie product and like it a lot!  I think that the result from the product is unexpected.  Argan oil is should be equal or about the same but this product I actually like it better.  I like the texture of it.  I recommend this product and recommend the brand.</li>
    <li> This  oil is great and able to used in many different ways. It only takes a few drops and does not leave an oily feeling. I was so lucky to be able to get this at a super price and am so glad. I have used it on my face after washing, cuticles and hair. It works great! Would definitely give this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I have been using oils instead creams, lotions or serums, those are very expensive and many of them contain harsh chemicals, we not even know what we are using in those products anymore, one safe product is oil, it is the purest form of a nut, seed, fruit or vegetable. I am using Argan oil, besides others. Teddie organics Argan oil is 100% USDA certified pure (that is peace on mind) the results are wonderful on my hair and skin, I am happy and pleased with this product. The Argan oil in it&#x27;s pure form has a slight smell, it&#x27;s not that bad! but is bothersome for many persons, to be honest the smell lingers just for a few seconds and dissipate completely, if the Argan oil will smell like flowers or having a pleasant smell would not be as pure as the manufacture will proclaim, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was happy to get this product during a launch promotion.  I have used it a few times since receiving it.  I use it on my face at night, after cleansing.  The oil Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, and I like the consistency of it.  It&#x27;s winter here and we have some arctic below zero weather that really just pulls the moisture out of my skin.  This oil helps fight the dry skin on my cheeks.  I have even used this on my son&#x27;s scalp.  Oh, I love the dropper applicator too.  Makes it easy to use the amount I want.</li>
    <li> Organic Argan Oil will by my new go to skin and hair conditioner.  I prefer all natural products when possible. Being new to oils I am experimenting with ways to effectively use them.  Since I am new I like this bottle came with the dropper.  I did not have to invest in a dropper.  During the cold winter months my hands will crack open and bleed.  At times they get so bad they are covered in open sores.  I usually invest in a lot of time and product to treat them.  I started putting a dab of this on the front of my hands at night before going to bed.  I immediately my dry skin felt the soothing relief from the oil.  After a couple nights use I can tell a huge difference.  This will be a staple in my medicine cabinet. Taking a chance I wanted to see how this would effect my daughters thin curly hair.  Her hair will tangled as soon as it&#x27;s brushed.  I added a few drops to a little spray bottle.  I was able to work the tangles out by spraying her hair and then adding a concentrated amount on the tangle itself.  I was provided this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  I am happy with it because it worked for me so far.  I can not wait to see how else I can use it.  The oil is hydrating so it is not as greasy as some oils.  I also like that it does not have an over bearing scent.  Most of all I prefer organic and natural when possible.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:88fd76c22a2d142e797b455363ef10b8]] This is my first time trying argan oil, I heard good things about Argan oil and thought I will give it a try. I started using this about a week ago and I am surprised how nice it is, it absorbs easily on my skin, helps hydrated my skin completely, I used it for my scar too, it is lighten the scar and I am sure if I apply it regularly, my scar will fade away. It really works, Great product I must say! I was glad that I bought this argan oil with special discount for testing purpose.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly.  Comparable to oil that costs 4x as much.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I used this Argan Oil on my 93 year old Mother&#x27;s scalp and it worked like a charm! Great Product great customer service! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and this brand! I noticed a difference after using it one time on my hair. I have extremely frizzy hair but this oil calms it right down. I have also been using it on my face as a moisturizer. I think it&#x27;s well worth the cost. The sellers are very personable and love to answer any questions you have.  P.s. I have used other oils and other brands and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I got the oil in secured packaged. It looks the same as the picture shown. Argan oil has great benefits for your hair. Happy to have got this at a good price.</li>
    <li> Very affordable and quenches my skins thirst for moisture. I&#x27;ve also used it on my hair with beautiful results! This is definitely a must in my routine.</li>
    <li> I had very dry skin and this helped a lot without any irritation. I liked it very much</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft after using Argan oil</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; I love this oil - it&#x27;s great for the skin and absorbs quickly. I have found that natural forms of anti-aging work so much better than the packaged creams with ingredients you can hardly pronounce. Love the stuff &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have several products from Teddie Organics. It is  a great company with excellent customer service. They stand behind thier products 100%.&lt;br /&gt;This Argan Oil is wonderful. I have curly, frizzy, thick hair. I need all the help I can get to keep my curls defined and the frizz at a minimum. This does the job! There is a dropper attached to the lid, which makes distribution easy. After showering, I simply puit 4-6 drops on my scalp and comb it through. I will put a few drops in my hands to massage the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;There is a noticeable difference using Teddie Organics Argan Oil. I was using a spray with Argan Oil prior to this that i had purchased a at a big box store, recommended  to em by my hairdresser. There is NO comparison here; Teddie Organics has one ingredient - Argan Oil. That&#x27;s it. Much better than the other product which,  in hindsight, actually dried my hair not moisturized it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Teddie Organics products, particularly this Argan Oil. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. If anyone is looking to soften and define curls while reducing frizz, this stuff WORKS.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised at how big the bottle was. It was perfect, i opened it and the smell was different but that&#x27;s how i knew it was truly organic.. so excited that this is my moisturizer very natural and a very light oil not too thick.. this was an awesome product at such an amazing price</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Argan Oil!  I color by hair every few months and it leave my hair dry and frizzy.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about the frizziness or dryness anymore!  I just apply a small amount of this Argan Oil in my hair and VIOLA! my shine is back.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy looking.  I make sure to pay attention to applying more on the ends and not so much towards the roots of my hair as the lower half of my hair is what needed the most help.  I would absolutely recommend this to my fellow frizzy hair friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for a truthful and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this evaluation are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I feel like the Teddie Organic Argan Oil - 100% USDA Certified Pure Cold Pressed Moroccan is a good oil.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used it on my face.  I have to use a CPAP machine with the nasal pillows, and for some reason in the winter my face gets really chafed even while using my normal facial products.  Even though the Argan oil is an oil, it rubs in and doesn&#x27;t stay feeling oily.  It barely has a smell if any at all.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using it on my hair which also needs a little tender, loving care during the winter heat.  My hair is coming out really bad and is feeling brittle even though I&#x27;m using a good shampoo and conditioner, so I&#x27;m researching which ways are the best to use the Argan oil for my hair.  I have long hair, so I need to figure out if I need a carrier oil or how it will be best to do this.  Even without using the Argan oil anywhere except on my face, I&#x27;m happy with how it&#x27;s helping the chafing on my face.  I believe it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I have dry, thin, naturally curly hair and I live in a really humid climate. I have so much trouble controlling the frizz! But this Argan Oil works great. I warm it up and rub it in my hands, and run my hands through my hair, and it helps to tame the frizz. This oil is light and thin, so it isn&#x27;t too thick or greasy for everyday use. My hands also get super dry from working in the hospital and from the winter weather. This gets absorbed into the skin without leaving a slick or greasy feel. I loved reviewing this product - it has so many uses and is so high quality. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hubby to rub some into his beard!</li>
    <li> Where has this oil been all my life?..I use this on everything,my hair,face,nails,and it made my extremely dry feet soft and supple once again,thank god..I love,love,love this oil!!!!</li>
