      <li>I should point out that I have allergic reaction problems with many scented products, but never with Dove&#x27;s soaps.  </li>

      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I love Dove&#x27;s scented soaps.  </li>
      <li>It smells great without being overly perfumed and it really moisturizes.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice and smooth when applying it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was a relaxing and lovely experience that lingers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using Dove bath bars for many years, and never had any problems.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent is overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>but I would prefer non fragrance just to be on the safe side.</li>
      <li>I love Dove products...</li>
      <li>But for me, I LOVE the smell of this soap.</li>
      <li>Refreshing, but not like a perfume soap.</li>
      <li>love Dove soap, and if you have never given it a try, you should.</li>
      <li>I love soap.  </li>
      <li>, so it&#x27;s mostly about the smell and</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel, and usually I love the scents.</li>
      <li>I had to read the box as I couldn’t name the scent, mandarin and tiare flower, but I love the combination of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>It is an especially good choice with the recent below 20 below zero wind chill factor - which is obviously very drying for skin even with good protection from gloves and jackets.</li>
      <li>I liked immediately was the cool touch of the bar when it slid from the box.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes the pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although the soap is strongly scented, I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming or unnatural.  </li>
      <li>This Dove beauty bar has a sweet, pleasant fragrance, smelling like the fresh bloom of fragrant flowers.</li>
      <li>Most important, I&#x27;ve had no redness, or any skin reactions noted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to find a fragrance that is clean and not too floral -</li>
      <li>just wish the smell lasted longer because I liked it so much!</li>
      <li>When I held it, it fit like it was custom designed to fit in my palm.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, if scent plays an important factor in your soap selection, you will want to sniff before you buy.</li>
      <li>but it still smells fabulous.  </li>
      <li>BUT if you enjoy showering and having your senses awakened by a juicy fruity smell, then this soap will not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>This latest scent is so fresh, and not overbearingly fruity.</li>
      <li>My wife and I tried this free sample out</li>
      <li>I love Dove products and even though this Go Fresh is for women based upon scent</li>
      <li>It makes a good lather and does a good job of cleaning without being harsh.</li>
      <li>It is more feminine in smell than masculine but nice nonetheless.</li>
      <li>has a nice fresh and somewhat potent smell straight out of the box.</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of Dove products for many years; my mother used there classic bar soap when I was a child so the Dove brand is very familiar to me.</li>
      <li>The soap lathers well, rinses cleanly, and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>soap has a rich lather that feels luxurious.</li>
      <li>After using, there is only a very light and very pleasant scent left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and has a lingering scent after my shower.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does a good job cleaning as soaps go, and does not dry the skin out.</li>
      <li>Dove has always been a good brand when it comes to non-drying soaps (it was recommended by name by the dermatologists who I worked with in medical school years ago) and that reputation is well deserved.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I could do both, as the parcel had arrived with 2 boxes, 2 full size bars.</li>
      <li>This new one has a lovely floral/citrus smell, very fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Trying this new (new for me) Dove was like meeting an old trusted friend who introduces you to something wonderful and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty strong but fades quickly and for us smelled like citrus fruit /</li>
      <li>I quickly washed my hands with one to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin too much, but the 1/4 moisturizer composition was just great for me, so I used it in the shower later and really liked the way my skin smelled and felt.</li>
      <li>I really like getting this type of product at a reasonable price and easily purchased - many scented soaps</li>
      <li>As with all Dove soaps it leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed about the bar was the scent, reminiscent of the original Caress bar soap, which I loved.</li>
      <li>Glad to have found and tried a new scent to mix things up.</li>
      <li>like the soap, and have to say that if you order a soap that says it has a &amp;#34;vibrant scent&amp;#34; in the descriptions you really can&#x27;t complain that the scent is too strong.  </li>
      <li>Then I realized how decorative was the bar itself - smooth curvy lines like a dove&#x27;s wing, a deeply inset shape of the dove, and a beautiful deep peach color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is still the same great Dove soap, just with a new color and scent.</li>
      <li>I just wish the scent was a little stronger because it is so nice and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Dove Go Fresh Revitalize Bar, 4 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fresh Revitalize Bar with mandarin and tiare flower scent</li>
      <li>Dove Go Fresh, Mandarin &amp; Flower.  </li>
      <li>The Dove go fresh Revitalize Bar</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>It is smooth and dense just like the classic bar.</li>
      <li>This one adds a little color and a pleasant fragrance though.</li>
      <li>This particular Go Fresh Revitalize Bar has a pleasant scent, but it is pervasive; not exactly overpowering</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s fantastic, and gives your entire bathroom a light, citrus smell, even when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
      <li>am here to report that this stuff smells pretty good (a little soapy, but the mandarin fragrance is relatively light and not overwhelming in the morning), and lathers up nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wakes you up first thing in the AM to shower with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all, it&#x27;s soap.</li>
      <li>It is invigorating first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perfect for after a workout, or on a hot summer</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is great stuff, if you wash your face, your arms your legs especially if you have dry skin, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft and clean feeling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I highly recommend Dove for especially women. For me doesn&#x27;t irritate even with the fragrance but I would prefer non fragrance just to be on the safe side. Dove has always been a great product. My skin is never dry and itchy</li>
    <li> The women in my family use Dove products but prefer the scent-free products. This particular Go Fresh Revitalize Bar has a pleasant scent, but it is pervasive; not exactly overpowering, it nevertheless was detectable through the shrinkwrapped package before I opened it, and the scent fills a small room. The soap lathers well, rinses cleanly, and leaves skin feeling smooth. However, if scent plays an important factor in your soap selection, you will want to sniff before you buy.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. My wife will switch to this. It helps with dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> I love Dove products and even though this Go Fresh is for women based upon scent and I&#x27;m a man, I totally did it.  I mean there isn&#x27;t one negative thing I could say.</li>
    <li> This is a good gentle bar, with a nice smell to it. It makes a good lather and does a good job of cleaning without being harsh. It delivers on its promise of being revitalizing.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizing soap that I got  from Vine for my wife. It smells great without being overly perfumed and it really moisturizes. I wash my face prior to shaving, and it really seems to make a difference on the gentleness of the shave. Granted, it is to make women more beautiful... but don&#x27;t we guys deserve a little pampering too? Great Bar Soap!</li>
    <li> As a guy, I typically just get the &amp;#34;original scent&amp;#34; variety of Dove bars of soap.  However, given the opportunity to try this scent, I didn&#x27;t find it off putting.  And my girlfriend might prefer it which is always a plus :)  It works just as well as the &amp;#34;original scent&amp;#34; variety of Dove.  Not to be confused with Dove chocolate bars!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the bar was the scent, reminiscent of the original Caress bar soap, which I loved. Then I realized how decorative was the bar itself - smooth curvy lines like a dove&#x27;s wing, a deeply inset shape of the dove, and a beautiful deep peach color.&lt;br /&gt;I was torn. I wanted to display the bar in a soap dish by the sink and not use it except for guests, but I also wanted to luxuriate in a tub with it. Thankfully, I could do both, as the parcel had arrived with 2 boxes, 2 full size bars. I quickly washed my hands with one to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin too much, but the 1/4 moisturizer composition was just great for me, so I used it in the shower later and really liked the way my skin smelled and felt. With my busy schedule, I have to schedule luxuriating tub baths, but it&#x27;s on my calendar now. I&#x27;m glad to find a fragrance that is clean and not too floral - just right.</li>
    <li> My wife and I tried this free sample out and we were impressed. Dove has always been a good brand when it comes to non-drying soaps (it was recommended by name by the dermatologists who I worked with in medical school years ago) and that reputation is well deserved. It is an especially good choice with the recent below 20 below zero wind chill factor - which is obviously very drying for skin even with good protection from gloves and jackets. The scent is pretty strong but fades quickly and for us smelled like citrus fruit / not at all disagreeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommended product.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve never used Dove before as I thought it was just the same as all of the rest of the bar soaps out there, but after using it, I have changed my mind. It&#x27;s so nice and smooth when applying it. My skin feels amazing after using this. It&#x27;s so soft and clean feeling. I never realized it before, but other bar soaps leave a film behind after rinsing off, but Dove feels so pure and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind. Next, I really want to try the exfoliating bar!</li>
    <li> I love Dove products... and I really liked this soap.  I just wish the scent was a little stronger because it is so nice and refreshing.  Dove always leaves my skin feeling smooth and it&#x27;s gentle - unlike some other brands that leave my skin feeling stripped.  Highly recommend - just wish the smell lasted longer because I liked it so much!</li>
    <li> This 4 ounce bar has a great smell.  I had to read the box as I couldn’t name the scent, mandarin and tiare flower, but I love the combination of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up nicely and rinses off easily.  Dove’s signature curved bar fits nicely in my hands.  My skin feels clean and has a lingering scent after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as in all Dove products, this bar provides extra moisture for my skin which in winter is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are tired of winter, need some extra moisture for your skin and are looking for a nice scent, this Dove bar, Go Fresh Revitalize, will fill the bill.</li>
    <li> If you are familiar with the classic Dove white bar of soap, this bar will be familiar in feel. It is smooth and dense just like the classic bar. This one adds a little color and a pleasant fragrance though. It is more feminine in smell than masculine but nice nonetheless.</li>
    <li> This Dove beauty bar has a sweet, pleasant fragrance, smelling like the fresh bloom of fragrant flowers. In addition, it makes a creamy, moisturizing lather. I have very dry skin, and my skin feels relieved, and smooth like silk after using this bar. Most important, I&#x27;ve had no redness, or any skin reactions noted. I have been using Dove bath bars for many years, and never had any problems. I like the fragrance of this one, and how good my skin feels after each use. I will be ordering a few bars to stock up on. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love Dove&#x27;s scented soaps.  I really like getting this type of product at a reasonable price and easily purchased - many scented soaps are overly expensive and sometimes the scents aren&#x27;t even that great, plus they can be difficult to find in stores.  This new one has a lovely floral/citrus smell, very fresh and clean.  I should point out that I have allergic reaction problems with many scented products, but never with Dove&#x27;s soaps.  It&#x27;s great to be able to enjoy the pleasant smell without worrying about my allergies.  An all-around wonderful product, and I plan to buy some myself once these two bars are used up.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest: soap is half about fragrance, and half about how it feels. It&#x27;s going to get you clean-ish no matter what, so it&#x27;s mostly about the smell and sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here to report that this stuff smells pretty good (a little soapy, but the mandarin fragrance is relatively light and not overwhelming in the morning), and lathers up nicely. Like many Dove products, it&#x27;s not over-drying, which is great. Added bonus: the curved shape of the bar fits great in my hand, and slides over ye olde bode quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All &#x27;n&#x27; all, a solid scented soap from Dove.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Dove Go Fresh cucumber and green tea bars for years.  So, when I saw this new fresh scent, I had to have it.  Yes, the scent is a little strong, however not any stronger than the cucumber scented bars.  As matter of fact, I took off the outer cellophane wrapper around the two boxes of bars, and left them in my towel closet for a few days until we were ready for a new bar of soap.  I couldn&#x27;t smell them when I open the closet, so I don&#x27;t think the scent is overwhelming.  Glad to have found and tried a new scent to mix things up. We use Dove because it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue after using.  This is still the same great Dove soap, just with a new color and scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not certain this soap smells like mandarin but it still smells fabulous.  If you don&#x27;t like scented soap, then skip this one BUT if you enjoy showering and having your senses awakened by a juicy fruity smell, then this soap will not disappoint.  I actually thought of keeping the soap box stored with my towels so they would pick up the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the soap is strongly scented, I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming or unnatural.  I just found it relaxing and pleasant. It lathers nicely and rinses off well.  Unlike other reviewers I did not have a problem with being left overly scented after bathing but perhaps it is because we have a whole house water softener that insures that there is no residue left on us when we bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the soap, and have to say that if you order a soap that says it has a &amp;#34;vibrant scent&amp;#34; in the descriptions you really can&#x27;t complain that the scent is too strong.  If you like vibrantly scented soaps (think Vitabath) then you are going like this soap.  It&#x27;s like regular Dove, with a scent boost.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Dove products for many years; my mother used there classic bar soap when I was a child so the Dove brand is very familiar to me. These Dove Go fresh bars have a nice citrus scent and they definitely don&#x27;t dry out my skin like regular soap does. If you are already a Dove fan you will be pleased with this soap!</li>
    <li> We have been using Dove for years - ever since our children were little. Everyone was having some major problems with dry and chapped and sometimes bleeding hands, especially during the winter months. Our doctor recommended we start using Dove to wash our hands with, and it worked! We&#x27;ve tried other soaps, but keep returning back to Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Go Fresh Revitalize Bar with mandarin and tiare flower scent has a nice fresh and somewhat potent smell straight out of the box. It&#x27;s somewhat floral but &amp;#34;is not girly&amp;#34; as my son describes it. After using, there is only a very light and very pleasant scent left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is a brand that we&#x27;ve come to trust over the years. It is fantastic for keeping hands (and other parts) moisturized and soft. We are thrilled there is another delightful scent to choose from making Dove even more delightful to use!</li>
    <li> Dove Go Fresh, Mandarin &amp; Flower.  2 Bar Soap.  I love soap.  It is a necessity, and I have to have it anyway, so therefore, I can indulge in it without feeling guilty.  This particular soap is mandarin and flower scented.  It smells so good.  It is a luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is an awesome brand of soap.  The scents of this soap is just so awesome and refreshing and the mandarin makes it citrusy.  The flower gives it an awesome floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> This smells exactly like the old ZEST used to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wakes you up first thing in the AM to shower with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for after a workout, or on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole bathroom smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it isn&#x27;t drying, just like regular Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new scent in Dove, try this.</li>
    <li> Dove Go Fresh Revitalize Bar, 4 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff, if you wash your face, your arms your legs especially if you have dry skin, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;br /&gt;You can use Cold Pressed Evening Primrose oil also, for skin smoother than a baby’s ______.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, Baby.&lt;br /&gt;THE GUNNER, JAN. 2015</li>
    <li> My wife really likes the pleasant scent. It does a good job cleaning as soaps go, and does not dry the skin out.</li>
    <li> Great soap, has a nice mild citrusy scent. It was a bit drying for wintertime, which is why I deducted one star. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased with this soap. As usual, it&#x27;s a mild soap and if you have used Dove before and you like it; you will like this one as well.</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s soap. It cleans well, so I&#x27;m not sure what more you need to know. But for me, I LOVE the smell of this soap. It is invigorating first thing in the morning. Refreshing, but not like a perfume soap. More natural, but different. Hard to explain. I really like it, and being Dove, it does add moisturizing to your skin. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is as &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; as I do using many other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Dove soap, and if you have never given it a try, you should. I think you will like it as well!</li>
    <li> This Dove moisturizing bar combines the exotic scents of mandarin and tiare flower. Tiare flower is a type of gardenia from Tahiti. The scent is subtle and lovely. I put the empty soap box in my lingerie drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has a rich lather that feels luxurious. It made my skin feel silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked immediately was the cool touch of the bar when it slid from the box. When I held it, it fit like it was custom designed to fit in my palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying this new (new for me) Dove was like meeting an old trusted friend who introduces you to something wonderful and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a relaxing and lovely experience that lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely.</li>
    <li> The main thing about this soap is the smell... if you happen to like it (I do), it&#x27;s fantastic, and gives your entire bathroom a light, citrus smell, even when you&#x27;re not using it. It doesn&#x27;t overpower your entire bathroom, but works almost like potpourri or a diffuser--a faint but noticeable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the soap itself, it&#x27;s like any other Dove soap (which happens to be the only brand I use). It&#x27;s less drying, more gentle, and less overpowering on your skin than most soaps. The odor on your skin is super-faint; no different than any other soap.</li>
    <li> Dove has yet to disappoint me with their soaps and body washes. This latest scent is so fresh, and not overbearingly fruity. The citrus scents give you a nice pleasant scent to start the day. As with all Dove soaps it leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh, and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have been a Dove soap user for quite some time. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and usually I love the scents. The Dove go fresh Revitalize Bar is no different. However, unlike my current bar, this go fresh scent can be a little overwhelming. I am not super sensitive to strong smells, but this scent sometimes can even be a bit much for me. While this bar works like any other Dove bar I have tried, for now, I will be sticking to my current scent as it is a bit lighter.</li>
