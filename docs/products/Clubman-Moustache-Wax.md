      <li>It works great!</li>

      <li>Nice transaction.</li>
      <li>Liked the product</li>
      <li>I just wish I had longer mustache hairs to more effectively use this.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better mustache waxes, it also smells nice.</li>
      <li>The color of the dye is a good match, but I would prefer a true neutral wax.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I use it every morning.</li>
      <li>I love the brush that came with this</li>
      <li>My husband had been to all the beauty supply folks in our area, and many calls</li>
      <li>, so am glad it can be ordered on line.</li>
      <li>I love this mustache wax but did  not read that it was a color.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It will wash out in your coffee or draught beer, but it tastes okay.  </li>
      <li>He was sooooo pleased he could get this.</li>
      <li>I do have more gray at the end of the day, but if I brought the tube along with me to work, it would be easy to touch up.  </li>
      <li>I especially appreciated being able to order it in a variety of colors.  </li>
      <li>Not bad!</li>
      <li>This wax goes on easily, has practically no aroma, and comes in a variety of tones.</li>
      <li>It holds well and is easy to shape.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub off easily or run.</li>
      <li>Its easy to apply</li>
      <li>EXTREMELY easy to apply &#x27;stache wax.</li>
      <li>is that the hold is undeniably strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It actually smells kind of good (eucalyptus maybe?).</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant, but something I will have to learn to like, as most do when learning to appreciate a well hopped brew.</li>
      <li>light brown.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that is actually does work well.  </li>
      <li>Great color blends way better with dark hair-</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this is good general purpose wax that is inexpensive and comes in a assortment of shades to fit your hair color.</li>
      <li>This is a good general moustache wax.  </li>
      <li>it was my fault i did nto realize it came in different colors which is a good thing, and i Have a salt and pepper mustache</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still okay, but be sure you purchase the actual color which is closest to what you want.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>The clubman moustache wax is high quality, low priced, and does a great job.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive, easy to use, and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>The coloring part is pretty cool though.</li>
      <li>MAKE SURE you get a color that closely matches your natural color (or a non colored one).</li>
      <li>The sonicare is too powerful, and splatters.</li>
      <li>It may not mesh with my morning coffee aroma&#x27;s right away.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>These sometimes want to curl or go not lay the right direction.  </li>
      <li>The small comb that comes with the wax is also very handy.  </li>
      <li>It seems you have to wear more to get it to stay and definitely not after a shower when your hair may still be moist.</li>
      <li>This wax worked quite well at first, however it did not hold as well as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Even steam from a hot soup can degrade it.</li>
      <li>it works very nicely, but when I stay outside for more than a minute or two in 90 degree plus heat, the wax loses its ability to hold shape.  </li>
      <li>I am also surprised that it really doesn&#x27;t wipe off all that easily during the day.  </li>
      <li>Going to have to spend some real money on real wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Looks much darker out of the tube than it applies.</li>
      <li>If you are going to be spending much time outdoors in the heat, I&#x27;d recommend a harder wax like Firehouse Wacky Tacky.  </li>
      <li>Clubman&#x27;s restores a very natural (and easily controllable amount) of brown back into my mustache.  </li>
      <li>By this, I mean, your hold will suffer, but a quick once over with a mustache brush, and it&#x27;s back to being a good boy.</li>
      <li>It did hold decently well.</li>
      <li>Bought the chestnut color even though I&#x27;m a strapping young lad with plenty of light brown and red beard hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have dark brown hair and like strong odors, this might be for you.</li>
      <li>This wax may not last you the entire day, but it lasts me pretty much the whole day!</li>
      <li>A little warm water around the tube makes the wax even easier to work with, while allowing you to use every last bit of it.</li>
      <li>Must be very old.</li>
      <li>Right away it was a little too pliable, but hardened within the time it took to right this review thus far.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>The downsides are it smells for a couple of hours until it the volatiles all flash off, and it has a definite brown color that happens to mostly match my mustache hair, but not exactly.</li>
      <li>It is a good wax except for the coloring is a little to dark for my hair color.</li>
      <li>I have never used any product like this, so this is new to me, but so far the styling of my &#x27;stashe has been manageable after letting the wax settle for a bit on my &#x27;stashe.</li>
      <li>Dark brown and clear also available.</li>
      <li>Shapes an \\&quot;in between\\&quot; mustache and lightly colors my 65 Year old grey mustache hair to a younger looking (64?)</li>
      <li>using a sonic toothbrush instead of the tiny brush that comes with Clubman, cuts application time by more than half.</li>
      <li>Make sure to get a color that is very similar to your natural color or else it will look a bit odd .</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t glop it on because I want it to look somewhat natural.  </li>
      <li>Can apply directly out of the tube with no pre-heating or warming needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very much like lemon oil soap (for wood) or some other cleaner.</li>
      <li>Not only did it stink it has tallo which is cow fat right under your nose.</li>
      <li>If it gets wet at all, it really hinders the wax.</li>
      <li>As first time user on new moustache, the Clubman seem to perform well though not able to retain the short hairs as this relatively early stage of use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Mainly when your hands are wet, you&#x27;re eating, or out in the rain or snow, the moisture will ruin your style.</li>
      <li>(By the way, a see a major mascara company now sells their eyeylash wax with a similar vibrating bush.)</li>
      <li>I just put it under the hot tap for a few before using.</li>
      <li>I have a graying, light brown mustache and the Chestnut color is a little dark, but I still use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does come as a brown color which is nice because it thickens my mustache hairs like mascara and darkens them because some of my mustache hairs are blond, thin, or just not as dark.</li>
      <li>This is a water soluble product, so you can apply it to your crumb catcher wet for a gentle hold, or pack it on the dry lip broom and shape those bars to an eye piercing</li>
      <li>If your beard hair is thin, this will be fine.</li>
      <li>I just put a little in some of the gray areas and brush it in really well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If your beard hair is thin, this will be fine. Thick beard? not enough hold and that it has doesn&#x27;t last. The coloring part is pretty cool though.</li>
    <li> I just wish I had longer mustache hairs to more effectively use this.</li>
    <li> As first time user on new moustache, the Clubman seem to perform well though not able to retain the short hairs as this relatively early stage of use.&lt;br /&gt;The only worrying thing was I failed to wash out the small plastic comb they provide on the last time I used it and the next day the plastic comb section was all melted and twisted.&lt;br /&gt;This did not inspire confidence as to what it was likely to be doing to my moustache hairs. Has anyone else had this issue ??</li>
    <li> The cap broke really easily, but otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> Mustache wax is just hard to find locally. This is good stuff!  Shapes an \\&quot;in between\\&quot; mustache and lightly colors my 65 Year old grey mustache hair to a younger looking (64?) light brown. Dark brown and clear also available.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My &#x27;stache has been graying for years and products like \\&quot;Just For Men\\&quot; hair coloring dyes are way too harsh for me.  Clubman&#x27;s restores a very natural (and easily controllable amount) of brown back into my mustache.  It&#x27;s very inexpensive, easy to use, and lasts all day.  A little warm water around the tube makes the wax even easier to work with, while allowing you to use every last bit of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clubman Moustache Wax in auburn. It has a little brush/comb that comes with it.  I use this product for my eyebrows.  It does a couple good things.  It keeps the eyebrow hairs in the correct position.  I have some hairs that feel a little thicker than others.  These sometimes want to curl or go not lay the right direction.  The mustache wax hold them in place.  I also have a few hairs that are lighter than the rest of my brow. I purchased the auburn color. It makes all the hairs the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product in the heat.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off easily or run.</li>
    <li> The clubman moustache wax is high quality, low priced, and does a great job.  Shipping and delivery were on time with no problems.  I would recommendthis product 100%.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Others might like it but I did not. It turned my beard and mustache dark brown and had a smell I did not care for personally. It did hold decently well. If you have dark brown hair and like strong odors, this might be for you. I will pass.</li>
    <li> Try this. I&#x27;ve found that (I kid you not) using a sonic toothbrush instead of the tiny brush that comes with Clubman, cuts application time by more than half. And it&#x27;s a lot neater. Be careful. The sonicare is too powerful, and splatters. I&#x27;ve had best luck with the Cybersonic toothbrush. The brush head is completely flat, which speeds up application.  (By the way, a see a major mascara company now sells their eyeylash wax with a similar vibrating bush.)</li>
    <li> Bought the chestnut color even though I&#x27;m a strapping young lad with plenty of light brown and red beard hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;Decent hold&lt;br /&gt;smells like fruity pebbles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;application brush handle broke taking it out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;brush is very scratchy and bad&lt;br /&gt;hold has to be reminded that it&#x27;s supposed to hold. By this, I mean, your hold will suffer, but a quick once over with a mustache brush, and it&#x27;s back to being a good boy.</li>
    <li> this works well enough.  it tends to flake off towards the end of the day and they sent me the white version instead of the chestnut I ordered so it looks like I have dandruff in my &#x27;stache.  No big deal tho. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The wax was exactly what they said, great quality and made me look like the coolest hipster ever for MoVember!</li>
    <li> Wax doesn&#x27;t keep its hold.  Keep having to reshape stache.  Is really hard to get it to not look like dandruff in your mustache. I&#x27;m Looking for a stronger wax to tame the hairs, and one that blends into the hair.  Might work for someone with white mustache and hair already growing in the direction u want.</li>
    <li> I ordered approximately 10 Clubman Moustache Wax Chestnut products. I received 3 that were chestnut and 7 that were dark brown. I sent the 7 back and have yet to hear from anybody. In all probablity I was ripped off times 7. BE CAREFUL !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, have used it before</li>
    <li> Not strong enough. Hold lasts about 5 minutes. Going to have to spend some real money on real wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually smells kind of good (eucalyptus maybe?).</li>
    <li> This product has been on the market for years, i have used it for years, often can not find it it stores, at least the color i want, so am glad it can be ordered on line. It works great!</li>
    <li> Got as a joke tease my son, who has a an occasional grey intruder in his otherwise brown mustache. Unamused, he left it here. Maybe I will try to grow &amp;#34;handle bar&amp;#34; eyebrows to test its efficacy. Will let you know.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it every morning. It works all day if you use a good amount, and it has a nice smell to it.the smell goes away after about an hour, if your concerned.</li>
    <li> I have a reddish-brown mustache that has some areas that are completely white now.  I was skeptical about whether this would work and/or look right and I&#x27;m happy to say that is actually does work well.  I don&#x27;t glop it on because I want it to look somewhat natural.  I just put a little in some of the gray areas and brush it in really well.  I then use the clear/neutral one to give my mustache overall styling.  The color in the tube is totally weird, but it somehow works for my mustache.  I am also surprised that it really doesn&#x27;t wipe off all that easily during the day.  I do have more gray at the end of the day, but if I brought the tube along with me to work, it would be easy to touch up.  I also bought the brown, but haven&#x27;t seen what it looks like yet.</li>
    <li> It works good, once you get use to applying it. I have a graying, light brown mustache and the Chestnut color is a little dark, but I still use it.</li>
    <li> This wax goes on easily, has practically no aroma, and comes in a variety of tones. It holds well and is easy to shape.&lt;br /&gt;I marked it down one star because the cap is weak (the center cracked- allowing the wax to dry out), and (on another tube) the side punctured as I rolled it up.</li>
    <li> Totally happy with product.</li>
    <li> This is a good general moustache wax.  I especially appreciated being able to order it in a variety of colors.  The small comb that comes with the wax is also very handy.  I use the comb even with other moustache waxes that I have bought.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t hold up well in extreme heat.  Indoors it works very nicely, but when I stay outside for more than a minute or two in 90 degree plus heat, the wax loses its ability to hold shape.  If you are going to be spending much time outdoors in the heat, I&#x27;d recommend a harder wax like Firehouse Wacky Tacky.  Otherwise, this is good general purpose wax that is inexpensive and comes in a assortment of shades to fit your hair color.</li>
    <li> Stuffs great for curling yo&#x27; stache. Beware of the colored kinds, it will leave the mustache looking painted on. Get the clear/white kind and rock that stache out. Smells great, I&#x27;ve been tempted to eat it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my &#x27;stache in about the place where I put it at the start of the day. Not bad!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough, but it doesnt seem to hold as well as I would like, partly because it is water soluble, I think. I have to pinch and twist my hairs together so that they all support each other, otherwise, they fall down because the wax isn&#x27;t enough to hold them. If it gets wet at all, it really hinders the wax. Mainly when your hands are wet, you&#x27;re eating, or out in the rain or snow, the moisture will ruin your style. Even steam from a hot soup can degrade it. It seems you have to wear more to get it to stay and definitely not after a shower when your hair may still be moist. Don&#x27;t dry it with a hair dryer, though! That&#x27;s bad for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come as a brown color which is nice because it thickens my mustache hairs like mascara and darkens them because some of my mustache hairs are blond, thin, or just not as dark. It adds a lot of volume to a mustache that is sparse.</li>
    <li> Nice transaction. Liked the product</li>
    <li> Husband uses this and I can&#x27;t find it in the local stores.  good deal</li>
    <li> Not only did it stink it has tallo which is cow fat right under your nose. I wanted to throw up. Also not much of  hold.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly.  It is great for my beard.  Keeps the ends of the stache out where they belong.  Color works for touch-ups between beard dye jobs.  I had read where the smell was bad but smells kinda clean and citrusy to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since the 70s(okay I bought some in the seventies the &#x27;stache didn&#x27;t come in until the eighties) it worked then and it works now.  This is a water soluble product, so you can apply it to your crumb catcher wet for a gentle hold, or pack it on the dry lip broom and shape those bars to an eye piercing point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will wash out in your coffee or draught beer, but it tastes okay.  The decision to drink with a straw is entirely yours, just remember you look kinda stupid either way.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better mustache waxes, it also smells nice. MAKE SURE you get a color that closely matches your natural color (or a non colored one).</li>
    <li> Works great. I just put it under the hot tap for a few before using. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> Must be very old. Very difficult to squeez product out of tube</li>
    <li> It is a good wax except for the coloring is a little to dark for my hair color. Its easy to apply</li>
    <li> my friend was growing out his &amp;#34;mousestash&amp;#34; and i figured id get this for him, went over well and i lold</li>
    <li> Product as described, my only problem and it was my fault i did nto realize it came in different colors which is a good thing, and i Have a salt and pepper mustache and i got the chestnut.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell at all. It&#x27;s very much like lemon oil soap (for wood) or some other cleaner. It&#x27;s not what I want to be smelling all day!</li>
    <li> EXTREMELY easy to apply &#x27;stache wax. The tint of color works well for us &amp;#34;graybeards&amp;#34;  Looks much darker out of the tube than it applies. Can apply directly out of the tube with no pre-heating or warming needed. Not the strongest holding wax out there, but I don&#x27;t think its intended to be. The &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; comb is a joke, throw it out upon opening package.</li>
    <li> Once I opened the product  I was curious if the color (chestnut) was going to stand out against my hair color. After reading review&#x27;s I only knew not to get the neutral colored wax, as it seems to stand out against darker colored hair. I have brown hair on my head, so that&#x27;s what prompted me to go with chestnut. A good choice from what I see. It blends in well.&lt;br /&gt;  The odor of this product is something that will take some time to get used to. Not unpleasant, but something I will have to learn to like, as most do when learning to appreciate a well hopped brew. It may not mesh with my morning coffee aroma&#x27;s right away.&lt;br /&gt;  I have never used any product like this, so this is new to me, but so far the styling of my &#x27;stashe has been manageable after letting the wax settle for a bit on my &#x27;stashe. Right away it was a little too pliable, but hardened within the time it took to right this review thus far.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t understand the brush yet. Do I wash it with soapy water after every use, or is it even necessary to use every time? Experience will tell me.</li>
    <li> My husband had been to all the beauty supply folks in our area, and many calls so I typed it in the browser and chose the one he uses. He was out and didn&#x27;t want a white mustache. He was sooooo pleased he could get this. Thanks. And timely too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is gross. It stinks for ages after you put it on. It leaves your moustache a big congealed lump of sticky hair. The only this it&#x27;s got going for it is that the hold is undeniably strong. Your stache will stay put, but at a price.</li>
    <li> I think I purchased this product on the assumption that the Chestnut color was close to the Brown shade.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s still okay, but be sure you purchase the actual color which is closest to what you want.</li>
    <li> This wax is all I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t know how others compare, but it seems to work well, keeps the stache in place all day, even when it gets bumped.  The downsides are it smells for a couple of hours until it the volatiles all flash off, and it has a definite brown color that happens to mostly match my mustache hair, but not exactly.</li>
    <li> Comb is a little on the flimsy side. Didn&#x27;t need the wax but what are ya gonna do? But seriously, the comb works well.</li>
    <li> This wax may not last you the entire day, but it lasts me pretty much the whole day! Not too stiff but holds well. Make sure to get a color that is very similar to your natural color or else it will look a bit odd .</li>
    <li> This wax worked quite well at first, however it did not hold as well as I had hoped. I curled the ends of my mustache with it and it worked superbly for about an hour before my curls began to droop.</li>
    <li> The wax is good.  I find it much easier to apply than the hard waxes and it holds well.  The color of the dye is a good match, but I would prefer a true neutral wax.  The wax can stain shirts.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps hide the grey in my beard !</li>
    <li> I love this mustache wax but did  not read that it was a color.  I am still weighing in on if I like my grey mustache to be brown</li>
    <li> Wax seemed a little old/drier that I expected.</li>
    <li> I love the brush that came with this and I would recommend buying it just for that. The wax was a little greasy for my taste because it just made my moustache look gross and overly waxed. I bought this and Firehouse Moustache wax. I use this brush from this and the firehouse wax and I love it!</li>
    <li> Great color blends way better with dark hair-</li>
