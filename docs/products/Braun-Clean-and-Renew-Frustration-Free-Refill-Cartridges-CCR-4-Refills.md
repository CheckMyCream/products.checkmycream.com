<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and the cleaning system is excellent. I like how easy the clean up is. While it is not fun to have to continue to buy these refills, I still feel it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Good value. I am still rocking a 7540. Braun makes a very good shaver and I would not buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Its better than  new I think the cutters are sharper than the original I have a thick coarse beard cuts like butter and I  even Use it  to shave my head</li>
    <li> They work. They seem to dry out faster than they get used up.&lt;br /&gt;But i have to use them tho keep clean.</li>
    <li> exactly the right cleain solutionfor my razor and its quite a bit cheaper than buying it at walmart. got here pretty quick too.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with my automatic shaver&#x27;s cleaning unit and the price was very reasonable. I recommend this product for use with the Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> This product is a must with the Braun Series 8000 Shaver (and other models).&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the refills and the speed in which they were received.  Being able to sign up for automatic shipments means I will never have to worry about running out of the cleaner for this razor.</li>
    <li> I switched to Braun more than 25 years ago, and have never seen any reason to try, let alone buy) any other brand.  The addition to the other attractions of a self-cleaning machine that really works is great.  I&#x27;ve been using my cleaner/shaver for years with never a need for any tech help. The cleaning fluid is well-housed and easy to insert when it&#x27;s time to put another one in.  Altogether, a well-designed and well engineered piece of necessary equipment.</li>
    <li> Best price at Amazon.  Have used it for 4 years and is simply excellent.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the product and the supplier, and will continue to order the refills from them.</li>
    <li> This refill makes it easy for you to clean your razor and keep it working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Relieves Braun razor owner of chore of maintenance by automatically cleaning and lubricating in the \\&quot;washing machine\\&quot; base that comes with the razor. If you replace cutting comb every year or so (Braun, of course, says every 6 months), each shave will feel almost like a new razor shave.  You can also brush out the razor head, brush out the comb under running water and let it dry overnight for a similar effect, but doing it every day feels like a chore.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the best and quickest way to get these refills, if not exactly the cheapest.  The products really do the job, but do they ever run out fast!  Sometimes I think I&#x27;m putting Braun into a new tax bracket with all the refills I need for this machine.</li>
    <li> Gives a smooth close shave with no skin irritation.  I have had some problem with solution leaking out of the bottom of the&lt;br /&gt;clean and renew station. I don&#x27;t know what causes this.</li>
    <li> The razor these are for is great.  The cleaning process works well.  I just with the cleaning solution was cheaper.  Before I bought this product I found a recipe to mix the solution yourself.  I wish I had saved it.</li>
    <li> This is the way to go if you have a Braun shaver. Quick and easy to change. No fuss, no muss.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun electric, they keep it clean! They last long enough, the price is not too bad. I think you definitely want to get your high quality products, clean and smell fresh razor every time you use to get what you pay!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it cleans and lubricates the razor in one step (charge and clean the razor once a week).</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. My shaver feels clean and new every time I use it. I shave everyday and clean it every single day as well.  What I find works well is to remove the cutting head and then gently tap the extra hairs out into the sink before sending the shaver through the cleaning cycle.  This way the solution stays clean an entire month, and I have not had significant issues with evaporation.  Love the smell and cleanliness!  To all those cheapos trying to create their own solution: You may damage your $300 shaver in an attempt to save yourself $4.  If you skimp to this extreme, you have no business buying this shaver in the first place...</li>
    <li> Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills--this one was a gift along with the entire shaving set  and the whole thing is amazing.... These are wonderful.    Basically this product is used to clean and lubricate the  Braun electric razors. The price at which it comes is affordable and they do last for a long time....    If the razor is very dirty then it is obvious that we need to clean it using a brush and then use the cleaner to make it look perfect and the next time you use the razor it looks like new. Even otherwise you can just tap the razor after the shave and the extra hair falls off and then if you go with the cleaning it works well..    This happens especially if we go out on a vacation where you do not spend time on cleaning your razor.. Just save the cleaning for the latter part... Only then I found accumulation of dirt of bits of hair... but otherwise it is fine and this cleaner works well. ....    The odor is quite manageable but it  keeps the razor shiny and clean. The cleaning also helps maintain a close shave.</li>
    <li> For the longest time I was bitter than I had to buy replacements to clean my razor. But after reading a review on Amazon, someone suggested taking the cartridge out and sealing it back up when not in use. Since I started doing that (only inserting the cartridge to clean), these last forever... based on that, this ends up being a great price.</li>
    <li> These packs do what they say and they are great. However, they are designed to be disposable and don&#x27;t last long BUT --- there is a way to make the most of them. Instead of buys these packs, you can purchase denatured alcohol from your local Home Depot store. Take a spent cartridges and rinse it out of all the alcohol and collected shavings. Then allow to air dry while you use the next refill cartridge. Once dry and you need to replace a cartridge, fill the dry refill cartridge with denatured alcohol and plug it in. Clean and rinse out the other cartridge and allow it to dry. You can literally alternate between the two and spend much less then continuously buying refill cartridges. Denatured alcohol from Home Depot is much cheaper. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best improvement for maintaining ones electric shaver.  I have mine now for more than 5 years cleaning it with the solution  and together with replacing the cutter block every 12-18 months (depending on how much facial hair it cuts), my shaver is still working like it is brand new.  I don&#x27;t need to clean the shaver every day.  I clean it once a week and it is good to go.</li>
    <li> The Braun razor I purchased at the same time does not have the ability to use this product. It was sold as a package, the web site was not clear about the razor model I got. So they are usless to me, be careful you match model number to package deal.[[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]</li>
    <li> Have been using these Braun Clean &amp;amp; Renew Refills for several years now.  They do a good job of helping to clean the razor (after you get rid of the hair debris).  Used to purchase them at various stores especially if I could find them on sale, which was almost never.  I have watched their prices continue to go up &amp;amp; up.  Then one day I found them on Amazon at their Subscribe &amp;amp; Save area at a cheaper price, especially because this package comes with 3 refills which is a money saver.  The only negative comment I will make is that once opened, each refill only last about 30 days -- sure wish Braun could figure out a way to make them last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my electric razor... I have a fairly thick beard and dark hair, this is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned that I could use everyday.  I used to have to blade shave about every other day to look halfway clean shaven.  The self-cleaning function of the razor is one of those things that I just kind of felt like ok...  it&#x27;s there, but had absolutely no influence on my decision to purchase.  That said... this stuff is just too expensive.  If you use the self cleaning function all the time you are looking at probably $50 to $60 a year just to clean your razor.  I wish, as others who have reviewed this, that they would package up the fluid and let you just refill the plastic cartridges.  It&#x27;s probably the only negative I see with this razor after a couple years of use.  I will say though that it does do the job nicely.  I&#x27;ve run out of liquid and used the razor for a few days without cleaning and I could feel a difference.  Hence the title of my review, it&#x27;s the price that prompted me to give 3 stars, not the performance.  It does it&#x27;s job nicely.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
    <li> Does the job it is supposed to, but very expensive.  If I didn&#x27;t have two of these razors in the house to be cleaned, I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great Product-- always fully cleans my shaver head. I find my shaver always in mint clean state and ready for a fresh shave every morning.</li>
    <li> Gotta have em for your self cleaning Braun shaver! I \\&quot;pre-clean\\&quot; with a brush to extend the life of the refills. Great price Amazon!!</li>
    <li> The Braun Shaver with built in cleaning system is the first electric razor I could ever use consistently.  Purchasing the refills on Amazon is much less expensive than the local drug store.</li>
    <li> A clean shaver is a happy shaver. It also makes for a much better shave in the morning. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> The replacement cartridges are exactly what I was after. The price was good and when I compared the original C&amp;R cartridge, these replacements were exactly the same.  One little tip, you can extend the life of these for months by replacing the plastic cap on the cartridge. I simply pop up the holder, slide out the cartridge, replace the plastic hole caps and slide it back into the holder. I leave the holder extended and under the sink. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Good price but I hate that I have buy this product. I have had my razor for three years and have spent $12.00 a month for this product.I could have 2 new razors with that money.</li>
    <li> For anyone with a Braun electric shaver, these cleaning refills are a great price and they make your razor (if used on regular basis) feel like new again.  I only run the cleaning cycle twice per month but run the razor under running tap water in between the electronic rinse.  They are pricey in the retail drug stores but because the Braun  was a high end purchase in the first place I feel these refill clean cartridges are a small price to pay to ensure its longevity.</li>
    <li> good stuff but the charger plugs with hairs and this stuff flows over the top! I drilled larger hole to rectify the problem.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat buying these as a three pack.  The price is well worth it.  I use my clean and renew system everyday and at this cost I don&#x27;t worry about it.  My razor is always clean and ready to go.</li>
    <li> I think these things are too expensive for the function they provide (cleaning a razor) but the razor was given to me as a gift so I had to go with it.  Worse yet, I recently bought two packs of these &amp; the razor broke....  However, for those of you who bought a razor knowing about this function, it&#x27;s a top quality product and never had I never had any problems during the 8 years I was using them.</li>
    <li> Dont wast your time purchasing Braun products.  Unreliable shaver and cleaner.</li>
    <li> I used to loathe electric shavers, but this model has made me a believer. Anyway you slice it, shaving is expensive. These, however, are cheaper than buying 2 refills at any brick and mortar. No complaints.</li>
    <li> These cleaner work well and keep the blades on my razor clean and lubricated. The razor just works so much better after a cleaning. I do find that they do need to be replaced almost every month. This is probably because it is an alcohol based solution and evaporates more quickly than water. To avoid this problem I just save the \\&quot;lid\\&quot; and cap it when not in use. I usually only clean my razor every other day or a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> I usually refill my own with a combiation of rubbing alcohol and witch hazel but at around $3 each this was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> This solution is a must for the shaver. I bought the shaver for my dad and he loves it but the refills are pretty expensive so this was a super deal. I doubled up on this and will be giving it to dad for his birthday.</li>
    <li> Look, this is a great system.  By far, it is the best electric razor I have owned.  It has a great cut, and it cleans itself.  Nothing better could you ask for.</li>
    <li> For the price, I expected cheap, imitation, or substandard.  The product was none of the above, to my surprise (unless whoever is making these is ripping off Braun - possible, I guess, but I&#x27;d think Braun &amp; Amazon would jump all over them.)  Anyway, these are the same refills I bought for 30% more in the store.</li>
    <li> The Braun cleaning fluid I bought was fairly priced and arrived before it was expected.  And the stuff works.  What more can you ask?  Except, maybe, not having to shave at all.</li>
    <li> I received this product really quick!!! It was everything I had perchased. I will be ordering from here again!! No Regrets!!!</li>
    <li> The three pack of refills provide quick and convenient replacements and ensure a clean shaver, every time.  The three pack is economical, and they don&#x27;t spoil, so this is the best value I can find!</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled when I found these refills on Amazon. I went to the store where I bought the shaver and was advised that they did not carry ther refills. I went to several other stores with no success. In my frustration I dediced to go to Amazon....and viola....great price, perfect quantity and quick delivery......when you are purchasing this for your 89 year old father time is of the essence. This refill is critical to the functioning of the shaver......so THANK YOU for servicing the refill market.</li>
    <li> I would have to say the is the best price I have ever seen for these.  I would recommend buying a few of these at the same time to qualify for the free shipping.  This will enable you to keep the best price available.</li>
    <li> Received these very quickly although initially was informed there would be a 6-week wait. The price was excellent at $11.64 for 3 units, several dollars less than regular retail, and as I combined this order with other orders shipping was also free.</li>
    <li> The shaver was exactly as advertised, came sooner than expected and is an excellent value, especially compared to local stores and other net sites.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected. Good price, came on time and in good condition. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and the Braun 360 Complete and the CCR3 Refills are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish it didn&#x27;t take this long to find a shaver with such outstanding value!!</li>
    <li> It is silver and makes funny noises when it is cleaning.  It also generates heat. I dropped it once and the top popped off. It is ok though.  I will need to be more careful.</li>
    <li> This is a great system.  I bought it for my son and he has had nothing but positive comments.  The self-cleaning system is exceptional.</li>
    <li> Good stuff...I love the shaver and refills can become an issue for some people. Buying these is a good way to shave a little of the total cost.</li>
    <li> I purchased 5 Braun self cleaning shavers in a 8 month period and gave them away as gifts  for my sons and nephews after first purchasing 1 for me. everyone loves them and this cleaning cartridge is a big part of that. It takes all the work out of keeping the shaver sanitary and clean. we all agree these are the best shavers we,ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve kept my Braun shaver running clean for 2 years and I&#x27;ve NEVER bought refill cartridges.  Why?  Because the cleaning fluid is nothing but blue-dyed denatured alcohol that you can get for 4 dollars a QUART at a hardware store or Wal-Mart.  I&#x27;ve bought one can so far.  Dump your dirty cartridge and rinse with water a few times, refill with denatured alcohol.  They probably tell you not to refill because the stuff&#x27;s flammable and it eats up a big chunk of their business if you&#x27;re not buying cartridges.  Do the green, sensible thing instead.</li>
    <li> as I have said, this is exactly what I have expected...perfect</li>
    <li> These refills work just like the original package--they effectively clean and lubricate the shaver. Amazon also had the best price I could find.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the fact that you have to constantly buy these refills for the razor, however, if you have to get these the best deal is here. And save the trip to Target.</li>
    <li> The razor gives a great shave, once you learn how to use the features. The quick clean feature is appreciated. However, the large, bulky plastic cleaning/recharge station makes taking it on a trip almost impossible. The cleaning system uses alcohol, and must be replaced frequently - the directions say at least monthly. These refills are not cheap! I use the razor daily.</li>
    <li> maybe less irritation than panasonic/remington but does not shave closer than they do. actually my old remington  intercept shaves closer but is tough on the skin. the auto cleaner works well, though. very nice design and feel of quality but leaves stubble that is always removed via a manual razor. some faces may have better results??</li>
    <li> I found the product to be very helpful.  The ease of delivery was great. I would definetly use it again.</li>
    <li> I ended up having to return the Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver because I got a much better shave from the Gillette Sensor double blade , so I DID NOT use the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack).  And I was told I could not return the Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack) because it is a flammable liquid.</li>
    <li> This shaver/refill works really good.  Easy to clean/maintain, just a little pricey.  We&#x27;ve had this razor for several years and it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
    <li> No need to say this is the product I wanted. Buying was quick and easy. I received the refills in approx. 1 week. Would definately do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> The product works very well.  It keeps my razer clean and lubricated for long life.</li>
    <li> These cleaner cells keep the razor lubricated, from jamming between razor head change-outs, and are the best price i have found for them anywhere.</li>
    <li> YOU CAN THREE FOR LESS THAN THE PRICE OF TWO. KEEP YOUR SHAVER CLEAN AND OILED. SMELL GREAT TOO.</li>
    <li> Being able to order these Braun refill pack, receive them so qickly is very nice.  Much easier then getting out in the hot Texas weater to shop for them.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the razor this refill goes with.  Refill does an excellent job cleaning the razor each day.  When we travel we send one of the refills ahead of us so my hubby can use the razor.  The cost of these refills is well worth the cleanliness they give to the razor.</li>
    <li> 10-09-08    After searching for the best price and delivery service, Amazon.com was the only online store that beat all the other online stores.    In a struggling global economy we are in, every penny I can save I am grateful and thankful Amazon.com does save me on every product I buy from them. Thank you  Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> These do the job and are the same as that which came with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Great product and with the free shiping what Amazon offers it is the best price on the net.</li>
    <li> No electric replaces blades but this one is excellent for taking the rough look off</li>
    <li> I save money using the subscribe &amp; save subscription for this item.  It&#x27;s cheaper than buying it at the store and it&#x27;s delivered for free.  I have being getting refills this way for over a year now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing just how much dirt these things collect. They don&#x27;t last as long as I would&#x27;ve liked, but they really do the job.  So overall, this is a great deal.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> It is a good shaver my husband liked it better than any he has ever had before.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me a Braun 360 a year ago and this is the best investment ever</li>
    <li> The Braun Refill is necessary for the cleaning-shaver system to operate.  The cleaner fluid lasts 60-90 days, and the 3-refills offered in this product work well.</li>
    <li> Since I only clean my razor about once per week and empty hairs manually every couple of days I suspect they are evaporating inside the system base.  Fluid level is down 1 LED from full and I&#x27;ve only cleaned my shaver twice with it.  Not a very efficient system but does get the razor mostly clean and smelling fresh.  Easy to change when it&#x27;s empty but expensive for the convenience you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> The product performs as advertised;however, it is pretty expensive but worth it for  the convenience!</li>
    <li> My sister bought the shaver 4 years ago and my dad wouldn&#x27;t use it.  Now at 93 he is nicking himself with the regular razor.  I looked everywhere for the Braun refills and found them here on Amazon for the best price.  Just what I was looking for.  They work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this item at local stores, even those that sold Braun shavers but Amazon carried it. This product is basically a lemon scented alcohol mixture that cleans and lubricates the Foil and Cutter Block. I only clean the shaver every five shaves and you can tell the difference in how it glides over your face after the skin oils are removed from the Foil. If you have sensitive skin I would recommend cleaning after every three shaves.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com makes it easy to replace parts of my husband&#x27;s Pulsonic razor.  I order a 3 pack once every 3 months.  One cassette a month usually does it.  My husband raves about his razor&#x27;s performance, and how well these cleaning cassettes do the job!</li>
    <li> I received the item in a timely manor and am pleased with this seller. will buy again.  Thank you.  Ev Hall</li>
    <li> GREAT product,GREAT service from Amazon in placing order and delivery, GREAT electric razor to use product to clean it.  In ending, from beginning the order to using the product everything was JUST GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I am glad that I&#x27;ve purchased this unit designed for Braun shaver/cleaner system.  The very best part i like about this system is that it&#x27;s easy to use, simply insert and go.  Got this previously at Walmart and found it for sale cheaper here in Amazon.  Each one of these refills lasts approximately 2-3 months, and I have not experience any skin irritation/inconvenience ever since.  These are definitely great units to get</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 7 Series Braun (760 I think?) for over three months now. I use the cleaning cycle about every other shave and it lasted almost three months. It definitely keeps the razor clean and smelling fresh. I was surprised actually. I had just assumed that when the indicator told me it was time to replace the cartridge that it meant it was empty. It was not empty at all. But it was no longer blue and I could see TONS of my tiny facial hairs floating around. Yuck! But this is why the clean &amp; renew system is worth using. I&#x27;ve read that some people cap their tank after every cleaning to keep it from evaporating. I did that for about a week before I gave up because it was too much of a hassle. After all, half the reason I use an electric is because I&#x27;m lazy. So maybe I lose out on an extra couple of cleaning cycles but to me it&#x27;s not worth the trouble. Just buy a three pack which should last 6-9 months.</li>
    <li> I hate having to buy these, because you are essentially paying for a piece of filter material and some alcohol. Still, once your shaver goes through the cleaning cycle, it comes out feeling brand new, and shaves like new as well. The liquid contains a lemon scent and some lubricant for the razor, and the end result is almost worth the high price.     To get a better deal, use the Amazon subscribe and save option, I get mine shipped every 6 months, and save 15%.</li>
    <li> Each one of these refills lasts about 3 months. My husband shaves every day, occasionally twice. He&#x27;s had no issues with infection or irritation.They are certainly convenient to use.</li>
    <li> It makes a big difference when your electric razor is clean.  It cuts better and doesn&#x27;t drop whiskers all over the counter.  I make sure my Braun razor is always as clean as it can be by ensuring that there&#x27;s a Clean &amp; Renew refill in the base.  And I&#x27;d never consider buying my refills anywhere but Amazon.  They&#x27;re reasonably priced and delivered right to my door.  You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I purchased this through subscribe and save for use with my Braun 790 system. I am very happy with the shaver, but I really like how it automatically cleans and smells fresh every time I use it. This item does ship slower than other subscribe and save items because the contents are flammable, which is understandable. They must ship it by ground shipping, so just keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what the package says, and does it&#x27;s job well.  Each cartridge has lasted ~2 months for me.  I HATED cleaning my old razor.  Very happy to let this razor clean itself.</li>
    <li> The 3-pack cleaning cartridges have a good price.  It seems like the shipping cost is unreasonable but when you consider the cost of gas to travel for the product it probably comes out in the wash.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as expected.  The fragrance was different from the original product that came with the razor but not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  If you have this Braun razor, then this is a good value for you,</li>
    <li> Es un muy buen producto, exelente relaci&amp;oacute;n precio y calidad.&lt;br /&gt;Me afeito todos los d&amp;iacute;as y cada vez que realiza la limpieza y la lubricaci&amp;oacute;n es muy agradable sentir la fragancia que provee el cartucho.&lt;br /&gt;Muy recomendable.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not too much to say about these...they do what they&#x27;re supposed to!  I clean my razor using the self-cleaning system nearly every day and it really amazes me how clean the razor comes out.  Not only is it clean, but it&#x27;s lubricated and smells nice.  It truly does feel like you&#x27;re using a brand new razor every day.  There are lots of reviews on here complaining that the stuff doesn&#x27;t last long enough, but I find that they last about a month if you use them fairly regularly, and that&#x27;s about what I&#x27;d expect from them.  Sure, you can only use them once a week, seal them in between uses, and make them last a lot longer.  But, I don&#x27;t find them overpriced and I like that my razor is clean and fresh every day.  It&#x27;s much faster than thoroughly cleaning the razor yourself, and works better than just using a brush and water.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and am very satisfied.  The blades are cleaned and lubricated.  It does evaporate over time after opening but if I&#x27;m away for a long time I just plug it up until I return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been impressed with Braun shavers and the new Braun Series 7-790cc is better than previous shavers I&#x27;ve owned. Very close and smooth shave every time and it&#x27;s quiet, too. It&#x27;s a well built solid product and I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a great electric razor. Price is a little high, but well worth the money.Amazon also offers good pricing for the refills, and shipping is very prompt.</li>
    <li> Product described was sent quickly delivered and exactly as described.  Great service absolute a++++++++++</li>
    <li> These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old, and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time, so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that&#x27;s in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life, I&#x27;d never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy.</li>
    <li> i wish there was a cheaper product out there, but this seems to be the best value.</li>
    <li> These are pretty self-explanatory. They&#x27;re priced at a premium because they can be, but what do you do? You need them to keep your razor running well, and mine hasn&#x27;t failed me for years</li>
    <li> Nice to have a clear razor but frustrating to have to spend so much per year.</li>
    <li> Buying 3 is better than 2!  I have only found this deal on Amazon and it saves me money.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I could find for these refills. Since we have to buy them for the Braun shaver system might as well get the best price!</li>
    <li> The price is good and it is very convenient not to have search all over some store to find them when needed.</li>
    <li> What is there so say? These work great and been using them for years :) I Love the lemon scent!!</li>
    <li> Not much to say here about this. It&#x27;s just a simple three-pack of Clean &amp; Renew Refills for certain Braun electric shavers. I was forced to find an alternate supply when my local pharmacy stopped carrying them, so I naturally turned to Amazon. They work great and I&#x27;ll likely be buying them here from now on.</li>
    <li> I just started using this shaver a few months back (was my dad&#x27;s and hasn&#x27;t been used since he passed in late 2006) The self cleaning part is great...makes it feel like a new shaver every day.  I love the product.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much excitement about getting refils for a shaver, but the price was good and the shipping was quick. Everything is as it should be, and I&#x27;ll buy again on amazon.</li>
    <li> The product was delievered on time, and was the correct product. I will continue to purchas from this supplier. The installation was straight forward.</li>
    <li> These are an absolute for your Braun Shaver so there is no choice on whether or not to buy them. They are a bit pricey and don&#x27;t last quite as long as advertised. Still, buying them in the three-pack from Amazon saves some money over buying them at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Only for Braun electric razors- lasts about a month (in my case anyway - several years \\&quot;observation too.) The \\&quot;unit\\&quot; lets you know (wait for the RED light!) when to do it too.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my Braun shaver. Apparently even WalMart must think they are old enough that they do not work anymore. The batteries in mine are as strong as ever and I hate to see parts getting harder to find when there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the shaver. Thank goodness these cartridges are still available here at Amazon!</li>
    <li> My husband is not crazy about the razor but he was happy to find the refills at a reasonable price. He doesn&#x27;t think the  razor shaves as close as his old rotary style but he likes the cleaning feature. He was disappointed to find that they did  not sell the refills in the store where he bought the razor. I knew I could find them on Amazon...</li>
    <li> I tried denatured alcohol and filling spent cartridges.  But I believe the advice of one reviewer is better, not to mention safer.  Buy a new cartridge, clean the razor once a week and then put the stopper on the cartridge.  One cartridge should last the better part of a year.</li>
    <li> Purchased a year&#x27;s quantity. This purchase was hassle free and product was exactly as expected.  I saved about 15% over local store purchase, plus sales tax, fuel and time savings.</li>
    <li> I use up maybe one of these every 6-8 weeks, so ordering with the automatic repeat and 15% discount is a no-brainer, and much cheaper than buying locally :)</li>
    <li> The best price so far in the market that I found. Product arrived on time and in one piece! I couldn&#x27;t be happier :-)  Thank you  and hope to order more in the future!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and it helps me avoid having to replace razors that get clogged with stubble.  Easy to use and very efficient.  Cleans and let&#x27;s you have that new shave feel years after buying your electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and as advertised. Still feel they are a bit pricie but knew that when I bought the razor.</li>
    <li> Can you Spell D e n a t u r e d  alcohol??? I&#x27;ve been refiling my cartridges for years using the stuff and it works great!!! Go to any hardware or paint store and buy a whole quart for about $6.00. When you get a notice on the cleaner that it&#x27;s running low...take the cartridge out, wash it by running water through it several times and Walla...refill with denatured alcohol and on you go again. Nice to have two cartridges though. Let one dry while you use the other on with DENATURED ALCOHOL.</li>
    <li> Great value, as one of these cartridges usually costs the same price as the 3 pack. Awesome to have on auto ship, so I don&#x27;t have to remember when to pick new ones up for my husband.</li>
    <li> I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though, buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don&#x27;t mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&amp;S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the razor for over 2 years, and these are the 1st cleaner tanks I have ever had a problem with leakage.  Don&#x27;t know what the problem is, may not be the supplier, but all the same, it is an annoyance.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun shaver and the automatic cleaner it came with.  Of course it&#x27;s gonna need replacement of the cleaning fluid and you know the stores that sell it just want you to buy the shaver for Dad, Christmas, ... and&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t carry the fluid you need.  I tried all the local shops and after a wasted week, go on Amazon and not only do I find it, I get incredible prices and free shipping to boot!  I love the dozens of choices to select from, these&lt;br /&gt;eStores really earn my respect. They bust their humps to get you the product you ordered to keep a great rating.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s fresh, factory packaged (unless stated otherwise) and the best price you&#x27;ll find anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you like throwing out your money you&#x27;ll shop and compare like I do.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the shaves I get from having clean blades is really nice to my face.  Buy these in multiple packs and save even more.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun Shaver for a few years now. Very happy with it. Like the self cleaning setup. The refills last a month on average, are easy to replace, and readily available. Good product.</li>
    <li> These have a faint lemon scent mixed into the liquid, which is nice. The refills do exactly what they&#x27;re intended to do. My only recommendation is to remove the cartridge after every cleaning. Once removed, reseal the cartridge to insure the liquid lasts longer. Otherwise, the liquid will evaporate quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good for your Braun Razor because you need it. C&#x27;est la vie</li>
    <li> These refills work great. No leaks or defects in 4 years of refills. Hope they keep the quality high and the competitive pricing.</li>
    <li> I am totally amazed at how well and how perfect this razor works. It cleans the blades and recharges every time. It notifies you when to change the refill. WELL worth the money.</li>
    <li> These cartridges do their job well.  However, at a cost of $4.50 to $6.00 each, this is not something I would have been able to afford in my younger years.</li>
    <li> Over all i am satisfied with this purchase, no complaints at all.....</li>
    <li> My husband has had this razor for almost 5 years now.  It still works great and we have been very happy with the razor and it&#x27;s cleaning system.  The cleaner does not have to be replaced very often (every couple of months) and it makes it very easy to be able to purchase it on Amazon when he is running out.</li>
    <li> They work great.  What is more to say.  They clean my razor, price is great and it&#x27;s a Braun...  I&#x27;m pleased..</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and what I was looking for. Great price for the 3 cartridges. I do prefer the cartridges with the lemon scent but these are good.</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it&#x27;s worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me, it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button after shaving and walking away, knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel, I don&#x27;t bring the cleaning unit, so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day, which (a) takes a few minutes, and (b) isn&#x27;t as effective as the cleaning unit. So it&#x27;s four stars, withholding one star just for the price.</li>
    <li> This along with the automatic cleaner makes it really easy to clean your electric shaver! The smell is good and manly--but not too strong. And it lasts quite a long time for me. I use my electric shaver about once a week and have it cleaned after each use using this, and one cartridge will still last around 3-4 months. Good use!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I paid almost half of what it would have cost me at a local drugstore (if they carried it). It arrived on time - I&#x27;m set for another couple of years. Note: After each cleaning I take it out and re-insert the cover tightly, which prevents the alcohol from evaporating and thus helping to extend its usable life - I learned this from another reviewer&#x27;s comments last year.</li>
    <li> If you want to make the most of this product, do not clean your razor every day. It is not necessary. After you shave, shake the razor over the waste basket gently and it will remove some hairs. Then clean the razor every third day. I started useing my 8595 razor on Dec. 10th following this technique and I just ordered replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> It is great to have specific cleaning cartridge as the shaver comes out like new and my husband never complains about his shaver being uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing these Braun Clean and Renew Refill packs for the past two years now and I must say the work great.  I purchased these refills for my Braun Series 7 760 cc.  My electric razor still feels just as smooth and clean as it did the first time I used it.  These refills can be extremely expensive in the stores and I don&#x27;t believe you will find a better deal anywhere else than Amazon, unless there is a special deal going on.  Even after one shave, you can lift open the cleaning dock and see just how effective they are at cleaning the razor as compared to running it under the sink.</li>
    <li> SIMPLE &amp; RIGHT TO THE POINT. IT IS A MARRIAGE WELL MADE BETWEEN CLEANER &amp; SHAVER.  WORKS AWESOME. SAVES ME TIME CLEANING THE SYSTEM.  DO NOT HESITATE, BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANTHONY</li>
    <li> If you need this for your shaver, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I am using refill number 2 of the 3 refills that came in the kit. &lt;br /&gt;I felt that refill #1 did not last long enough. I talk from &lt;br /&gt;experience as I have been using Brauns cleaning system for more than a year. &lt;br /&gt;Refill number 2 is lasting much longer.</li>
    <li> It performs as it should.  It would be better if it did not evaporate when it is inserted into the unit and is not used for a period of time.  So I have to remove it and reinstall the cover when it is not in use, to prevent this evaporation.  Otherwise I only get to use a cartridge about two times before it is gone.</li>
    <li> As advertised and delivery as requested.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described and I could not be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> These refills are great, in that my shaver is fresh and citrisy &lt;br /&gt;every time I use it. The used fluid is black with stubble, so I  &lt;br /&gt;know it is working. Amazon seems to have the best price.</li>
    <li> product as described, fast shipping, PLUS a follow-up e-mail to make sure I was satisfied --- awesome!</li>
    <li> Love my Braun razor.  The refills are a bit pricey, but you can get away with cleaning the razor once every 3-4 uses if you want.  Easy to change out, and haven&#x27;t noticed a problem with evaporation after two months on the same cartridge.</li>
    <li> Spending the money for the shaver was hard enough but the shaver is the best I have ever used. Keeping a shaver clean and lubricated with a brush and oil is messy and time consuming. So the self cleaning option is a nice touch. I tried to be cheap and use a 8 oz solution in a cleaned out empty cartridge but the time, effort, and cost was no better then buying the three pack.(it takes over 5 0z to refill the cartridge) When you get free shipping it comes to less then 4 bucks a cartridge. If you clean the shaver every two or three times one can get two or more months out of the catridge. I put a platic zip lock bag over the shaver and cleaner when not cleaning or charging that seems to slow the evaperation down a bit.</li>
    <li> Not really much to \\&quot;review\\&quot; here.  The Braun razor, with which the refills will be used, is a superb product, and the Cleaner system of which the refills are a component is equally outstanding.</li>
    <li> Second purchase from this vendor. Would recommend.  Pleased with product, prompt shipping, etc.</li>
    <li> Fits my husband&#x27;s Braun Activator system and keeps it nice and clean.  Good price, esp. with the free super saver shipping!</li>
    <li> I am submitting a review for this only because I am still using the one that came with the shaver. I know that the one included with the shave works well and I can only assume that these will work as well. Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated, so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound, second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception, I don&#x27;t know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges, mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I bought these online this time because the 3-pack was about the same cost as a 2-pack in stores. I&#x27;ve had the Braun razor for at least 5 years and these keep it clean and lubricated. I&#x27;m still using the same blades on mine. I shave everyday, but I also have a beard so I&#x27;m not shaving as much area as most will.</li>
    <li> Works as promised and keeps my 790cc very clean with a nice lemon smell. Lasts about a month with daily use as promised. Once opened though that month deadline begins as the solution begins to evaporate.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time and it cleans the shaver as good as new, each and every time.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend purchase through Amazon.  Better pricing than I found at discount stores, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> What can I say - I own their shaver, so I need these..  Nothing to compare to, but they seem wo work just fine..</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Syncro for about 4 years now and the cartridges were, always, around $24 for 3.  I get them from Amazon for about half the price and don&#x27;t pay shipping because I have a subscription.  I think this is a great way to buy these.</li>
    <li> These refills are an ongoing replacement for a consumable item.  They work very well, but require frequent replacement.  There is no other cleaning unit that will work with my Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Braun cleaning solution units since I bought this razor 6 years ago.My razor cuts like it&#x27;s still brand new and I&#x27;m sure the regular use of this fluid has helped. And Amazon has them at such a great price. In fact the price has never changed.</li>
    <li> If you want your shaver to give you a close shave, you have to keep it clean. So by keeping the cleaning system full and ready to go, you can keep it clean. You get three refills, so you don&#x27;t have to reorder anytime soon.</li>
    <li> The best shaving product that I have ever used, pricey but worth every penny. I highly recommend it to anyone. [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD Screen]]</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recently purchased a Braun series 7 shaver and couldn&#x27;t find refills for the cleaning system.  Once again, Amazon came through and in 5 minutes we found them.</li>
    <li> They were factory fresh and work well with the razor. Too bad that we have to pay shipping even with the membership in Prime Shipping.</li>
    <li> If you buy the razor, you might as well add this 3-pack refill to the order.  It&#x27;s a great price -- I&#x27;ve seen only the 2-pack refills in stores and they go for about the same price of this 3-pack refill.  And, since 1 cleaning cartridge lasts about a month, and 1 cartridge is packed with the razor, you&#x27;re bringing home at least 4 months of clean and renew packs so you&#x27;re set for a while.</li>
    <li> Bought husband top of line Braun razor which he loves.  The refill pack is a good buy online.  Is interesting how it works - cleans the razor by catching the stubble in these cleaning cartridges and then I guess essentially dissolves the stubble.  Husband happy.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best ever and it must be, in part, to the cleaning method they recommend.    Very happy to buy this product on line as I could not find it locally.</li>
    <li> Supposedly this keeps the blades clean and sharp. It sure seems to work. But after about 1-1.5 months, the fluid seems to stop working regardless of how many times you&#x27;ve used it to clean the razor.  So plan on buying more than a few of these. For certain it really cleans the razor and so far the blades are only about half as dull as they normally would be. So a big plus, but I really don&#x27;t like having to buy all these accessories and you can&#x27;t travel with these as they are flammable. I wonder how just plain alcohol would work instead as it&#x27;d be a lot cheaper. Just bring an empty container and fill it with alcohol?  I&#x27;d like it if these refills weren&#x27;t flammable so I could take them on the plane and also if they were cheaper, and lasted longer than a month.</li>
    <li> Amazon wont really ship these 1 or 2 days like it states which makes it silly to be a Prime item.</li>
    <li> Amazon had the lowest price I could find for this product.  Fast shipping, too!</li>
    <li> This appears to be a simple solution to the problem of reordering a product which is used everyday.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and getting it as fast as I did made it even better.  Amazon came through again!</li>
    <li> This product is the Braun Original product so you know it will work with your razor. It qualifies for free shipping but you have to order two packs which gives you six refills.</li>
    <li> If you own a braun electric shave this is is the best cleaning cartridge to use.</li>
    <li> Received as expected.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, packaged well, as described.     Good price and actually easier then driving to walmart just to find out they are out of stock.     Good Seller and Product - Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Great price and convenient!  I have also recently started reusing/refilling these items (note that the manufacturer says &#x27;not to&#x27;). After the cartridge is out I clean it out by running water through it to empty inside contents. Then I refill with isopropyl alcohol+ 10 ml of glycerin. It works like a charm and costs about 25cents versus $3-5 each refill!</li>
    <li> Item arr in good time and condition.  Very pleased, thank you.</li>
    <li> The refills arrived faster than I&#x27;d expected - nice work Amazon!  They are exact replacement refills for the cleaning system of my Braun Activator 8000 series shaver.  Amazon&#x27;s price for the package of 3 refills beat most every other place I checked.  I keep the shaver in my car during the week, then brush it out on the weekend before using the cleaning system.  That keeps the cost of the cleaning fluid reasonable and the shaver still works very well all week long.</li>
    <li> Bruan head cleaner is expensive-- I went to WalMart-- found that Remington makes an electic shaver head cleaner in an 8 oz. bottle of 5.00  I figured if it worked for a Remington Electic Shaver it would work for a Braun.  It is 96% denatured alcohol and some other stuff-- has a nice lemon smell too.</li>
    <li> You have to have this stuff to keep the razor clean.  One refill lasts about 4 months, and is easy to change.  Good product!!</li>
    <li> Having a heavy beard, I wanted to enjoy the relative comfort of an electric razor, which the Braun does indeed supply.  However, it is nowhere near as close a shave as with a traditional straight razor.  C&#x27;est la vie.  These cleaner refills are a necessary evil to maintain the razor...but I guess it&#x27;s all part of the Manscap&#x27;ing.</li>
    <li> excellent price for a product that is much higher in bricks and mortar stores.  Delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This does just what it says.  If you use it like you are supposed to, it keeps the razor feeling and shaving brand new.</li>
    <li> These liquid refills for my Braun electric shaver make cleaning the product so much easier.  Amazon set a price that was far below competitors, and got it to me with excellent speed.  I&#x27;d recommend Amazon for most products--try them first and compare!</li>
    <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve been able to find no this product and the product is great.</li>
    <li> These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not, so just use it.  I tap my shaver&#x27;s screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you&#x27;re not going to run it at least weekly, then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system.</li>
    <li> my husband was very happy we were able to order the refill and cleaner.    thank you</li>
    <li> This is the only solution available and is very expensive. I clean the shaver once a week to extend the solution life.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun CCR3 Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Refills)]]    I bought my husband the Braun Shaver System about a year ago.  He shaves every night so by that I would say he likes it.  His face is always smooth when he comes to bed and never gives me a brush from whiskers.  He had tried electric shavers before, but always had problems with his sensitive skin.    We get the refills from amazon as that is the best price we have found.</li>
    <li> Purchased for at least half the price else where. I know where I&#x27;m doing my unique shopping item from now on.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted to keep my new shaver clean. It&#x27;s the cleaning fluid that&#x27;s recomended by Braun. It&#x27;s a good product that I&#x27;ve used before, but at a better price.</li>
    <li> I love this Braun Water filter and purchased this refilled 3 pack together. I wish it comes with more than 3. overall, it is good buy!</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the Clean and Renew Refills the price was a lot cheaper than local purchase. It seems to work well, but it evaporates pretty fast.</li>
    <li> These refill cartridges go a long way and they are easy to use with your Braun electric razor.  I purchase them from Amazon.com again and again.</li>
    <li> What can I say about a bucket of shaver cleaner? It&#x27;s pretty. It smells good. It&#x27;s easy to use. It&#x27;s expensive (you think gasoline is expensive!? A gallon of this stuff would rival the cost of a couple of full tanks of gas for your car!).    I buy this product because it keeps my shaver nice and clean and sweet smelling.</li>
    <li> These work and aren&#x27;t all that expensive. So it&#x27;s probably not worth my time to try to refill them. I&#x27;m an educated guy with a decent hourly wage. But I can&#x27;t help myself :) I blame my mom for instilling this cheapskate mentality in me.    Anyway, refilling is working fine for me. The ingredients in the real thing are isopropyl alcohol, limonene, citral, and dye. What I used was 91% alcohol (highest I had) and a few drops of tea tree oil. Tea tree oil seems similar to limonene and citral. They are all \\&quot;terpenes\\&quot; (plant essential oils). The purpose of these is to help clean and lubricate, and provide a fresh scent.    One trick: the solution needs some conductivity (ions) or the unit will register it as empty. I added few drops of saline solution/contact lens cleaner and it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I use these refills with my Braun Pulsonic 9595.  No problems as of yet.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and find it lives up to its expectations</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was out,and it was a birthday gift to myself. Also the price was right within my budget.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]    Braun refill cleaners perform as advertied.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I have the Braun 8995 shaver and it uses these refills.  Although they keep the shaver clean and neat, they are very expensive-  I can&#x27;t believe they really can&#x27;t make these for $2 or less...  maybe some competitor will make them at some point..  but, for now, if you need these, Amazon has a program where you sign up for home delivery on a regular basis (but you can still move or cancel a shipment)-  this is by far the cheapest way to get these.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Good shape. Just what I ordered and it was delivered quickly.  No complaint. Not much more to say. Havent had the the razor long. Will see how things go  the next time I order.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASE THESE TO GO WITH THE BRAUN SHAVER THAT I PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND!!  HE WAS THRILLED!!</li>
    <li> Even though a local store carries this brand and model of razar, I was unable to buy refills or a replacement shaver head and screen. Luckily you carried the refills.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun Shaver System. These refills do a great job of keeping my shaver clean as they extend the useful life of the system.</li>
    <li> i  tried it several times and i do not see how the bath or liquid part gets it clean ,it does not even touch it ...please get in touch with me on this ..i am very disappointed  in  it ..///////////</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve invested in a Braun Razor, the Clean &amp; Renew Refills are a must have!  If you follow the instructions that came with the razor and clean it every time the yellow light comes on you&#x27;ll have a clean, close shave.   So, if you&#x27;re trying to scrimp on these to save a few pennies (my Dad was doing this), don&#x27;t!  And above all, never clean the head or the screen with the brush that comes with the unit.  Overall, I like the clean and renew.  it keeps the razor shiny and clean and helps maintain a close shave. The only complaint I have is really about the design of the base unit, not the cartridges.  I wish they had designed it so that it wouldn&#x27;t splash/spill so easily when it&#x27;s bumped or moved around.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal, and it&#x27;s not too easily spilled, but I would rather not have to even worry about it.</li>
    <li> 1.Great.&lt;br /&gt;2. None.&lt;br /&gt;3. Try it you will like it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don;t dislike at all.&lt;br /&gt;5. Above.&lt;br /&gt;6. Da. clean my razor</li>
    <li> I no longer use these since I switched back to the Mach 3 razor, but I remember these refills always made my Braun shaver working like new. If I ever switch back, I will for sure be buying more of these. They also have a great scent that is not too strong.</li>
    <li> These refills work - they clean my razor... and since the razor was expensive- I am going to replace these refills for a year or so longer.    They are cheaper now ( 22 when I bought) so that&#x27;s good.    No complaints</li>
    <li> My Braun shaver shines because of its self-cleaning feature. I used to buy these cleaner cartridges locally, but they got harder to find in stock at places like Target. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of having a razor that is always sterile.  The easy replacement of the cleaning module helps me make sure I keep the system ready for use.  I generally clean the razor each time I shave.  Being able to order the cleaning modules on-line means I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about where to find them.  They each last a long time and they ensure me that the shave is clean.  I wanted the convenience of buying these from my computer and a low price and I got both. What more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> These cartridges are seemingly the same as the original that came with my razor, and they do a great job of keeping it clean and fresh with no effort.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and works well. I think it does a good job keeping my shaver clean and ready to use. The only draw back that made me give it four stars instead of five was the simple fact that it is very easy to spill while manipulating the cartridge for installation into the base. The good thing is that it evaporates quickly when it does spill, leaving very little to clean up. The bad part is, don&#x27;t spill it on anything that is sensitive to alcohol as it might destroy some furniture finishes upon contact. Other than that a very good product and easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Braun shaver for a number of years.  I like the cleaning process very much.  My problem is that I have not been able to find these refills in any of the popular stores.  Finallly I did a search and found that good old, reliable Amazon carries these refills.  And what a surprise; a 3-pack.  Excellent product and fabulous Amazon.</li>
    <li> The ability to buy these in a three pack with free shipping is a great deal.  You don&#x27;t have any choice if you have the Braun razor that uses these, but this sure makes it convenient and a fair price.</li>
    <li> Good cleaning capability. Slightly funny smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been good dealing with Amazon. Great to do business with at a great price...This item works great it does a nice cleaning job....</li>
    <li> Keeps my razor smelling so fresh and so clean, clean. Each refil lasts about 2 months for me (I clean after each shaving).</li>
    <li> Enough said, you just need this if you have the Braun shaver that uses them.  I found the 3-pack to be a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> My hubby is very happy with his shaver that uses these clean &amp; renew refills. Together they work great. He changes it once a month and you can see how dirty it gets. It keeps his shaver nice and clean.</li>
    <li> received notification by email that product had been sent back by shipper. I was charged a return fee even though no product was delivered . Address was correct and someone was here at all times</li>
    <li> The product is as described. If you have the razor then you know how nice, clean, and refreshing it is after it has been cleaned with this fluid. It is the same fluid that initially came with my razor kit. It was reasonable shipping and i am deployed in the Middle East and got it a lot quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> The reason the rating is low is because these don&#x27;t last long.  They need to either make them cheaper or find a way to make them last a LOT longer than a month.</li>
    <li> The clean and renew system works very well, at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time, and to improve the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month, and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; cleaning.  The system obviously has a \\&quot;cost\\&quot; associated with the refills, but overall, it seems to be worthwhile.</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations and worked perfectly.  Less expensive than buying in the store.</li>
    <li> This is the OEM cleaner refill for Braun shaver systems.  I have a Braun 8985.  Like the foil/cutter replacement; it can be difficult to find the cleaner refills.  This one is a good bargain especially since you get 3 of them.  They last quite a bit of time; but it&#x27;s good to have fresh refill on hand.  Since they are OEM, it works great cleaning out the shaver and giving it a fresh, clean scent.  Remember, when you remove the top of the new refill, use the top to insert on the old refill; otherwise,  you&#x27;ll have a gloppy mess in your trash can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for 38 years now. I&#x27;ve used this self cleaning model for at least 7-10 years. It cleans,lubricates, charges and sanitizes your shaver every day automatically as you return it to it&#x27;s crib.   The refills last about 45 days so I buy a year&#x27;s supply and change whenever the cleaning unit indicates with a flashing red light. I&#x27;ve bought this unit for my son and for all my friends. they all rave about it. By the way, the Braun shaver is the most advanced and the cleanest shave you will get despite all the newcomers to this self cleaning field.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.         For what it is worth, I&#x27;ll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I&#x27;m always finding flaws in electronics, etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!       Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to \\&quot;vibrate\\&quot; the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I&#x27;ve done this on trips of up to one month with great success, but that isn&#x27;t like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still just expensive, scented and lubricated alcohol. But there&#x27;s no other good alternative to get a good daily clean on your razor. It&#x27;s worth it to have it cleaned. Being subscribed to it is the cheapest way to get it with free shipping.</li>
    <li> If you are buying a refill you probably are already familiar with the system.   What I like about the cleaning system is that it is easy to use and leave my razor with a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Each cartridge lasts three months as they say. It cleans and smells good afterwards (lemon).</li>
    <li> I have had this shaving system for over a year.  It has worked perfectly and has stayed clean due to these little refills.  They are quick and easy to replace, you just have to be careful not to spill when opening the new one.  The only drawback I have is that they only last about a month or so.</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought this was the goofiest idea on the face of the planet.  After eventually taking the plunge, I am convinced this is the best way to clean, protect and maintain your shaver.  Every day, your shaver looks and smells as clean as the day you got it new.  Yes, you can do all this manually as per the instructions but this is so much more thorough and easy.  Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> This cartridge works.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to change [follow the instructions in the manual] and lasts longer than 1 month especially if you clean the shaver every 2 shaves.  The shaver smells good too.</li>
    <li> Buying the 2 packs at walmart was getting expensive.  I don&#x27;t go through these things terribly fast, but being able to order a 3 pack and have it on the subscription/auto delivery program is awesome!  about half the cost on amazon vs. walmart for 33% more product! Can&#x27;t beat that with a stick.</li>
    <li> The first impression on this solvent system is the speed with which it is delivered. It came one day after I ordered it with no special attention.  I&#x27;m not certain exactly how this alcohol cleaning solution works but my razor stays sharp when I use the solvent.  It is probable that the solvent could be replaced by ethanol or methanol but whatever it is, it works.  The solvent really changes with use.  It starts out as a pure light blue and after a month or so is a very dirty gray.</li>
    <li> Just as described... works great!!</li>
    <li> Normally Clean and Renew refills are sold in 2 packs.  The 3 pack saves a little money and lasts a bit longer.  Free shipping and an incentive offer are additional plus points.  The product quality remains excellent in either case.</li>
    <li> I saw these at the store for like 20 bucks for a two pack. so of course I was happy to get these. They last pretty long too.</li>
    <li> It was so hard trying to find these in Walmart. Sure they were around the same price, but I didn&#x27;t have to waste my gas hoping that the next one would have it. These renewers really extend the freshness of your shaver. I believe after reading some of the other reviews that I get a bit more life out of a cartridge that many other users that don&#x27;t take the cartridge out after a cleaning. I also brush out and rinse my shaver before I charge and clean it. It takes a much longer time for the cartridge to get filthy that way.</li>
    <li> The dealer shipped product very quickly and arrived in good condition. Using the clean and renew refills make a world of difference in my shaver.</li>
    <li> This is essential for keeping your shaver clean and working properly. Just be careful when replacing because cleaning it up is not a pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> The clean and renew packs work well to clean the shaver (I have a Braun 8585) but leaves a residue behind which every once and a while I will taste on my upper lip and it tastes quite bitter, kind of like a dandelion (not pleasant if you&#x27;ve ever experienced that).</li>
    <li> Deal is okay...not really a big saving...especially factoring the shipping cost it equivalent to the cost of $/cartridge at a Drug&#x27;s store.</li>
    <li> Cleaner refills work just as advertised and do a good job of cleaning your Braun shaver. I question whether they are worth the advertisedprice. Buying through Amazon helps reduce the cost.</li>
    <li> I used to get a lot of skin irritation and sometimes infected hair follicles from shaving. Since switching to this cleaning system, I have not had any problems. Great product.</li>
    <li> I keep my electric razor cleaned every other day and this really keeps it working well. I purchased my razor last year in August and it still cuts like it was new.</li>
    <li> The Braun auto-clean system does away with the tiresome work of brushing and cleaning the head of your electric shaver. Shave, put it into the stand/cleaner, push one button, and in a few minutes it&#x27;s clean and ready for the next use. Recommended.</li>
    <li> BRAUN products are high quality- the CLEAN &amp; RENEW solutions helps maintain the series. I am VERY happy I searched MORE THAN THE FIRST Amazon Product. There is a 2 pack product that is near SAME PRICE. Product does WELL! ! !  Wish it was available for the Subscribe&amp;SAVE value!</li>
    <li> If you own the razor you need these and this is a good price for the Braun product. I have repurchased these so I must like them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun Razor for years and it works perfectly. The cleaning system works the same as when it was new. So.... I keep buying the cleaning fluid to keep my razor clean. Recommend Braun highly! Have their electric toothbrush too.</li>
    <li> These keep my razor clean for each use. Each one lasts about a month. Amazon.com is the best place to buy these. Good price. If you sign up for recurring shipments, you can save EVEN MORE! ...and I know I will continue to need them as long as I have this razor.</li>
    <li> Part of the process when shaving is cleaning your razor.  These packets are so easy to use and prvide a quick and easy way to clean my Electric Razor daily.  I suggest to buy the refills right away so when you need them you will have them on hand.  They are long lasting and when I shave I smell a clean and fresh smell as I begin to shave each day.</li>
    <li> Engineered for the Braun harger/cleaner base.  The only thing that will work.  Does its job.</li>
    <li> The process to order and receive the Braun automatic cleaner cartridges was easy and seamless.  I received the products in a timely manner, and for 20% less than I would have paid on the Braun website.  Highly recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> They work, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do in my razor cleaner, guess I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
    <li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills are typically available in most drug stores, Wal-marts, etc. but not in the 3-pack. Price is competitive and delivery, particularly with Amazon Prime is very quick and convenient.</li>
    <li> New OEM packaging and everything. Mine came in perfect condition. Nothing wrong or weird with anything. Caps stayed on as they should have.</li>
    <li> Got the Braun 7000 series shaver Last Christmas and was impressed with the shaver care system.  The razor cleans itself with the help of this Braun product.  Shaver gets clean and smells great.</li>
    <li> Good Price as I shopped around for cheapest way to get these refills with shipping...cannot find it cheaper anywhere, and this includes going shopping at stores.  When making purchase DEFINITELY get the three-pack at minimum..and getting several is the way to go.  In fact I have seen on Amazon a single refill for the same price as THREE... DUH!?</li>
    <li> The cleaning fluid does exactly  what it is supposed to do  and is easy to insert in the shaver fixture.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased many years ago and want off my screen. Product must have been ok, otherwise I would have given it 1 star. Great product, I think??</li>
    <li> These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this, I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning, raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It&#x27;s a tough call, I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about them.  They are refills, they work fine.  They are all the same, so find the best price.</li>
    <li> The shaver comes out clean as the day you bought it and its not mess no fuss cleaning that is great for everyday or as much as you think you might need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price for 3 so it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I buy the refill kits at Amazon for my razor.  With Amazon Prime, I get free 2nd day shipping, and my local stores can&#x27;t beat this 3-pack price.</li>
    <li> Only game in town.  Completes about 10-15 cleanings per cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item a few times and will continue to buy through Amazon.  Great value and they have always arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> They smell pretty fantastic and work just like I expected them to!</li>
    <li> These are expensive.  If you clean the razor every use, as Braun recommends, you&#x27;ll get maybe 30 cleanings and be done with a single refill in about one month.  Instead, I use the clean cycle only once a week, and stopper the refills in between to prevent evaporation.  Before you clean the razor, get as much hair out of it as you can (e.g. by *carefully* running it under water and/or using a brush).  This will keep the refill from being filled with hair. Then you use the cleaning cycle as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning is done, the razor will be free of hair and have a nice scent.  I&#x27;ve had my starter cartridge since December 2011, and it still shows up green when I put it in the system.</li>
    <li> works very good now my bf doesnt have to try and clean his clippers by hand because that&#x27;s a pain</li>
    <li> Works great to keep my Braun fresh. I think Braun is trying to make a bunch of money on this by suggesting this be used daily, I use it once a week along with charging my cordless razor and have not noticed a difference in the quality of the shave from my Bruan 5 series. I estimate I get about 5 months of use out of one cartridge by rising all the hair off my razor before using and by putting the lid back on the solution when not using it.</li>
    <li> Great price for what I received. The other web sites were triple the price and this was the best bargain.</li>
    <li> The product was priced decently, and ordering was easy. Shipment was on time. I have ordered this product before, and had the same positive experience</li>
    <li> I have used Braun products for many years, they are very good, and the auto-matic shaver cleaner/charger with it&#x27;s cleaning liquid does the job.</li>
    <li> Works well, but addds to cost of shaving.  Each refill lasts for about 2 months with daily use, so not too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clean and Renew system for years and really like the push and forget aspect of cleaning my razor.  Braun would have you do this every day, but I find once a week to be perfectly adequate for my light beard.</li>
    <li> The Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack) were delivered quickly. This three back is an economically buy.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these refills for my Braun from Amazon for over three years now. So far the best value for the money I have found anywhere.</li>
    <li> Keeps the shaver head clean and sharp for daily use. However I find that it is used up too quickly. I&#x27;m used to having a longer use life than 18 days per cartridge. Good for Braun, but not the consumer from a cost point of view</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I bought the Braun Series 7 with the Clean &amp; Renew center after years of shaving with blades.  I was skeptical at first but this shaver really does give me an amazing shave - just about as close as a blade.  I clean it every other day with the alcohol fluid and it keeps it performing at its best.      It is better than the hassle of shaving with blades.  The cleaning refills are not cheap, but I did the math and in the long term it&#x27;s still cheaper than buying expensive razor blades all the time and it&#x27;s worth it to maintain my Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> The Braun Clean &amp; Renew system is a great way to rejuvenate your electric razor, especially given that my last razor had a tendency to be hard to clean by hand.  The problem with owning a Clean &amp; Renew (or \\&quot;Clean &amp; Charge\\&quot;) system is that refills like this cost yet more money for a razor you already bought the Clean &amp; Charge system for, and for which you also know that you&#x27;ll be buying blades and foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here then are the best ways to save money when you&#x27;re buying Clean &amp; Renew refills:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product can be bought two ways:  as a pack of three or a pack of two. The price of each changes from time to time.  When you need to buy more, take a moment&#x27;s basic math to figure out the best price per unit.  Sometimes the per-unit price of three is a better deal than the price for just two, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You don&#x27;t need to use this system every day, or even every week.  I bought my system from a Braun store that also did repairs and the owner (who also owned a 7526 like mine) told me he uses the cleaner every two weeks.  He also said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When using your Braun razor daily, take 10 seconds when you&#x27;re done and run it with the foil clicked loose (but still attached).  The blade inside will shake like a wet dog and drop loose particles into your trash or sink...meaning less build-up when you go to put it in the clean and charge...and the fluild lasts longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When you&#x27;re not using the clean &amp; charge system, pop open the Clean &amp; Charge base, slide out the Clean &amp; Renew refill, and put the cap back on it.  This will keep the alcohol from evaporating and the fluid will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product is often eligible for free Super Saver shipping if you buy more than $25.  Either buy two three-packs and get free shipping, or buy these when you need to buy a blade and/or foil replacement (which are also often eligible for free Super Saver Shipping).  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay $5 to ship a $10 or $15 item.  I typically buy a set of these when I&#x27;m on my last one, and usually only when I happen to be buying something else that&#x27;ll push me over the limit and save me some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Braun Clean &amp; Charge system, and my Braun 7526.  I don&#x27;t like being nickel-and-dimed on all the bits and pieces that keep it working as well as it does.  With a little planning, I get the most bang for my buck out of these bundles.and usually only when I happen to be buying something else that&#x27;ll push me over the limit and save me some money.

    <li> I ordered the Braun refills for my Braun self-cleaning electric razor. The product arrived within a short amount of time. Great delivery and a good product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver and the convenience of buying online - at a good price - is great.  No running around!  Quick delivery, too!</li>
    <li> HAVE USED AUTO REORDER FOR 3 YEARS JUST WHAT i need when I need it at 20% of store price. braun head cleaner</li>
    <li> Buy the same stuff at CVS.</li>
    <li> For me, this is to be used with The Braun 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System Silver.&lt;br /&gt;I like the (light) fresh lemon sent it puts on the razor it also contains an antiseptic solution, this has a potential of reducing razor rash.&lt;br /&gt;As we all know, after-shave lotion is alcohol with food coloring added to it.&lt;br /&gt;When I am done in the shower, I splash 73% isopropyl alcohol on my face. The result is a clean razor and a clean shave</li>
    <li> I buy these and often. I always clean my braun grazer and this is a must have. I don&#x27;t want itchy face because I didn&#x27;t keep my razor clean.</li>
    <li> These refill are a great replacement for my expensive Braun shving system. They fit right into the dock and do their job as promised. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These Clean &amp; Renew packs aren&#x27;t entirely necessary to use your new razor, but they do keep it cutting closer and smoother for much longer. One little trick that most people don&#x27;t realize is that the cleaning process only uses the cleaning solution for about the first 3 minutes, after that it just dries. So feel free to remove the container from your stand and seal it back up. Seeing as this product is primarily alcohol, it tends to evaporate at room temperature. By closing it back up and only opening it for when you need it, you can prolong how long these packs last for. I managed to make my initial pack that came with my Braun 3 series last for an entire year.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product through two Braun shavers.  Am still happy with the cleaning ability of this refill cartridge.  Would recommend this as a great price for the product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve spent the money on a quality razor and want to keep it in the best condition then these cleaning packs are a must have. Don&#x27;t try to cheap out and make your own cleaning solution. These do a great job, keep your razor feeling fresh and new and last quite a long time. Best bet is to use subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I have this razor, and love it and the cleaning system. But does Amazon take us for fools? They are selling this three-pack for more per unit ($4.33 per) than the two-pack ($3.99 per). Hopefully they&#x27;ll lower this price instead of raising the other one...</li>
    <li> What can I say about this one?  It works well, and because of Amazon Subscription, I don&#x27;t have to cheap out and get those useless self-refills. It&#x27;s affordable enough to buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelcos for 30 years. Recently, my three year old Norelco stopped working properly. I read the user reports on Amazon and decided to bite the bullet and go for this highly rated and expensive Braun shaver. The shaver is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER SYSTEM THAT I HAVE EVER USED. I really look forward to shaving every morning. The cleaning system  is extremely easy to use and keep the shaver in top condition each time. I highly recommend this product to all. Thank you Braun and thank you Amazon for bringing this product to my attention.</li>
    <li> This package is the best bet for the price.  It keeps the Braun shaver cleaned and oiled.  I like the idea of getting a discount when you sign up for the automatic shipments.</li>
    <li> I recieved everything as they said and in the time promised. However I ordered something I did not need for the model razor purchased.[[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun CCR3 Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Refills)]]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to write a long review about this product I have owned electric razor&#x27;s for about 11 years so I consider myself a pretty good judge of the product. The Pulsonic is actually the closest shave I have ever had from an electric razor. It even rivals the shave given by a blade. The cleaning cycle is quick and effective. I would easily give the product five stars if it were not so expensive. If you can afford it, and won&#x27;t think twice about the price. Buy it and never look back. You won&#x27;t be sorry. If you can buy a much cheaper product and get a fairly close shave. Give some thought to the price.</li>
    <li> There is not much to say about these refills.  They do the job they were meant to do and they do it well.  They last a long time so the three refills in the pack should last most of this year.</li>
    <li> I used to have trouble finding the refills online at reasonable prices, but now they&#x27;re readily available from Amazon.com. This is the best price I have seen on these items, and I have ordered before on E Bay for more cost, so I really stocked up here.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers pretty much since I started shaving. I tried Norelco a few times (my old man is a big fan) but for me the foil shaver is the way to go. I now have one of Braun&#x27;s later models that uses the Clean &amp; Renew base and I could not be happier with it. Pop the shaver in for about an hour (I&#x27;m not sure how long the actual cycle is, I just set it and go) and the razor comes out like new. It smells great and shaves better too. I purchased these cartridge refills from Amazon because they offer the best price of anyone else. I ordered the 3 refills and got a 3-month subscription (which made it even cheaper), figuring I will go through about one cartridge per month. I do wish the cartridges cost less, and I keep reading that if you plug the cover back into it you can make them last longer, but either way they definitely do their job.</li>
    <li> Since I bought a Braun shaver with self cleaning system I have gained more time. Simply insert refill and you will never have to struggle with washing and lubricating your shaver again. These refills will do it for you and after cleaning is over your shaver is: sharp, clean, smells like a fresh lemon :-) and ready to do its job!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had a video to show you exactly how cool these refills are!!!!  The just pop right in and when you push a button on the base part of the shaver they clean like nobody&#x27;s business!!!!  Incredible</li>
    <li> The refill packs came super quick at a much lower price than anywhere else and was so easy to order.  Damn, I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> Got 3 for the price of 2 - worth the deal on a needed product.</li>
    <li> The cleaning fluid keeps my braun shaver  clean  for the next shave. I get them automatically  every 3 month</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]  In order to extend the life of these refills, remove the current one from the charger/cleaner, reinsert the cover and store it in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks between cleaning sessions.  This keeps the fluid fresh-smelling.  (Used fluid can \\&quot;sour\\&quot; at room temperature.)  Every couple of weeks, reinsert the refill into the cleaner, charge and clean the shaver between shaves for a few days, then return it to the refrigerator.  This limits the loss from evaporation that some other reviewers have described.  The shaver battery power lasts for more than three weeks when I travel.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be charged everyday when I am at home, either.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun electric, and these keep it clean! They last a sufficiently long time, and the price isn&#x27;t too bad. I think you are definitely getting what you&#x27;re paying for, a quality product that keeps the razor clean and smelling fresh every use!</li>
    <li> ...quality, price, and delivery!  I&#x27;ve owned the razor for a few years, but have used alcohol as the cleaning fluid.  Decided to try this, and I&#x27;m sold.  Really cleans well!</li>
    <li> This does extends the life of the blade.  but is expensive as in the end you end up spending the same amount.</li>
    <li> I bought a Braun Activator shaver because I was tired of nicks, cuts, and irritated skin.  I had tried electric razors in the past but they never did a good job shaving and were always a pain to keep clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This cleaning fluid for the Activator shaver is a must!  The self cleaning system makes it very quick and simple to keep the shaver clean and running good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I typically run the cleaning step every other day, shaking out the shavings on the off days.  This helps the cleaning fluid last a wee bit longer.  The fluid lasts 2-3 months, with evaporation in the hot months shortening the life a little bit.  The cleaning fluid leaves a slightly lubricating film on the shaver which helps it glide smoothly across the skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can buy a 2-pack of refills in store at Target for $12, or you can get a 3-pack here at Amazon for the same price, plus no sales tax.  The math is simple.</li>
    <li> Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each, this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target, Walmart, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh, lemony, sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each, which helps to increase the value and lower the cost.</li>
    <li> After Purchasing my Braun shaver I decided to buy 2 refills but do no own an activator.  I clean my shaver by removing the screen and giving two quick bursts of Dust Off, while it is running.  Dustoff Is something I used in my darkroom to remove dust from negatives. I then place the shaver head in a small plastic tray containing the solution for a few seconds while it is running.  I use a tissue to dry the cutters and clean the screen by by dipping it in the cleaning solution.  I clean the heads every 2 to 3  weeks. From November 2005 till August 2006 I have used just one of the refills. It works great.</li>
    <li> It cleans pretty well, but I think it gets over too fast. It is expensive to replace so often.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Works fine to clean my Braun shaver</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  He bought the first refills for it from Rite Aid for $7 and change each plus tax, without asking me to shop around for him (sigh).  Amazon runs them three for $12.99 including super saver shipping.  I looked around and can&#x27;t find them any cheaper than this.  If someone else can, I wish they would let me know.</li>
    <li> They work.  They fit in perfectly and they arrived safely.  Just don&#x27;t know what more I can say about something like this... LOL</li>
    <li> I use this with a Braun 8000 series activator (8585 I think). They are expensive (so is the shaver) but the system does work.  The first one lasted over 5 months, using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  No evaporation loss that I could tell.  You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee, etc.  I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner, so that made it clean and fresh.  However, when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to smells, but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose.</li>
    <li> Get one of these, then get some 90% isopropyl alcohol from your pharmacy for pennies, then keep refilling it. Of course, you should not follow my advice since it is against what Braun recommends, so please ignore my silly suggestion. It appears that my shavers never read Braun&#x27;s warnings because they just keep getting clean, keep smelling good, and keep working despite my illegal activities.</li>
    <li> Each cartridge lasts a little longer than a month and is necessary to keep the foil and blades clean and sharp for a first-class shave every morning.</li>
    <li> Very effective at cleaning and lubricating the shaver.  Short of replacing the cutter head and film every 6 months or so, the solution takes care of all other maintenance.  The only drawback is its quick evaporation when the shaver is out of its bay.  It&#x27;s best to cover the solution if you are on travel, so as not to waste it.</li>
    <li> I receive 3 months worth of Braun Clean &amp; Renew from you at a cheaper cost with free shipping! If I bought it in a store there would be tax and it woould cost $5.00 foe each product.  I do not have to order it comes to me every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Not much choice if you&#x27;re using a Braun.  These work well, but my only wish is that they would last longer.  If I&#x27;m lucky, I get about a month&#x27;s worth of usage out of these.  Don&#x27;t think you can stretch the lifetime out by not using it as much - it doesn&#x27;t work.  If anything, it actually seems to shorten the actual amount of usage you get out of it (maybe it dries out?).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Philips Norelco system. I find this system to offer better shaves. The Norelco solution is poured in and can be messy. I much prefer the enclosed cartridge setup of the Braun cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for these then you must already know what they&#x27;re for. The cleaning system works well and $4-$5 per month isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> Amazing product overall. It actually completely renews my shaver in two ways.   1. it keeps my shaver head super clean.   2. the shaver heads performs better after cleanings.</li>
    <li> Using the cleaning dock and cartridges after every shave keeps the razor working very well and the shave clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> These cleaning inserts which cannot be refilled turn out to be fairly expensive. One insert barely lasts a month if you shave regularly.SInce there is solvent inside the container, you cannot recycle the plastic. It feels wasteful.  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t get  little skin infections like I used to with a conventional electric razor. This is really a guilty pleasure.</li>
    <li> This cleaning/lubricating solution is probably overpriced everywhere, but this vendor sells it at the most reasonable price I have found. Careful and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It is a good deal if you subscribe these refilled to come to your house once every 6 months or so. The shipping is free and price is cheaper. If you have the shaver that needs it, I suggest you get these refills, it will leave your shaver lemony clean! My husband likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Gives me a much faster and closer shave than my previous Braun shavers. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Pricey solution for your pricey electric shaver. They tend to dry out so I remove them from the cleaner base and put the cap back on them</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic shaver is by far the best shaver system I have ever used.  The key word is SYSTEM of which these cleaning refills are an integral part.  My skin used to become sore and irritated with other shavers.  Not with this one and the refills are the key.  The refills clean and sanitize the shaver. I change mine the first of every month and my skin is never irritated from shaving.  Expensive??? 20 cents a day is a bargain for these!</li>
    <li> Right stuff for my Braun shaver. Description in Amazon&#x27;s website was easy to understand. Fast shipping, too</li>
    <li> I found them to be a very good price and they were exactly like the old one I took out.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure I was going to be happy with this product, assuming it was just something to bring more money to Braun.  But using this product has kept my razor exceptionally clean and in great working order.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to Braun shaver owners.</li>
    <li> The amazon price of these refills were much less than anywhere else. They keep the electric razor working like new.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best cleaning product to buy, if you own one of the great Braun Shavers.  This does the best job of cleaning and also Lubricating all the parts, not to mention the \\&quot;Blades\\&quot; so they coninue to provide you with a wonderfuly close shave for as long as possible (because replacing the blades and the screen is not cheep).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Amazon is offering this Cleaning and Lubricating Cartrige in a three pack, that as far as I know (and boy have I looked) is not sold in Retail Stores, is an even greater deal, but on top of that, they sell this three pack for only a few dollars more than the Two Packs everyone else sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Thank You Amazon, for finding and offering us a great deal on this product.  I look forward to finding more savings like this on items we all need in our daily lives. Then many more people will join and buy from Amazon, as you continue to show these Big Box Stores that they can not continue to rape the American public on necessities, because someone like Amazon will always step up and share there savings onto their customers.  This is how this country will become what it once was.  Thanks Again Amazon.....</li>
    <li> It may be a little bit pricey to use these everyday, but I prefer a clean razor.  I only change out the cartridge when my cleaning station tells me it is low.  It seems to last longer than 1 month, more like 5-6 with near daily use.</li>
    <li> A must for keeping your razor blades clean and lubricated!</li>
    <li> This item continues to be a quality product for an affordable price. I have been buying this item for several years via Amazon.</li>
    <li> Order received timely and in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;Not too much to say about product - it works and&lt;br /&gt;the three pack saves reorder time.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use. When the light shows the cartridge is empty, you just slide the old one out and the new one in. Amazon has the best price, and I love the convenience of the product delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> They should just give us the solution, not the entire container. What a waste of plastic. I do love the way the solution takes care of my razor tho!</li>
    <li> I have never liked electric shavers until I started using this system. The razor doesn&#x27;t irratate my skin and I do not have to take it apart to clean every day. The cleaning system does a great job and the indicators make it easy to know when to change the cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> Great price and having three is better than Two (2).</li>
    <li> We the freeNezy testers at eJawab found that this product is an essential part of life. That is if you like to keep clean. We love it, and so will you.</li>
    <li> This product makes cleaning the razor much easier.  The packaging is simple and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Product is a necessity to the awesome Braun shaver.  In order to maintain the cleanliness and upkeep of the razor you must purchase the needed refills.  Fortunately, the refills come at an affordable price and satisfy their purpose.  In the long haul, the minimal price you need to pay for refills far outweighs the expenses that will come with buying razor refills for your old razors.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and anything that makes it self cleaning makes it even better</li>
    <li> What could more convenient and economical than getting a pack of three Braun clean and renew refills every three months at a terrific price.&lt;br /&gt;No other retail store can match this deal.&lt;br /&gt;I clean my Braun razor daily and it is a pleasure to start the day using a clean and well lubricated shaver.</li>

    <li> I love the product and love being able to buy it on Amazon even better.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent way to maintain the Braun Shaver is top condition and on subscription at the price offered it is excellent value. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Shaun</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to receive the Clean &amp; Renew Refills in the mail as needed. It&#x27;s convenient, smart and oh so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best electric shaver in the world deserves nothing less!</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient item. It works quickly and neatly. It is easy to install and remove and takes up very little space. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Much easier (and much less costly) to just remove the top of the shaver and tap it slightly to empty the whiskers. Rinse under faucet if desired. Shaver does not always charge when sitting on the device. Have to remove it from the stand and hook it up to the charge cord. This is an idea whose time has not arrived. Went back to my Panasonic ES8003 which takes up far less space, is easier to clean and gives a better shave.</li>
    <li> This braun clean &amp; renew refill cleans perfectly leaving a nice and cool soft shave without any scratch.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say here -- my face feels better as a result of these refills?  They work just like the ones that originally came with the shaver.  Woo.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to buying these at Wal-Mart. Three for the price of two is a good deal. Will continue to buy these through Amazon!</li>
    <li> They are what they are... been using this system for years and razor still performs as new! Keep your blade/foil maintained and enjoy!</li>
    <li> My husband is using those cartridges for several years. He likes this self-cleaning system very much. I bought him supply of cartridges for all year.</li>
    <li> This alcohal-based cleaner, selected manually, does a good job of fitting in the shaver base and cleaning  the Braun electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in great condition.  Product works as advertised.  Product that works as it should, excellent service and on-time arrival.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that!</li>
    <li> These are fine, but I find that they don&#x27;t always last the month.  The alcohol in them evaporates in a dry house during the winter and I have found the device telling me that the level is too low to operate in less than 1 month.  But what are your other options if you have the Braun?</li>
    <li> My rating was based on quick response to my order and shipment. Also I do like the fact that you can order a three pack instead of two pack and I would recommend this product to anyone using an electric razor. More than likely I will reorder.</li>
    <li> this system is really cool... I don&#x27;t have to bother cleaning my shaver anymore and the clean &amp; renew refills are easy to install.</li>
    <li> A simple bargain...more for less. Comparing prices with retail outlets this was a bargain. If you can afford to think and buy ahead in multiples this is a $$ saver</li>
    <li> I just love my Braun electric shaver. For a lazy guy like me, the refills are easy to change and do a great job of cleaning the shaver. Whats not to like?</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best deal around on this item. Buy 3 and stock yourself for the next year and get free shipping. Item performs the job wonderfully. I&#x27;m very happy with the Braun Clean &amp; Renew shaving system.</li>
    <li> I received the renew refills as ordered.  The price for the refills was the best I could find and an excellent deal.  I bought three boxes since this will be something that I can use for a long time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have the Braun shaver, this is the deal to maintain it.</li>
    <li> A quick and easy transaction. Delivered during the holiday rush without a hitch. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> New shaver any time you want. Great stuff. Smells good. Cheap and fast ship from Amazon. Well done Braun!</li>
    <li> After reviewing several shaver&#x27;s for my husband as a Christmas present, I bought the Braun CCR3 Syncro Shaver.  He always remarks on the great shave.</li>
    <li> These Braun shavers are great.  I&#x27;ve never had such a close, quick shave from an electric razor.  They are expensive, but do a great job.  The ingredients on the cleaning cartridge state the the contents are denatured alcohol and perfume.  I wonder if you can refill with some kind of denatured alcohol.  I have a feeling that Braun makes big bucks on the refills and sells the shaver at a narrow profit margin.  It&#x27;s a lot like video game systems.  Companies like Nintendo don&#x27;t make that much on the system hardware, but make a ton on the software and licensing fees - that&#x27;s where the money is.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the shaver and these replacement cartridges are easy to use.  Just throw away the old one and insert a new one.  He wouldn&#x27;t go back to the old fashioned way.</li>
    <li> This price is great.  These cartarages are very hard for me to find and knowing I can get 3 for this low price with a great price for shipping is worth it.</li>
    <li> This product can&#x27;t be shipped by air.  If you want it shipped quickly or are in HI or AK, you can&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver gives a really good close shave.  Much better than my old Braun shaver. It&#x27;s convenient, I like the hard carrying case (good for putting in your suitcase), the window showing how strong the battery is , is also nice.  The message about how long my most recent shave was is silly.  What I find too much is the recharger/cleaner.  Just give me a brush and I&#x27;ll clean the thing myself.  And it&#x27;s no big deal to plug in the razor when it needs recharging.  Too fiddly.</li>
    <li> I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean.  We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try, this was not the ideal solution to using the refills.  We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone, I searched for a better price.  The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and, with free shipping and scheduled shipments, this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with.  Great product -- excellent value.</li>
    <li> Diaster!  SHipment was made to an address that does not receive USPS delivery.  All previous deliveries have come UPS or FedEx Ground.  Even after lots of email exchanges could not get this straightened out.  Usually your service has been unmatched and thorough. Never again.</li>
    <li> Good price...and what could be easier; place your razor in it&#x27;s &#x27;house&#x27; and return tomorrow for a cleaned and charged razor, ready to go!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew was fairly priced. The product was as expected. Great deal! I would strongly recommend it especially from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Original equipment manufacturers cartridge which works well. This was a good price with speedy delivery. These cartridges are like razor blades- work well, have a short life(25 cleanings) and are quite expensive to replace.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But, it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol, although i often check these and when they are around 2/3&#x27;s full, i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However, at 2/3&#x27;s full or 3/4&#x27;s full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week&#x27;ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Better price than two at the store.  Plus they deliver quickly right to your door so you don&#x27;t have to wait in line behind the ONE person that still writes checks there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I purchased this razor.  It works for me as well as I had expected.  Great product. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in very short time. The Braun Shaving system is perfect for me! one press of the button is all it takes to clean and renew my shaver!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I used it with my Braun shaver. This really helps get the whiskers up to get a close shave. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> A nice pack for a fair price, with 8995 and other series. clean your razor daily or semi-daily :):)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deal I could find on these refills for my husband&#x27;s shaver. They do what they are meant to do but there really is no reason to charge close to $10 for a box with alcohol in it. Other than that it works great.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Braun Machine with autocleaning system and after my included refill was empty, I boutght this 3-Pack, wich has an excellent price and is very easy to replace. The results are just Excellent, exactly the same as the first refill (included with the machine), when the machine does the autocleaning, it feels like a brand new machine again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this Braun machine. I must say that shaving with the machine is not as perfect as using my old Gillete Match3, but I use the machine for everytime I need to shave, except when I have a special ocassion and then I shave with a Match3.</li>
    <li> It was great to get a good price on these.  My husband loves his shaver and these are required as needed.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years and still love them</li>
    <li> Getting these in the mail for this price was so much better than running around in Wal Mart trying to get someone to open the case and get one out for me.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;three pack\\&quot; arrived promptly; the packs appear genuine and they are convenient. I use them but I am not 100% clear why I do so - maybe because I am lazy and want to think I am sweet and clean? I am a medical doctor and I don&#x27;t think they are helping me to be especially hygienic. They do clean the razor foils/cutters and screen well and they make that end of my razor smell nice after their noisy little spritzing. However, I imagine I could refill the containers with a little isopropyl alcohol and a dash of scent and not spend near the money?</li>
    <li> They are exact workable units that do the job as they should and will fill the bill for my needs for time to come.</li>
    <li> Good performance through excellent design.  Drawback is that the cleaning liquid evaporates rather quickly when installed in the cleaning head.</li>
    <li> Always need these refills for my shaver so am happy to be able to get them in bulk from a supplier.</li>
    <li> NOT Happy feel cheated! &amp;#34;Dislike&amp;#34;  I Felt like something was wrong when cleaning my razor it had a different smell than what I was use too, not the clean fresh smell like cleaning it in the past; It smelled more like rubbing alcohol... Never had this problem in the past....  The cleaner I received looks clear not the blue look... Its a shame I didn&#x27;t pick up on this before I used one... Be sure to look close at what you receive.....</li>
    <li> It is great! It works exactly like i expected and i do recommend it for a new buyer.  fast and easy to use, and to replace.</li>
    <li> These clean and renew refills are needed if you have a Braun shaver with clean and renew system.  Pricey but do work well to keep the shaver clean and smelling refreshed.  Buy them here and save over the local retailer.</li>
    <li> Fits my shaver cleaner system perfectly.  Three boxes all shrink wrapped together. Factory-quality.  Haven&#x27;t had a problem with them ever.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and good price. Bought for my husband who uses this system and he loves the cleaning system. Good buy.</li>
    <li> No three packs anywhere.  We like to stock pile and this really helps.  Worth the price to have them on hand.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it irks me that I have to (in theory) keep buying these.  But once I got past that I have to admit that they seem to last a long time.  Whether they actually improve my razor or not, I&#x27;m unclear.</li>
    <li> Keeping my Braun Electric Shaver, back in working in supreme condition. Always being able to self-clean when needed with this great 3-pack!</li>
    <li> Very simple to install as replacement cartridges. These will last you about a year of usage given a daily shave. Pleasant barbershop scent. Wished the cost was lower considering it is water, alcohol and scent.</li>
    <li> These are the refills for the Braun 7000 series, easy to put in and necessary to clean my shaver so these are awesome and important to me lol.</li>
    <li> Braun make the best high tech simple electric shaving machine with closest shave ever used. The cleaning solution make sure that the shaver is maintained free of any bacteria and stay ready and cleaned</li>
    <li> Five stars, Excellent in fit and in style,  Lasted thru many machine washings.  I literally woore them out and would be reluctant to order order any other replacement.</li>
    <li> A 3-pack of cleaner cartridges.  They work.  Nice lemony scent.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> The renew kit is a great recharge for the Braun electric shaver and Amazon&#x27;s auto-order subscription service makes it quick, easy, and saves you few bucks!  Not to mention that it makes sure that you always have spare refills.  This is a must have for anyone that has the Braun cleaning system.</li>
    <li> You can by a lot of blades for what it costs to use this system.</li>
    <li> The refills were exactly what I needed for my Braun shaver. The price and delivery were unbeatable.  A great deal.</li>
    <li> Good buy!  Same as in stores at a lower price.</li>
    <li> Anyone who owns a Braun razor knows about this cleaner.  It is a necessary item that you must purchase since these refills have to be replaced every month.  Makes the razor clean, and keeps it functioning properly.</li>
    <li> They turned out to be good and working just like the ones I got with my shaver.. They last very long if used properly..</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and I love having extras on hand when my old one runs out. They are a must have.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat these, they work well and clean your razor for you.  I enjoy the citrus scent it leaves behind, or at least I think it is citrus.  They are a bit on the pricey side, but what are you going to do.  The razor offers to great a shave to ditch it because the cost of a cleaning cartridge    A good secret to make this thing last long is buy a cheap bottle of alcohol at a pharmacy, cvs sells it for a dollar.  If you want buy some witch hazel as well, its about the same cost.  Pour the alcohol in the cartridge and if you want add a touch of witch hazel for the smell.  It works great, I do it all the time and have owned the same razor for 4 years.  Its saves me a ton money especially during the summer months when the solvent pretty much just evaporates at 4 times the speed.  Just keep an eye on the hair build in the cartrigde, you can work a cartridge for 3 times its normal life.  More if you empty the hair out before cleaning it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp;amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]&lt;br /&gt;The Braun cleaners work fine.  Keep razor clean.  What more can I ask.</li>
    <li> If you have this kind of razor &amp; stand you need these cleaner cartridges.  My razor stays nice and clean.  But don&#x27;t throw a used cartridge away.  Save it.  Then when you get 2 used cartridges, pour some of the remaining solution in one into the other, being careful not to include the solids at the bottom.  This has worked well for me.  It gets 3 cartridges for the price of 2.  And when this cartridge is exhausted, save the fluid for ANOTHER refill, always being careful not to include the solids from the bottom in the refilled cartridge.  In time, though, you&#x27;ll have to throw everything away and start with a fresh new cartridge.</li>
    <li> This Braun system is about the best I&#x27;ve used for an electric.  The item arrived promptly, so the seller is good, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost three years now. It cleans well, and I can feel confident that my shaver is clean &amp; sanitary every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Braun for approximately 6 months and just signed for the regular mailing (every 3 months) of the refills.  They do a nice job of cleaning and keeping the shaver smelling fresh every use.</li>
    <li> Keeps the razor clean and cutting close.  My refill lasts about two months so I get the automatic shipment every 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute necessity to keeping your Braun shaver clean and shaving properly. Seems to Lubricate the parts as well as clean them.</li>
    <li> It is what it is and the price was good and I didn&#x27;t want to drive any where so there you have it.  Looks good but I knew it would it fit great but again I knew it would and I am happy I got it... but I knew I would.  So it is what it is and I am happy</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference after cleaning the Braun 760 cc shaver on its base. It feels and smells like a brand new shaver. And you can save some cleaning liquid by putting the caps back on the plastic tanks right after use, at least it is working for me.</li>
    <li> This is an easy and simple way to get refills for the shaver.  Always good to have some extras just when the old one fills up.</li>
    <li> Bought this item directly from Amazon.  Item arrived in good packaging and in factory sealed box.  I have been using these refills for a little more than a year now and I am completely satisfied with the way they are used to clean my Braun shaver.    I would recommend switching them out with a new one every time the light on the base turns yellow.  I always use the lid from the new refill to close and seal the old one before disposing of it.  I was able to get them a little cheaper by adding this to my Amazon subscriptions.</li>
    <li> Went to 2 Super-Targets and a Walgreens - not to be found. Might as well save time &amp; gas and buy it here.</li>
    <li> If you need these, this is a great source to pick them up &amp; save a few bucks!  Short &amp; simple...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a \\&quot;Braun 360\\&quot; for about four years now.  While it is definitely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned (it glides through my heavy beard even when I skip a day), finding the cartridges for it has always been a hassle and expensive.  This 3-pack via Amazon costs less than a 2-pack at the only store near me that sells them.  Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the original cleaning liquids that came with the shaver. They work the same but I just don&#x27;t get as many cleanings.</li>
    <li> Braun kind of &amp;#34;forces&amp;#34; you to buy these refills.  They aren&#x27;t excessively expensive, but can add up if you are using your shaver daily and clean it daily.  Subscribe and save is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> Good service, exactly what needed</li>
    <li> These refills work fine and keep the razor clean. Not a lot more to say, they do what they were intended to do!</li>
    <li> Excellent choice for the price offered.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it constantly reloading every time the electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it with the electric razor (Braun Series 7)</li>
    <li> What a clean, healthy shave this gives.</li>
    <li> Cleaning the Braun shaver with this is a must for maintaining the optimum operation quality of the cutting blades etc.</li>
    <li> These worked great for my husbands Braun Electric Shaver!</li>
    <li> This should last awhile for my cordless Braun 360 complete shaver.  Looked on line and got this really great deal.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the packaging and price of these cleaning system units.</li>
    <li> A must for these shavers.</li>
    <li> I know...Many of you out there were just like me...I am &#x27;Old School&#x27; and still firmly believed the BEST way to clean my brand-new Braun razor was by painstakingly taking it apart; brushing, soaking, dipping, and trying to assemble all the little clicky places, points, bumps and tolerances back together without breaking something. WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Braun razor, which incidentally gives me a shave as close as any blade (the very first electric razor in my life to do so)came with this wonderful cleaning system cradle. After shaving, you drop the razor head down into its cradle, which contains the cleaning solution cartridge (THIS PRODUCT). The cradle has the Braun Cleaning Cartridge in the bottom.  VERY easy to insert. The cradle has a series of lights on it telling you how much liquid is left in the cartridge and how clean your razor is at that point.  You decide when to activate cleaning it by just pushing a button on the cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Refill Cartridge and cradle do ALL the work for you! No more taking apart, worrying about losing or breaking parts and tedious cleaning by hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the cartridge is low the cradle will indicate this too, and that is when you replace the old self-contained cartridge with a fresh Braun Refill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase these in a brick-and-mortar store I suppose, but I did not have much luck locally in my small town so always buy them in a two or three-pack through Amazon.  I clean my Braun razor every Sunday so I don&#x27;t forget, and the cartridge lasts me about three months, pretty good!  During the cleaning cycle the razor is cleaned, sanitized and comes out smelling very pleasant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a big favor - DON&#x27;T struggle any longer, modernize, and use your accompanying Braun cradle cleaning system with these wonderful cartridges.  They do a terrific job and you can be cleaning your golf clubs or weapons in the time you use to spend cleaning your old razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I started using the Braun Cleaning System and refills, and you will be too!started using the Braun Cleaning System and refills, and you will be too!</li>
    <li> Cleaning the shaver head is key to a good morning shave and to keeping the blades lasting longer.  I used to clean only 1x per week because I didn&#x27;t want to run out of solution (I was paying ~35% more for the solution from bricks &amp; mortar stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the savings I got by ordering bulk from Amazon I started running the cleaning more often, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference on my face - the skin is clearer now with fewer blemishes.  I plan to keep up more frequent cleanings to see if this is a permanent improvement.</li>
    <li> Great item, very happy</li>
    <li> Again this is the only product available that I know of to clean and renew the Braun shaver. It seems to work fine. The price compared to retail stores is great and the auto shipment makes it even cheaper.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. We have had this shaver for about 4 years now and have used the same refills. No problems at all.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I needed at a fair price. This is a great system and if you keep maintained lasts a long time. I like ease of use in cleaning and then usually rinse off any remaining cleaning solution before using to avoid and skin irritation. Solution cleans the shaver well.</li>
    <li> Great product, however runs out very quickly even without use.  Don&#x27;t understand how it locks you out and won&#x27;t let you clean the shaver even if it has been barely used sometimes.  More of a problem with the cleaning sensor, but still a pain.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several years now.. keeps my shaving head very clean for next usage</li>
    <li> These refills are the same as the original that comes with shaver. I did refill the original with a combo of mouthwash and some almond oil. Since I got a got six months from the one original that came with razor, I decided to purchase these to make sure the razor is properly lubricated. I paid about $15 for the three (3) set of refills. Without lubrication, the blades will dull very fast and not cut as close.&lt;br /&gt;I applaud the Braun manufacturing for not forcing the users to use these refills, but offer them as an option unlike other manufacturers who like to sell proprietary components that you have to buy in order for their product to work properly. The cost seems fair and not overly priced.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these refills for your Braun Syncro. and I highly recommend the razor itself if you can afford it. It is the best I have owned so far. Stays sharp, cuts close even with several days of beard growth.</li>
    <li> These are a great thing for cleaning my shaver but now my electric shaver is not working, so now I got 2 more of these unit&#x27;s I can&#x27;t use, but that&#x27;s the way I had to buy, in packs of three, so now the two other unit&#x27;s are just sitting in my wall cabinate...</li>
    <li> The refills arrived when the dealer said they would and in perfect condition. Only was able to use one of the refills as the razor quit working a month after receiving the items.</li>
    <li> Works like advertised, no problems.</li>
    <li> The product is described accurately in the listing, the price was fair and the shipment of the product was very fast.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner and was as described! 100% satisfied! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Easy to installed and received in reasonable time. Worked good.</li>
    <li> The price on Amazon is better than the store where I purchased these in the past.  They work good, and keep my razor running smoothly.  I do have one complaint, this item seems to evaporate, I feel like I should get more cleanings out of them than I do...but alas, I&#x27;d rather have to buy more of these, than replace my razor.  Since the product smells and feels mostly alchy like, that would explain the fast evaporation rate!    All in all!    Pros: Keeps razor clean, and are cheaper on amazon than in store  Cons: They evaporate.</li>
    <li> The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more, the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store, and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change).</li>
    <li> Ive been using this shaving system for a while. Honestly the cartridges last a lot longer than advertised. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product has worked perfectly for me so far, and has made sure my shaver has smelled clean and has kept it from getting dirty.  I would recommend this to any customer with a Braun electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time (early even) and was exactly as described.  I will be a return customer for sure!</li>
    <li> If you happen to own an older Braun Pulsonic 9000, these refils are for that shaver as well. They just don&#x27;t mention it.</li>
    <li> The rating for the refills is low because unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use them.  The Braun M90 Shaver for which I purchased the refills was a big disappointment as it did not do as intended - shave/remove hair.  So therefore, I wasn&#x27;t able to utilize the refills, but am now stuck with them.  Not a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my friend, who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he&#x27;d be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they&#x27;d be cheaper than the drugstore prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was right about the drugstore price comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However--when they didn&#x27;t show up in 2 days, I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials), so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit, and work just perfectly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend, at least ;)</li>
    <li> I appreciate being able to buy this standard product at lower prices than &#x27;stores&#x27;, even Walmart, and get free shipping with buying only 2 boxes. Thanks!</li>
    <li> this is a must if you have the braun razor, I like this better then the one that comes with the shaver. this stuff has a nice lemony smell to it</li>
    <li> Ok so maybe not forever....but for a really long time.    First I love the braun shavers.  One of the best buys I ever made.....no exaggeration.  Your face will take a few weeks up to a month or so...  ...to get used to it but once it does, it is really great.    MEGA TIP...!!!  1. There is a double plastic cap thingy that seals each refill pack. Do Not Throw Away!    2. Once the auto-cleaning-cycle finishes simply remove the cleaning-solution-pack and snap the cap(s) back on.    3. You can use it for easily 6 months or whenever you feel too grossed out by it.    4. I clean my shaver whenever the digial indicator, on the butt of my shaver, says to which is like once every few weeks.(Series 7 Shaver)    5. Why would want to leave the cleaning-solution-pack open the whole time inside the cleaner chassis?    6. It is alcohol based of some sort, i&#x27;m guessing, it will evaporate within a couple of months. Bogus.    7. Just remove and re-seal it....it will last soooo much longer.    I&#x27;ve been doing this for a couple of years and this morning I just felt like paying-it-forward to help you all out.</li>
    <li> My beard grows very quickly. I was in 7th grade when I got my first razor. This is a tremendous product that helps me get a close shave in much less time than traditional methods. Few electric razors do a passable job, and I have found the Braun Series 7 760 that requires these cleaners to be the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure happy that I can still come back and get the same excellent product and Amazon is so easy to use!</li>
    <li> These Braun razor items do an excellent job of cleaning the razor, especially if the cleaning function is used after every shave.</li>
    <li> These refills are very competitively priced.  I liked the price so well I &#x27;overbought&#x27; and will probably never use all the refills.</li>
    <li> These are great for allowing my to clean my shaver all the time. Also I love the subscription option so now I&#x27;ll never forget to order and run out.</li>
    <li> This is the third time that I&#x27;ve ordered these and each time they have arrived in pristine condition.  Highly recommend.    I clean my shaver every day in it&#x27;s holder and these last about 30 days.  I replace it on the first of each month so I can keep track.  Price is also great - I can&#x27;t find them locally for any less.</li>
    <li> Replaced this shaver with another brand.</li>
    <li> When you use it the next shave feels good and smells fresh. Like a new shaver.  Although, this stuff is expensive. Sometimes I buy a bottle of Lectric Shave and refill the container, it works just as well (but I don&#x27;t like the smell of it).</li>
    <li> It is kind of annoying that you have to replace the entire container every time...but it is what it is. These are the standard replacement that clean well and smell nice.</li>
    <li> This cleaner does what it is advertised to do. The shaver is clean and smells nice the next morning. You can use water instead, but this is much simpler to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement at great price.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Component was manufactured in Germany and works great.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Timely delivery</li>
    <li> Good quality at a better cost than the store</li>
    <li> This item came really fast with standard shipping and it serves it purpose.</li>
    <li> Great price, service!</li>
    <li> THESE REFILLS MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BLADES. I TRIED TO BE CHEAP BY RINSING OUT ONE THAT WAS USED UP. THEN PUT RUBBING ALCOHOL AS A REPLACEMENT. IT CLEANED THE BLADES BUT THEY WEREN&#x27;T SHAVING ME. REASON IS THE REFILLS HAVE SOME OIL IN THEM AS WELL. SAVES THE BLADE YOUR BEARD, OR LEGS WHATEVER, AND YOUR MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. GOOD PRICE ON AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I really love the Braun shavers (I have two one for home and one for travel or a home spare)they are about the best shaver for the money in my opinion and this was the selling point having the cleaning solution to really clean with an alcohol based fluid sold me.These handy replacement solution containers make it a snap to change them out when they are no longer usable and with the cleaning/recharging base telling you to change it that is fantastic,great idea and time saver.</li>
    <li> Keeps the blades clean and well lubricated.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a better way to clean and lubricate the razor...but this is it.  One trick that I use to prolong the life of the solution is give the razor a couple of blasts with a can of compressed air before running it through a cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the 3 pack and it was shipped free with the rest of my items. Easier and less expensive than buying it at my local drug store. It came promptly and I will order it again when needed.</li>
    <li> So these are a must have for the super smart man that saved up and got the best shaver in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we have to take a major hit on the wallet? Maybe. What&#x27;s a Fiver in costs every 6-10 weeks, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I can swing it this year, but if hard times come and that kid gets re elected, if the greedy NYC &amp; DC folk keep making gas &amp; utilities costs higher, and we get hammered even worse--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I heard you can refill these with 2-5 drops of lemon juice and a top off with cheap pharmacy isotropic rubbing alcohol to save a spot of cash. Manually clean and mechanically clean on alternating days or weeks if you want to be a frugal type. Consult youTube in a big way for tips on this ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to not dispose of the cap, recap after cleaning cycles, and avoid evaporation or fast waste of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do what I say, and you will stretch your cash from a 30 day reload to a 60-180 day reload.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my braun for three years. the first half year I used the cleaner regularly, but stopped due to the counterspace the fixture occupied. I recently put a third set of screens/cutters on it and bought a set of these to see if they acyually made a difference. well...I&#x27;m quite surprised to find that the shave is smoother and much like the braun when it was new.</li>
    <li> We the clean &amp; renew solution evaporating when you keep it inserted in the cleaner, you might as well us the shaver everyday to get your monies worth.  But, who wants to pay $20 for two in the store, when you can get 3 for less.  The package came quickly and the solution is lemon fresh.  I&#x27;m going to defiantly purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic of this system when I purchased my last Braun razor, but I must admit it is nice.  It is another \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; cost, but my razor is always clean and my wife no longer complains about whisker \\&quot;dust\\&quot;.  Does anybody know where one can purchase these in bulk for a lower price per unit? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would like for Braun to make the cleaning operation less noisy, however.  My wife now complains about the grinding noise that it makes, alas.... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Used every two weeks, the Braun Shaver System Cleaner removes all traces of residue left from facial oils &amp; perspiration. Cleans shaver head and recharges shaver (when necessary). Extends the useful life of the razor comb &amp; cutter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they do the job.</li>
    <li> I like getting a 3 pack of system cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works great as expected...</li>
    <li> I like that my razor is clean so I use this solution every day.  For me it has lasted a little over 40days. It works very well and does not appear to leave a residue on the razor.</li>
    <li> Has kept my Braun electric shaver running smoothly for over 8 years now!</li>
    <li> The refills only lasts for a short time.  The razor only does a fair job.  All in all this is expensive shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a gift for my husband. He loves the Braun shaver and thinks it is just great to use the cleaning system- keeps everything running well and it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Just like everything else, printers are cheap, but the refills are a complete rip-off. Just like Gillette razor blades are over-priced, the solution is how this company continues to rack in the cash after your bRaun purchase. I find it sad that all these companies try to do is make money every way they can epically just selling something as a cleaning solution based of a common element that is extremely cheap. Like the person below me said, it would be more practical for the customer to buy a gallon of the solution and fill it them self. It works, but is still a rip-off.</li>
    <li> Company claims new formula but solution does not last that long versus the &lt;br /&gt;old one. &lt;br /&gt;I think this is just one of those marketing hypes to force you to buy more &lt;br /&gt;refills.</li>
    <li> If you have a Braun Shaver and need the Clean and renew refills, look no further. This is the best price around - and if you buy a few, FREE (and fast) SHIPPING. I know I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> every time I charge and clean my razor it&#x27;s as good as having a new razor. I hope they don&#x27;t change the design or stop making these things.</li>
    <li> you need these to keeep your braun smelling lemon fresh.  i dont shave every day so my cartridges last like 2 months.  Definately worth the money.  i bought 3 at a time for like a year supply and got free shipping.  i dont even know where to buy these in the store so i just order them here.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am not a daily shaver so I only replace the refills every 8-9 weeks. Even after that period of time, there is still 1/3 of the liquids left but for hygienic reasons you would probably want to change the refill anyway. I think the refills are reasonably priced and keeps the blades all clean for the next round.</li>
    <li> SAME SHAVING SYSTEMS, I NEED TO BUY BULK...GREAT PRICE THANKS...</li>
    <li> The Braun razor provides you with one cleaning cartridge and recommends that you clean your razor after each shave and replace the cartridge after one months use. This can get rather expensive and I have found for my own use that cleaning once every three days works fine which would give the cartridge a three month lifespan. Some reviewers have stated that the cleaning fluid would evaporate before you reached three months, but I have found this to not be the case. Overall it does an excellent job of cleaning and lubricating the razor blades if you follow the direction that come with the razor.</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to find in stores but it is the only one that keeps my shaver really clean. Since I started using the auto shipping I&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
    <li> The Braun Syncro shaver works great and the cleaning system seems to work, it&#x27;s not just a gimmick.  The solution lasts longer than stated.  Refills were easy to order, decent price, and quick ship.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Braun for about 18 months and am very pleased with it. The cleaning system keeps the heads clean, and makes keeping them clean a breeze. The refills are easy to use, and the cost for 3 of them, which lasts me about 9 months, are reasonably priced. And, they do have a pleasant smell to them. So, shoving the razor around on my face isn&#x27;t quite as much of a chore with the nice smell.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a gift for that man in your life, this is a great idea.</li>
    <li> The description of these saver refills was not clear.  I wound up ordering two boxes because by the time I got to check out there was no description that told me there were 3 refills in each box you ordered. It was also unclear, even after nearly two hours of searching the web, that these refills were the right refills for my shaver.  I wound up with 2 boxes that contain 3 refills in each box, not what I wanted.      Now for the good news;  These refills work for several of Braun&#x27;s shavers and were exactly right for my shaver.  My Dad has an older version of this shaver and they work in his shaver so one box worked as a great gift.      Braun should make it clearer which shavers, by model number, work with these refills in all descriptions of these refills on the box and on the web.  This was unclear on Braun&#x27;s web site in all the descriptions of their shavers and was unclear in every description I read on the web.    YOU GET 3 REFILLS IN EACH BOX YOU ORDER.  This needs to be clear in the description.</li>
    <li> They work fine. They cost too much, but seem to be the only choice. I like the smell of whatever their magic liquid is.</li>
    <li> I bought these cleaner refills after reviewing another reviewer.  Even after shipping charges these refills are much cheaper than any other I have been able to find anywhere.  I would certainly recommend purchasing them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in small type, but I made the mistake of ordering this as part of a gift and didn&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s not returnable to Amazon. So we&#x27;re stuck with it and my husband wants neither this nor the electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun shaver and those were recommended with it so I got them but it turns out that they are for self cleaning shavers only.</li>
    <li> This product works great and as advertised, but I found that when you open a new cartridge it is a bit difficult to do so without spilling the contents a bit in the process.  It is best to put the cartridge on a firm, flat surface (such as the sink or a table) before pulling off the tab to open.  If you try to do so while holding the unit in your hand, you will likely slosh some of the liquid out and make a mess.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this product. It lasts pretty long and works great. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I will certainly buy mores stuff here .. ... .. .. .... ... .. .. .... ... .. .. ..</li>
    <li> I have used a couple Braun shaving systems that use these refills.  The system works well and the cleaning leaves the shaver nice and lubricated, clean, and fresh scented.  Always like a new shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package on amazon is a good price, and three packs aren&#x27;t found in many places.  The biggest drawback to the cleaning system is the cost, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> as stated, these are a great price for the product, and they do exactly what they are intended to do.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver and cleaning units.  Every week, it&#x27;s like using a clean shaver.  I also don&#x27;t have to clean it after each use.</li>
    <li> These work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Refills for my shaving system. Each cartridge lasts about a month.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal compared to the cost at any of the local retailers. Additionally, the option to automatically reorder is a great timesaver.</li>
    <li> These cleaning solution refills, when inserted into the cleaning base, do a great job cleaning the shaver. I purchase these regularly for my husband, and his shaver has lasted years now. Of course, once in a while you have to purchase a new shaver blade head, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun electric razor for my husband and couldn&#x27;t believe how hard it was to find the refills! Now that they&#x27;re coming via subscribe and save, the razor is once more providing a nice, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I thought these refills didn&#x27;t last long enough but I discovered a technique that increases the life considerably.  When the change refill light comes on unplug the unit and plug it back in.  It now says there is more life in the refill.  You can do this many times before the refill actually runs dry.</li>
    <li> If you own a Braun, you&#x27;ve gotta keep it clean right ?  Since there are no competitive replacements, then we must look for economical ways to purchase.  This 3 pack is an economical way to purchase.</li>
    <li> The trick here is to put the cover back on these inbetween uses.  Lasts 3 times longer. l l l l</li>
    <li> If you have a Braun razor, this is the only product you can use in the cleaner/recharger.  It&#x27;s somewhat overpriced.</li>
    <li> I buy these to keep my razor in great condition and they sure fill the bill at a low cost. They are twice the price in the store socan&#x27;t beat the deal. Yes I know you can concoct a recipe to make a similar cleaning solution but for all the trouble of getting three raw products, mixing them and gas to run to the various stores why bother at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it afraid if my boys would be strong enough to use it (mainly the 3 yo). But both of them used perfectly and had a lot of fun. Very good product. By the way. The pack of 2...it arrived 2 sets, as described. I was afraid with the other reviews, but it arrived according to the description.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this product. This three pack is less than a two pack at Walmart. I don&#x27;t shave every day so I take out the refill and reseal it with the top so it lasts longer. All in all great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> You can buy this anywhere but not for the unit price of about $5 each</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I have found for multiple refills, it caost less for these 3 than it does for a 2 pack at my local store.</li>
    <li> Finally, I found a vendor that sold these on-line. I Googled every company. I heard &amp;#34;That product is no longer available.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> There is so much packaging involved in the refillable cleaner for this product. I wish you could just refill the refill cartridges, or at least be able to recycle them. So much waste! And not that cheap either.</li>
    <li> The Clean &amp; Renew Refills; let you keep your shaver working, like new. I re-seal mine, after use and they last longer.</li>
    <li> I think I have my subscribe and save set to 6 months which is perfect. It seems once I load the last cartridge I&#x27;m getting an email from amazon telling me the next set is on its way. Its cheaper this way and less hastle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, its exactly what you need if you have a Clean and Renew razor. There really is nothing else to say about that.</li>
    <li> That set is good and fare, it smells comfort and do clean the shaver knives, and in my opinion, you need only order a pack annual。</li>
    <li> Excellent cleaning/lubricating. Price keeps going up and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the older system. Definitely better than cleaning it yourself.</li>
    <li> If your going to go the Self Cleaning route, purchasing the 3 pack is the best value. At least it was for me at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li> This is just a replacement for a regular service item.  Glad to have it in three-packs rather than duos, and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I like the package of three, they work great on the system and help me keep the razor clean at all times.</li>
    <li> The refill kits really do a good job of cleaning and maintaining my husband&#x27;s razor.  Easy to remove and replace.</li>
    <li> I used Braun razors for years. I used to think they were the best, but I got tired of their shoddy cleaning bases and pricey solutions. I&#x27;ve since switched to the Norelco 3d and that razor is no joke. Best save ever, by a mile. And their cleaning solution is easier to find locally than Braun&#x27;s and costs less too.</li>
    <li> Arrive in time and works as it should.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. It is a factory new Braun product that fits and functions perfectly. what more can I say.</li>
    <li> I bought my Dad a Braun series 5 with the clean &amp; renew holder.  With this system he does not have to take the shaver apart, just push a button and it cleans itself.  I did have to post a few notes on what button to push to clean, but I think we have it under control now!  Greatest purchase I ever made!</li>
    <li> You have obviously bought the Braun electric shaver, so yes, you need this!  It works  really, really well and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with my Braun shaver but not with the expense of the refills that are used with the cleaning and recharging station. Have tried several of the alternatives that I have googled, but none are as effective as the Braun refills. Came across the 3 pack on amazon.com at a price that made the need to try and jerry rig something that wasn&#x27;t as effective as the original unpractical.  Great price and a true value thanks!</li>
    <li> works well shipped on time.</li>
    <li> If you own a Braun electric shaver then you MUST buy these. They are cheaper on amazon.com then at any retail store!</li>
    <li> These Braun refills are very easy to use and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.  They always do a perfect job in minimum time.  I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I presume if you are buying this then you know if is for replacing your cleaning cartridge of your Braun electric razor.  The prices on these change periodically and my razor is several years old and doing a decent job.  It is nice to pop in a new refill and push a button and know your razor will be cleaned the next time you use it.</li>
    <li> The refills cam neatly packaged and have worked as they were advertised.  I am happy with this product. I would recommend it for the Braun Shaving System.</li>
    <li> Love the cleaning system and use it with every recharge.  Best razor I have ever used.  Highly recommended. Love it.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good refills and they last a good amount of time. The cost seems to be increasing since I first began using them, but they seem to clean the shaver and leaves a clean, refreshing scent.  I also like how this can be used in a variety of Braun models.</li>
    <li> Works with old and new systems.</li>
    <li> These do what they are supposed to do, but are not as often needed as you may think. They can be reused for a long time before needing a brand new one. Frankly, it would have made far more sense for Braun to sell refill FLUID in economy sized bottles. The way they designed this, it&#x27;s more like the printer companies and how they make their money on ink refill sales. The only reason i bought a new package of these cleaning refills this year was because the existing one i had been reusing was too full of debris to continue using. Since Braun has utterly ruined the replacement cutters, i will probably never use the second in the new package of two, because i want to throw my formerly excellent shaver in the trash (the QUALITY replacement cutters cannot be purchased any longer, and it seems all shavers today are made my companies that are hell-bent on selling garbage that kills your face and doesn&#x27;t actually shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reuse these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once your refill has gone empty enough that your cleaning base cannot use it, pull it out and pour alcohol in. 80% or higher alcohol is best (as little water as possible). Add a little skin-safe lubricant (i use pure tea tree oil), and it&#x27;s ready to go again.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a good 6 yrs or more now. Replaced the blades and screen twice and this cartridge about every 6 weeks. ITs like a new razor every morning! The auto ship is great, a lot cheaper than I can get it locally. Even at the big W!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun 8526 for at least 7-8 years. Love the shave. Love the cleaning feature. As many other have con planned about, cleaning solution can run expensive. I have been able to cut down my cost by using a variation of the refill technique previously described. I buy about two cartridges a year. In between, I clean out used cartridge with water/shaking. Let dry. Refill with isopropyl alcohol and then add some Lectric shave (or equivalent). This duplicates the smell and function of the original almost exactly. Does not damage shaver at all. Over at least 5 years using this method and no issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;  Hope this helps people extend life of cleaning solution</li>
    <li> Ever since I bought the shaver I am very happy with the product itself and with the necessary accessories as well</li>
    <li> The solutions dry out pretty fast....even when not used.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much to shave and I only do so twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Usually a refill is only good for about 4 weeks, which averages it to 8 washes for each refill....&lt;br /&gt;Only if I knew, I would have stay away from Braun products.</li>
    <li> good price &amp;&lt;br /&gt;good turn around time!!!!!!</li>
    <li> good price. item is and works as described. nothing else to really say other than i will buy again. .</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and it worked!!! The company who maked this product has never let me down ever!!!</li>
    <li> The shaver is good, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now. However, not too happy with having to buy these replacement clean and renew systems because they&#x27;re expensive and have to be replaced quite frequently. I&#x27;ll continue to buy them until my shaver dies, but can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on a new shaver where I can just rinse with plain old water from the faucet.</li>
    <li> ordered these for a friend</li>
    <li> Need it. It is a must for my electric razor to stay clean and sharp. couldn&#x27;t have it any better than that.</li>
    <li> These refills do the job of cleaning the shaver head and for the first shave afterwards provide a slightly cleaner feel vs manual cleaning with a brush and water.  The problem is they don&#x27;t last long at all.  Plainly put save your $</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> These cleaning cartridges work very well with my shaver and its cleaning system.  I would recommend these units when a replacement is needed.</li>
    <li> This is a Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean &amp; Renew Refills Shaver Refills 3 Pack.  You use it to clean your razor.  They work.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement cleaners for the Braun shaver, shipped quickly, it was well packaged at a fair price. No issure pulling the old out and replacing the new.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that a self-cleaning razor was gimmicky, but after owning for several years now I think that this function is highly useful and that it keeps the expensive razor and blades in decent condition.  My one complaint about the refills is that because they are alcohol based product, it evaporates, so if you shave infrequently and therefore clean infrequently, the product does not last for very long.  The idea of removing the cartridge and capping is decent, but seems like more of an hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> A very good purchase, will definitely purchase these again from here, great selection and the quality is very good, thanks</li>
    <li> These refills go with the Braun shaver system.  The shaver system is wonderful and very easy to use.  The refills are also very easy to use, but not so easy to find.  I was hoping to find them in our grocery store or a pharmacy because I will do anything to avoid having to go to one of the big \\&quot;super stores\\&quot;.  I was thrilled to learn that I could purchase them from Amazon.com.  The three-pack will last a while!</li>
    <li> These refills are really hard to find in stores so I went to the internet.  I found what I needed and placed an order.  The item was delivered within a very short time and I was glad to get it, since my shaver was overdue for a cleaning.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From now on I won&#x27;t waste my time going from store to store looking for this.  I&#x27;ll just order it from Amazon and know that I&#x27;ll have it in record time.</li>
    <li> If you search around, you can find the best price when you buy these in bulk. These work great with the Braun Shaver system... and you&#x27;ve got to have them... so buy a pack at the best price! I found them on Amazon at different prices (and the best price was here with free shipping and no tax)... but I&#x27;ve also found them elsewhere on the web for less at other times... check before you buy!</li>
    <li> This 3 pack of Braun cleaning refills,is by far the lowest price anywhere.</li>
    <li> This pack of three is the same refills sold in most stores in packs of two.  With free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Why bother with cleaning your shaver when this product does it for you, and does it very well?  Simple and easy to use it represents great value.</li>
    <li> These buggers are hard to locate in stores as well as online. This was the only site (out of three) that had them and shipped them in a timely manner. Make sure to buy extras for that man in your life!</li>
    <li> I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while, long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in, it must have been about two months ago, it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year, not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased some braun syncro shaver clean and renew refills from amazon. I received them quickly and they were packed with care. I will be sure to order from here again</li>
    <li> I only use this about once a week it works very well. If you keep the container tightly closed after each use, one of these will last you a very long time, this package will last you over a year.. Why? simply, it contains lots of alcohol and if you keep it open it will simply evaporate (with your money).  This will also   help with your share of creating less plastic waste (the empty container).</li>
    <li> needed this product in a hurry and got it. could not beat the price and needed the product for my shaver system. no complaints and will do this again for any products I need in the future.</li>
    <li> If you have one of the shavers that takes these refills, you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of choice in buying them.  That said, I do rather like the shaver itself and the cleaning system is convenient and effective.  The refills are reasonably priced and last quite a long time.  I shave every 3-4 days (because work doesn&#x27;t mind when I&#x27;m scruffy) and each refill lasts me about 2 months or so.    I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> good cleaner solution for braun devices, besides the regular use, sometimes it evaporates by itself, then you must change the cartridge. Clean and fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Love the bulk pricing.  Perfect replacement.  Cheaper than buying locally with sales tax and more $$ per unit</li>
    <li> OK, a scientific analysis of just what happens when you treat your shaver to an automatic cleaning &amp; lubrication is not forthcoming, nor is  it necessary. It&#x27;s enough to say that if you do it, you will believe (as I do) that each shave with your Braun is like its first (except, perhaps, that it&#x27;s better than your actual first electric shave because your face &amp; beard have been broken in). The CCR Synchro Shaver System is compatible with my old Braun 8995 and my new 9500. It&#x27;s a wonderfully clean &amp; convenient way to keep you shaver in peak condition &amp; to, literally, make each shave like the first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun shaver cleaning system for quite a few years and find it a neat, easy way to keep my shaver working in top condition. I used to have trouble finding the refills online at reasonable prices, but now they&#x27;re readily available (with free shipping if you combine a few) from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have kept my Braun Synchro shaver going for many years by use of the refills and occasional replacement of the screen.</li>
    <li> great product. It cleans my razor very well and it is easy to order online. Eay to remove and replace in razor cleaning unit.</li>
    <li> These products help maintain your razor running at peak level.  You will notice a closer and better shave using this product.</li>
    <li> Husband said this is the best electric shaver ever.</li>
    <li> The items work very well. They are just as advertised.</li>
    <li> The quality was what you can and should expect from any Braun product.  I have been using this product for more than five years.</li>
    <li> If you have the cleaner stand for your Braun Shaver, these refills are the best to use to keep your shaver clean.  Have always used them and always keep a few on hand.</li>
    <li> Keeps shave blades clean.  Mine set of blades and foil last over a a year.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great and the fluid cleaner system works very well keeping the unit clean and sharp. The only drawback is that it is a little expensive to have to keep purchasing cleaner fluid.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my husband, he always using this brand for his braun shaver which i also bought on amzaon, good product</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]  Purchased for replacement of original cartridge that came with the shaver. If you clean the shaver once a week by carefully brushing the head area and placing the head/blade assembly under fast running hot water to remove any remaining hair, each cartridge should last about 40-50 cycles. I also carefully remove the cartridge from the cleaning unit after the cleaning cycle is complete and then replace the covers on the cartridge so that the cleaning liquid does not evaporate. Purchased from Amazon, the cost is quite reasonable to keep the Pulsonic Shaver in like new cleanliness.</li>
    <li> Braun shaver was one of the best purchases I have ever made ... these clean packs are simple to use and keep the shaver in top performing condition.  I&#x27;d suggest this for anyone who wants to simplify daily shaving.</li>
    <li> The service was great.  Odering was easy.  I now as a carsgiver with limited time use this site for all of my shopping except food.</li>
    <li> Good price - quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Nothing more, nothing less. Filter refills for your Braun shaver. A Bit on the pricey side, but the cleaner does do a good job of removing a the little bits of hair from she shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can be a bit difficult to open without spilling though, I wish they&#x27;d fix that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need them, buy them.</li>
    <li> This works well and functions as it is supposed too. I dont have much expectations however. Cleans better than just washing the blades</li>
    <li> I use these regularly.  I love how the Braun shaver cleans itself.  This is certainly a very good cleaning system.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product and works as described. Braun products in my opinion are always of high quality. The only complaint I have is the price is difficult to keep buying when I need it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good buy if you are still into the dry shave thing. I have some left over as I went back to the foam and razor which for me is much more comfortable and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Have bought several of these and never had a problem.  Have used them in my old DOA Braun and my new Braun.</li>
    <li> buy them all the ti9me a ok</li>
    <li> These solution has a powerful way to clean your machine from any hair &amp; germs . Also, one package will be enough, if you use it for cleaning &amp; remove it from the washing system then cover it by its cover .</li>
    <li> My husband needed the foil and cutter pack for his Braun razor.  We found it and added this 3 pack of refills to the order so we could get free shipping.  My husband uses the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges to clean his Braun razor and has for years.  He seems to be very pleased with it and I was very pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 90 year old father and he thought it did a nice job on his shaver.</li>
    <li> If you have a Braun shaver - well - you have to get these....It is just part of the deal.  I can usually get about 7-8 cleanings out of each by keeping the lid and reusing.  Love Braun - and the cleaning system</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for his birthday a couple of years ago and he loves it!! M. has said it&#x27;s the best shaver he has ever used in his lifetime!! M.has said it&#x27;s the closest shave he has ever had and I agree!! I tried the shaver on my legs when he was at work and it shaves your legs as close as a regular inexpensive razor used!! These refills are really great to use with your shaver, it really helps to keep your system nice and clean. It&#x27;s a little expensive in a shaving system, but as the old saying goes- you get what you pay for!! It keeps my man happy and that makes me happy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun shaver owner for years and Amazon seems to have the best price.  When my shaver says CLEAN, I take off the foil cover and rinse off the foil and cutter under running water. Replace the foil and run it thru the clean cycle.  Helps the cartridges last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun for a number of years, and I like the quality of its products.  They are sturdy and refills and accessories are easy to order.</li>
    <li> Good porduct.  Works well. cleans the razor very well. Like the product Very good very good very good very good</li>
    <li> OVERPRICED!  It&#x27;s like Braun&#x27;s emulating the PRINTER MOB ... sort of.  They want a lot for a shaver and then bleed you keeping it clean or nag the heck out of you when you don&#x27;t routinely submit your shaver to  &amp;#34;intense cleaning.&amp;#34;  Three years into this, and I&#x27;m beginning to think that laser hair removal for my facial hair would have been a lot better deal.</li>
    <li> Access on time&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Packaging&lt;br /&gt;New as in the description&lt;br /&gt;good good good good good&lt;br /&gt;good good good good good</li>
    <li> Keeps the shaver clean with a light lemony fragrance.  Love the ease of changing these packs.  Excellent product and I would reccommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very good and leaves a nice lemon smell that lasts over a week for me and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> These refills have really extended the life of my husband&#x27;s shaver.  The auto cleaning system makes it feel new every day.  Great product at a great price via Amazon.</li>
    <li> neat, quick, no fuss no muss.&lt;br /&gt;i mark them with a permanent marker in hubby&#x27;s cabinet just like the furnace filters and everything else for the year and valah.&lt;br /&gt;done and one less thing.. or four less things i have to do for the year.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband one of these Braun shaving machines and eventually needed to buy the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on how good/bad they are as I am not the primary user, but they seem to do their work.</li>
    <li> Replacement canisters for the Braun Syncro Shaver system. Fluid contains alcohol so it evaporates over time and need to be replaced not to mention the liquid becomes contaminated with whiskers from cleaning the shaving head.</li>
    <li> Not really much to say. They do a good job of cleaning your electric razor and give it a fresh, sterile smell. No issues with it.</li>
    <li> These refills (needed about once a month) clean the Braun razor perfectly. Shaving after the cleaning the razor with this solution feels like using a new razor. I didn&#x27;t intend to use everyday but I like  it so much that I use it after every shave and setup an auto-delivery program for it.</li>
    <li> The refill was easy... snap out old... snap in new.  What&#x27;s not to like?  Well, it was easy to spill.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, very functional.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner but it is hard for me to see the line, when it needs to be replaced.  I like the Braun Shaver, in which I have a wireless one.  This liquid does a clean job.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning the razor and extending life of razor</li>
    <li> My husband loves his razor- these refill cleaners works awesomely well with his razor system to self clean the razor!!</li>
    <li> Compared to in store prices, this is a great value for a three pack.  Arrived quickly too.  My husband says these cleaners do really good.</li>
    <li> Works very well and keeps my Braun Razor in great shape. The charger / cleaner station requires it but you will want to use it anyway.</li>
    <li> Good buy ... would purchase again ,,, ,,, ,,,  ,,,&lt;br /&gt;Not much more to say about this purchase ... ...</li>
    <li> u can put any cleaner product inside</li>
    <li> This is the right product for the Braun shaver and it&#x27;s at the right price...delivered to your door. I highly recommend this to others and I&#x27;ll definitely be placing another order.</li>
    <li> previous part worked well.  Reordered.  Have reordered several times very successfully.  Very easy to install.  Nothing more to say again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened it to use it yet but the packaging seems authentic.  Therefore I cannot give a 5 star just yet.  If it&#x27;s the real thing then it should work like a charm.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to get this on-line</li>
    <li> These refills for the Braun Shaver make everything almost maintenance free.  Fantastic!  I would recommend these refills and the Braun Saver to everyone.</li>
    <li> Not much to say. Must have it. Does a great job. You can buy it in bulk (for a year at a time) and only costs like 3-5 bucks a month to own and operate. Go buy a stack of them.</li>
    <li> My sons like these so I get them every year at Christmas time for them. However, these are way overpriced. I get them at Walmart, 2 pk for $10+.</li>
    <li> The price is right and the order was filled very quickly.  Much better than buying it locally for a higher price.</li>
    <li> Probably not essential.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to buy them. Price was right, they are braun product not some after market product.</li>
    <li> good cleaning product for the renew system....but a little expensive.</li>
    <li> quality refills for a great shaving system</li>
    <li> the braun shaver is excellent and these refills keep it fresh and clean. each refill gets me about a month&#x27;s worth of cleaning</li>
    <li> I confess I really dislike companies that sell products that require a recurring purchase of support items (e.g. refrigerators where you have to buy a water filter and produce-drawer-purifier every couple months).  That said, the cleaning system on the Braun really seems to work well. It flushes all the gritty little shaving residues that have eventually clogged up my previous electric razor. There were no instructions for how frequently I need to run the cleaning cycle, so I do it once a week. There&#x27;s a fluid-level marker in the cleaning cartridge that says &#x27;If the fluid gets below this level, change out the cartridge. Either because I live in a dry climate (Denver) or some other reason, the fluid seems to hit that level about 1x per month.  Over all, yes I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have been using the Braun system for over 4 years now.</li>
    <li> The product is great and works well. Purchasing three of them was cheaper and since I will need them makes sense.</li>
    <li> Like price and quantity.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago.  I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills, but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock.  So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did.  Not only was the refills cheaper, but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I no longer have the shaver which requires these since this liquid eventually starts to eat away at the shaver itself.  I replaced the shaver with a Panasonic that uses water/soap based cleaning solution instead of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Cleans the braun shavers well.  The only problem is that it evaporates quickly.  As other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s better to take it out of the shaver charger/kit when not being utilized and reseal with the plastic insert.  That definitely increased the life of the refill.  However, it still gets gummed up quickly.  I ended up rinsing with water first to remove more of the shaving bits prior to running the cleaning cycle with this.  That also ended up helping to extend the use life.</li>
    <li> same stuff you get in the store. Only a bit cheaper. don&#x27;t know what else to say but I have to oh never mind.</li>
    <li> Good quality- Easy to order- Cheap price&lt;br /&gt;Good quality- Easy to order- Cheap price&lt;br /&gt;Good quality- Easy to order- Cheap price</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
