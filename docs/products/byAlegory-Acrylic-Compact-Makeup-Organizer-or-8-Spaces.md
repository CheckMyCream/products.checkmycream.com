<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my blushes and shadows.  My physician&#x27;s formula compacts tend not to fit in this because they are too wide if they have the compartment on the bottom for a brush.  The acrylic is really sturdy and I love that I can find what I&#x27;m looking for easily without digging through my drawer to find what I&amp;#34;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Doesnʻt fit MAC studio fix compacts</li>
    <li> Great product. will buy again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for blusher/powder/highlighter.Great size.Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold my circular makeup containers. Alot of my things like translucent powders are too big for this so Ive been putting some Naked basics palettes in here, but overall I love this container! Its very sleek and pretty :) And it was delivered on the expected date.</li>
    <li> Great organizer. Very good quality, nice looking. You can use it for different items, I use it for little cards and envelopes. I have a clear one.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to store. And because it is transparent it is very convenient</li>
    <li> I have sat and stared at these organizers for months, maybe even years. They are perfection and fit into my Alex drawers like a dream. I purchased the clear acrylic and they fit my bigger compacts with no problem at all, I much prefer these to just stacking up my blush/bronzers etc in the drawer or in smaller containers. This keeps them contained, but not constrained so I can&#x27;t pick them up because they are too close together. The acrylic is sturdy and has no fogging or marks on it.. completely perfect!</li>
    <li> My MAC skin finishes wont fit but my other blushes and powders do.</li>
    <li> Love this organizer since I&#x27;m a neat freak when it comes to my makeup collection. So far it fits Mac blushes, and the Mineralize skin finish fit(not the new packing), the milani blushes don&#x27;t, but for the most part they work</li>
    <li> LOVE This!!! Perfect for make-up organizing. So glad i got it and i highly recommend it! Does not feel like cheap plastic like other products. Love it!!</li>
    <li> some of my compacts didnt fit because they were a bit thicker (usually the MAC ones) but still was good</li>
    <li> Obsessed. They are high quality and fit most brands. Love. Love. Love.</li>
    <li> I like it, the only thing is that it won&#x27;t hold anything thicker like my MAC natural skin finish powders</li>
    <li> Great material but I can only fit Mac blush in the compartments</li>
    <li> Very nice fitted my blushes perfectly</li>
    <li> Just as with the Acrylic Eyeshadow Organizer, one size does not fit all available compacts by competitive brands. Few people subscribe to one kind of brand of foundation or blush. Does not suit most Physician&#x27;s Formula compacts.</li>
    <li> Love this acrylic blush organizer...I had all my blush rolling around in my case and it was so annoying digging through all my makeup for all my blush.  Now they are all standing up, easy to reach and find.  I bought it in clear and looks very classy.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for to organize my cosmetics!!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Great quality. just wish it held more.</li>
    <li> Made beautifully and not cheap. Its great quality acrylic.  It fits most of my blushes. All my mac, be a bombshell and elf. does not fit milani baked blushes. i do recommend the clear!</li>
    <li> These work really well to keep all those baked, mineralized and what have you new powder, blush, shadow, etc. containers organized.  A 2 5/8&amp;#34; diameter container that is 3/4&amp;#34; thick moves around easilly.  Won&#x27;t stand up on its own but think if I put some felt dots on the front it just might work.</li>
    <li> Beautiful streamline design, however the price for Australians is ridiculously high! Then with the price of shipping on top of that...&lt;br /&gt;Would give 5 stars if the price wasn&#x27;t so damn high!</li>
    <li> Such quality product.  It is heavy and not in the least bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> I received this earlier in the week and I am loving it. I&#x27;m thinking about getting one more because I have a lot of MAC compact blushes that fit perfectly with this organizer. I highly recommend if you are a makeup artist like myself or a makeup junkie. You will not regret purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these in clear and I love them. It makes my blushes and compacts so easy to get to. They fit most blushes and compacts that I have, including nars, hourglass (the blushes and ALP&#x27;s) MAC (blushes and skin finishes), tarte, etc. The only thing that does not fit is the fatter MAC studio fix compacts.  They fit my drawer perfectly and make me feel so much more organized. I also have a couple of the lipstick holders that are great as well. They are good quality acrylic, no sharp edges, and are just the right size. I need to get a mother one soon.</li>
    <li> Great organizer. I use it for my MAC blushes and mainly for MAC extra dimension highlighters. The slots are not wide enough for the highlighter to sit all the way down but it holds them in place. The blushes do fit perfectly. I got this organizer over a year ago and still looks nice. No complaints at all. Nice durable acrylic.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Great quality. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> These are perfect. They are the perfect size!</li>
    <li> great quality and perfect for my blushes! super sturdy and perfect for organization. i def will be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> Avon eyeshadow quads, e.l.f. Custom Compact quads, Almay eyeshadow trios only fit upright. I was surprised because, although I don&#x27;t own any Mac compacts, they look huge on YouTube reviews of this tray, and it just didn&#x27;t work for half of my stuff. I was able to use it for the eyeshadows which were too big for the eyeshadow tray I also purchased.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite holder for my makeup in my collection. I have another from byAlegory on the way! Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is pretty expensive for what it actually holds. It doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of variety compacts like my benefit blushes which I have two of amongst a few others.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would say skip it.</li>
    <li> The compartments are so small very little of my powders fit. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Love it except that i wished they would of been a little wider. My milani baked blushed didnt fit. Other than that i would had given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it can not hold my limited edition square compact well.. Am I being too critical probably.. but this is a great way to save space without having to buy another storage drawer case</li>
    <li> This is everything to me! Once I up my collections on blushes, bases,skin finish powders, and bronzers, I will definitely buy another one. Immediately, it makes it all look organize and cute. Just do yourself a favor and get it.</li>
    <li> Its perfect. Really sturdy, and fits a nice amount of my compacts.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for my MAC products, hourglass products and many drugstore compacts as well. I love the sturdiness of it, and I love how it looks on my counter top too. Really pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my love of makeup.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for organizing blushes. I doubt I will buy any more though because I do think the price is completely a rip off. Absolutely rediculious.</li>
    <li> Fits awesome in my vanity</li>
    <li> Great product! Perfect size for my mac eyeshadows &amp; powder compacts.  Shipping was good Can&#x27;t wait for the lipgloss organizer!</li>
    <li> I love this compact it is very practical, pretty acrylic, and fits most of my compacts.. however if you have bought Mac products recently which is my preference the NEW compacts do not fit.. only the old ones without the mirror.. That is the only downfall but other than that it fits your square. and round products.. I just wish it fit the newer mac  products.. great buy.. worth the money</li>
    <li> Looks great on top of makeup vanity and very useful for someone that needs to actually see and display their makeup items.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Sturdy and a nice way to keep my blushes and quad shadows organized and within easy reach.</li>
    <li> I like this compact organizer but I wish the spaces for the compacts were a bit wider. It only holds smaller compacts. My MAC foundation compacts does not fit in it.</li>
    <li> This is just the perfect size to use for all your favorite MAC highlighters or powder duos, i love it!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. Whoever decided to make this product is a genius. I just wish there were more types of this organizer! Like longer ones or ones that had bigger sections to fit oversize compacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ByAlegory products are expensive, but, in my honest opinion, the ones that I&#x27;ve tried so far have convinced me that their price is totally worth it. The material is very high-quality acrylic...you will most likely never have to replace these; they&#x27;ll last the rest of your life! I will definitely be buying at least two more of these now that I know how much I love this one.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. I love it. It keeps all my Mac Blushes organized and I bought the second one for my eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be able to fit your compact in if it is by Mac but this is great for everything else.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great, it came on time with no problems,</li>
    <li> Very well made acrylic and nice to store compacts and blush containers so you can find what you need easily.  Certain brands do not fit but MAC brand does and that is what I am using this for.</li>
    <li> bought it for my MAC compacts &amp; while they don&#x27;t exactly fit (making the compartment spaces a tad bit wider would do the trick) it still does the trick at keeping my compacts organized</li>
    <li> Great for organizing my vanity. Fits my compacts and makes them very accessible so i use the products that i have. :)</li>
    <li> This does exactly as it says it will. It was perfect for space saving and organizing my counter</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s perfect for all my Laura Geller baked blushes.</li>
    <li> Got it when it was 30% off, and now I wish I&#x27;d bought two at that price. These are great if you&#x27;re a makeup addict and have oodles of highlighters and blush.</li>
    <li> this fits just what i wanted it to! It holds smashbox, laura gellar, urban decay and both drug store blushes i tried in it! Its great to be able to see and grab them quickly!! Love!</li>
    <li> Great quality, perfect fit!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, this is so nice, I use this for my compact makeup and it is perfect for that, very nice quality. I will be purchasing more, although they are a little expensive.</li>
    <li> Saw the review on youtube and decided i needed it. Glad i bought it. Its kind of pricey but worth every pennies. I bought three of these compact, should of bought more. The shipping was super fast. I&#x27;ve ordered on thursday night and got the compacts on tuesday</li>
    <li> I got the clear one, and it&#x27;s just like in the picture! I love it, it is great for organizing my powders, bronzers, and blushes! It fits TooFaced bronzers, clinigue powders, theBlam bronzers, elf blushes and more. But sadly, the mac studio fix powders are too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a great product, and it is for a really good price! I am glad I bought this ♥</li>
    <li> Great product!  Hold my blushes, bronzers and compacts.</li>
    <li> I bought the clear organizer, and I love it... Am going to buy more soon. It&#x27;s also a space saver, and looks really cute! Make-up guru or not ,you should own some!</li>
    <li> The organizer perfectly fits my Mac &amp; Nars blushes and an absolute must for any makeup junkie.  The transparent color is my favorite because it keeps your blushes visible and easy to organize.</li>
    <li> Fit most of my compacts well. Great organizer and durable. Great item!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. Holds one Nars blush, Two Faced chocolate bronzer, theBalm highlighter,  Maybelline blush, Elf eye brow kit and more. Does not fit Milani blushes. They are too thick. Not cheap but worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  It is very sturdy and well made.  I am loving this great organizer.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect solution for storing cosmetics. The simple ideas always seem to be the best ones! A little pricey, but the product looks great and is very sturdy. It will last for years and will certainly help me keep my collection organized. I want to order several more.</li>
    <li> Not big enough for MAC compacts but works on MAV blush</li>
    <li> Absolutely stunning &amp; gorgeous. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s so chic and cute and very stylish. It&#x27;s not bulky at all and it fits my makeup collection great. I want more and I will be ordering more. Excellent price and it&#x27;s all worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Makes storage neat and easy.  I suggest making changes to the packaging.  I ordered 3 items and 2 arrived cracked. I received replacements and loved them.  I will continue to purchase these pieces as my makeup collection grows.</li>
    <li> I found the size just slightly off from perfect.  It held some products well, however I couldn&#x27;t fit two thin products in.  I&#x27;ll use but won&#x27;t buy a second one (as I thought I might)</li>
    <li> Such a great quality, very thick acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;they hold mac, the balm, stila, bobbi brown and various other brands of powders, blushes.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way they look and i think they are totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Can organize my makeup items easily!! Love it. It is overpriced though...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have all my compacts all in an organized order of my choosing and know they are going to stay that way. I originally bought it to take care of the sliding pile in my drawer but it looked so nice I left it out to sit on top of my vanity. The white blends in nicely with my white vanity.</li>
    <li> I ordered the clear. It fits most of my regular sized compacts.</li>
    <li> I love it but it came chipped on a corner.</li>
    <li> I mainly can hold my mac blushes and powders in this holder. It cannot hold new packaging of MSF powders and highlighters. Milani blushes could not fit as well. Regardless of what it cannot hold, I love how my MAC blushes have a proper home! It looks really good on my acrylic makeup cube, they go well perfectly!</li>
    <li> Although all of my compacts did not fit in this organizer most of them did! I even use it for other small compacts as well. I love it because it helps me stay a bit more organized.</li>
    <li> This will not hold MAC compacts. At least not studio tech, studio fix nor MAC pressed powder compacts. They are all too large to fit in the slots. Three stars because I bought it for compacts but ultimately had to use it for blushes.</li>
    <li> My favorite beauty organizers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.  It fits my blushes and compacts perfectly.  I probably  need to order another one.  The largest it will hold is probably mac mineralize powder, but I have the older style one.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item just as described.</li>
    <li> Love it. Really useful and organized.</li>
    <li> fits my NARS single blushes and eyeshadows</li>
</ol>
