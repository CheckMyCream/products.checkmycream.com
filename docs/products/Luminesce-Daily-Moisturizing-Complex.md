<li> A few always manage to make their way to Amazon.  </li>
<li> so FDA don&#x27;t care , you can have a lotion out there and said miracle no one even care, they have Hugh make up that why all they have tons of money to recruit sellers and give them high profit&lt;br /&gt;, bottom line , don&#x27;t be stupid like me spend $$227 for an Avon&#x27;s product&lt;</li>
<li> the day cream and night cream is nothing different tan Avon product:( .</li>
<li> Your system is Broken!</li>
<li> Anyone can leave 5 STAR FAKE REVIEWS.</li>
<li> Way tooo expensive to not do what it claims.</li>
<li> Just disappointed with the bottle</li>
<li> This is crap!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product, excelente seller&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Make my face to break out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product to amazon , I bought this product throughout a marketing person&lt;br /&gt;This is a scam, I got cleanser,day, night cream and a serum for$227 , they call this a basic level lit (this is my 80%) discount already&lt;br /&gt;The maker ting person is my friend, she was a good talker about this is the only product in the maket that got endorse by FDA about stem cell .....&lt;br /&gt;I went home and read the ingredients , the day cream and night cream is nothing different tan Avon product:( . There is no FDA endorsed since this is not a treatment so FDA don&#x27;t care , you can have a lotion out there and said miracle no one even care, they have Hugh make up that why all they have tons of money to recruit sellers and give them high profit&lt;br /&gt;, bottom line , don&#x27;t be stupid like me spend $$227 for an Avon&#x27;s product&lt;br /&gt;2/ I agreed with other reviewers Amazon should only allows amazon buyers review, I didn&#x27;t buy to amazon and I still be able to write review&lt;br /&gt;So do your research, do not trust the 5 star reviews</li>
    <li> Bought it to complement my night repair and the serum.  Its ok but ive had better moisturizing creams.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, seller is a 5 star. Product didn&#x27;t do  anything for me. feels like a regular face cream</li>
    <li> Love this product it is amazing</li>
    <li> it is a very good moisturizing complex</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.....happy wife, happy life!&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be working as expected, the dark spots on her face (picked up during pregnancy) are fading noticeably and her skin tone has improved</li>
    <li> This product is sold through an online marketing group.  A few always manage to make their way to Amazon.  I was totally unimpressed.  I should have returned it.  I just tossed it in the trash the other day.  We aren&#x27;t going to see miracles from these creams.  At some point you need injections or more.  It&#x27;s just a fact of life.</li>
    <li> love it would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> used this product for three months and saw no difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer but that is about it. Way tooo expensive to not do what it claims.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed my acne scars are less noticeable and my skin is brighter. I would recommend this but i understand it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m leaving this review as a TEST to the reviewer before me..and all I can say is wow...I can indeed leave a Review without purchase..I no longer trust these Amazon reviews..Amazon should ONLY allow REAL Buyers to Review a Product...This is crap!!! Do something about this Amazon!!!! Anyone can leave 5 STAR FAKE REVIEWS. Your system is Broken!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, very good package, easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good product ! it absorbs fast, non greasy, you will see the difference in your face.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I bought this Moisturizing !</li>
    <li> I really like how this product makes my skin feel.  I just turned 50 &amp; using this daily, I see visibly less wrinkles.  I will definitely buy this again, when I run out. ;)</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and is the process of referring it to her friends. I can&#x27;t think of anything else to say.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.bad pump</li>
    <li> Much better price than local salons! Works best with Serum</li>
    <li> Did not like the product, don&#x27;t like something with a scent.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product. I will know better in couple of weeks. It arrived timely and in good shape. It seems to moisturize excellently and feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I wrote this review without purchase it. Wow the review is indeed could be faked!</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely but the pump didn&#x27;t work to get the lotion out. Had to break the top and manually get to the lotion. Love the lotion itself. Just disappointed with the bottle</li>
    <li> It made really big claims, not sure that I noticed much of a difference.</li>
    <li> This product goes hand in hand with the Luminesce Cellular Rejuvenation and Antiaging Serum.  My skin feels so soft! And it looks young and healthy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and travel with. I didn&#x27;t see results immediately, but I did realise that through the day, my complexion remained fresh looking without the shine. My skin tone seemed more even, too. It still does need a layer of makeup for coverage, but on an uneventful au nautrale day, my mid-30s skin could step out with just this and feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is how little there is in the bottle and how quickly I use it. I&#x27;m not very diligent with my daily application, hence it lasts for about 5 months. If a user is more regular, the bottle will only last 3 months. For this price, it is dear, but I do appreciate the results. I use the serum as well, so I&#x27;m uncertain about the efficacy of each product independently.</li>
