    <li> The smell of Naked Bee is out of this world.  I waver between the grapefruit and the orange blossom and need to make sure I have both this and the hand sanitizer in the same scent so they don&#x27;t conflict although orange and grapefruit would not be a bad combo.  This is a body cream so I use on my body as well as my hands.</li>
