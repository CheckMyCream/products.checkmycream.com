      <li>Being from the Pacific Northwest, it is our kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know about the women falling all over you, but my wife liked it.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>Initially, I liked this product a lot.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, though, if you don&#x27;t want the scent lingering in your hair, this is a nice shampoo/conditioner option.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for men who want a quick and effective hair routine in the shower.</li>
      <li>The scent was rather pungent coming out of the bottle, but it dissapated quickly to something pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is a strong smell, but it&#x27;s nice and minty, not obnoxious.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner like most men&#x27;s shampoo products</li>
      <li>I love their deodorant products and now I love this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad we ordered a sample.</li>
      <li>It has a respectful scent, not some dance club-esque aromatic assault like so many products out there today.</li>
      <li>in love with the smell</li>
      <li>This is Timber which I suppose gives it a more manly name</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>There is also a fresh &#x27;soapy&#x27; smell which smells great, like clean laundry or hand soap.</li>
      <li>He said it works fine, lathers up nice, and rinses easily.</li>
      <li>However, with this product, I can say they did---their hair looked smoother and more manageable than it does after just a shampoo, and they reported it was easy to brush.  </li>
      <li>I (and more importantly my girlfriend) really love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It suds up very nicely and rinses out completely which is very important to me.</li>
      <li>The Old Spice Timber with Mint 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner, he says, also leaves a very nice, light and clean feel in the hair!</li>
      <li>The scent is very very mild.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly strong.  </li>
      <li>We tend to not like strong scents since they cause headaches.</li>
      <li>That has worked out fine</li>
      <li>This is a fine product.</li>
      <li>By no means is the scent overpowering or too light.  </li>
      <li>I very much enjoy the scent of the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The combined conditioner leaves hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
      <li>I have used Old Spice products for years and they have always been good.  </li>
      <li>It is in no way overwhelming - it just makes him smell like a nice young man who keeps himself clean.</li>
      <li>They liked the scent, and I gave it a little try to see what I thought, and liked it too!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smooth and clean feeling and yes manly too.</li>
      <li>lather is, as the ad says, rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>Clean &#x27;em up and move along.  </li>
      <li>I just smell clean.</li>
      <li>The mint is not overpowering and it does have a masculine woodsy kind of smell to it.</li>
      <li>As for the shampoo itself, it cleans very well and because not is a 2 in 1 product that is even better.</li>
      <li>In my opinion the scent is masculine, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I could absolutely see myself buying more of this</li>
      <li>I got this for my husband and he was pleasantly surprised by how nice it smells.</li>
      <li>This does an adequate job of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is woodsy, yet fresh and clean-smelling.</li>
      <li>I actually love Old Spice Timber.</li>
      <li>It looks like I have found another Old Spice favorite.</li>
      <li>I am glad to say that the Old Spice smell is there.</li>
      <li>I love the scent but notice it doesn&#x27;t last long which can be a good thing.</li>
      <li>This is our first time using the Old Spice hair products, and we&#x27;ve been pleased.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m finding it less pleasant.</li>
      <li>However, I am glad that I did because it smells fantastic and the smell stays all day long.</li>
      <li>The conditioner does a great job of keeping his normally dry hair manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>I typically buy shampoo for the smell, to keep dandruff from forming, and to make me feel good about rubbing stuff into my scalp.</li>
      <li>It is not a heavy cloying pine smell rather it is light and fresh.  </li>
      <li>But this Old Spice Timber shampoo works just fine.</li>
      <li>This shampoo fits in well with the rest of the Old Spice line, but  the scent could just as well fit in with something Axe would make.  </li>
      <li>The more I use it, however, the smell is lasting longer and stronger.</li>
      <li>The marketing is funny.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how they got the smell of pine in a bottle, but that is exactly what it smells like.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves his hair soft and not weighted down.  </li>
      <li>Old Spice is usually very perfume-y and too strong.</li>
      <li>And put simply, it cleans my hair very well, and the conditioner leaves my hair softer and more manageable that just shampoo</li>
      <li>The hair is left feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>The opening is small, which is good to keep too much shampoo from coming out at once.</li>
      <li>Well after using it for the past couple weeksmI can honestly say that the scent is just right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not impressive, or even very good.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>I really like this scent.</li>
      <li>I was very worried that the smell would be overly intense or</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used Old Spice products for years and they have always been good.  This shampoo and conditioner has a different smell, but it is a manly one, not feminine.  Being from the Pacific Northwest, it is our kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about the women falling all over you, but my wife liked it.  It is nice to have both the shampoo and conditioner in one step rather than two.  It is also a good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent way to keep your hair looking great and a nice scent as well!</li>
    <li> I am not a hair guy, and typically spend 30 seconds a day fixing it. I wouldn&#x27;t expect to rate a shampoo sub par. Also, I generally like Old Spice&#x27;s products and use some of them regularly (deodorant, soaps). However, I have noticed with this product that my hair is not the same as it is with other two-in-one shampoos like Pert, or the others my wife stocks the shower with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubts that it cleans, and have no problem with the smell. The marketing is funny. But the result, at least for me (fine hair), is for weekends.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent. Definitely captures the aromas of wood and mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little strong in the shower. The scent lasts for several hours and is much more subtle once your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well. I little goes a long way. The combined conditioner leaves hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
    <li> First of all this is a large bottle, twice what you would normally get in a single bottle of shampoo, and it&#x27;s got conditioner in it to boot so you&#x27;re getting a good deal in this, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: Adequately manly, not girly, not overwhelming. It has some staying power. My husband used this in his air 12 hours ago and I can still smell it there, yet it&#x27;s not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff: none.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product. I have short to thinning to balding hair, depending on how polite you&#x27;re feeling that day. I typically buy shampoo for the smell, to keep dandruff from forming, and to make me feel good about rubbing stuff into my scalp. This does an adequate job of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Big ol&#x27; bottle full of stuff.&lt;br /&gt;- It does make your hair nominally cleaner, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It smells like basically nothing. It&#x27;s not impressive, or even very good. It&#x27;s just...there.&lt;br /&gt;- No mint extract, nothing else, really. Just chemical soup. Mmm mmm good.</li>
    <li> This is a good sized bottle for the price ($5.99) and my husband prefers 2-in-1 shampoos. He said it works fine, lathers up nice, and rinses easily. The scent is the only thing we were concerned about. Old Spice is usually very perfume-y and too strong. I think the mint in this &amp;#34;Timber&amp;#34; scent helps tone it down and it comes off more &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; than perfume-y. The scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, thankfully. We tend to not like strong scents since they cause headaches. But this Old Spice Timber shampoo works just fine.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to use this on my body because the consistency is like a thick lotion. However, I am glad that I did because it smells fantastic and the smell stays all day long. But it&#x27;s not overpowering either. I just smell clean. It&#x27;s an excellent product. The only thing I can think of to take it up a notch is to have a pump dispenser instead of the one it currently has because it is such a heavy bottle and my hand is wet when I use it, one of these times I&#x27;m going to drop it and break my foot. Go ahead and grab a bottle and try it for yourself.... your girlfriend/wife will thank you.</li>
    <li> Good price and delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent smell &amp; nice smooth hairs</li>
    <li> I really like this scent. The mint is not overpowering and it does have a masculine woodsy kind of smell to it. This is our first time using the Old Spice hair products, and we&#x27;ve been pleased. The 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner does a good job of cleaning and rinses out well. My only complaint is that my bottle came with a plastic label rather than having the information printed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is noticeable, but not overwhelming. The large size also means that it should last a while.</li>
    <li> I was very worried that the smell would be overly intense or the 2-in-1 in shampoo conditioner too thick. I actually love Old Spice Timber. The smell is very subdued and pleasurable. The shampoo feels good in my hair. I could absolutely see myself buying more of this once I run out.</li>
    <li> All the items are great; however, I prefer the &amp;#34;Bulk Up&amp;#34; because it does a great job on the volume of your hair.</li>
    <li> Well I read the reviews and noticed women were using the shampoo too. So I thought I would try it. I am very pleased. It suds up very nicely and rinses out completely which is very important to me. I have very thick hair and hate shampoo residue on it. Smells like Old Spice when shampooing and when hair is dry smells fine with maybe a little mint scent. I would say this is a great shampoo for anyone and of course perfect for man and wife to use. I love it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he was pleasantly surprised by how nice it smells. He has used for the past couple weeks and his hair definitely looks clean and healthy. It is a strong smell, but it&#x27;s nice and minty, not obnoxious. It&#x27;s a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner like most men&#x27;s shampoo products so you save time in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it, and am glad to see new Old Spice scents!</li>
    <li> The hubby loves it.  It smells great and leaves his hair soft and not weighted down.  Often with the combo conditioner/shampoo his hair will feel yucky after he gets out of the shower (like there is buildup already or something).  Not the case with this product.</li>
    <li> Initially, I liked this product a lot. I don&#x27;t know how they got the smell of pine in a bottle, but that is exactly what it smells like. The mint is lost on me. The scent was rather pungent coming out of the bottle, but it dissapated quickly to something pleasant. The more I use it, however, the smell is lasting longer and stronger. I don&#x27;t know if it is building up in my hair or what, but I&#x27;m finding it less pleasant.</li>
    <li> In the shower this morning I was daydreaming back to the days when Old Spice was just a cheesy aftershave.  Remember the commercial with the sailor in the heavy cable knit sweater tossing a bottle of Old Spice to the younger sailor up on the dock?  Remember the \\&quot;go get &#x27;em champ\\&quot; look that the older dude gave his younger protege?  Completely cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Spice brand has evolved way past that.  I love their deodorant products and now I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice big bottle for about the same price as the smaller bottles that I buy at the store.  Good.  I hate buying shampoo at the store.  It always takes me too long to pick one.  Now I can just reorder this one six months or so from now when it finally runs out (or maybe longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a guy, my shampoo needs are pretty basic:  hair, beard, pits, chest, and privates.  Clean &#x27;em up and move along.  Do I really need a 2-in-1 shampoo with conditioner? It&#x27;s tough to say.  I honestly don&#x27;t know.  My hair never gets tangled, so no I probably don&#x27;t.  I like it anyway though.  This shampoo covers all those bases for me, one less thing to have to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My \\&quot;go get &#x27;em champ\\&quot; days are behind me now, but I still like to smell nice for my wife and smell decent at work.  Done and done. Thanks, Old Spice.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this product based on some of the reviews I had read. I was worried the scent would be overpowering and possibly off putting. Well after using it for the past couple weeksmI can honestly say that the scent is just right. It is a subtle scent that sort of reminds me of a forest after the rain. I love the scent but notice it doesn&#x27;t last long which can be a good thing. As for the shampoo itself, it cleans very well and because not is a 2 in 1 product that is even better. The size of the bottle is perfect which means I won&#x27;t be buying any shampoo for awhile.</li>
    <li> I have used Old Spice for years and continue to use the after-shave.So I was very curious about the shampoo. I am glad to say that the Old Spice smell is there. This is Timber which I suppose gives it a more manly name but I like the shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair smooth and clean feeling and yes manly too.</li>
    <li> Hubby likes this. The product cleaned and rinsed well. He used about a dime sized portion. I noticed that it has reduced frizz for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part was the scent. The minty smell woke him up but disappeared when he rinsed so there was no competition with his cologne.</li>
    <li> When I started choosing my own deodorant I picked Old Spice because my grandfather had used Old Spice aftershave so I picked the “Ship That Sails The Ocean”.  That has worked out fine so when I saw Old Spice Timber Shampoo on the Vine list I decided to give it a try also. It is another good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is white and creamy.  It has a mint scent that is pleasant during the shower, but does not linger thereafter.  The hair is left feeling clean and fresh.  It looks like I have found another Old Spice favorite.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband and he&#x27;s been using it for a couple weeks now. Since he was just using shampoo before this his hair has definitely gotten softer. It also smells great. It&#x27;s not one of those products for men with a horribly, overpowering scent.  Less important, I like that it clearly says &amp;#34;for the hair&amp;#34; since my husband saw the brand Old Spice and the bottle and thought it was body wash at first.  All in all, it&#x27;s a solid product and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if he bought it again when on sale.</li>
    <li> College son loves this shampoo and says the scent is very nice and not too strong. The Old Spice Timber with Mint 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner, he says, also leaves a very nice, light and clean feel in the hair!</li>
    <li> in love with the smell</li>
    <li> My adult stepson is using this and really enjoys it. The scent is woodsy, yet fresh and clean-smelling. The conditioner does a great job of keeping his normally dry hair manageable and soft. His wife likes the smell as does he. As someone who is very sensitive to perfume scents, I find the smell to be pleasant and subtle. It is in no way overwhelming - it just makes him smell like a nice young man who keeps himself clean. My motto for aromatic scents is that people should be able to smell your aroma only when they hug you or sit next to you on the bus or a bench, and not when you pull up into the driveway. Old Spice Timber is the former, not the latter. Subtle, but clean. For men who want to have great looking hair without messing with a bunch of products, this is a winner. The smell is great and doesn&#x27;t have the pretentiousness of some perfumed products for men. It has a respectful scent, not some dance club-esque aromatic assault like so many products out there today.</li>
    <li> This shampoo fits in well with the rest of the Old Spice line, but  the scent could just as well fit in with something Axe would make.  The shampoo is a creamy white and cleans just as well as other products.  The scent is nice and my wife likes it.  By no means is the scent overpowering or too light.  In my opinion the scent is masculine, which is nice.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shampoo/conditioner. It smells very pleasant(yet manly). It&#x27;s not overly strong.  It cleans and rinses out well. The smell doesn&#x27;t have lasting power, though. That could be a positive or a negative, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for. After a few hours, there wasn&#x27;t really any lingering smell in my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, if you don&#x27;t want the scent lingering in your hair, this is a nice shampoo/conditioner option.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this Old Spice shampoo for his military cut hair. It has a subtle scent of pine and apple. There is also a fresh &#x27;soapy&#x27; smell which smells great, like clean laundry or hand soap. This is a great product for men who want a quick and effective hair routine in the shower.</li>
    <li> Handy to have combined shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s a bit less strong of a conditioner (doesn&#x27;t hold hair as long in firmly in place) as a separate conditioner that I&#x27;ve used, but it works well enough even on a reasonably windy day! The scent is very very mild. Its actually a less strong scent than many other common brands, so don&#x27;t be discouraged by a particular scent or fear that it will be too strong -- it isn&#x27;t. The opening is small, which is good to keep too much shampoo from coming out at once.</li>
    <li> One is entitled, I think, to approach a product that seeks to capitalize on the current Lumbersexual craze with some trepidation.  A hair care product called Timber that threatens a piney smell could easily be a cross between Pine-sol and that cardboard tree dangling from your grandmother&#x27;s rearview mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this product is a pleasant surprise.  First, the ad copy on the bottle shows that the company is in on the joke and secomnd, the scent is actually rather subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad we ordered a sample.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The lather is, as the ad says, rich and creamy. And put simply, it cleans my hair very well, and the conditioner leaves my hair softer and more manageable that just shampoo alone.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price seems reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband and son both liked this shampoo/conditioner a lot!  They both prefer two in one combos like this, to save the bother of conditioner, but I don&#x27;t always think they get very good conditioning.  However, with this product, I can say they did---their hair looked smoother and more manageable than it does after just a shampoo, and they reported it was easy to brush.  They liked the scent, and I gave it a little try to see what I thought, and liked it too!  It smelled to me a lot like those pine needle stuffed pillows you can buy in Maine as a souvenir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very nice product---certainly recommended!</li>
    <li> I (and more importantly my girlfriend) really love the smell of this shampoo. It has a nice, not overpowering scent that seems to at least linger a little bit.  I try to highlight my curly red hair and this shampoo leaves it soft and pliable and not weighed down. I&#x27;m not a huge conditioner user so it seems a little oilier than I am used to in a shampoo, but it does not leave my hair feeling oily but it does seem rather soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a very nice shampoo with the biggest selling point being it&#x27;s nice, subtle, manly scent.</li>
    <li> This product is a typical 2 in one shampoo/conditioner. After using for a week or so we have found that it dries out the hair.  I very much enjoy the scent of the shampoo.  It is not a heavy cloying pine smell rather it is light and fresh.  This may work for other types of hair but for those with dry hair this is not the product for you.</li>
