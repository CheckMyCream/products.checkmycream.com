      <li>It was nice</li>
      <li>Good, responsible, timely seller and great buy.</li>
      <li>This product is kind of okay.</li>
      <li>I love wearing my hair off my face.</li>
      <li>Easy to put over bun</li>
      <li>Good product, works well for my 9 year old at ballet.</li>
      <li>But i still have the first one which is actually better than the first.</li>
      <li>just as well but so much cheaper than comparable products off my girls&#x27; dance clothing catalogs!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll do more research before ordering again next time .</li>
      <li>But on amazon, that&#x27;s never failed.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my grandma, they&#x27;re of pretty good quality, don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll last yet.</li>
      <li>I use the Hot Buns product to make the bun, then place the hair net and add bobby pins to secure it.</li>
      <li>I expected more out of it</li>
      <li>In this case, it worked very well ...</li>
      <li>Just what she asked for and very reasonsbly priced.</li>
      <li>An easy bun to get ready for ballet and other classes.  </li>
      <li>well to start make sure you read that these are not full hair nets, I just looked at pic and thought they were full hair nets,, and with the price beening so low</li>
      <li>the other one is fine, no unraveling or anything</li>
      <li>...the smaller (yes, one is slightly smaller--the one that looks like a finer mesh) one kind of unraveled when i tried to put it over my bun.</li>
      <li>It might be good for someone with a lot of thick, long hair</li>
      <li>Very loose, falls right out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>The bun cover was to small for a lot of hair, if your hair is on shoulder length maybe it will fit.</li>
      <li>its ok i would use it more for a child other than that it wasent bad, thanks but no thanks</li>
      <li>My hair is really really long, and these keep my bun in place, which normally bobby pins just aren&#x27;t enough.</li>
      <li>Good quality, bad design.</li>
