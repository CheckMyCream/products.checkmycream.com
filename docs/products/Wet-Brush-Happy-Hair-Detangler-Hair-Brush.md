      <li>I&#x27;m sure the brush will work fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, for me this was the best $8.98 I ever spent on a hair</li>
      <li>With this brush, she can brush the tangles out so easily with no discomfort.  </li>

      <li>I used it with shampoo in my hair, with conditioner, and just wet hair and all three ways the results were Fabulous!!!  </li>
      <li>I’m very happy with my purchase, and will definitely buy another one in the future.</li>
      <li>That’s when I started to extensively research my current options for the perfect</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the design on the brush looks like to may wear off quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m here to tell everyone how wonderful this brush works on 3b/4b African American coiled, curly,</li>
      <li>The style is also super cuter</li>
      <li>She uses it in the shower to ensure her hair comes out tangle-free, and a quick brush in the morning has all the knots out with no complaining.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says -it works great on wet hair without ripping or pulling.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was forever keeping the tangles out of my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s long hair until someone recommended the Wet Brush.  Since then she has been able to keep her hair tangle free with almost no help from parents, which is a huge time saver!  She uses it in the shower to ensure her hair comes out tangle-free, and a quick brush in the morning has all the knots out with no complaining.  Best brush I&#x27;ve ever seen for long hair, and everyone I&#x27;ve recommended it to has been happy with it also.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. Was given as a gift &amp; loved. :)</li>
    <li> heavy hair its a lil tricky you have to be really careful so you do not pull your  hair too much cuz you might damage it.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this brush.. no more tears with tangles at our house</li>
    <li> Good product. I had problems with other &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;wet brushes&amp;#34; where the beading protecting the tips of the bristles would fall off after a short period of use and then become painful to brush with as a result.  I purchased this brush about 2 months ago for my 7 year old daughter. I also have another ouchless and wet brush but she loves this one. Definitely her favorite and mine too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the brush will work fine but the one delivered was not the &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; brush that I ordered.  I had built an entire gift basket around the colors of the brush so was very disappointed not to receive it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly fine hair that gets knots very easily. Although, the brush is not a miracle worker, I do find it brushes through her hair easier than a regular brush will. And for that I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter hates to have her hair brushed, especially right out of the shower.  The Wet Brush has saved us from a lot of drama in the mornings!</li>
    <li> Very gentle on the scalp and does not hurt or rip out hair while wet. No need for conditioner with this brush. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but i tried this brush and it Works great on long hair. Detangles with ease!</li>
    <li> My 14 yr old daughter has very thick, very fine, very long hair.  Her hair gets knotted and matted easily and she has a tender scalp.  With this brush, she can brush the tangles out so easily with no discomfort.  We love it!</li>
    <li> I had a wet brush that a friend purchased about three years ago for 1.99 and I love it, I was about due for a new one and ordered this brush and a few others. The bristles in this brush are not as good, and I paid a lot more money. The pattern is pretty, But, I wish it worked as good as my other brush. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and this brush does all it claims. Easily brushes through knotty or wet hair with no problems.</li>
    <li> I have long, dry and color treated hair.  This brush doesn&#x27;t tug or pull and is a God send.  I own three, one in my bathroom, one in my purse and one in the diaper bag.  Get it, a mush have</li>
    <li> I purchased a Wet Brush at a local retailer and loved it -- felt great brushing my long hair.  No ripping and tearing.  I decided to buy another and found this pretty paisley one online.  When I received the product I noticed a strong rubber smell.  After unpacking the product and having it sit on my bathroom counter for almost 2 weeks there is still a very strong rubber smell -- so strong I almost don&#x27;t want to brush my hair with this brush.  After contacting the manufacturers customer service they suggested airing it out, not sure how long it needs to air out before the smell goes away.  Disappointed, should have bought another not as pretty brush from my local retailer -- no smell from it.</li>
    <li> This brush is great with wet hair. It combs right through without tangling!</li>
    <li> I ordered the paisley design and got the peace design instead. Bought this for my daughter who was disappointed that it was not the one she wanted. I noticed they also now changed the picture from the paisley to peace but you can see the description still says &amp;#34;paisley&amp;#34;. What&#x27;s up? I was too busy to repack for return.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing for detangling wet or dry hair.  It is the first brush I have used on my 10 yo daughter that doesn&#x27;t end with her in tears.  I deducted 1 star due to the strong petroleum smell on the brush - it still exists a week after use and the smell bothers my daughter. Without the smell issue this would be a 5 star product!</li>
    <li> I have never had a brush that didn&#x27;t hurt when trying to brush my hair until I found this. My hair knots so easily and this takes them out painlessly. If only they had it when I was a kid, maybe it would have saved me many headaches from my mother trying to detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. My mom bought one at a hair salon, at triple the price. The mildest brush for mine and my 5-year-old&#x27;s hair, the bristles are very soft, and it still brushes hair well. The best brush to untangle long straight hair. Now this is the only brush I use, and in fact I ordered several more to have at work, in my purse, for my daughter.  I have tried many brushes and this one is by far the best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> 3 YR OLD TENDER HEAD FIX. THIS IS THE ONE THAT GETS THE TANGLES WITH LESS TEARS.  TIP, ALWAYS START AT THE ENDS AND WORK UP.</li>
    <li> i BOUGHT THIS FOR WHEN MY GRANDDAUGHTER VISITS.  THIS MAKES HAIR COMBING SO MUCH EASIER AT BEDTIME!  Now I use it as well!</li>
    <li> As a mother, grandmother, and licensed Cosmetologist, I positively encourage any parent, nanny, or caregiver looking for a hair brush which gets through knots of hair without fuss nor tears, to confidently and without hesitation, order this exact &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34;!  Although many others appear to look similar, I have never found this to be true of any other hairbrush!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient was very satisfied with how well it works (they were skeptical about the de-tangling capabilities).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really revolutionary.</li>
    <li> Love the gentle brush. It works well with my daughter&#x27;s fine hair and tender head! The only negative is the smell; it takes a while for the rubbery smell to fade.</li>
    <li> Love it, so does my 9 year old...  Recommended by the hairdresser and now the only issue is we can never find them since they are all over the house.  Biggest downfall is they are very hard to clean.</li>
    <li> My kids love this brush!! I have one with curly hair, one with straight hair and it works great on both of them!</li>
    <li> We love this brush! It seems to really manage through tangles in both wet &amp; dry hair. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for a few days now and I am in love!  It glides through my hair unlike any other brush I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the design on the brush looks like to may wear off quickly.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my granddaughter.  She loves the pattern on the brush, and it brushes through her long hair with ease.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says -it works great on wet hair without ripping or pulling.  My daughter has exceptionally long and thick hair and it is great!</li>
    <li> My niece loves her wet brush. Cool design too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always been a battle brushing my daughter&#x27;s long thick hair.  We love this brush!  Just wish we had discovered it when she was 3 or 4 instead of 8.</li>
    <li> This brush has saved my hair.  I have long thick curly hair and when it gets wet it knots up and looks like dreadlocks.  The brush is good for young or old, thick or thin, wet or dry hair. What makes this brush so good is that the bristles are supper thin and flexible. When my hair is wet it takes a little longer to brush out with this brush but it doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair.  I like the brush so much that I bought one for my mom an aunt and bought myself the mini to keep in my bag.</li>
    <li> I was on a quest to find a brush that would end the mom / daughter battle..  This brush did it.  I can now brush both my daughters 3 and 7, hair without the fight.  The style is also super cuter, I purchased paisley and stars brushes and they are so cute..</li>
    <li> My hair constantly tangles and this hairbrush detangles it gently.  I don&#x27;t feel like screaming when I brush my hair!</li>
    <li> Great product, can easily get through my wet hair when I get out of shower.</li>
    <li> Washed my mother&#x27;s hair Sunday and it passed through her scalp like butter.&lt;br /&gt;Get this brush for all the members of your household.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that gets through my daughters hair with no tears! It even is good to keep in the camper for traveling.</li>
    <li> When my 14 year old, who has impossible tangly hair, saw the brush she said that it was a waste because that type never works. I told her it was a different kind of brush and just try it. She humored me, and then said how amazed she was that it worked so well and didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Normally she loses a lot of hair when she brushes, but only a few hairs at the most come out each time. She now wants her own so that she doesn&#x27;t have to share it with her little sister. It really is an awesome brush.</li>
    <li> I have had a wet brush in the past and needed a new one.  I order this one, even though the price had gone up substantially since my last purchase.  However, the white background isn&#x27;t really white but very dingy.  I haven&#x27;t had it long and it already looks old.</li>
    <li> Nice item...Super fast shipping....</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love it, will have to buy another one just to keep the peace....</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  No more crying or screaming about hair brushing time.</li>
    <li> A+++ Very cute and helps with tangles!!!</li>
    <li> We heard great things about this brush and looked forward to trying it on my daughter&#x27;s very long hair.  However, it arrived with two issues.  One the handle was broken off when it arrived.  I can only assume from poor packaging as it was packaged with other items and must have been dropped or hit or something.  Secondly, I ordered what is pictured here.  A blue brush with green peace signs. The brush that arrived was white with some sort of crazy pattern swigglies all over it.  Not what I ordered.  We could not use due to no handle to hold onto.  So just had to trash.  I should have sent it back but I find anything under $10 not worth the time and trouble and frustration.  Guess we will purchase one of these from Sally&#x27;s to try.</li>
    <li> When I first got this brush, I was a little confused because the bristles are super thin and SUPER flexible. If you look at them wrong, they pretty much collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I tried this brush on my daughter&#x27;s hair right after her shower (it&#x27;s almost down to her waist- she&#x27;s 9, and it&#x27;s her thing...), we were surprised at how well it worked. It doesn&#x27;t tear through the knots on first brush- or the first ten brushes. But after you pull the brush through hair about 15 or 20 times, the knots disappear. I really don&#x27;t understand why it works, but I do know that I was able to get my daughter&#x27;s hair tangle free without any pain or handfuls of hair coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well the brush will hold up over time, but I do know it works on long, straight hair, and that it&#x27;s got my daughter not only regularly brushing her hair, but not minding if I brush it. This makes having long hair so much easier!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush you can buy for any hair type.  My daughter use to complain each and every time I would brush her hair.  No more complaining!  We own 5 of these.. I use them as well for my hair.</li>
    <li> A woman must have designed this, sorry guys.  My daughter hated brushing her hair.  Now I have to take the brush away.  As she puts it...no more pain.  She has very thick and curly hair and it brushes right through it, even when it is wet.  Would highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! No more breaking hair with harsh bristles. I have one at home, office, and gym bag. Replaced all my other brushes!</li>
    <li> I am reviewing &amp;#34;The Wet Brush Happy Hair&amp;#34; hairbrush ( Blue peace sign pattern)  This really does gently detangle my wet hair (after conditioner) and gets out any snarls.  I have fine long hair that tangles quite easily.  I intend to get a second one and a mini for travel.  Great item, does what it is says. My only complaint is that the material the brush is made out of smells quite industrial, like chemical/rubber/tires. The odor seems to be slowly dissipating, but it is strong &amp; unpleasant at first. My stylist uses a &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; and her brush does not smell bad, so I am hoping the toxic odor goes away in time. However, if you are sensitive to odors, beware.&lt;br /&gt;Update-the chemical smell is long gone-took a week or two and now is not an issue at all-just needed to &amp;#34;off-gas&amp;#34; so  maybe put it outside for a bit when you first get it. Now I love this brush-use it every time I wash my hair, would not want to be without it and I bought a second one.&lt;br /&gt;Update-still use every day &amp; are holding up fine. Very useful item &amp; my husband likes this brush too so I guess I should get him his own.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my 8 yr old niece.  She cried every time her mom tried to brush her very curly hair. I learned about this brush from my daughter-in-law.  My granddaughter has this brush, and I brush her hair with no problem. I allowed my niece to pick the color so the brush would be all about her. She LOVES it. She brushes her hair daily with no trauma/drama.  Her mom is so appreciative,  especially when getting ready for school. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Numbers of my family members have extremely sensitive scalps and adore these.  They are the very best!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I fight over this brush!  I bought this after two neighbors recommended it.  Cheaper here than the hair dresser:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s The Magic Brush!  My waist-length hair loves this brush - no more pulling, no more creating those little bug-sized knots.  Magic!</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Great price for a great brush.  I have medium long hair and it would take forever to comb my wet hair after a shower.  I used to use the de-tangler comb and it would take at least 15 minutes to comb my hair.  With this brush it takes 3-4 minutes.  I so love it and glad I bought it!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love the design of this brush and that doesn&#x27;t tear my hair out.  Yes, I noticed the smell but I always run a new hairbrush/comb through the washing machine before I use it the first time so after one wash the smell was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have waist length, fairly thick hair and the brush won&#x27;t simply \\&quot;go through it\\&quot; as the bristles are soft (to protect the hair).  I simply section my hair off run the brush through it section by section.  Much less painful than using a wide-tooth comb.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter has very long, curly, but fine hair.  Her hair tangles incredibly easy and brushing her hair always ended up with her in tears and me frustrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this brush, it gets through tangles so much better than an ordinary brush, I don&#x27;t really understand how it works, but it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works best when her hair is wet, but it&#x27;s still a lot better on dry hair than other brushes!</li>
    <li> My 4 1/2 year old loves this brush.  She has fine hair that tangles easily and it combs through without pulling.  It also works on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin and fine hair that the brush had a tough time going through. The pattern was cute until the end of the first week when the white handle started to turn pink from the paisley pattern bleeding onto it.</li>
    <li> Slips through my waist-length hair SO EASILY, no matter if it&#x27;s wet or dry! Using it EVERY DAY. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love.  I usually spend 30-45 minutes trying to painfully brush the rats nests out of my hair (it reaches my lower back).  I literally had it brushed in under 5 minutes today and it was pain free!  This brush is AMAZING.  Some reviews I have read state the brush has a chemical smell to it, mine did not.  Smells like a normal hair brush.  This brush works amazingly fast and painlessly on wet and dry hair.  Love love love.  I will never buy another brush again.</li>
    <li> Great brush! I have ordered the blue brush pictured twice, but they sent me a different one than what was ordered each time.</li>
    <li> From the time I was a child until very recently, brushing my wet hair was very painful. I have thick, curly hair and it&#x27;s impossible to brush or comb it without crying - literally. So, a few months ago, I did the unthinkable and cut my hair short to end the pain. Ugh! I hated it from the moment it was cut. Thankfully, it has almost grown back, but I was having the same painful problem again. Until...I read about the Wet Brush in a mommy blog. I thought, &#x27;what do I have to lose?&#x27; (other than roughly $10). Well...this brush is a miracle! Never again will I cut my hair short. Even if I forget to use conditioner, this brush runs through my hair like it&#x27;s butter! Amazing!!! I&#x27;m seriously considering purchasing a few more as back ups just in case they stop making them. The moral of my story is...don&#x27;t cut your hair! Buy a Wet Brush. You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> These Wet Brushes have become a necessity in our home for my daughter and me.  We both have long hair and use these brushes wet or dry.  It&#x27;s makes the job of combing through tangles easier and less painful.  I&#x27;ll reach for this brush before any other.  I even leave one in our beach tote for convenience.</li>
    <li> I have hair to my waist and it is pretty thick. When someone first gave one to me, I thought they were crazy. I looked at it and thought there was no way that was going to o through my hair....and wet at that. Well, not only did it go through my hair wet, but it stopped all of the ripping of my hair. I don&#x27;t have a hand full of hair from my brush after trying to use a regular plastic brush and yes I use It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle as well.</li>
    <li> My daughter (8) LOVES this brush. She has long hair and hated to have her hair brushed while it was wet. Now she does it with no problem.</li>
    <li> my daughter has very thick hair and this brush is extremely effective for her, it is light weight and comfortable to hold</li>
    <li> My daughter still complained, but not as much.  Her screaming went down a few decibels. Next time I&#x27;ll try with some detangler.</li>
    <li> Got three of these for my grandkids and they are always lossing their brushes.  They love the brush.</li>
    <li> My girls LOVE these brushes and will only brush their hair with these brushes.  No more crying!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of all the rave reviews, but ordered it anyway. It turned out to be a great buy! This is one great brush! It takes our tangles from mine and my toddlers curly, easily tangled hair with no problem.</li>
    <li> great brushes for any hair, detangles without pulling or hurting. great for kids or teenagers, actually, great for any female</li>
    <li> Long ago a friend gave me a detangling brush specifically for coarse, thick hair.  It was perfect, but after years of use, the bristles started breaking.  I went on a search for another one, but found that they no longer make them.  So sad!  That’s when I started to extensively research my current options for the perfect brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit about me – My hair has been categorized as 2c which means that it’s slightly wavy and coarse.  It’s also long – reaching what is called a “classic” length.  In other words, it reaches right below the bottom of my butt cheeks.  I have A LOT of it and it’s very thick.  Needless to say, I have trouble finding a good brush that will even penetrate my hair, let alone do anything close to detangling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kept popping up during my research was the Wet Brush.  After reading a lot of reviews, I decided that I’d give it a go.  What did I have to lose?  My options were thin on the ground.  And am I ever glad I picked one up!  This brush not only penetrates my hair easily, but it makes detangling a breeze with minimal pulling and tugging.  I usually don’t use it on wet hair since I’ve found that, for me,  it makes detangling more difficult.  I wait until my hair is slightly damp or nearly dry, and then detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some people mentioned that this brush had an odor.  I never detected anything unusual from the moment I first opened the package, and I&#x27;m usually the first one to notice any strange odors.  But knowing that sometimes manufacturers use slightly different materials to make their products, this could be the reason my brush was odor-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush in February  2014.  Here we are, a bit over a year later, and the Wet Brush is still going strong after daily use.  The only signs of wear or tear:  3 of the bristles have lost their balled tips.  All in all I’m very happy with my purchase, and will definitely buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> In reference to the other reviewer who said hers had a strong smell...YES, it can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 of these at the same time, received them all at the same time, and ONE of them has a REALLY strong smell. I can see where it would be headache inducing. The other 2 you can barely smell at all. You have to bury your nose in the bristles to pick up even a hint of chemical/plastic(?). I do not agree with the \\&quot;comment\\&quot; posted to her review that says it hasn&#x27;t had time to &#x27;air out&#x27; from the manufacturer. The cover has a VERY large oval over the bristles, so a consumer can &#x27;feel&#x27; the bristles, and the brush is not in an airtight or sealed plastic pack. It sits on cardboard with a staple holding the plastic covering on. So there is a TON of space around/in the pack for air movement, or to air out. I think it&#x27;s just something in the manufacturing. I will still keep the &#x27;smelly&#x27; brush, as I love these brushes and have been using them for years. Back when you could only buy them at salons. (The one with the \\&quot;daisey&#x27;s\\&quot; is the strongest smelling one for me. The other two are the stars and this paisley one). I don&#x27;t ever remember getting one with a strong smell before...hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly detangles the worst wet hair. We also use the to simply brush our dry hair. I DO find that after a few months SOME of the bristles are pushed down into the black brush &#x27;bed&#x27;. (Maybe we brush too hard?) You can simply pull those bristles back up by their little rounded balls on the tips. But that becomes a pain in the a** after a while. So it&#x27;s worth it to me to just buy another.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after reading the reviews on how well it detangles on any hair type.  I was skeptical because there weren&#x27;t any reviews saying it did so on very curly and kinky hair such as African Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m here to tell everyone how wonderful this brush works on 3b/4b African American coiled, curly, thick beyond words hair. That&#x27;s me!!!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so coiled that it will link with other coils and make a knot that I can&#x27;t get out without breaking it or cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used every kind of detangling comb there is, Quidad, Diane, Wen, Conair Ionic, and several other no names that I thought would help.  At best they would separate the coils that weren&#x27;t tangled but the ones that were not so.  So I gave this brush a try and OMG, NO WAY, IT WORKED, BEYOND BELIEF, ARE YOU KIDDING ME, BLOW YOUR MIND RESULTS!!!  It separated my coils, removed shed hair, and removed the knots.  I used it with shampoo in my hair, with conditioner, and just wet hair and all three ways the results were Fabulous!!!  I am still marveling at how well it worked and I am going to purchase one for my niece, would like the purple heart one for her, but now Amazon has this as an add on and you can&#x27;t select which pattern you want.  So I&#x27;ll wait till this one is separated from the add on items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for me this was the best $8.98 I ever spent on a hair implement, I no longer need to use several different combs in the shower trying to detangle my hair, just this nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has hard ball at the end of each bristle, a cushioned base, and a rubberized handle.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of these that make it so effective.  All I know is that it works.  Don&#x27;t ask me how to make a clock, I couldn&#x27;t tell you.  Ask me what time it is and that I can do.  By the way, if you have any type and I do mean any type of hair that tangles or knots it&#x27;s time to get this brush!!!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my best purchases from Amazon and I purchase a lot of things, and I&#x27;m selective on what I review.  This was well worth the price and time I spent on it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT MY NUBIAN SISTERS YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
