      <li>I think it looks more luxurious than the Revlon Lip Butters.  </li>
      <li>I love it and also bought three for my friends.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Revlon products for years and love them.</li>
      <li>It almost more like a gel/ lipgloss but in a lipstick form.</li>
      <li>When you apply it on your lips it is very nice, smooth and glossy but the colour is very transparent.</li>
      <li>I thought that the color would be a bit more noticeable, however the texture is silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Quite good to use and make my lip very moisture.</li>
      <li>The texture is very glossy and feels good on your lips just like lip balm though.</li>
      <li>I love the rich color.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought that it will be really creamy and has a great color payoff.</li>
      <li>I have tried many lipsticks in order to find ones that don&#x27;t dry my lips, and this one is great.</li>
      <li>although it has to be reapplied I love the product the lipstick is soft and the color is amazing</li>
      <li>It feels like a great, creamy balm but also gives you enough color</li>
      <li>This would make a fun valentine&#x27;s gift for your girl friends :)</li>
      <li>Color was too light on lips</li>
      <li>FABULOUS.</li>
      <li>I also like how light weight it is when put on.</li>
      <li>The packaging was fantastic.</li>
      <li>I personally really liked this product because I wanted something that didn&#x27;t have too much color in it.</li>
      <li>Overall I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>This was actually a plus point for me as I don&#x27;t like strong color on my lips all the time as I don&#x27;t think it looks particularly good for me and my age.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the color while browsing on Amazon and it arrived looking exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>No lipstick has ever made me feel pretty and confident.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty and easy to use..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Packaging: The packaging is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>Color is very pretty.</li>
      <li>The plastic top case gives it a cheap look and the lip balm looks too pinky, more than I expected.</li>
      <li>I love the way this feels on my lips, and in the color pink satin, it&#x27;s a marvelous nude that adds a hint of pink.</li>
      <li>so it was kind of smooches but not bad enough for me to return it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset because it should be in the box with the rest of my stuff, but it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>.. goes on smoothly and fast..</li>
      <li>suits a natural, no makeup girl style :]</li>
      <li>then I go with a red but other than that BEST lipstick ever!</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use!</li>
      <li>The packaging is pretty</li>
      <li>Exactly the color I was looking for</li>
      <li>You get the exact shade that you see in the pictures.</li>
      <li>Pretty-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy several more</li>
      <li>Pretty tube, pretty &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; but probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
      <li>just doesn&#x27;t last long enough but not going to keep me from buying it because like I say everything else is perfect.</li>
      <li>The color is really light, can barely be seen.</li>
      <li>This particular color!</li>
      <li>It was lighter than I expected, but I love the feel on my lips.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>I really had to scrape my lips to get it on.</li>
      <li>I know this is too much</li>
      <li>I keep it on my table, ready to use...</li>
      <li>the colour of this lipstick doesn&#x27;t really look like anything you see it the picture</li>
      <li>Makes your lips feel soft and gives the right amount of shine with out looking too glossy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is soft and won&#x27;t dry out your lips, but it added absolutely no color to my lips! I was really disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy save your money</li>
    <li> smells, feels, and wears like a child&#x27;s play cosmetic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!!!! Absolutely love it</li>
    <li> the color looks nice!!!</li>
    <li> Love everything about this except it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I think it should.  In every away it&#x27;s exactly where it should be color consistency shape smell perfect just doesn&#x27;t last long enough but not going to keep me from buying it because like I say everything else is perfect. Reminds me of that old song two out of three ain&#x27;t bad well sort of like that good e nuff  it really is and the price is not that bad so you just apply it more often?</li>
    <li> I do like this product, it gives a natural look to my lips.  However, it is a little to light. It did feel nice and light on my lips, which was nice.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color for me.  It matches well with the blush I ordered and I highly recommend this lipstick.</li>
    <li> I purchased Le Balm in Pink Satin at my local drugstore because it was on sale at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The packaging is very pretty.  The cap is clear and the base is gold.  I think it looks more luxurious than the Revlon Lip Butters.  The cap is also easier to grip and take off because of the taller base.  When you put the cap back on, you have to line it up with the notch at the base (it&#x27;s an interlocking cap) - this is a bit annoying, but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: The Pink Satin has a sweet scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering or overwhelming in any sense.  I think it&#x27;s a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: I was underwhelmed by the color.  Take L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s word, it \\&quot;provides a HINT of color\\&quot;.  Personally, I can barely see the pink on my lips.  Even after 3 heavy applications, the color is hardly visible.  This formula reminds me of YSL&#x27;s VOLUPT&amp;Eacute; SHEER CANDY.  If you want noticeable color, stick with [[ASIN:B006GQSH0C REVLON Colorburst Lip Butter, Sugar Frosting, 0.09 Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B004HRB0CE Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, Tinted, Hibiscus]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear: I found this lip balm to be very long lasting.  I live in Michigan where the winters are cold and dry.  I applied this in the morning and it lasted until lunch time (about 3 hours) - my lips felt moderately hydrated by noon.  My lips also retained a shiny look.  This is because the formula is a slick and not as creamy as the Lip Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this if you are looking for an SPF 15 Lip Balm with a tiny hint of color and lasting moisture.  This would make a fun valentine&#x27;s gift for your girl friends :)</li>
    <li> Pretty- very sheer, doesn&#x27;t add much color, just shine.</li>
    <li> Love this! Not much color and not much gloss. Makes your lips feel soft and gives the right amount of shine with out looking too glossy. Just a touch of natural color.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. It gives me the color I want and with a little shine on the lips. It last a long time. It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my lips, and in the color pink satin, it&#x27;s a marvelous nude that adds a hint of pink. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> first time purchase Loreal lip balm, feels great, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much receipt of the product, which was in excellent condition and in conformity with the specifications mentioned in the presentation&lt;br /&gt;I hope all the shops dealing directly with Saudi Arabia .</li>
    <li> Seems like it would be moist but actually makes my lips feel dry after wearing for 30 min to an hour. Pretty tube, pretty &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; but probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> The kid was off of the product when I got it in the mail so it was kind of smooches but not bad enough for me to return it. It has a different consistency than I was imaging. It almost more like a gel/ lipgloss but in a lipstick form.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon products for years and love them. reece@rodrunner.com  Working under the television lights for hours at a time can dry out your lips.  This product id great and has lots of moisture.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed as the pink couloir Riche balm looked so pretty and pink. Was hoping for at least a beautiful hint of color , but alas, it just looks like clear lipgloss.</li>
    <li> Quite good to use and make my lip very moisture. I love it and also bought three for my friends.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I tried to put this on was how hard it was. It wasn&#x27;t like other lipsticks or chapsticks, it was really hard. I really had to scrape my lips to get it on. After spending time trying to get it even, the color didn&#x27;t show at all. It left a gross taste like sunscreen on my lips. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Ir never come to my house!! I&#x27;m pretty upset because it should be in the box with the rest of my stuff, but it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> The color is really light, can barely be seen. It feels like a lip balm</li>
    <li> My fave lip balm ever !  Lips are soooo soft after usage.</li>
    <li> I have had this for like 2 years and use it everyday unless I am looking for a sexy look then I go with a red but other than that BEST lipstick ever!</li>
    <li> And I sometimes use it as a lip balm because the color was sheer. This was actually a plus point for me as I don&#x27;t like strong color on my lips all the time as I don&#x27;t think it looks particularly good for me and my age. The packaging was fantastic. I fell in love with the color while browsing on Amazon and it arrived looking exactly as pictured. Will try other colors!</li>
    <li> This particular color! It goes with everything! It applies easily! I would recommend this lipstick to every girl!!  Nice for all skin tones.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a few weeks after I ordered it and I tried it out as soon as it arrives.  At first, I thought that it will be really creamy and has a great color payoff. Unfortunately, this color is really sheer and not really moisturizing as a tinted lip balm. The packaging is pretty but, I would rather buy something else and not repurchase this again.</li>
    <li> the colour of this lipstick doesn&#x27;t really look like anything you see it the picture it&#x27;s a lot darker . When you apply it on your lips it is very nice, smooth and glossy but the colour is very transparent. It looks like your just wearing lipgloss.Also, the packaging isn&#x27;t gold its silver.</li>
    <li> Feels very smooth but I purchased pink satin and it goes on completely clear. Has a very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use! You get the exact shade that you see in the pictures.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t look good in a lot of lip colors so I usually stick to nude. This, however, is an excellent alternative! Love the product quality and color.</li>
    <li> subtle sheer color. good for finishing touch for nude lip color base.</li>
    <li> Love it, will for sure buy again.</li>
    <li> Very similar to Dior addictive and only one tenth the price</li>
    <li> misread...says lipbalm...but really nice anyways</li>
    <li> It appears to be healthy ingredients.. It smells good and is a good texture.. goes on smoothly and fast.. the tube lasts a long time..&lt;br /&gt;and maybe best of all, I like the tube it comes in.... it&#x27;s pretty and easy to use.. I keep it on my table, ready to use...</li>
    <li> I know this is too much but a girl got to pamper herself from time to time. No lipstick has ever made me feel pretty and confident. I love the rich color. I love everything about this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> not what i want, and it&#x27;s not protected well, when it arrives, the cover is always fallen off from the lip balm...</li>
    <li> I personally really liked this product because I wanted something that didn&#x27;t have too much color in it. It is basically expensive lip balm that has the tiniest hint of pink color to it. The color itself is sort of silvery as well, not quite identical to the picture. Don&#x27;t get it if you are wanting lipstick. The texture is very glossy and feels good on your lips just like lip balm though.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way - color, texture and the way it feels on my lips.  The price was reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I love this. I got the color pink satin and I&#x27;m not a girl that wears lipstick or lip gloss. I don&#x27;t like a lot of color on my lips. You can tell I have it on but it&#x27;s not bam in your face.  I also like how light weight it is when put on. Def will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Great shade and price</li>
    <li> I thought that the color would be a bit more noticeable, however the texture is silky smooth. I like it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A CLEAR LIP BALM, NOT LIPSTICK.. but I was still shocked by how smoothe it was and kept it.</li>
    <li> BEST LIP BALM I EVER USED PERIOD ! LIKE THE FACT IT&#x27;S IN THE SHAPE OF A LIPSTICK ~</li>
    <li> I would not recommend anyone paying $8.00 but shipping and taxes for this. It is NOT lipstick, it is merely Lip BALM .IT LEAVES NO COLOR/SHADE behind.It&#x27;s clear lip balm.  and i have no idea why it comes in different colors or have different names. This product is no different than a $1.00 chapstick from cvs.</li>
    <li> The color is in the center of this lipstick with a clear gloss going all around.  On me, I am ivory toned, it just didn&#x27;t provide all the color I wanted.</li>
    <li> Exactly the color I was looking for</li>
    <li> Color is very pretty. Very soft upon application.  It was lighter than I expected, but I love the feel on my lips.</li>
    <li> amazing . just like advertised , it only adds a HINT of color . which is very natural pinkish color , while moisturizing . suits a natural, no makeup girl style :]</li>
    <li> When I saw the real product I was kind of disappointed. The plastic top case gives it a cheap look and the lip balm looks too pinky, more than I expected. But after I put it on the color became natural on my lips. Overall I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It feels like a great, creamy balm but also gives you enough color so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re going out \\&quot;bare\\&quot;.  It feels like you&#x27;ve got something on that is nourishing, and gives you some color without looking like LIPSTICK! I&#x27;ll probably buy several more so I&#x27;ve always got one on hand!</li>
    <li> Beautiful balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really smoothes lips and very little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fancy look and feel.</li>
    <li> is the perfect color for lips look beautiful and naturalesl. the quality and presentation are impeccable. I loved the product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have ordered more already, I have 5 of these lip balms, one in each color. they are sheer with a hint of color and they really do moisturize.  a great product.</li>
    <li> This lipstick applies smoothly, has a great light color, and is quite moisturizing. I have tried many lipsticks in order to find ones that don&#x27;t dry my lips, and this one is great.</li>
    <li> Color was too light on lips</li>
    <li> Great as a gloss and lipstick.  I use it alone and as a base and/or topping to too dark lipsticks. FABULOUS.</li>
    <li> This lip balm smells divine and goes on like silk. Bought Five for stocking stuffers. Everyone loved them.</li>
