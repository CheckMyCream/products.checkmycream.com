    <li> I learned about this from my dad years ago. Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> i have used Cushion Grip for a number of years and will use nothing else.  for me it will last at least a week before having to be replaced.  What I would like to know is why the large price hike.  I used to pay $20-25 for a pack of four and for the past few purchases I have to pay $40 for a pack of two.</li>
    <li> the price is a lot higher than it was before</li>
    <li> This product works very well &amp; was shipped &amp; delivered early. Thanks</li>
    <li> This adhesive if thats what you call it is the worst. First of all as  soon as you squeeze it out its already gettting hard so its difficult to spread let only evenly. My gum ridge is deep so i have no way of getting in that deep. The other problem is it sticks to the denture making it impossible to remove. I read the directions 3 times. I should have known it was to good to be true. I want to know how do you measure 3/4 in diameter of a balloon. Absolutely ridiculous. I would not even rate this product because its to troubling and problematic on all aspects of this thermoplastic theory.</li>
    <li> great product but do not know why all of a sudden its hard to get and the price is WAY too high. My motherinlaw doesnt like anything but this product so I think she will have to start getting used to something else.  I am thinking its discontiued to have been pro</li>
    <li> I  was so pleased to find it as it has been discontinued at the stores and it works so great that I couldn&#x27;t do with out it..</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years, I hope the supply does not run out. For me it does the job</li>
    <li> can not belive they quit making this prouduct</li>
    <li> Works just fine, too bad price has skyrocketed.</li>
    <li> Way way too expensive!!!</li>
    <li> Cushion Grip is the greatest, really like it..</li>
    <li> paying 50 dollars for two tubes was a total ripe off when a tube of this costs 5.87 in stores. it was sopposed to be two packs with two in each so i guess it sucked.</li>
    <li> Mom is very sad they are no longer in business.  Price is way to high now for the product that is left.  The best denture adhesive out there though.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by my dentist. I have used it for years with great results.</li>
    <li> It was as good as it always has been. Just need to go back to the old original price. It isn&#x27;t fair to put it out of reach for the older people who can no longer afford dental help. I am almost 84 and no longer have the appliances available for my implants., so have to use cushion grip in place of the needed dental help.&lt;br /&gt;Please tr to get this back to the original $5.00.</li>
    <li> People with dentures it&#x27;s a blessing.</li>
    <li> Much better than previous cushion grip. Much better adhesive &amp; nice &amp; soft.  Much longer lasting</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for it&#x27;s Denture adhesive, but it can be used in other  beneficial ways as well.</li>
    <li> It needs to be made available in pharmacies again at a reasonable price. It is a fantastic product. Please ask makers to make it available for everyone that doesn&#x27;t  know about Amazon.</li>
    <li> worked out very well thanks....should last for awhile now.....happy customer</li>
    <li> Product not what it once was.</li>
    <li> Best recliner available, great shipping speed!</li>
    <li> It arrived a day before it was suppose to and it feels comfortable in my mouth I just have to get use to how it works but it is good product</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Just wish it came off a little easyer, but that would defeat the whole idea ...LOL</li>
    <li> Works great.  To bad it&#x27;s been discontinued. And three times the price it was in the stores.</li>
