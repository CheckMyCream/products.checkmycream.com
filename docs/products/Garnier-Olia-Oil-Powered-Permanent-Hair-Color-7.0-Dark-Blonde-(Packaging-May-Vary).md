      <li>then Olia is a great choice for you.</li>
      <li>So this product was a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>which was awesome but made me wonder if it was going to be that easy to get out of my hair as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The design is a good concept on paper but not practical at all.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>My hair feels good and soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, something the packaging would have been wise to mention.  </li>
      <li>I loved that it didn&#x27;t smell of ammonia at all.</li>
      <li>beautiful brown healthy looking hair</li>
      <li>It is definitely a pleasant scent and was very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I love the color!  </li>
      <li>The positive: This product smells great!!!</li>
      <li>I liked the color and my hair was a darker auburn brown</li>
      <li>The smell is fine, but it is not as pleasant as Nutrisse&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even after I rinsed, the results were a huge disapointment!  </li>
      <li>It was more creamier.</li>
      <li>I love the smell,  </li>
      <li>I used I&#x27;m sure fried some brain cells.</li>
      <li>Even the $3.00 Revlon Colorstay is better than this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love the olive oil product and there is no staining on the skin.</li>
      <li>Is it my favorite?  </li>
      <li>Sure.  </li>
      <li>I love that it ddoesntv stain rugs or walls...</li>
      <li>top of all that, it didn&#x27;t cover grays well.</li>
      <li>I would love if they included maybe 20% more in order to cover everything well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>was the lack of overwhelming chemical smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, even if this was the best color in the entire world, I would not use it based on it&#x27;s difficulty and flaws.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, even if this was the best color in the entire world, I would not use it based on it&#x27;s difficulty and flaws.</li>
      <li>I love this hair color.</li>
      <li>My mother and I have used this product for about a year now and have always been pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I almost dropped it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is so easy and works better than using a bottle.  </li>
      <li>Which is fine because i really do love it</li>
      <li>It is a nice, mild light brown that is also multi-dimensional and shiny.  </li>
      <li>dye was easy to apply, but as soon as I rinsed the conditioner out</li>
      <li>Easy rinse</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that strong fragrance of &#x27;just dyed&#x27; smell that lingers.</li>
      <li>but it is very pretty!).</li>
      <li>But this just made a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this hair color.</li>
      <li>I liked how I didn&#x27;t get a burning sensation when applying the product, and there wasn&#x27;t so much of a smell.</li>
      <li>and I used a light brown shade.</li>
      <li>bought the light auburn,  which i don&#x27;t understand why they call it</li>
      <li>I am not an experienced home hair colorist having only colored my hair once before.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and smells good after I color it.</li>
      <li>You see you are to knock that tip of the bottle off first, put a finger on top of the opening and give it a shake....</li>
      <li>But it all came out a beautiful brown color (maybe a smidge darker than expected).</li>
      <li>I thought the packaging was cool and original.</li>
      <li>The smell is the only good part of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used the 6.3 light golden brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved the end result of this product and it held for 2 months of regular washing.</li>
      <li>I then washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried, then applied Garnier Olia 6.3 light golden brown.</li>
      <li>I did run into the \\&quot;slippery bottle\\&quot; thing that people talked about, but I find most of the applicator bottles get slippery once you start, so it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
      <li>It rinsed out beautifully and it wasn&#x27;t a dark dye rinsing from your hair either.</li>
      <li>further, my hair does not feel any softer than it did when i used clairol&#x27;s nice &#x27;n easy.</li>
      <li>I expect this will wash out quickly</li>
      <li>The mixture is super runny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to John Frieda; it may cost more, but it delivers more even coverage and 100% of my greys are colored.</li>
      <li>Sure, it is ammonia free, and has a pleasant smell, but that&#x27;s not enough to get me purchase it again, since it didn&#x27;t actually do what I bought it for.</li>
      <li>As for the color, it&#x27;s very pretty</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and I love the colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>next day my hair lightened even more so it is now a rich chocolate</li>
      <li>I took a washcloth with soup and water and it came right off...</li>
      <li>I had more than enough dye to cover my whole head with some to spare and the application was easy.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;oil based dye\\&quot; sounded kind of strange</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, the other box dyes I used with the ammonia left my hair feeling better than this one - strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>The colour mixture is a bit intimidating for those who don&#x27;t want to chance a bold unusual colour -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting married in three months</li>
      <li>I already have pretty damaged hair, and it felt a bit improved even before the conditioner.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for several years and have used mostly clairol and l&#x27;oreal products.</li>
      <li>earlier I had said that I thought the container was stylish - which it is</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands from foams to creams to liquids.</li>
      <li>I washed my hair first with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried then followed the directions.</li>
      <li>There should have been more than enough to color my hair.</li>
      <li>I had to open that plastic bottle up, root around for some more dye and still had to scrap some off my head to apply it to hair that hadn&#x27;t received the dye.</li>
      <li>I am going to have to go get more [of a different brand] to finish my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was worried that I got a messed up batch at first.</li>
      <li>the first time around.</li>
      <li>Another positive worth mentioning is the creamy product did not drip and was much easier to apply without mess.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used Light Golden Brown to change up the extra-light ash blonde I had before.  </li>
      <li>The developer comes in a HUGE container but barely has anything in it.</li>
      <li>The color was true to the box on my roots but darker though the rest of my hair because of the old color that was on it.</li>
      <li>Right before coloring, my hair was probably about 5 different shades (including my natural color which has a lot of grays around my temple), mostly reds with some highlights.</li>
      <li>the application bottle is an odd shape and it was kind of cumbersome to use.  </li>
      <li>I also have a lot of greys in certain areas,which covered well.</li>
      <li>I have medium blonde, fine hair</li>
      <li>It is also much, much brighter on the grown out roots.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>If you find a color you really like or cant stand the smell of ammonia box dye</li>
      <li>When you are shaking or squeezing it, the whole thing just slips out of your hand.</li>
      <li>and I still don&#x27;t really \\&quot;need\\&quot; to re-dye my hair</li>
      <li>but I am ready for a change.  </li>
      <li>The color is saturated and very pigmented where it was put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this from Walmart.  I got the lightest cool blonde, because it pretty much matched the color that I usually buy in a different brand.  I just wanted to try something different, so I decided on this.  BIG MISTAKE.  First it was awkward trying to get all the developer out of the tube.  Usually the developer is already in the application bottle, and you just have to add the colorant. Strike one!  Second the application bottle is an odd shape and it was kind of cumbersome to use.  Strike two! Once I got all the color on my hair, as per the instructions, I was already noticing weird things happening.  Parts of my hair looked as thought they had a grey tint to them, but I gave he product the benefit of the doubt, since I hadn&#x27;t used it before. And also couldn&#x27;t tell if it was just the lighting I was in.  When it was time to rinse I was already displeased, the color, while being the lightest blonde they had available, did not lift my roots very well at all, the color looked blotchy and strange.  Even after I rinsed, the results were a huge disapointment!  There were still parts of my hair that had a greyish tint to them.  HORRIBLE, and my hair did not feel good after either.  A few days later, I bought my regular box of color, Revlon&#x27;s Colorsilk in Lightest Ash Blonde, a less expensive brand, but FAR superior!!  I used it, and it lifted my roots perfectly and evened out all my color, vanishing any trace of this horrible hair dye!  And my hair felt much nicer again.  I will stick with the Colorsilk from now on!  This Garnier product was by far the worst hair color I ever tried!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I dye my hair frequently, and different colors at that!  I used Light Golden Brown to change up the extra-light ash blonde I had before.  I picked that shade because I didn&#x27;t want my cool-toned hair to go green when I dyed it darker, as has happened to me in the past.  I love the color!  It is a nice, mild light brown that is also multi-dimensional and shiny.  The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because the bottle is awkward to use, the developer bottle is awkwardly big and unnecessary, and the gloves were a little bit too small.  The smell and color are great, though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been self coloring for 10 years using everything from professional to Sally&#x27;s products to box color when I&#x27;m incredibly lazy. This is by far the worst coloring experience I have ever had. Even the $3.00 Revlon Colorstay is better than this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The developer comes in a HUGE container but barely has anything in it. I was worried that I got a messed up batch at first. But then I called my mom who raved about it and she said it was normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The instructions tell you to take off the little topper on the mixer bottle then shake it. NO female has hands big enough to keep their finger on the tip while holding onto it while shaking it because of the following reason. This may seem like a small complaint with an easy fix (to leave the topper on until after shaking), but it&#x27;s annoying nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The bottle is a horrible, horrible shape. It is an awkward ball shape with a 3-4 inch cone on the top. When you are shaking or squeezing it, the whole thing just slips out of your hand. I almost dropped it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The mixture is super runny. I&#x27;ve used many different brands from foams to creams to liquids. But this just made a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The gloves are made for a child&#x27;s hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the biggest con.....&lt;br /&gt;6.. There is not enough to do an entire head. My hair is barely to my color bone, heavily layered, and fairly thin. I usually throw away color because I never need an entire batch. I barely had enough to do 3/4s of my head! That is ridiculous. There should have been more than enough to color my hair. But when the developer and color was combined, only about 1/2 of that horrible baseball and dunce cap bottle was full. (Again with the oversize packaging!) I am going to have to go get more [of a different brand] to finish my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t smell too horribly. I&#x27;ve smelled worse and I&#x27;ve smelled better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The conditioner that comes with it left my hair soft and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The color is saturated and very pigmented where it was put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, even if this was the best color in the entire world, I would not use it based on it&#x27;s difficulty and flaws. Garnier did not think things through before releasing this product.it left my hair soft and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The color is saturated and very pigmented where it was put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, even if this was the best color in the entire world, I would not use it based on it&#x27;s difficulty and flaws. Garnier did not think things through before releasing this product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color. My hair feels soft and smells good after I color it. I also have a lot of greys in certain areas,which covered well. Everyone complains about the applicator bottle. I never us an applicator bottle instead I squeeze the product in a plastic bowl and use a hair coloring brush to apply. This is so easy and works better than using a bottle.  I love the olive oil product and there is no staining on the skin. My hair looks and feel beautiful.</li>
    <li> The smell is the only good part of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to rinse for half an hour to get the water to run clear. When I dried my hair, I realized that even though I was careful to spread the product evenly throughout my hair, the dye did not take evenly and now I have weird streaks in my hair. It is also much, much brighter on the grown out roots. Almost clown colored.</li>
    <li> I color my hair regularly to cover very resistant grays. I am ready to try any new product that promises to do just that, with the least amount of harsh chemicals, so I was very happy to see this new product advertised on my local store, and I bought it. As I said what a disappointment! Not only the grays started to be visible again after 4 washes, but the hair was not left soft and silky at all, like me previous hair color product does. I am going back to my old product, till I find something better, this one was definitely not it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly very shocked by the amount of bad reviews.  My mother and I have used this product for about a year now and have always been pleased with the results.  And yes, we have collectively tried several different colors at this point as well.  I actually really love the new black gloves they use for Olia.  The old clear ones are way to baggy and make it hard for me to properly apply the color.  I have used Olia when I had short, chin-length hair and now that I have past my shoulders length hair and have NEVER ran out of color.  And I have never had issues of spotting and streaking like some reviewers have mentioned.  Yes, it can take several minutes for the water to run clear in the shower, but I&#x27;ve never had color loss or bleeding after the initial dyeing.  I also have almost annoying healthy hair (hard to style or tease because it falls right out) and I do not feel as though Olia has caused my hair any damage.  It has been over two months and I still don&#x27;t really \\&quot;need\\&quot; to re-dye my hair but I am ready for a change.  I think I&#x27;m going to try Dark Intense Auburn next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have medium brown hair naturally that I have been dyeing darker using Dark Brown, Darkest Brown, or Dark Soft Mahogany depending on my mood)</li>
    <li> beautiful brown healthy looking hair</li>
    <li> I typically use Garnier&#x27;s Nutrisse and will be switching back ASAP. I tried Olia Medium Golden Brown last night and am really disappointed with the color. My hair felt dry as I was washing it out in the sink and still felt dry after the deep conditioner. The smell is fine, but it is not as pleasant as Nutrisse&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My color is the big bummer. My hair is flat, solid and boring. Even old Miss Clairol doesn&#x27;t dull and bore like this! My grey roots look blonde and some grey in front of my ears didn&#x27;t take the color at all. I expect this will wash out quickly and I&#x27;ll be redoing my color in 2 weeks - which sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat, brown color, dry, dull with not a hint of shine. Don&#x27;t bother with this new product. It isn&#x27;t worth an hour of your life and is not worth the extra $1-2 off the shelf. They missed the mark on this!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this would work.  It doesn&#x27;t have that horrid &amp;#34;hair color&amp;#34; smell and it left my hair really soft and silky, but (after carefully following the directions) it didn&#x27;t cover my roots!</li>
    <li> I was so attracted to the packaging that I purchased this product. Upon opening I found the company wasted a lot of plastic on big tubes. I&#x27;m a recycler but not a fanatic and found this to be overkill. There was barely enough color to cover my hair, and the color came out 3 shades darker then what I chose from the picture on the box. I am NOT a first time home color user and I will NOT purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for several years and have used mostly clairol and l&#x27;oreal products. i tried olia because it&#x27;s ammonia-free. after following the instructions and leaving it on for 30+ minutes, i discovered it did not provide hardly any gray coverage, especially near my temples. my hair is medium to dark brown and the color i used is 6.3-light golden brown. i wish i would&#x27;ve read these reviews prior to using, for it looks as though i now have to look forward to the color washing out after a few shampoos. further, my hair does not feel any softer than it did when i used clairol&#x27;s nice &#x27;n easy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for the first time when I found my usual brand and color were recalled (scary!). I was looking for something to match my current color of deep brown without going to dark. It&#x27;s always so difficult to tell from the product descriptions so I went with \\&quot;dark brown 4.0\\&quot; My natural hair color is borderline black but not quite that dark so I have a difficult time finding a diy color kit that is just what I want. I am sitting here with the color on my head with the clock ticking to see the results. What prompted the idea to write a review.... one big positive comment and one negative comment.&lt;br /&gt;  The positive: This product smells great!!! I questioned whether I mixed the right tubes together at first because there is no chemical smell. Big plus in my book! Another positive worth mentioning is the creamy product did not drip and was much easier to apply without mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative: I was so irritated right from the beginning of the mixing process because I could not keep my finger over the opening of the bottle while shaking with the gloves on because of the strange non-ergo shaped bottle. This irritation increased while applying the product because I ended up dropping the stupid thing 3 times because I could not keep my grip on the bottle.  Not sure why they chose this shape but it is not user friendly and dropping it several times resulted in dye marks on my bathroom walls. NOT HAPPY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting color and condition of hair: No complaints about the color but boy is my hair dry! I used the conditioner provided as directed and my hair felt so dry while still wet that I used some of the conditioner left over from my old brand of hair color. The other brands hair conditioner did the trick!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new hair color and this box caught my eye. \\&quot;oil based dye\\&quot; sounded kind of strange and it said it had no smell. I liked the color and my hair was a darker auburn brown so I figured I would try it. I have long fine hair that goes slightly past my bra line so I got two boxes which is what I always use.  I found the packaging as a whole was a bit big and gimmicky, giving it the feel of something different than normal box dye, but it is pretty much the same as any other box dye I have ever used. I had more than enough dye to cover my whole head with some to spare and the application was easy. Best part the smell!!!! I loved that it didn&#x27;t smell of ammonia at all. The color was true to the box on my roots but darker though the rest of my hair because of the old color that was on it. All in all this box dye worked just like any other box dye would except it doesn&#x27;t have the obnoxious smell. If you find a color you really like or cant stand the smell of ammonia box dye then Olia is a great choice for you. I would use this product again.</li>
    <li> I was attracted to this product because it doesn&#x27;t have ammonia, and I&#x27;m trying to color without damaging my hair. I read the reviews and noted that people stated it didn&#x27;t cover greys, but I thought \\&quot;that won&#x27;t happen to me!\\&quot; and tried it anyway. Well, this product says it has 100% grey coverage, but as other people have written in their reviews, it actually covers 0% grey. In fact this product only colored my already color treated hair, and didn&#x27;t even touch my roots (which is virgin, untreated hair)! Sure, it is ammonia free, and has a pleasant smell, but that&#x27;s not enough to get me purchase it again, since it didn&#x27;t actually do what I bought it for. As for the color, it&#x27;s very pretty and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it, even if I still do have all my grey, and my dark blonde roots are still showing. This stuff is weird. I&#x27;m going back to John Frieda; it may cost more, but it delivers more even coverage and 100% of my greys are colored. Thanks anyway, Garnier.</li>
    <li> I wanted so much to like this product but it was so poorly designed for usage and the color barely took.  Just finished using it to color my hair which had been previously highlighted.  The highlights still remain, which is a positive thing, but the roots, hairline, and new growth remain gray with a hint of brown in some spots!  I don&#x27;t who designed the new oversized and unnecessary bottle for mixing ingredients, but it was too big to handle and kept slipping from my hand when I tried to shake it and apply it to hair.  As always, the developer and colorant come in tubes that are plastic or metal and like toothpaste containers, they do not dispense all the product.  Very disappointing product.</li>
    <li> Made my hair dry and unpleasant to touch. I was excited for an alternative to permanent color but this will definitely not be it. Will not use again.</li>
    <li> I have medium blonde, fine hair but when I need to redo my highlights I use a dark blonde base.  I purchased Dark Blonde and it came out much darker than any other hair color I&#x27;ve used.  There wasn&#x27;t much odor but the packaging was very difficult to manage.  The teardrop shaped bottle has a wide mouth, so right way I accidentally dropped the color container into the bottle.  After that mess was cleaned up and everything mixed, I found the bottle really slippery to hang onto.  I have small hands and the wide bottom proved a challenge during the whole color process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair black, which usually is less of a gamble than the reds or blondes I used to use. Black is black, right? Nope. I used \\&quot;Soft Black\\&quot; and not only is it a weird grey shade, my hair is the driest and worst condition it&#x27;s been in years -- and I used to bleach it 4x a year! It&#x27;s like straw and every time I use a wide tooth comb it just falls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this hoping it would be gentler, but it seems like I&#x27;ll be going back to the harsher stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also need to redesign the bottle as it flew out of my hands several times during the application.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this hair color. I am over 50%% grey with dark brown thick hair- this is grey because it works takes well on the roots and does not have the impossible ammonia smell.  I have been using this hair color for a year and I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I loved the end result of this product and it held for 2 months of regular washing. Even then, it didn&#x27;t really fade overall, but in some places where I probably hadn&#x27;t got it on as well as I might have. The color is the most natural I&#x27;ve ever used, and doesn&#x27;t look flat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the company clearly tested the product but not the equipment. The applicator is shaped like a fat raindrop. I have smallish hands, but not overly so for a woman. I had a hard time getting a grip on it while wearing the slippery gloves, and it became just about impossible, once a bit of the oil based color got on the gloves. Every time I tried to squeeze it, it tried to pop out of my hand. Greased pig contest anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, something the packaging would have been wise to mention.  If you use it in the shower, you need to scrub the shower thoroughly afterward, for the sake of safety. I colored my hair at night, went to bed, and the next morning, hopped into the shower without thinking about it. I&#x27;m a sturdy, athletic sort, and that&#x27;s what saved me from a nasty fall. The oil based color had left a thick layer of oil that hadn&#x27;t washed away and the shower was like a skating rink. Hate to think what would have happened to an older, less athletic person. Then again... people with actual houses instead of tiny apartments probably color in a sink instead of a shower, so maybe it&#x27;s a nonissue.</li>
    <li> I used the 6.3 light golden brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic! I am a dyeing newbie but the ammonia from the other box dyes I used I&#x27;m sure fried some brain cells. So this product was a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has got to be redesigned. It is awkward to hold and not user friendly whatsoever. The design is a good concept on paper but not practical at all.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t really make my hair softer than before, even with the conditioner. Surprisingly, the other box dyes I used with the ammonia left my hair feeling better than this one - strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use this product again? I might give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair saga is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;I have never dyed my hair before so I had the requisite virgin hair. It is a soft black and I really wanted the color lifted rather than bleached to a brown color.  I wanted to stay away from bleach because I did not want my hair to turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;So I chose the L&#x27;oreal Paris sun-kissed caramels UL51 hi-lift natural brown.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to dyeing, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a day. I followed the instructions.  I wanted a subtle ombre effect so I only applied the dye from chin length to the ends. I left it on for 30 minutes. The effect was so subtle, I could barely tell anything had been done to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Having gotten over my fear of dye, the next day I went on a dye rampage (not advisable given the fact that no professional has ever colored my hair - I just watched a lot of Youtube videos).&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to stay with the ash/cooler dyes to avoid the orange effect so I chose the L&#x27;oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown. I washed my hair first with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried then followed the directions. The color lifted at least two shades of brown, which was good.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t stop there. I then washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried, then applied Garnier Olia 6.3 light golden brown. It made it darker. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;So I washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried, then applied another layer of the L&#x27;oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown. My hair was the right shade of subtle dark brown. I love the effect of my soft black hair&#x27;s subtle gradation to the brown from roots to tips.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re fearing for the damage to my hair, you&#x27;re not alone. I figure 20+ years of no chemical processes and then 4 box dyes in 24 hours should balance each other out.  Anyway, I applied the Pantene overnight miracle to my hair and now my hair feels even softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;The next day my hair lightened even more so it is now a rich chocolate brown.&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: If I had to do it all over again - I would have skipped L&#x27;oreal Paris sun-kissed caramels UL51 hi-lift natural brown and just used the L&#x27;Oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown the first time around.</li>
    <li> I thought the packaging was cool and original. The one tube was a bit big for the amount of product it contained, but I really liked the gloves (a littler thicker than typical gloves) and the overall style. I have been coloring my hair for almost 2 decades, almost exclusively at home. Right before coloring, my hair was probably about 5 different shades (including my natural color which has a lot of grays around my temple), mostly reds with some highlights. I chose olia light brown in an effort to get back to a solid base tone that was brown with gold hues.&lt;br /&gt; I liked how I didn&#x27;t get a burning sensation when applying the product, and there wasn&#x27;t so much of a smell. I did run into the \\&quot;slippery bottle\\&quot; thing that people talked about, but I find most of the applicator bottles get slippery once you start, so it didn&#x27;t bother me too much. I was a little concerned about coverage, since my hair is thick and past my shoulders. I really had to try to get every little drop out of the bottle and really scrub it into my hair in order to get all of it saturated. I would love if they included maybe 20% more in order to cover everything well.&lt;br /&gt;But my efforts paid off. I left it on my hair for 40 minutes as I typically do (stubborn greys) though I was reading the other reviews and got very nervous about it. I rinsed, and what normally would be a LOT of color running out was very little. I did not experience the straw like effects others have mentioned. I already have pretty damaged hair, and it felt a bit improved even before the conditioner. I left the conditioner on for about 15 minutes, really scrubbing it in before letting it sit.&lt;br /&gt;And when I came out, I was pleasantly surprised. For those of you who dye your hair and have natural roots, you know the many different color variations you might have in those two different \\&quot;sectors\\&quot; after dying your hair. Always a little bit of roulette when you take the towel off and brush it out. So now imagine roots, greys, severalreds, and highlights. But it all came out a beautiful brown color (maybe a smidge darker than expected). I missed a few little sections here and there that are a little lighter. I can see the highlights are also a little lighter, but the reds really got neutralized well and there aren&#x27;t any copper tinted places. There is also no green/ash tints that sometimes show up on brown over blond. There is no \\&quot;root\\&quot; line visible either. My hair feels good and soft.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s not magic or anything, but it covered my grays, gave me a nice overall color to work with, and it was a less harsh experience than it usually is. I will definitely use it again, and I will get 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> I got it for touch up and hey my roots are still their</li>
    <li> I have been using hair dye out of the box since I was 13, so.. for almost 20 years. I usually don&#x27;t pay much attention to reviews because everyone is different so I figured I&#x27;d give this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye was easy to apply, but as soon as I rinsed the conditioner out I knew something was wrong. Even after leaving the conditioner on my hair for 5 minutes and rinsing my hair felt VERY dry and brittle. Usually after you use hair dye conditioner your hair feels great. When I went to brush it out the brush pulled out a lot of hair. I dried it and saw that the top of my head was covered in short frizzy hairs that didn&#x27;t lay with the rest of my hair. It caused major breakage and drying. It took a good 3 months for the broken hairs to grow out enough to lay back down. I&#x27;ve never had a dye, or even bleach damage my hair so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all that, it didn&#x27;t cover grays well. My grays were dyed, but they were all lighter than the rest of my hair. Within just a few days they were gray again, and the rest of the color washed out within 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t usually review hair dyes but this one is really awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend anyone using this dye.</li>
    <li> I am not an experienced home hair colorist having only colored my hair once before. At age 55 I was tired of my hair looking mousey gray (dead brown) with white streaks. The other time I colored my hair it came out a peculiar orangey shade even though my natural color is medium brown and I used a light brown shade. This time the shade stayed true to my natural color but completely covered the white streaks and gave life back to the rest of my hair. It came out a lively golden brown without looking red or orange.&lt;br /&gt;What I liked best about this product was the lack of overwhelming chemical smell. It is definitely a pleasant scent and was very easy to apply. I have short hair and did not used all the product. I had no reaction to it. Someone mentioned drippiness but I did not find that to be the case. It was plenty thick enough to stay in my hair and did not run down my face or neck. I even did my eyebrows! I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationsHip with this product.  I love the oil base,  I love the smell,  I love that it ddoesntv stain rugs or walls... literally,  I missed a spot on the wall and three hours later when I seen it,  I took a washcloth with soup and water and it came right off... which was awesome but made me wonder if it was going to be that easy to get out of my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the light auburn,  which i don&#x27;t understand why they call it that because even the picture shows a dark red.  Well,  turns out that my hair turned fire engine red.  Which is fine because i really do love it haha just wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting.  I&#x27;m getting married in three months so i don&#x27;t mind if it fades because I&#x27;ll be going for a cherry mocha then.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is strange but i have big hands so although i didn&#x27;t have a problem,  I could see how some women might.  It didn&#x27;t cover my roots very well to be honest and because the formula is so thick,  when i died my hair,  I have numerous blonde chunks still visible.  I had to buy a second box.&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again?  Sure.  Is it my favorite?  Not exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: 4 DAYS LATER&lt;br /&gt;I just came back from a 3 day camping trip, and because it was so dirty and rainy and whatnot, we took showers every morning at a local rest area/shower place.&lt;br /&gt;Well, today is my first day back home, and let me tell you, I was so extremely angry when I looked in the mirror and seen that my hair was almost completely blonde/orange again. Almost all of the color came out, I am so extremely dissapointed and I wouldn&#x27;t ever buy this product again!!! Such a waste of money! I will be writing the company, 4 day haircolor is just ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I just used this stuff last night so my review may be premature. If I remember to do so, I&#x27;ll update. I decided to purchase Olia because my mother had and I had to admit - I liked the style of the bottle and the idea of a less harsh hair product. I purchased my box at Walmart, I got a dark blonde, though I have brown hair - I picked the colour to lighten the brown up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase Feria hair dye. I have used the sud dyes as well. I have a little grey but give it a year or two and that little will become much higher. I usually use a mascara to cover the gray between dyes. I do have rapid hair growth so it isn&#x27;t long before I see new grow at the hair line. My hair is very thick and short - a layered bob with an A cut in the back. Similar to the cut that Victoria Beckham had. Long in the front, short in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On using Olia: The directions are pretty much the same as all home dyes. The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as other hair dye I have used. It isn&#x27;t as runny either so there wasn&#x27;t a big blob of it on my shoulder or arm or on the floor...you all know what I mean. It is easy to get off the neck, ears, and forehead just by wiping it - but the other hair dye are the same way. It was more creamier. The colour in mixing was a bit intimating it. It was a very lovely peach colour! I&#x27;m at the age where odd hair colour is acceptable so I shrugged the odd colour and poured it upon my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now earlier I had said that I thought the container was stylish - which it is but it isn&#x27;t practical. It is hard to squeeze the dye out in that bottle! Maybe if you had manhands or the Hulks&#x27; you could do it but we women, you are probably going to find it difficult as well. As I said before, I have short, thick hair. I had to open that plastic bottle up, root around for some more dye and still had to scrap some off my head to apply it to hair that hadn&#x27;t received the dye. If you have should length hair - you might want two. Hair that falls midback...stockup. I also found the bottle hard to shake. You see you are to knock that tip of the bottle off first, put a finger on top of the opening and give it a shake....Next time, and as of now - there will be a next time - I&#x27;m going to snap that opening off AFTER I mixed it up. Seriously, its almost impossible and you want to get it mixed properly. It rinsed out beautifully and it wasn&#x27;t a dark dye rinsing from your hair either. It was almost soapy looking. It doesn&#x27;t have that strong fragrance of &#x27;just dyed&#x27; smell that lingers. There might be some smell but not like Feria left behind. My hair is soft and I love the colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Creamy. Lovely colour mixture (yes, its odd and a bit scary to put on but it is very pretty!). Non-drip. Not harsh odor. Plenty of conditioner. Easy rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bottle is too big and balky. Probably not enough dye for average hair length. The colour mixture is a bit intimidating for those who don&#x27;t want to chance a bold unusual colour - BUT it doesn&#x27;t come out looking anything like the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, if I remember I&#x27;ll repost of my review further in the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It is now August 4th, nearly a month since I lasted dyed my hair. I did touch up today, Olia started to fade sometime last week. This isn&#x27;t regrowth but an actual fade of colour. It isn&#x27;t too bad of a fade and with light hair you may not notice it. I still like this product though because it doesn&#x27;t seem as harsh and the smell is more tolerable then other dye products. I will continue to use it though for those who have a lot of gray to cover, you may opt out of using this product because of the fading process. Also on mixing the product, I did not break the mixing container until after it was mixed - where the direction say to break it before mixing. Because of the design of the bottle it is hard to mix the product while holding a finger tip on top of the bottle. The product is thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip but still if you have thick medium hair you may want two dyes as well as for those with long hair of any volume.</li>
