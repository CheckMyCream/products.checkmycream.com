      <li>The scent was great and literally lasted 24 hours!</li>
      <li>I tried one &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant but wasn&#x27;t impressed - it didn&#x27;t apply well, nor did it smell fresh.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This deodorant performs awesome!</li>

      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Probably a great deodorant if I didn&#x27;t have to apply it again half-way through the day.</li>
      <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t ever feel sticky.</li>
      <li>which worked ok because I guess it meshed well with my own body odor, but wasn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
      <li>I felt good about the ingredients list, so decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it also DID NOT smell pleasant when my own after a couple hours of wearing it.</li>

      <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural; I feel good about putting it on my body and into the environment.</li>
      <li>Zak Detox Deoderant is by far the BEST all natural  deoderant that I have ever used...and I have tried many.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using Energize, the scent to me smells just fine for a guy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;About five years ago, I became very interested in my health and stopped using the more commercially available deodorants.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t exactly a smooth application</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a good smelling and functioning natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for a good, natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>it is a pine-y scent that I didn&#x27;t love at first but have grown to like it.</li>
      <li>worth the price!</li>
      <li>I just love that I am using healthy, natural and healing ingredients on my skin.</li>
      <li>Zak smells fantastic (only tried the Energize) and keeps me from stinking up the place on warm days or if don&#x27;t take a shower immediately after I exercise.</li>
      <li>I received this product quickly.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that the added chemicals were good for my long term neurological function.</li>
      <li>But the few products that are on the market either don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t smell too great.</li>
      <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
      <li>Love this product so far.</li>
      <li>I was most surprised about the scent.</li>
      <li>Another claimed it was aluminum-free, but readers pointed out the ingredient right there on the label.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With energize I have finally found a happy alternative to the deoderants with aluminum and other natural deoderants that just aren’t quite effective.</li>
      <li>When you look at the back you can easily read, and identify everything in it!</li>
      <li>After my first use I knew that I had made the right choice.</li>
      <li>After reading these reviews thought I had finally found a good natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Sure enough, the stick ended up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
      <li>but it really is a 24 hour product!</li>
      <li>I think I have finally found my favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to Tom&#x27;s of Maine and renewing my search for better deodorant.</li>
      <li>Pits surprisingly stay dry for a natural deodorant, and I haven&#x27;t had any skin reactions to it.</li>
      <li>It does smell different than the off the shelf products that have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>Pretty decent deordorant.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I am really liking it...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 30-something female and I had been using deodorant free of aluminum for some time.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t really explain the scents on the site.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t think much of their ingredients until as of recent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>$15 is probably too much but despite what ur getting from it,it&#x27;s kinda&lt;br /&gt;Worth</li>
      <li>It really covers for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Having said that, I like its natural smell that is not over the top, it is just different.</li>
      <li>I bought the energizing scent, and love the smell of the natural essential oil blend.</li>
      <li>’s can keep up with me and keep me fresh, even after hot yoga and long runs.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this deodorant after reading reviews.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>He really did not like it because he developed rash in both armpits.</li>
      <li>Obviously it&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but it&#x27;s nice knowing</li>
      <li>I have tried several products and none of them have come close to the success I have had with this one.</li>
      <li>This is truly an amazing product, hard to believe it doesn&#x27;t have any of those harmful chemicals in it, as it smells even better than other deodorants and seems to last longer with no irritation.  </li>
      <li>I was offered a replacement with an unscented one, and a sample of their new version, as they changed the scent.  </li>
      <li>I have searched for so long without success until now.</li>
      <li>I read reviews on Amazon and finally ordered ZAK Energize as my first natural deodorant and started using it for about a month.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s comforting to know that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Zak deodorant for nearly three weeks now</li>
      <li>The scent will last pretty long and you don&#x27;t really feel the sweat at all.</li>
      <li>It was so much hair left on deodorant!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t developed any itching/irritations/rashes.</li>
      <li>in came my tests with natural deodorants.</li>
      <li>A lot of natural deodorants stop working on odors afrer a week or so.</li>
      <li>Zak&#x27;s deodorant has all natural, and high quality ingredients only.</li>
      <li>did not apply easily and noticed it turned my skin red after i used it a few times.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had started getting irritations with other deodorants and antiperspirants within 3 -4 hours after applying, so I had to stop using those daily and only used on special occasions or on days involving heavy sweating exercises. I read reviews on Amazon and finally ordered ZAK Energize as my first natural deodorant and started using it for about a month.I am really liking it...I haven&#x27;t developed any itching/irritations/rashes. And it does the job of keeping away the BO from sweat.   I noticed a few people commenting on the smell. It does smell different than the off the shelf products that have a strong scent. Keep in mind that this is a natural deodorant and cannot be expected to smell like Axe or Old Spice. Having said that, I like its natural smell that is not over the top, it is just different. The stick is very dry, I wish it were a little soft, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love this product so far. I think I have finally found my favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> Works really well and smells great.  One stick has also lasted a surprisingly long amount of time.  Definitely the best value for money I can find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Zak deodorant for nearly three weeks now and I love it. It is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I have searched for so long without success until now. The deodorant lasts for 24 hours plus. I feel very confident each day that I wear it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! With energize I have finally found a happy alternative to the deoderants with aluminum and other natural deoderants that just aren’t quite effective. I have previously had issues with other natural deoderants because they give me irritations and rashes. Zak’s works for me all the time. As a college student I am always running around and trying to go from class to class and Zak’s can keep up with me and keep me fresh, even after hot yoga and long runs. I have already recommended this product to all my friends and can’t wait for Zak detox to expand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This deodorant performs awesome! I&#x27;m a 30-something female and I had been using deodorant free of aluminum for some time. I really liked Tom&#x27;s of Maine until I couldn&#x27;t find the apricot scented one anymore-which worked ok because I guess it meshed well with my own body odor, but wasn&#x27;t perfect. I&#x27;ve read a lot about the potential dangers of parabens and was dismayed to read paraben contents on Tom&#x27;s label. I switched to Jason brand deodorant that did not contain parabens or aluminum but it also DID NOT smell pleasant when my own after a couple hours of wearing it. This was NOT OK because I work in the dental field and am constantly working in close proximity to patients. I found Zak on Amazon and was intrigued by the reviews. My only concern was that it is made for men and was unsure which scent to buy...it doesn&#x27;t really explain the scents on the site. So I bought the Energize scent. It came promptly! On my first use I was a little put off by the smell...it is a pine-y scent that I didn&#x27;t love at first but have grown to like it. The consistency is a little dry and it took a few days for me to get used to how to apply it. But now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it (it&#x27;s not your average OTC deodorant)...I LOVE IT. I got the hang of applying it. It keeps me dry and fresh for at least 24 hours. And it has yet to rub off on clothing. WORTH EVERY PENNY. And I feel better knowing that I&#x27;m not putting toxic chemicals in my pits. I might try the other scent next time just to see what it&#x27;s like, but the Energize isn&#x27;t bad! Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I feel safe using this product and love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About five years ago, I became very interested in my health and stopped using the more commercially available deodorants. I didn&#x27;t feel that the added chemicals were good for my long term neurological function. I tried one &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant but wasn&#x27;t impressed - it didn&#x27;t apply well, nor did it smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago, a friend recommended that I check out this product. I felt good about the ingredients list, so decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I did. The product applies evenly, just like you&#x27;d expect from a stick, and has a very refreshing scent. I actually purchased two - one for my gym / yoga bag, and one for my home bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product, hard to believe it doesn&#x27;t have any of those harmful chemicals in it, as it smells even better than other deodorants and seems to last longer with no irritation.  Obviously it&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but it&#x27;s nice knowing that you just might be adding some years to your life not adding these chemicals to your body.  I thought it would be a clear roll-on, and although it&#x27;s somewhat of a solid, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue as every other solid I&#x27;ve ever tried does.</li>
    <li> did not apply easily and noticed it turned my skin red after i used it a few times.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for a good, natural deodorant. But the few products that are on the market either don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t smell too great. Look no further. Zak smells fantastic (only tried the Energize) and keeps me from stinking up the place on warm days or if don&#x27;t take a shower immediately after I exercise. Great product, will buy again</li>
    <li> Zak Detox Deoderant is by far the BEST all natural  deoderant that I have ever used...and I have tried many. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t ever feel sticky. It gives me long lasting protection but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue when I shower the next morning. I just love that I am using healthy, natural and healing ingredients on my skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Pretty decent deordorant. It smells like Rosemary &amp; wood like. When u apply it for the first time,it will feel rough but you&#x27;ll get use to it. The scent will last pretty long and you don&#x27;t really feel the sweat at all. so far,this is the best deordorant I bought so far. $15 is probably too much but despite what ur getting from it,it&#x27;s kinda&lt;br /&gt;Worth it tbh.</li>
    <li> I received this product quickly. I was impressed by the ingredients and the fragrance, while strong at first does not seem that strong once applied. It isn&#x27;t exactly a smooth application but it really is a 24 hour product! I&#x27;ve used natural deodorants before (like Tom&#x27;s) and have found that it only lasts for 4-6 hours. With Zak&#x27;s, I just have to apply once and forget about it for the rest of the day! And it&#x27;s comforting to know that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
    <li> If you have had a difficult time finding a natural deodorant give Zak a try. I have tried several products and none of them have come close to the success I have had with this one. Even though it is not an antipersprent I find that I sweat less. The product goes on dry and does not leave any residue on clothing. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative from the conventional aluminum based protection.</li>
    <li> This is the best all natural deodorant I have ever tried and I have tried a lot! A lot of natural deodorants stop working on odors afrer a week or so. I work in a place where i sweat a lot, and it prevents body odor as well as more mainstream deodorants. I love that it&#x27;s all natural; I feel good about putting it on my body and into the environment.</li>
    <li> Works great, thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, does a good job of deodorizing without any kind of fragrance. It is very thick though, noticeable when you put it on.</li>
    <li> It works very well. No irritation whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. It really covers for 24 hours. I&#x27;ll buy again, again, again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other natural deodorants and they didn&#x27;t work very well. This works for me and lasts.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I applied the deodorant, it has a great smell that. This product also lasts day unlike other natural deodorants. 5 stars, will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have bought this for my husband and he used it for two weeks. He really did not like it because he developed rash in both armpits. It was very very dry, so when he used it it would pull out hair. It was so much hair left on deodorant! It did not prevent him from smelling either. The rash cold been because he is alergic to some ingredient, or just reaction to pulling hair every day. Anyways, we returned it and got refund.</li>
    <li> I have been using natural deodorant for many years now, and Zak&#x27;s detox deodorant is the best out there! I am a licensed esthetician, and have extensive knowledge of what is being used in products. Zak&#x27;s deodorant has all natural, and high quality ingredients only. When you look at the back you can easily read, and identify everything in it! Unlike other natural deodorants Zak&#x27;s has a light and moisturizing texture, that doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. I bought the energizing scent, and love the smell of the natural essential oil blend. I can apply it in the morning and at the end of the night still smell nice and fresh! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about switching to an All Natural Deodorant. After my first use I knew that I had made the right choice. Zak Detox Deodorant makes me feel better about what I am putting on and into my body. It is just as convenient to use as any other deodorant. I was most surprised about the scent. The scent was great and literally lasted 24 hours! I would fully recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this deodorant after reading reviews.  I have been searching for a good smelling and functioning natural deodorant.  This is not it. It does smell nice upon application.  The stick is very hard though and feels as though you are somewhat scraping your delicate arm pits to apply.  Unfortunately it lasts all of an hour and then I have a horrible (worse than not applying anything) smell coming from my arm pits.  Like don&#x27;t raise your arms because someone might be knocked over bad.  I&#x27;m going back to Tom&#x27;s of Maine and renewing my search for better deodorant.</li>
    <li> After reading these reviews thought I had finally found a good natural deodorant.  Even stuck with it for a week giving it a chance and my body a chance.  This stuff is horrible don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  Not only that they are charging a ridiculous amount of money for a poor product.  Smells like pine tar, and goes on just like it too.  Goes on clumpy and finally after a week the entire bar just crumbled into peices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the 105% money back guarantee as advertised on his website?  After explaining my experience and being very specific asking for my refund, he wouldn&#x27;t answer my question specifically.  I was offered a replacement with an unscented one, and a sample of their new version, as they changed the scent.  Sent another request/email with no response?  Have to now send it back to Amazon now for refund hopefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this deodorant actually gave me the absolute worst body odor I&#x27;ve ever experienced, almost like it had a bad chemical reaction under my arms.  And the next day it leaves this clumpy residue that stains your shirts.  Better off not wearing any deodorant.  This stuff is just some overpriced, over hyped low quality deodorant.  Look elsewhere and don&#x27;t believe these hyped up reviews.  Was given a discount code after purchase for a next order, no thanks.</li>
    <li> Great natural deodorant! Best so far from what I&#x27;ve been trying. I wanted to switch from using standard deodorants typically picked up from Target. I used gels, rollers, clear sticks, white sticks, sprays all from Axe, Mitchum, Tom&#x27;s, Arm &amp; Hammer, and a few others. Didn&#x27;t think much of their ingredients until as of recent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So out went with the shelf stuff and in came my tests with natural deodorants. I bought a spray bottle of natural stuff from Amazon -- it had high reviews, but a liquid spray onto my pits felt awkward. I went back to a stick, trying Tom&#x27;s out this time. Probably a great deodorant if I didn&#x27;t have to apply it again half-way through the day. I work in an office, there&#x27;s very little arm movement or any physical activity that should cause me to perspire. My pits would stink far worse than not having anything on at all! Sure enough, the stick ended up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back on forth on my next selection. I settled with Zak&#x27;s Detox stick because of the reviews. The other products I was looking at required my pits to be wet for proper application (what!?). Another claimed it was aluminum-free, but readers pointed out the ingredient right there on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is it. This is the stick to use. I&#x27;m using Energize, the scent to me smells just fine for a guy. Pits surprisingly stay dry for a natural deodorant, and I haven&#x27;t had any skin reactions to it. I will say that the dispenser edges are a bit sharp. You&#x27;ll need to dispense quite a bit of the stick to keep your pits from scraping against the edges.</li>
    <li> Quality deodorant - works all day and smells a lot better than others I have used.  Highly recommended.</li>
