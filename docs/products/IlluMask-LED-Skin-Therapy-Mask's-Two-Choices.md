      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of the IlluMask so far....</li>

      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Really interesting concepts and worked</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This does not work, waste of money. . .</li>
    <li> It made my face, 10 shades darker!!  I was traumatized and had to see my dermatologist to get a facial!  It was the worse investment I had ever made!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did work with blemishes. But make ur skin little dry though</li>
    <li> I bought this for my18 year old daughter who has tried many things to clear her acne problem, she said it did help the ones she had but didn&#x27;t help preventing new ones.</li>
    <li> Life changing product! I wouldn&#x27;t go a day with out it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of reading before I bought this mask &amp; saw it could be hacked to work beyond the 30 uses so I bought it. I&#x27;m 30 yrs old &amp; have struggled with acne since I was 12. For the last couple years I&#x27;ve had it pretty much under control with birth control &amp; spironolactone (if you haven&#x27;t tried it, it was my life saver. It does take time to work. It blocks aldosterone from binding to your sebaceous glands decreasing oil production ---&amp;#62; no clogged pores ----&amp;#62; no acne) but for some reason this past January my jaw line &amp; chin went out of control. Don&#x27;t know if it was stress or what. Fast forward to the end of March and I still didn&#x27;t have a hold on it so I thought I would give the mask a try. Since I knew I could hack it I used it twice a day to start out, but it was drying out my face. About a week in I saw my dad &amp; he told me my face looked smoother.  I thought it was looking better but him saying that confirmed that it was doing better. I also shoved it under my shirt at night while watching tv for any little break outs there. It worked for me. No more cystic acne around my jaw or chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just did the hack &amp; mine didn&#x27;t work with the ones that I found so I figured I&#x27;d post what worked for me since I bought mine the beginning of April 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Unscrew the two screws on the back of the device. Be careful when you open it to not pull the wires out of where they attach.&lt;br /&gt;2. Take the batteries out and unscrew the 2 screws that holds the plastic piece in place. Once unscrewed replace the batteries &amp; put some tape over it so the don&#x27;t fall out when you flip it over (the batteries must be in place to reset the mask). Underneath it there is a circuit board.&lt;br /&gt;3. Using a piece of copper wire or paper clip touch one end to the LED wire in the bottom right hand corner. Touch the other end to the little TEST copper circle--located on the left of the circuit board.&lt;br /&gt;4. Press the start button while the wire is in place....2 or 3 seconds. The number 30 should then be flashing on the screen (indicates you are in test mode)&lt;br /&gt;5. Move your wire from the TEST button to the RESET button. (use the copper circle above the word RESET, not below).&lt;br /&gt;6. Press the start button again while the wire is in place, and the blinking 30 will stop blinking &amp; you will be good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this jack works for you. I was getting so bummed when the others didn&#x27;t work for me but I just kept playing with it.he number 30 should then be flashing on the screen (indicates you are in test mode)&lt;br /&gt;5. Move your wire from the TEST button to the RESET button. (use the copper circle above the word RESET, not below).&lt;br /&gt;6.

    <li> I bought this from walmart and I only use it on occassion when I need to feel light on my face after too much bad weather.  It improves my mood.  With 7 uses left the batteries were low and I replaced them, it was still much dimmer than originally so I bypassed the counter, soldering a wire to do so and when only two of the batteries are in it is as dim as it was when I replaced the batteries before bypassing but with all four in its as bright as new.  My guess is that along with the counter when it gets low they have it switch to drawing power from only two batteries.  This is really shameful on their part, more trash for the landfills. I give it a star because I like the light on my face, but this product is a shining example of whats wrong with modern consumerism.</li>
    <li> I love this product . But I can get it for $29 on the website!!!</li>
    <li> After one week of use i am able to see the difference in my skin! I love this mask, it saved me before my big day!</li>
    <li> Does anyone else feel vertigo after using this?</li>
    <li> I have used this daily for a week and NOTHING no changes what so ever. Seems a little goofy. Then you can only use it 30 times and it is trash. You have to buy this non working mask monthly..... NO THANKS</li>
    <li> I had moderate acne due to hormones but it wasn&#x27;t too bad until I tried the illumask.  It made me break out terribly.  I thought that was normal at first but after a few weeks I looked like I had the chicken pox on my face!  I&#x27;ve never ever had acne that bad.  Within a few days of stopping this product &amp; using neutrogena rapid clear my face began to clear up &amp; after a week of not using the illumask my face is acne free &amp; clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted it to work but unfortunately it did the exact opposite.  I even tried the anti-agong illumask which did nothing as well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Gave this product to my son and is truly worked well!  Really interesting concepts and worked so well I bought the anti-aging version which is subject of another review.</li>
    <li> Love the mask. Both my children are in early puberty. After a visit to the dermatologist she prescribed a product with RetinA. Really?! My kids play outside in the sun. Product was too harsh for their skin. Had tried the IlluMask for AntiAging and loved it. Thought I try the AntiAcne mask for their beginning acne. So far works really well for both children. No complaints from them either. They take their shower and use the mask while watching nightly TV. Thanks for making a no chemical product that works.</li>
    <li> It has only been two days and my acne has greatly improved! I have mild/moderate acne that is mostly triggered by stress. Seeing that I am a graduate student, there isn&#x27;t much way around that. I am currently on a balanced healthy diet and birth control that is known to help with acne, but nothing really stopped the onset of more and more acne. Until now. In just two sessions, most of my small bumps were gone, nodules are shrinking/disappearing and my cysts are no longer inflamed or painful and are much flatter! Overall my face is smoother and softer. I was so amazed by the results that I couldn&#x27;t get with drugstore brands like neutrogena and Clean&amp;Clear, or higher end beauty products like Dr. Dennis Gross or Estée Lauder alone.  My night routine is a daily scrub coupled with a mild, revitalizing cleanser, followed by a 15 minute Illumask session, then wipe of toner, a serum for dark spots, an acne spot treatment, and a moisturizer. I look forward to my progress and hope to keep updating this review with my results!  The mask leaves little indents on the bridge of my nose like regular plastic glasses, but besides that, it is comfortable and easy to relax in. I typically talk on the phone with a headset and my eyes closed during each session. While the light doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes, I find the opening to small to comfortably read or do school work in.  I recall reading reviews and finding a lot of skeptics on the comments. While the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; is questionable, it works so far better than kits I spent $40 on. The product mentions that it probably isn&#x27;t very effective for severe cases of acne, so I would not recommend it if you fall in this category. I have tried the similar Tanda Zap, which uses a blue light only which made my acne worse, and not to mention took about the same amount of time because I had to hold it on several acne lesions--each for two minutes. If Tanda Zap works for you and you have mild acne, you will get more treatments out of the Tanda Zapthan this 30 day Illumask.  I appreciate all the tips and suggestions on resetting the mask and will try in on day 30. If it doesn&#x27;t work, spending $30 a month maybe too steep for my student budget.  I hope this helps! Oh, and there is a 15 session guarantee for all who are willing to try it.  Update 5/26/15 --------------------- After a few months, (and no more birth control--natural vitamins for stress and hormones seem to work better without the side effects and risks) my acne is pretty much clear. Instead of using this everyday, I use it for about a day or two when I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; a nodule under my skin. I have simplified my skin regimen to toning and moisturizing with a weekly clay mask.  The only strange thing was that with 7 sessions left, the timer just cleared out. Waiting to see if it would happen again.  After all this time, would still recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 13 year old and we loved the results.  We have tried benzoyl peroxide, Avon, Mary Kay, Clearasil and other products with mediocre results. I reluctantly bought this product for her after a commercial she saw. I initially told her no,but heart strings were pulled and I ordered it for her. It worked well. Her pimples healed and face looks so much smoother. We are hoping for the dark spots to fade but the results are remarkable for us.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> How many time do you have to use it before your acnes gone ?</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask daily since January and it has reduced my redness and breakouts noticeably. I&#x27;m in my 20s and normally have mild acne / monthly breakouts but since using the mask I&#x27;ve only had 1 or 2 spots in the past 3 months. This is my first time ordering through amazon and everything arrived quickly and in good condition. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using the anti-acne mask for about 2 months now and I am seeing really amazing results, not just in my breakouts but in my overall skin texture and appearance. I like to use the mask at night because it&#x27;s actually really soothing, and helps me to fall asleep. Since the lights inside the mask turn off automatically after each cycle, I usually fall asleep wearing it. I highly highly recommend this mask, it is such a great alternative to using harsh chemicals on your skin!</li>
    <li> Just a big THANK YOU!!!!!!!!. My son had a lot of Acne on his forehead and nose area, I bought everything out there for him, but only made him break out more! Then I saw illu Mask at Walmart, and as hard as it was to get him to remember to do his treatments (boys) his skin has become so much more clear and repaired. It so great to see my son with his healthy skin coming back with each use , THANK YOU!!! And I know in time he will be happy that mom drove him crazy about doing his treatments! THANKS AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A very happy customer!! Jacqueline</li>
    <li> There are only 19 days left when I open the box. Don&#x27;t know why. The mask is very dirty. Looks like a used mask.</li>
    <li> This helped my complexion somewhat. Not a great improvement. It is hoped that it works better for others.</li>
    <li> Ok! I have cystic acne. If you do also you know how embarrassing it can be. Never had acne as a teen but when I hit my thirties &amp;#34;bam&amp;#34;. Adult acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Spirlacitone, every topical, not to mention every anti-acne sold at sephora. Last resort was Accutane. Horriable. The side effects internal and external were so bad. And again results were minimal. I only made it three months and threw in the towel. Feeling embarrassed and self conscious I decided to get this. Not having high hopes I gave it a go. Twice a day for the first week. The results are better then anything I could have imagined. The acne is going away. Im blown away. I all started to use acne free sever in conjunction with the mask. I don&#x27;t know if its the combo but I know the mask it is a very big part to my skin finally starting to clear. I know the fact that you can only use it for thirty times seems expensive and limited. I saw a life hack on YouTube on how to fix it so it will be unlimited. I&#x27;ll try and post about if it works. If not I will repurchase. Give it a try. It&#x27;s worked wonders for skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the mask for a week now. I&#x27;m using it daily per the instructions, &amp; so far I can already see a positive difference. It says it generally takes 2 weeks to notice improvement, so I hope it continues. And, as far as the reviews are concerned that are putting other reviews under a microscope, I think those people should find better use of their time. I shop regularly on Amazon, &amp; I get emails asking for my opinion of products I&#x27;ve purchased. I try to get to as many as possible with honest reviews, especially if they stand out one way or the other. So, I&#x27;d be quite resentful of someone who made the suggestion that a review of mine is staged in any way....if that EVER happens, that person will most certainly hear directly from me. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of the IlluMask so far....I&#x27;ve been looking forward to my 15 min each day, excited at the prospect of having clear skin with less dependance on harsh,irritating medications.</li>
    <li> My son loves his illuMask.  We purchased the Acne Mask from Target and in less than 20 days his face has completely cleared up by only washing his face and using the mask for 15 minutes a day.  His confidence is up and he gets compliments from his classmates about how his face has cleared up.  I highly recommend this product to any person who has acne and wants a clean efficient experience without use of chemicals.</li>
    <li> If you get acne, you want to use this.  I use it with Retin-A and get great results.</li>
    <li> I just read that this thing shuts off completely after 30 uses...I had to shut it off three times so far because of life happening and not being able to finish my session...so I have 27 uses left without using it once...RIP OFF</li>
    <li> Ok im 32 and still have issues with acne! Soo embarassing!! I was super skeptical ahen i purchased this, im sick of creams that dont quite work how they say they will so i bought the acne illumask and the acne scars from peior breakouts have evened out my skin tone and i have NO MORE black heads or white heads since using it ONLY 7 times!!! Im acne free!!!! You get a total of 30 sessions of light therapy at 15mins a session, after using it for 1 week the results are speechless!!! BEST home light therapy product EVER!!! Try it you WILL LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I did not find benefit from using. Never used all the sessions on the mask. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This did nothing to improve my skin. I would recommend other products for sure! I would rate it 0 stars if I could!!! I&#x27;m not happy with it at all! The product needs work! Save your money!</li>
    <li> There is a &amp;#34;30 time limit&amp;#34; that locks you out of a product you paid for! Save yourself some money and open the mask. You can easily bypass the circuit which locks you out of the product you paid for. For more info on how google illumask and hackaday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with hormonal acne as an adult and frustrated beyond belief.  My skin is dry and sensitive and most of the acne medications dried it out more making a bad situation even worse.  I used the Acne illuMask and found that my breakouts started to clear much faster.  My acne is more cyclical - I know that I&#x27;m going to break out around the time Aunt Flo comes for a visit.  I use it 2x a day for the week before and then scale back to every other day after that.  I don&#x27;t have any of the redness or irritation that I had from the other acne treatments.  My skin finally feels back to normal. Thank you for making something so advanced so affordable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Target not on Amazon. I saw it on TV and when I was at the store I bought it on a whim. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin. I&#x27;m a 29 year old female with a few sun lines. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything amazing to happen when I used it but I thought at least I would see smoother skin or diminished lines. NOTHING! I don&#x27;t have acne but once in a while I&#x27;ll get a pimple here and there. It did not work. I should have suspected that if it sounds to good to be true it probably is.</li>
    <li> The only thing that worked for my teenaged son! We have tried all the brands of face washes including proactive and this plus apple cider vinegar work like a charm. He looks like a different person!</li>
    <li> I didnt realize it had a limited number of uses</li>
    <li> I have seen a big difference in my daughter&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> notice a very slight difference in skin after using...not impressed</li>
    <li> Been using it for 5 days &amp; already I see an improvement in fine lines around my eyes &amp; lips and a smoother, more even skin tone.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what the entire 30 days will reveal.</li>
    <li> This has really worked wonders on my skin. The first two weeks I felt all of the impurities coming to the surface. I was recommended by a friend to buy this so I knew this would happen. On the third week my skin started glowing. After using the light I put Mirta de Perales collagen and WOW...highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The combination of this mask for 15 min a day and serums, is resulting in big improvements. I&#x27;m still getting pimples but the old ones and scars are improving significantly. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I just finished my first month of illuMask and am so happy with the results. I was on Accutane five years ago, but my acne resurfaced this winter. I was hesitant to go back on such a harsh drug, and someone recommended illuMask as a better alternative. The most visible change I&#x27;ve seen is a reduction in the redness and irritation in my skin, and that started within days. I would definitely recommend this mask-it&#x27;s easy to use, fast working, and has no side effects! Great product!</li>
    <li> Used it everyday for 30 days - I took before and after pics of myself so I could accurately assess the difference - this product did not work for me. My mild acne and all of my skin looked the same after 30 days as it did before the 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, I had no problems turning the item on and had no problems with dimming lights like some reviews have stated. I would have been very happy with this product if it had only made my acne better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use this product, I recommend checking Walmart - I bought mine there and paid half of what they are asking here...</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with how my skin looks after using this mask for only 2 weeks. My acne has cleared up and has not returned. Finally an easy product that helps clear up acne without using tons of creams and acids. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from acne.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 14 yr old, that has been plagued by Acne. Previously we had tried the ProActiv system, and many other costly cleansers and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very skeptical about this silly looking mask, but thought what the heck, at $30 we could try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been using it 2x a day, morning and night (she has lots of redness, no nodules, just loads of pimples)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has only been using it for 3 days, and by day 2 all the redness was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day three her face is less &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $1 a day, it is the cheapest treatment we have ever tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she washes her face with the clearisil system, really mild cleanser. No more harsh chemicals, and we are seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see it in a month!</li>
    <li> I can really see a difference in my skin. I happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ant-Aging one for about 3-weeks now and love it! My skin looks and feels so much better.  I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s so I have started to notice fine lines but it was the improvement in the texture of my skin that I really saw a HUGE difference in.  I am sold on this! I see that people are posting stuff on how to hack this thing to get more uses but I think I will just buy a new one in another week. I read on the manufactures website that the counter is set to 30 so you are getting the full effectiveness and life of the LED lights working properly NOT THE BATTERIES!</li>
    <li> Too bright - seems to cause discomfort due to brightness. Also only good for 30 uses ( 1 month).&lt;br /&gt;Proactive is cheaper.</li>
    <li> It keeps me still for 15 mins. haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.</li>
    <li> Usually nothing works for my acne, and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of everything completely, it has evened my skin tone by reducing redness and blemishes. I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money, because this product states that it can only be used for 30 sessions then it&#x27;s no good. For almost $60 it should be working all the time. Not happy with it so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for my cystic and hormonal acne</li>
    <li> This is really working for me. I get cysts once a month and instead of them staying for over a week, they go away in a few days. My skin tone is also evening out. I would give it 5 stars but I did not know that it only has 30 uses and then you throw it away.. for such a device to just throw away is not appealing. However I use everyday if I feel a breakout occuring and every other if im pretty clear</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask for a month now and I absolutely love it. Not only have I noticed results, but overall my skin feels better. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from any type of acne!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I purchased it and have had great success with it. I would highly recommended for others.</li>
    <li> The only thing that has helped me including doctors</li>
    <li> I prefer the mask with both red and blue light much more effective</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but just arrived, looks like the advertisement that got me to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the IlluMask for two weeks and I seem to see a difference in the texture of my skin.  I&#x27;m a hairstylist and my clients are noticing a change in my skin...they say there is a glow and an all around healthy look. I will continue to use this product if it makes such a difference in the way I look.Better than buying so many wrinkle creams that don&#x27;t do what they promise.</li>
    <li> at first i thought i&#x27;d be inflicting UV rays on my already sun beaten skin but it&#x27;s not the case. i found it actually moisturizes my skin. I&#x27;m a few months in. I signed up for their auto delivery of sessions because i&#x27;ve been using it twice a day. i feel like the more I use it the faster it&#x27;s healing my adult acne prone skin. the frosting on the cake is that I now have found time to meditate because it forces me to sit still for 15 min a day. love it!!! see I even decorated mine. the box came with stickers. fun!!!</li>
    <li> This mask is supposed to give 30 treatments but it&#x27;s not going to happen.  The first treatment went fine.  Tried to start the second treatment and it took the counter down to 26 before it would come on so I lost 3 treatments.  The instructions say hold down the button for one second and the red led&#x27;s will light up. Pressing the button for 1 second, 1/2 second, 3 seconds or 10 seconds did no good. After loosing the 3 treatments the lights finally activated.  For the next treatment, the counter went down to 21 before it would come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK now I&#x27;ve done three treatments and my counter is at 21.  The instruction say it will last for 30 treatments only.  At the rate this thing works, I will be luck to get 10 or 12 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment as to the effectiveness of the mask but if I get the 10 treatments, it will probably not be enough so I might give a fair assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing at best.</li>
    <li> Was not described very well that you have to replace the power supply after so many uses</li>
    <li> I have had moderately acne-prone skin (both hormonal and genetic) for the last 13 years and I&#x27;ve tried every product except Acctuane and every home remedy to stay clear. Thus I&#x27;m a skeptic but since I&#x27;d never tried anything like this and the number of negative reviews greatly outweighed the positive, I took a leap of faith. Before using this, my skin was in good shape. I just had some mild hyperpigmentation and would get a new, usually small pimple every few days to a week which was phenomenal for me. The first two nights of this mask, I was using it before applying my prescription (something similar to Retin-A, I don&#x27;t remember the name of it). Overnight my skin had broken out in tiny bumps all around my mouth and along my jawline, dry and peeling like nobody&#x27;s business. On the third night I stopped using my prescription. The dryness and peeling subsided but I was still breaking out although less. After 6 days however, my skin was more clear and smoothed out but there were still some pimples popping up here and there (still more than there were before I started using the mask). Today I am just a few days short of having used this mask for 2 weeks and last night when I looked at my skin, my hyperpigmentation looked worse than before due to the breakout from the previous week. Not only that but my skin just looked dull, and I was I was fighting to hang on and keep the breakouts to a minimum. I don&#x27;t know if what I experienced was purging but I wasn&#x27;t going to roll dice for another two weeks. I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me but at least I won&#x27;t be shelling out $30 a month and relying on this mask forever. It was also a little irritating to the eyes although they say you can leave your eyes open during the treatment.</li>
    <li> On my skin this device does not work at all. My skin is oily (mainly on T-zone) and with mild pimples, blackheads and acne.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions very carefully but it was not worthy at all.</li>
    <li> I only used this for about two weeks, it had absolutely no effect on me in that time, I used it as instructed everyday and if anything my skin is worse!</li>
    <li> so far i think this product actually works. i&#x27;ve had mild to moderate hormonal acne since i was 12. i&#x27;m 9 sessions in and my hormonal acne has cleared up quite a bit. compared to last week, my skin has no new breakouts this week. also, i feel that it did a good job of getting rid of some of the acne spots i actually had. i also use acnefree as my baseline skin care. im glad the product is honest in that it is recommended to be used with your routine acne care. so far, i like the results. i think it&#x27;s a great buy for the price and results it offers.</li>
    <li> It may work for some, but not all. This product has potential, but I don&#x27;t think it is there yet. I cannot recommend this, maybe it takes more than 30 days to see the best results.</li>
    <li> Although I am an avid Amazon shopper, I purchased this locally in store.  As of today, I&#x27;ve been using this &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; for two weeks, and what can I say?  I love this product!  First, the cost for me is $1 a treatment.  What a deal! Super easy to use.  After almost two weeks&#x27; use (tonight will be the 14th treatment) I can see a difference in my skin.  I always take good care of my skin and have  a daily routine.  This is now part of it.  My skin seems to be &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.  I even noticed my skin tone improved.  The best part? Friends noticed too!  A few asked what products I am using.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use.  A the end of the day, I wash my face, lay down in bed, play soft music and put on the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;.  I think as with any skin care routine, consistency is key, no problem for me here, I wait each day till the evening so I can have my 15 minute treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Wil post another review at the 2 month mark.  So far could not be happier!</li>
    <li> Please Please Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> The product works!! The only downside is it does not cover the nose area or the very top of forehead .... Purchased for both teenage granddaughters and cleared their skin up but you can see line where no light... Really good product</li>
    <li> Actually broke me out. May work for others but not me. I think it&#x27;s the few red lights on the device that could be the problem. I have a different blue-light device and it works wonders. I&#x27;ll stick with the Tanda. This was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I have used the Anti Aging mask for 3 months.  This is so easy to use, no pain and RESULTS!!  I noticed after the third day a huge improvement in my overall skin tone.  I have several dark spots from taking hormone medication that have not improved even after several peels and laser treatments, that were much more expensive!  I love this product! Additionally I had a aging line around my mouth that is almost gone!  It is a great deal at this price.  I have spent more than this on just one facial or laser treatment.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought! Love this mask!</li>
    <li> I have twin boys who struggle with mild acne- especially during the winter months!  This mask was easy to use for them and it worked great!  Their skin was noticeably clearer in 7 days.  After 2 weeks one stopped using it and the other continued and the difference was very noticeable! Good way to test out the product.  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Did not work.  What is not made clear when purchasing is this products battery is only good for 30 uses. Returning.</li>
    <li> I usually have so many problem areas in the summer from make up. I have been using this after every time I wear make up (not often because of my skin) but it has seriously changed my life. It&#x27;s so easy to use and so inexpensive! I also love that you don&#x27;t have to buy a new mask every time just buy the charger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note my skin is noticeably more taught too!</li>
    <li> only thing that has helped my daughter&#x27;s acne!!</li>
    <li> ...and the Board Certified cosmetic plastic surgeon, Paul Lorenc, who helped develop UlluMask is a genius as well. So make no mistake, this is an effective quality product that just happens to be very affordable. What a terrific combination!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with moderate acne for about 15 years; I have tried everything over the counter you could imagine, and have also visited a dermatologist. I have been using the Illumask for about 3 mos. Nothing has cleared my skin like this product. My skin is smoother, more radiant, and even my mom was wondering what I have been using because she noticed a big improvement in my skin. This product has truly changed my life because now my acne has cleared to the point where I don&#x27;t even have to use any makeup and  I feel confident.</li>
    <li> I believe this works. I&#x27;ve tried it 4-5 times when I saw a pimple coming on and they always went away. I don&#x27;t need it every day and find that 1-3 sessions (one per day) can clear up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is nothing uncomfortable about the actual treatment, the mask can make me very claustrophobic. The 15 minutes seems to last forever. It gets a little hot in there but a fan nearby helps enough to get me through it.</li>
    <li> did not work for my face. It does calm the face down ~redness and irritation and is very relaxing but does not work on stopping acne. what a &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34;! It only works 30 times. **if you happen to push the button, it stops and you lose your session. That is for sure a bad feature, but a nice catch for them.</li>
    <li> I have been an Esthetician for 15 years and I am always looking for \\&quot;that great new product\\&quot;. I am now on my 4th day of using the anti-aging IlluMask and I am loving the results. I have noticed that my skin feels and looks firmer,my pores are smaller and there is a glow to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is so easy to use and is foal proof. It keeps track of the days for you and it turns itself off when the 15 min is up.&lt;br /&gt;I am loving the mask and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Finally an acne product that actually works!! After suffering from adult acne for over 15 yrs and trying every thing from antibiotics to chemical peels, I&#x27;m having fantastic results from the mask. I use the mask every night before bed and have hardly any breakouts. Very impressed with the Illumask:))</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s terrific!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the anti acne one for my teenage grandsons ( actually bought 2...one for each) and they sort of made fun of me.&lt;br /&gt;Because they had them, they tried it out and were surprised at how effective the mask is. Each boy reported a reduction in breakout and redness, and apologized for laughing at me!!  They are now using them regularly and asked if they need another would I treat them!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll be my pleasure!!</li>
    <li> I am not inflating reviews lol just actually really like this product.  I am a skin care professional and really love the results and ease that light therapy gives.  Its painless and there are not safety risks.  Yes if you have seizures I would not use this but hopefully someone would be smart enough to know this product is isn&#x27;t a good idea if they are prone to seizures.  What is great about these LED light therapy for acne/blackheads is it kills the bacteria, and promotes the HEALING of any blemishes that have been picked at, cause everyones done it.  It definitely speeds up the healing process and shrinks blackheads which is huge.  I agree it stinks this product can only be used 30 times and its a lot of plastic but its so easy to use and covers the entire face.  Normal led treatments cost upwards of 100$ and it needs to be used regularly to be effective.  This product works for mild/moderate acne.  I have seen significant improvement in only a few days</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this mask. I am truly a sceptic when it comes to skin care products that promise great things but after reading some reviews in other publications, I decided to order the mask for my son and daughter (ages 16 and 14). They both have moderate acne and both have redness and some irritation. Within the first 7-10 uses I started to see a very noticeable improvement. Their skin had fewer blemishes and an overall less &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; appearance. I will admit they have to be nudged and reminded to use it but my son wears his while playing xbox.  They don&#x27;t like to admit it but I think they both have noticed the improvement and it has definitely boosted their self-esteem and confidence. My daughter even leaves for school without bothering with foundation or make up...a true Christmas miracle.  I recently purchased the anti-aging version for myself and plan to start using it in the New Year. Fingers crossed that the benefits are as great!!!</li>
    <li> Beginning to think people leaving positive comments are people that work for the company. Looked at positive reviews so thought I would give it a try. Did not help my acne at all. The light also irritated my eyes and at first I thought I was going blind. My skin looked a little rested but dont know if that was a placebo effect. After 30 days, I still have acne. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mask for the (4) days now and I have notice great results so far.  After I turned 40, I started noticing fine lines appear under my eyes and cheeks and a little loss of firmness.  I&#x27;ve tried high end creams and serums for the past few years but nothing has seemed to work, so I thought I would give this a try.  I started using the mask (4) days ago and WOW what an improvement.  I&#x27;ve noticed the &amp;#34;crisscross lines on the tops of cheeks have visibly softened and the lines under my eyes are improving as well.  My overall skin tone is smoother and a bit firmer. I wasn&#x27;t expecting results so soon but after seeing such a great improvement in such a short period of time, I decided to write a review.  It was easy to use, comfortable fit and most importantly, I&#x27;ve noticed lasting results. Better results than with any high-end cream, lotion or serum that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> I started using illuMask shortly after I had face lift surgery.  It immediately helped with the process of healing bruises and suture lines.  Now after several weeks of use I see improvement in the texture of my skin.  It’s easy and relaxing to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin tone.  The product claims that it will reduce the appearance of fine lines.  Does that mean that the fine lines are still there and they just appear less?  In any case I appreciate the revue by Dr. Ali Fant that includes instructions for resetting the counter.  I did just that and will give it another 30 days.  Just in case it works.</li>
    <li> This mask only works for 30 15-minutes sessions, after that you toss it.  Would never have bought it for my son had I realized that.</li>
    <li> The  reason i brought  this item because have acne problems am hoping this mask will help.</li>
    <li> I give this 2 stars because of the cost and safety. I have seen an improvement of my acne since the start of the treatment, but I am not sure if i can give full credit to the mask. I bought this item at target for $30.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type- I am 23, I have had an acne problem ever since I was a teenager. I would always have a few pimple here and there but recently my face broke out really bad and nothing seemed to help the problem disappear. Throughout the year&#x27;s I have tried multiple products but none seemed to help so when I saw a commercial for this product I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try one more thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost- not bad compared to the price of other acne solutions. Except, this product is very misleading. You can only use the mask 30 times, when I bought this I had no idea about this problem, as it is no shown anywhere on the box. As the other reviews point out once you use up the 30 uses you have to throw away the entire mask and buy a new one. When I bought the mask, I saw on the istructions that you could buy refills from their website, I assumed this was for a cheaper price, but no you have to pay the full price again. Obviously the mask can operate well beyond the 30 days, but this is just the company being greedy to make more money. However, I did find a lot of reviews that say you  can manually reset the mask by taking it apart (have not tried this myself). As far as other people claiming the product does not let them use the full 30 uses, I had not problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Safety- They claim that it is safe to use with you eyes open but I do not trust this at all. The mask is VERY bright and I get purple vision when wearing this mask. It seemed as the more times I wore the mask the harder it is to adjust to normal light after you take it off. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes for my eyes to adjust back to normal light after taking it off. I have used the mask a few times with my eyes closed for the whole session and this doeshelp with the effects, but the mask is so bright that it still effects the eyes when they are closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness - I have seen an improvement with my face but I cannot completely credit the mask for this as I have been using neutrageona acne spot treatment with this as well. My face has not magically &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34; either, my face has almost returned back to normal (as I said previously this means a few pimples here and there, it is just not as bad). So, if you buy this mask hoping to have a completely clear face, this is not the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the mask. I would not discourage any one from trying this mask for themselves, but I feel like they should be warned that it does only last for 30 uses and to be careful with their eyes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a walmart for $30. I was skeptical, but OMG it works great. I do 2 sessions at a time, even if im not broken out. I wouldnt suggest the 2 sessions if you dont know how to take it apart and reset it or youre wasting your money. I have noticed a more even skintone and issues ive had with oil literally seeping out my pores are gone! I dont use chemical acne medications like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid because they have never worked or made a difference in my acne, but using this mask and tea tree oil have completely cleared my skin. I never got acne in my life until my early 20s, so to have it so severely was devastating to my self esteem. i tried so many products, diets and medications, wasting hundreds of dollars on things that didnt work. Im glad i found something that does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just to be sure, i used this product for 4 months before posting my review.</li>
    <li> ✔ Price&lt;br /&gt;The price I purchased this for was $32.50 (including tax) at Walmart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Battery&lt;br /&gt;The battery only lasts for 30 days which is the amount of time the company claims it takes to clear your ace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Review&lt;br /&gt;When I first purchased the mask, it came in an easy to open box that was opened with a simple cut of tape. I washed my face, and then used the mask for 15 minutes (the timer is automatic for each treatment) but what I didn&#x27;t like about the mask was that the lights hurt my eyes even with the glasses it came with built into the mask. It took around 25-45 minutes for my eyes to readjust back to normal which isn&#x27;t good for my eyes nor anyone else&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I used the mask for 30 days as the directions directed me to use the mask, but there wasn&#x27;t any results. I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but just some minor acne that came with puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product due to the way it made my eyes feel every time and it didn&#x27;t make my acne any better even after the 30 days</li>
    <li> works great for Grovers Disease.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!! My skin looks radiant. People have commented on how beautiful my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this off of Amazon. I purchased a week ago  from my local CVS. After my second use, I noticed strange \\&quot;dots\\&quot; on my skin. It was like burn marks in the shape of dots on my skin, and then I realized that the areas where the dots were coincided with the lights on the mask. Every place on the mask where there was a light, it was a dark spot on my skin. I have not used the mask since. I would not recommend for dark ethnic skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional clarification of what I mean when I say dark ethnic skin, I am in the range of complexion of Oprah Winfrey or Gabrielle Union. My MAC foundation color is NW45 and my ERA airbrush makeup color is R9. I hope that helps. The dots did go away after about 2 days.</li>
    <li> My son has had moderate acne for the last few years.  He is allergic to benzoyl peroxide so our options for treatment were limited.  We noticed that his skin was a lot better when he was training for cross country.  We thought it had to do with not drinking sodas but after the great results from the illumask, we think it might have actually been the sun!  I looked at several youtube reviews before trying this product and they all seemed favorable enough to give it a try.  His skin started to look better within a few treatments.  After two weeks he was nearly acne free.  We are so happy with the results and I have been recommending it to any of my friends with kids who also could benefit from this product.  I love it so much that I am going to try out the anti-aging illumask to see if it even my skin out like it says it will!</li>
    <li> 1st use by son used up 1 use. After 29 he announce to me tonight it has to be thrown out. Still on 1st set of &amp;#34; our&amp;#34; batteries.  Saw some improvement.  Albeit he also took a concerted effort in skin washing that previously he avoided.  Well it worked to get him to wash regular, take antibiotic as prescribed, so in that respect , yes it worked.  Who the H throws out a working item?  Please do not feed the greed of marketers. Mir it worked well, wouldn&#x27;t every one with pimples want it?  So getting me to purchase 12 a year or 100 kids at the school buying once us not good economicsk just short sighted greed.  Will not repurchase.  Should come with a disclaimer on online ad to alert public, then at least if you buy it you can beware, like any Over prized service or product.</li>
    <li> The fact that people are giving this one star only because there&#x27;s 30 uses out of it is ridiculous. If you do your research, you&#x27;ll know that&#x27;s the case and that there is a simple way to hack it so it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is only my third day using this product and I can already see results. It feels warm and it only takes fifteen minutes. It&#x27;s actually very relaxing! As the product explicitly days on the packaging, it&#x27;s not for severe acne, only mild to moderate. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> After using this for almost 30 days I&#x27;m kind of disappointed. My skin does feel softer but I still continue to have mild acne. In fact I would say I broke out even more on my jaw line and under my chin...where the light doesn&#x27;t reach. It&#x27;s almost as if all the bacteria went there to hide from the light..weird I know. One good thing that came from this experience was that I discovered the Sirius Pulsar light pen which uses heat and blue light and really did work to shrink the acne I got on my jaw line. I bought my Illumask from Ultra for $30 which is much cheaper then Amazon. I am not giving up hope just yet. I ordered the anti-aging one to see if that helps at all. I am a long time sufferer of mild acne so I was really hoping this would work. I also feel a little deceived by the clinical trials that are advertised because it was just 30 people and a few of those didn&#x27;t even finish the trial.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic about this product before I started using it. My mom purchased it for me on extreme clearance from our local drugstore, thinking that there wouldn&#x27;t be any harm in giving it a shot. Thank you Mom!!!! Some backstory: I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and have had moderate/severe acne since about age 12. I&#x27;ve seen countless dermatologists, estheticians, etc., and most have told me that acne might just be something I&#x27;m stuck with for the rest of my life. For about the last year, most of my breakouts have been cystic, below the surface and concentrated along my cheeks/jawline (hormonal). I also have severe redness and hyperpigmentation from years of breakouts. It sounds crazy, but I noticed a change in my skin after the first use of this mask. I woke up the next morning with several whiteheads, something that is typically unusual for me, as if my skin was suddenly forcing the acne to the surface. Over the next few days, the breakouts kept appearing on the surface rather than the usual deep cystic breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about a month now and I still get daily breakouts, but the severity and type of acne has improved dramatically. New pimples heal (on their own) within a day or two, and my makeup goes on more smoothly and evenly.  I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars and have tried everything in the past (prescription creams, laser treatments, facials, chemical peels, antibiotics, BC pills, vitamins, diet adjustments), but nothing has ever worked this well or this quickly for my skin. I really noticed a difference when I stopped using the mask for about 4 days during a weekend away. I didn&#x27;t necessarily experience an increase in breakouts, but when I started using the mask again, my skin went through a crazy &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; period and then drastically cleared up, just like it did when I first started using the mask. My esthetician, whom I see on a bi-weekly/monthly basis, saw my skin two weeks after I started using the mask and said &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; before sheeven knew what I was up to. My only worry is that my skin has a bad habit of plateauing when I use a product for too long, but since this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m topically applying, I hope that won&#x27;t be the case. I hate being wasteful, so I tried the reset trick and I was successful, but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a new mask if necessary. I&#x27;d love it if the company made a longer-lasting device, even if it was at a higher price point. I won&#x27;t ever be without this as long as it keeps working for me.</li>
    <li> so far it is ok but I also think when using this you have to maintain a good diet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day for a couple of weeks. Seems to be improving my skin. Very relaxing &amp; comfortable.</li>
    <li> So every 30 days you have to spend $30 on a another mask. Over a year that is 12 masks plus packaging going into the landfill. This mask is a waste of money. I purchased mine and did not see any results. Just a scam to make money off of people suffering with acne. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First off. I do like this mask. I did see an improvement in my skin tone and a reduction in breakouts. And it actually helped me fall asleep. I gave it one star because of it&#x27;s 30 use limit. Shame on them for creating a product like this that will end up in our landfills after one month of use! If I purchased a new one of these every month that&#x27;s 12 of these per year, just for one person! Why is it that every product produced these days is designed to break quickly or become outdated in a short amount of time. I would gladly pay more for a product that would last and possibly have to just replace bulbs occasionally. Disappointed and annoyed!</li>
    <li> Beware!!! First you only get 30 treatments, maybe,  If you turn it on and off to make sure it works, you have lost a treatment.  If your 30 minute session is interrupted, you have no way to pause.  You lose your treatment.  This is a rip-off.  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this review 2/5 stars because it felt good while using it.  However, I no longer have any eyeballs, nose, or mouth.  Just a plain face.  This side effect was not listed under the product details.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a family member who is using it with a good deal of satisfaction</li>
    <li> Caused my face to break out worse than before.  Instead of small minimal blemishes that would disappear in a couple of days I ended up with humongous painful cyst like bumps that took forever to shrink and go away.  Very disappointed,  but at least my face is getting back to normal after two weeks of not using this anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought my mask in the Ulta store. I wanted the red led anti-aging version but they only had the acne mask which has both red and blue leds. I paid $26 there with an in-store coupon you can find online ($29.99 + tax normal price). I bought this mask with the full intention of resetting it after 30 days so I can continue using it. There is no reason why you can&#x27;t use this mask afterwards. The LEDs in the mask might eventually get dimmer or burn out though but that shouldn&#x27;t be after 30 uses. I would use fresh batteries after each reset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am 10 days into this treatment and I don&#x27;t see any noticeable results. I still have black heads on my nose, old acne scars, and uneven bumps near my chin (where the light doesn&#x27;t reach). The worst part about this mask is while wearing it, I find it difficult to breathe behind the mask. It also messes up my vision. After taking the mask off, things look green tinted for 10 minutes. I&#x27;m not sure this is good for your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to leave 3 stars for now, will update at the end of 30 treatments with final verdict on whether this thing actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I returned this mask. Doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Wal-Mart for $30. I&#x27;m a little surprised at how well considering I haven&#x27;t had much luck with most products. My skin has cleared up significantly and it&#x27;s only been a week. My skin looks smoother and I&#x27;ve even noticed my dark spots looking lighter. I have very oily skin and suffer from moderate acne. I&#x27;m in my late twenties. I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I wish I could use as directed, I&#x27;m terrible at that. I do have to say that my skin felt tighter after using. I dont understand the 30 day cut off.</li>
    <li> My skin recently went crazy and stopped responding to what I was using. Using the combo of this and the Peter Thomas Roth sulfur mask I&#x27;m seeing insane results. Mind you I&#x27;m only 5 sessions in. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Rave about it to everyone! Best thing to happen to my skin!</li>
    <li> IlluMask Light Therapy - Dr. Ali Fant, WB5WAF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearful of a company lawsuit for my honest remarks, I have deleted my review.roduct to cease working after 30 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theory behind LED light therapy.  Blue LEDs (wavelength 405-470 nanometers) are supposed to destroy acne-causing bacteria. Green LEDs (wavelength 470-550 nanometer) had no recorded therapeutic effects. Red LEDs (wavelenght 620-660 nanometer) are supposed to improve blood circulation with improved skin elasticity because of a strong bio-resonance DNA effect. Near-Infrared LEDs (wavelength 700-1000 nanometer) showed deeper penetration depths. Greatest skin penetration depth was with approximately 870 nanometer with a depth of approximately 5 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wavelengths of 670-690 nanometer is best for simulating new hair growth with the possibility of regrowing hair follicles dormant for up to 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that LED light therapy may be beneficial with longer sessions and/or great light intensities (more LEDs). If you want to experiment, LEDs are available for cheap on Amazon or at your nearest electronic parts store.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with cystic acne around the chin area. Used this product thinking it would get rid of my light acne centered around the nose and chin area. The result was disastrous. After four uses my skin flaked and dried out for two weeks. I had to see a dermatologist because no cream would stop my skin from flaking or turning scaly. It was wretched to walk around with flaking skin or the appearance of soap scum around my mouth. The skin flaked a lot! I had to stop using it and am returning it. The product is not good for those with combination skin. It is not supposed to work for cystic acne as well which I already knew but having flaking skin for two weeks is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Spa treatment at home while you relax in bed! Skin feels so nice even after just one use!</li>
    <li> did not do anything for me</li>
    <li> Needs too much additional stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our 12 year old grand-daughter. She wrote and said that it actually seemed to be working. She will keep us advised. Our older daughter used this type of therapy 30 years ago in a dermatologist&#x27;s office with excellent results. More stars, if more favorable results reported! Per update - redness continues to be gone. Just found out that device can be used only 30 times. She has 2 left. Too bad you can&#x27;t get a price break on future units for the same patient. If they can&#x27;t find a light Dr. In the Detroit area, then we will have to bite the bullett again and maybe several more times.since it is working, I have added a star. I didn&#x27;t notice about the 30 use limit, but would have bought it anyway. Acne is a killer for a young girl&#x27;s self - esteem and all avenues should be explored,</li>
    <li> I have no idea how many treatments are left on my mask because that part quit working.. Other than that I like it..</li>
    <li> Acne creams and facial cleansers irritate and dry out my skin, but this mask does everything it promised!  My breakouts are gone and my skin is smooth!  I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford this kind of therapy at the dermatologist, but the price is right for at home treatment.  Because it takes about 10 minutes a session, I&#x27;ve started a whole morning routine where I take time to be good to my body by stretching and strength training.  It feels like pampering every morning.  :)</li>
    <li> In all honesty, the Anti-Acne mask is not working at all. I really wanted it to, but there is no difference in my zit count, skin texture, pore size, pigmentation, or pretty much anything. I used to have severe, cystic acne that started at age 31. I then went on a course of Accutane when my face was completely carpeted in cysts. I am now 36, and I get about one pimple a week.  There has been no decrease in lesions.  I used the mask daily without missing one day. I am also questioning the validity of some of the rave reviews. I have heard multiple times that the company posts positive reviews for themselves. I do not believe this product works as at all.</li>
    <li> 1. It is only a 30 day treatment, it has a remote with 30 &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; downloading into the remote, so this isn&#x27;t something you can use for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you interrupt your 15 min. treatment time you lose the rest of the treatment, so if you just turn it on when you get it to see how the lights work and stuff you lose a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;3.It is very cheaply made, the white &amp;#34;plate&amp;#34; is like a cheap plastic plate that still has rough edge and semi-sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;4. The glasses that are attached to the Mask are very uncomfortable, the rim of the glasses are rough and irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;5. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any change in my skin, and I didn&#x27;t have much acne to start with, just the occasional pimple&lt;br /&gt;6.Their claim that it is &amp;#34;clinically&amp;#34; proven, if you read the booklet it stated that it is has only been tested on 30 people, which to me isn&#x27;t very reassuring.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, simple in use, great results, and affordable ! Every woman deserves to have one - and can use, not feeling guilty. No wonder those fly off the shelves.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and a half and I feel like I am wasting my time. I have had recent breakouts of acne around my chin and I was hoping this would help, but so far it hasn&#x27;t, when one goes away 2 more come back. I doubt this does anything for wrinkles. I am 46 and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement. I would have been better off giving the money to a homeless person and doing community service for 7 and a half hours.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. Do not reset the mask for another 30 days of use. These led bulbs do not have proper heat sinks on them so they will dim quickly and you will not get the light power you need to be effective.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 20 minutes for 10 consecutive nights. My visible acne reduced greatly as did the redness. So easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an active 16 year old and found this not to be drying or irritating like many of the topical products I have used in the past. excellent value too. Definitely worth purchasing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie</li>
    <li> I am writing this review for both my mother and myself.  My mom is in her eighties and of course I am quite a bit younger.  I started using the mask about 3 weeks ago and my Mom a few weeks ago.  I saw a difference with my skin after about 4 days.  My skin is a lot smoother and even toned.  I see a big difference under my eyes.  They don&#x27;t look as sunken and the gray bags are lighter.  Now for my Mom, I think she started seeing a difference about a week later.  She also feels her skin is smoother and sees similar results under her eyes.  We both look forward to the 15 minutes of relaxation each night.  She is funny as she says the mask has made her get into a better routine at night.  We are both delighted with the results!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne from the time I started puberty, at about 11.  My skin is very, very oily, and mixed with bacteria, the result is my acne.  I am cursed with large pores and basically hate my skin.  I also have some mild to moderate scaring and indentations from picking at my acne as a teenager.  I have used all kinds of lotions and creams, which do work for me pretty well in controlling the new pimples that form every day. My normal routine is to wash my face twice a day, morning and night and then apply something like proactiv, azelaic acid, retin A, etc, and then slap on some moisturizer over it.  If I wash my face and not put on one of my creams, then there is a guarantee that by the next day I will have some new pimples.  There is no going around this for me.  If I miss putting on creams for just one day or one night after washing, and I will have new zits.   I saw the illumask on a late night infomercial and thought it looked pretty interesting.  I bought it and decided to give it a try.  I wanted to be sure it really works, so I washed my face, used the mask, and did not put on any of my usual creams.  Well, after the first test and I can happily say it actually worked.  The next day, I had no new pimples.  I have now used the mask for over a month, and I have had no major breakouts.  I have not had to put on proactiv or anything like that.  If I do get a new pimple, it is usually very tiny, and is gone by the next day.  So, did the mask give me perfect skin that I wish for?  No.  However, I am very satisfied with the results.  My skin is still disgustingly oily, the mask&#x27;s job is not to do anything about that, but it kills the bacteria, which is the main thing it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It has become a replacement for the proactiv.  The only thing I put on my face now is some moisturizer and sunscreen when I go out.  No more proactiv, no more oxy, clerasil, retin A, azelaic acid, etc.  Do I love my skin now?  No, it is still very unattractive with largepores and grease, but I was not expecting it to take care of problems that is wasn&#x27;t designed for.  The one problem I really have with this is that it is only good for 30 days.  There are ways to reset it, which I have done and I will keep doing so until it completely cannot be used any more.  The company who makes these are not doing the environment any favors by having people throw away this big piece of plastic.  I understand they want to make money, but this is very irresponsible of them to facilitate this waste. Another thing is that the edges of the glasses are pretty sharp.  I had to glue some foam to them so that there won&#x27;t be lines under my eyes where they touch.  The lines disappear eventually, but to avoid them in the first place, I had to alter it.  I have reset the mask just once after buying it and I did not change the batteries.  The counter has faded significantly, but the lights still come on the same way.</li>
    <li> WAY OVER PRICED ON AMAZON!!!!! I am disappointed that these IlluMask&#x27;s are so expensive on here! I use both the masks and see major results and they are so easy, quick and convenient to use. I used to use a blue light wand and it takes so long and makes my arms tired because you have to do individual spots separately on your face, which takes forever. These masks are truly amazing and convenient and I will continue to purchase both (the acne treatment and anti-aging treatment) but not on Amazon unless they reduce their price. If you buy from Ulta.com or Walmart they are $29.99 a piece which comes out to just a dollar per treatment; extremely low price compared to professional dermatology or spa treatment and much better than on here too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter at Walmart.  It was 30.00 there.  She was/is worried about acne and I thought this would help from the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  Rather than taking her to a dermatologist, I thought this might work and save me from putting her on prescription creams/antibiotics. Don&#x27;t waste your money!  It did nothing for her.  I would recommend taking your teenager or anyone with acne to the dermatologist.  This lights up and looks like it is doing something but in reality it did nothing.  There is a refund if you only use 15 treatments but my daughter wanted to keep trying it so we did.  I ended up taking her to the dermatologist and got  better results from the over the counter creams, washes and this device.  I read you can reset this device so if you want to keep trying, check out other reviews on how to reset.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this for my son, but at our local drugstore instead of through Amazon.  As a biologist with nearly 30-yrs experience, I am very suspicious of the stated efficacy of this product and if my wife can find the receipt, this product will get returned.  Here are my specific criticisms of the product:    NEGATIVE REVIEWERS NOT ALONE  From NY Times article (2014):  \\&quot;It&#x27;s a minimal, modest, infinitesimal change, so if they&#x27;re looking for the magic bullet, that&#x27;s not it,\\&quot; said Dr. Stafford Broumand, a plastic surgeon on the Upper East Side.    SUSPICIOUS REVIEW PATTERN  If you look at product rating by DATE, the first 29 reviews (2/8/2014-4/13/2014) are:  5-Star &#x3D; 18  4-Star &#x3D; 5  3-Star &#x3D; 4  2-Star &#x3D; 1  1-Star &#x3D; 1    And looking at ratings from the most recent 24 reviews (from 12/31/2014-2/6/2015):  5-Star &#x3D; 9  4-Star &#x3D; 0  3-Star &#x3D; 1  2-Star &#x3D; 2  1-Star &#x3D; 12    I&#x27;ll let you decide whether you think reviews were padded early in product launch; and whether this practice continues ...    Note to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos:  I&#x27;m assuming you guys at Amazon have developed algorithms to flag suspicious review patterns so as to ensure the quality of your website, right?    BAD SCIENCE  The enclosed brochure, in discussing mechanism of action, cites 2 scientific article in different journals, both journals have an \\&quot;impact factor\\&quot; of around 1.2 to 2.6 (quite low).  For the non-scientist, the \\&quot;impact factor\\&quot; of a scientific journal is a rough, albeit imperfect, measure of journal impact, or more specifically, the average number of times a study in the journal is cited over the past 2 year period.  In contrast, the highest regarded scientific journals (i.e. Nature) carry an impact factor around 30 to 50.  Still, a low impact factor doesn&#x27;t automatically mean bad science, so I tried to find and read the papers describing the supporting science for this product.  The first cited paper is only available by paying $86 for the download and no way I&#x27;m gonna do that.  The second paper, however, is available for free PDF download by going to PubMed and searching \\&quot;Lee SY, You CE, Park MY Lasers Surg Med\\&quot;.  After reading, I have serious concerns about the quality of this study.  The authors report some impressive results:  34% improvement in non-inflammatory lesions and 78% improvement in inflammatory lesions.  Closer inspection, however, reveals a very serious problem in study design, primarily in that there was no control group (no LED treatment) with which to compare the LED treatment group.  Further, had there been a control group, the person(s) doing the scoring for results should have been blinded as to which patients were treated and which were controls.  Instead, all test subjects received LED treatment and the scoring was done by both the investigator and the patients themselves.  The investigator has a natural subjective bias to want to prove his hypothesis correct.  And the \\&quot;placebo effect\\&quot; is a long-recognized phenomena amongst patients.  Believe me, my 26-years experience in the pharmaceutical industry tells me this is very bad science.  And if these are the best studies the manufacturer can cite to support their product, well, simply put ... buyer beware!  You&#x27;d probably get a similar (non-)effect by hanging a string of LED Christmas tree bulbs around your neck    NO FDA APPROVAL (No Real Clinical Trial)  If they&#x27;ve got a bona fide treatment, why no actual clinical trials to prove this product works?  Certainly the market is big enough at an estimated $3 billion dollars/year by the end of this decade.  This should be a relatively inexpensive, and short, clinical trial with low risk of adverse events.  Given the study reference above was published in 2007, they&#x27;ve had almost a decade to execute a real clinical trial.  I suspect the reason is because their preclinical science is so utterly bad.  Further, it is misleading for the manufacturer to include the study discussed above in the section of their product manual entitled \\&quot;Interpreted Summary of Clinical Data\\&quot;.  Then they go on to say they used an acne scoring system based on the FDA guideline; the subliminal linkage here is that there is some sort of FDA sign-off on this product, when this doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case.  Additionally, the referenced study describes 20-min treatments with 5 panels x 260 blue LEDs each for 1300 blue LEDs, and 4 panels x 420 red LEDs for 1680 red LEDs.  The IlluMask product likely contains nowhere near that number of LEDs (3000 total) and the manual fails to describe the radiant dose of the product, so impossible to state equivalence of radiant dose.  I also find it odd that the product manual says \\&quot;For more information about the clinical study ...\\&quot; and directs one to their website; and yet, on that website, there is NO INFORMATION on the clinical study.    IlluMask has FDA clearance; it does NOT have FDA approval (for efficacy)  From the FDA website:  What does it mean when FDA \\&quot;clears\\&quot; or \\&quot;approves\\&quot; a medical device?  When FDA review is needed prior to marketing a medical device, FDA will either \\&quot;clear\\&quot; the device after reviewing a premarket notification, otherwise known as a 510(k) (named for a section in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act), that has been filed with FDA, or \\&quot;approve\\&quot; the device after reviewing a premarket approval (PMA) application that has been submitted to FDA.  Whether a 510(k) or a PMA application needs to be filed depends on the classification of the medical device.  To acquire clearance to market a device using the 510(k) pathway, the submitter of the 510(k) must show that the medical device is \\&quot;substantially equivalent\\&quot; to a device that is already legally marketed for the same use.  To acquire approval of a device through a PMA application, the PMA applicant must provide reasonable assurance of the device&#x27;s safety and effectiveness.    BUILT-IN SHUT-DOWN AFTER 30 USES - REALLY?  As mentioned by many other reviewers, this product gives one 30 (supposed) daily treatments of 15-min each.This is a maddening example of built-in obsolescence:  LED bulbs last a very long time and batteries should be replaceable.  So you&#x27;re supposed to throw it away after 30 days and go buy another ... great, not exactly a \\&quot;green\\&quot; product ... unless you count the green (money) flowing out of people&#x27;s wallets.    If my wife can&#x27;t find receipt, then we&#x27;re stuck with this product and might as well give it a try.  If that&#x27;s the case, I will be sure to update this review in 30 days.  Of course, that still would only be an anecdotal report on efficacy, or lack thereof, and of limited reliability.</li>
    <li> For a 30-day &amp;#34;supply,&amp;#34; this was worthless. I am day 24 and there is nothing different with my skin. I still break out on my face and current acne aren&#x27;t going down...and I only have mild to moderate acne. I strongly do NOT recommend. Had high hopes, too. :\</li>
    <li> Excellent for cystic acne. I went about 6 months having at least one painful acne cyst at all times. Using illumask at least almost every day, I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I had one. I still have small whiteheads sometimes and I sure do wish something could be done about my rosacea. So, if your problem is cystic acne, this is definitely for you and very much worth it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical...come on, I look like Iron Man wearing it. But this mask really works for me. I suffer from hormone related acne breakouts, and nothing seemed to get it under control. I tried every product under the sun! Then I tried this mask. Along with a face wash, an alpha hydroxy type lotion and a benzyoyl peroxide cream (all of which I was already using with very limited success), my face is actually clear. I was averaging 5-8 medium sized pimples along my jar line and chin all the time. I have been using this mask for 30 days and I currently do not have a single blemish!!!!! I haven&#x27;t been able to say that in years. When I had my period, I did have 3 or 4 blemishes (much fewer than usual) but they all went away quickly and none turned into the cystic acne I get on a monthly basis.&lt;br /&gt;This mask has been a godsend for me. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the results!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Ulta in December and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I wanted to try this one before spending $200-$300 on a professional light set. Well I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This was just okay. I can&#x27;t say it did or didn&#x27;t work. How can I say it prevented me from breaking out? Did I break out while using this: yes. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles so I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with that.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really suffer from blackheads or whiteheads. I have cystic breakouts every so often and anyone who has cystic acne knows NOTHING works on it.&lt;br /&gt;I read that light therapy helped with the bacteria in your skin, which would help with cystic acne. I still broke out and I have a very strict skin regime.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve just accepted that sometimes Im going to get a cystic pimple and nothing will work except maybe a cortisone injection from my dr.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth a shot though.&lt;br /&gt;My device actually stopped working after 25 uses. The blue lights went completely out and the hand held device stopped working as well. So I tossed it after that.</li>
    <li> I saw a general improvement in my skin, it looked rested. HOWEVER, as many reviews say, it stopped working after 17 uses and there is nothing I can do to get it to work until the 30 count that is advertised.</li>
    <li> It took me two masks (each mask lasts for 30 days) to start getting visible results. While it didn&#x27;t completely remove all acne, it did lessen the number of zits as well as reducing redness overall. I would definitely recommend this product. HOWEVER - the price on Amazon is a RIPOFF! Amazon is selling it for forty something dollars, I bought this at my local Walmart for $23 after tax. This shocked me because Amazon is usually my go-to for the cheapest price but not this time. Even if that seems like a lot (which it did to me at first) it&#x27;s still a worthwhile investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it did seem to clear up the little bit of acne I had at the time.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any effect except it dried out my skin.</li>
    <li> The mask doesn&#x27;t work on acne at all. Didn&#x27;t help clear my acne AT ALL. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this products. Also, my vision was hazy with a tint of purple after taking the mask off. I definitely would not recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I realized that you could only use illumask for 30  treatments.I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fair to the consumer nor did you make that clear on the product description. I don&#x27;t think I would have purchased it had I known  that.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying i hardly ever write reviews because i never have the time but on this product I had to make an exception.  I purchased this product on a Whim and purposely kept the receipt because I wanted a refund if it turned out to be some junk.  I have suffered from Acne since I was a teen and throughout my adulthood.  I have used acne meds ranging from Rention A to Clyndomyicn (sp?) and this little mask by far has been the best thing for me in 30 years.  I am a dark skin African American and a lot of products on the market are not made for my skin type and some doctors even have a hard time figuring out what products will work best.  Of course I don&#x27;t get the issue of redness but acne is noticeable.  I bought this product on a Friday used it Friday night and woke amazed.  Day two was even better.  I used this mask in conjuction with my Alba Acnedote cleanser and the results are A+.</li>
    <li> Thought it would help my scars, but just acne. Didn&#x27;t even help my acne. And it is impossible to reset despite reviews with directions. It&#x27;s a bust</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to light therapy, so I was initially skeptical… but this product is seriously awesome! I used it for the full 30 days and am really pleased with the results. It helped to reduce the severity of the acne I had when I started using it, and I didn&#x27;t develop any new breakouts. Also, it dried out the oily areas of my skin, but didn&#x27;t leave me too dry. I am definitely going to purchase another one to continue treatments. At ~$1/session, it&#x27;s really a great deal.</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks in and my skin is looking great.&lt;br /&gt;A lot cheaper than what my dermatologist used to charge me.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a whim and I really love it. After a few few days I began to see a difference in my skin. I will definitely recommend this product if you are thinking of buying it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic product! I was initially skeptical at first, as my husband had purchased this for me as an &amp;#34;impulse buy&amp;#34; at Walmart. There is no denying my absolute SHOCK this this thing is the REAL DEAL. It has totally calmed down my inflammatory acne rosacea and my pimples now are less severe, less frequent, and less painful. It is so worth the money when you consider how much $ I USED to spend buying all kinds of fancy creams/potions to get rid of my acne. Plus it is chemical free so it is a safe all-natural product that will not harm the body</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in acne prone skin.  I try to use this every morning while I am fixing my hair, or I will do it just before I go to sleep.  I feel like a welder for the 15 minutes you wear it every night, but it does significatly improve your skin.  When I first bought it, I didn&#x27;t realize that it would expire after a series of uses so I was a bit disappointed.  I thought it was something you could just change the battery out and keep using. But since I have been using this I have had no new acne outbreaks.  I used to break out at least once a month and I have been using this mask for the 6 months, I have not had one new pimple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say my acne was moderate, I would have some cystic acne, blackheads, and white heads mainly forehead and cheeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of blue light devices for acne over the years. They work on my skin. But this device does not have enough blue lights. In particular there are no LEDs at all on the sides, so if you have a tendency to get zits on the temples or cheeks, the mask won&#x27;t help with that. Not all the LEDs are blue either. Many are red. That&#x27;s good for healing acne scarring but I&#x27;d rather have a separate red light device for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Illumask is that I can lie down and relax while I&#x27;m using it. I don&#x27;t have to move a lightsource around my face, like I do with the Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light Therapy System. I also don&#x27;t have to worry if the lightsource is too close or too far away from my face, the way I did with the BlueMD - Acne Blue Light Therapy Treatment. I like to listen to music or an audiobook while getting the  treatment. So the mask format has potential. It just needs more LEDs. And of course the counter thing is bogus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting another Sirius. Used with aloe gel it&#x27;s the most effective and convenient thing I&#x27;ve found so far for acne.</li>
    <li> The illuMask is one of the best product I have ever purchased! It is simple to use, just put the mask on like a pair of sunglasses, push one button to turn it on, sit and relax. I started seeing dramatic results almost immediately!  My photos are after only three days of using illuMask!</li>
    <li> Wonderful and exciting product for men as well. You&#x27;ll see a difference yourself in after 10-15 sessions; blemishes might disappear; tan and &amp;#34;liver&amp;#34; spots may fade away. In addition it has a calming effect as a bonus. It is a pity that Amazon could not secure a better price since everywhere else it sells for $30.</li>
    <li> So this thing stopped working for me at 15 uses, what a rip off. I would not buy this garbage again.</li>
    <li> As other reviews have stated, our mask will work sometimes and sometimes it won&#x27;t.  First time my wife used it cut off after 5 minutes and counted down one use.  Second time it turned on and immediately turned back off and counted down one session.  Third time it worked all the way through.  But for a product that only gives you 30 uses, so far the first 3 have been a dice roll and only getting one full use out of those first 3.</li>
    <li> The anti aging one is soooo good !!! I got the acne mask for my children also and they love it too!!! Awesome products!!</li>
    <li> Few details about me to start. Im an athletic 28 year old male, i exercise, take vitamins and am overall very healthy. I have tried everything to clear up my acne since my teen years. My face would always go through phases, sometimes mostly clear and other times there was nothing i could do to keep acne from spreading. I was skeptical about the Illumask, seemed like another &amp;#34;maybe it works maybe it doesnt&amp;#34; type of product. But after i had one of the worst acne flair ups of my life i decided i needed to try something. I found the Illumask on sale for 24.99 at my local Target and decided i might as well give it a shot (especially after I saw how to disable the counter). I used the Illumask one night before i went to bed and the next morning i could see a difference. After one week my face was clearer than it had been in as long as i could remember. I was one of those people that would study my face everyday, multiple times a day because i was so self conscious about my acne, many times it kept me from going out with friends because i didnt want to be seen by other people. But after one week, my acne has almost COMPLETELY disappeared. It is truly a night and day difference. I would highly recommend the Illumask to anyone struggling with acne. I can honestly say i have never felt better about my skin. Just try it and see what happens, it is definitly worth it.</li>
    <li> LED can damage your eyes !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.livescience.com/31949-led-lights-eye-damage.html</li>
    <li> I love the results. This is the first time I have ordered it on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve been using it at home. Just after 5 uses I experienced reduction in large pimples and an overall improved clearness in my skin. Best thing -- you can just opt into continuity and keep getting refill controllers if you don&#x27;t want to get a new mask each month, but hey for $30 it&#x27;s worth it. Can&#x27;t wait to send one to all of my sisters and mom! Although the mask can feel a bit alien at first it actually has helped me take 15 minutes to relax each night which also improves heath! :) Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this! The technology really does work -- and that&#x27;s from personal experience!</li>
    <li> Really helped my skin! Very affective when used with a proper cleansing and exfoliating routine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have combination skin and have always dealt with acne. I&#x27;ve tried so many products even proactiv, and wasted so much money on expensive products and this being only a dollar a day is really a steal for me. I saw results in the first week because I was looking for a change and started getting compliments from others two weeks in. I&#x27;m on my 3rd mask and really even look forward to laying down in bed before sleep and using it. It&#x27;s very relaxing. I recommend it to everyone. Also, it&#x27;s cheaper off of their website and walmart if you want a better deal.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I have had mild to moderate acne since I was 16...for the last 8 years and NOTHING has worked. I have tried many otc and prescription products. After a couple weeks of using this, my acne is almost completely gone. I still have 2 mild zits around my mouth but I think it&#x27;s because I keep touching my face while I&#x27;m at work. The only downside is that they set it to stop working after 30 tries which is pretty lame, but it is worth it to me.</li>
