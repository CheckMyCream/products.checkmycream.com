      <li>and I&#x27;m In love</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay hair, but it sheds and tangles a lot.</li>
      <li>I totally love it.</li>
      <li>pretty good for price</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>extremely fast shipping, very soft hair, color matched perfectly.</li>
      <li>And it gets tangled easily.</li>
      <li>The color matched fine, but they suck for being synthetic.</li>
      <li>So silky smooth</li>
      <li>I love these soooooo much omg !</li>
      <li>For $10 they are perfect quality and soft, and I would definitely order again.</li>
      <li>They are nice looks pretty real.</li>
      <li>They feel nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Because these seemed to be such a good deal</li>
      <li>need two to three to get full effect, didn&#x27;t work well for me, gave to a friend</li>
      <li>They are super soft and don&#x27;t get tangled easy!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these!!!</li>
      <li>It does tangle pretty quickly</li>
      <li>so glad I got two sets to make it full enough.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural and they are easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Super straight hair.</li>
      <li>this was my first time buying synthetic hair exitensions</li>
      <li>Its really pretty to wear.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Pretty for single use : ) wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
      <li>I bought the Off Black and its the perfect black.</li>
      <li>True black does get ratty easily but I like the hair</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t shed really at all.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you wet them first and let them  air dry and style eiter straight or curly but keep the heat under 300!</li>
      <li>If you really want it to look natural you need to order two sets.</li>
      <li>The color matched, they are pretty thick, I enjoyed them.</li>
      <li>they are ok, but they look really fake and it gets tangled really easy</li>
      <li>The only problem was some of the clips don&#x27;t work right, and</li>
      <li>I made sure to carefully take them out of their package and carefully brushed them out from the ends to the roots</li>
      <li>I would suggest this for cosplays, Halloween but everyday IMHO it would get raggedy really fast, maybe so oil might stop that and some light ironing</li>
      <li>They are long and exactly like the description.</li>
      <li>First off, they came 10 days early than the Expected Delivery from amazon.</li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY recommend reading the instructions on the back of the package on how to take care of them.</li>
      <li>but then I didn&#x27;t get it for about two and a half weeks later, and by then my hair was too light for them.</li>
      <li>The only reason these are getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don&#x27;t really think one package is enough.</li>
      <li>When they get &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; from being braided she just mists them down with water and dries them straight again.</li>

<li> Or flat iron?</li>
<li> I really disliked these extensions, they are very tangly making your hair look like a total mess.</li>
<li> I was worried they would look cheap and fake.</li>
<li> Way too long.</li>
<li> They came earlier than expected.</li>
<li> After trying on what I had left, they felt way to heavy and the clips hurt my head to the point where they got tangled with my hair and was literally ripping my hair off.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Its tangles soo fast.</li>
<li> I am going to tell other people about them toO!</li>
<li> and I was a little sketched out because of the price</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money and end up looking like the grudge.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> If you were to buy this, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you wear everyday.</li>
<li> a small single extension had a broken clip, I had to throw away.</li>
<li> Also I&#x27;ve only worn them twice since it&#x27;s the wrong color now.</li>
<li> I was so skeptical about these extensions, so i decied ehhh there only $10</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
<li> A lot of synthetic extensions I bought from the mall I could at least brush through with not a lot of issues and stuff.</li>
<li> Only could wear two times, then it looked like broken damaged fake hair</li>
<li> Not good hair at all..</li>
<li> I mean come on $10 jeeeeez!</li>
<li> There kinda thin..</li>
<li> Oh my word!&lt;br /&gt;These are behind perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
<li> Looks faker than fake.</li>
<li> and I am so sad meow.</li>
<li> I needed them for a wedding, but sadly the fell apart as soon as I took them out of the package.</li>
<li> These I couldn&#x27;t even set down for 5 minutes without getting horrible knots.</li>
<li> I was Beyond mad, but you get what you pay for.</li>
<li> Tangles really bad after 2 days.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Oh my word!&lt;br /&gt;These are behind perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Soft and real!&lt;br /&gt;A lot more than 8 pieces</li>
    <li> I love these extensions. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these extensions. They feel nice and soft. They are long and exactly like the description. They came earlier than expected. I am so satisfied.</li>
    <li> Only could wear two times, then it looked like broken damaged fake hair and I am so sad meow.</li>
    <li> They are nice looks pretty real. My hair is short so glad I got two sets to make it full enough. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars one clip broke but I just cut that part off. And it gets tangled easily.</li>
    <li> The color matched, they are pretty thick, I enjoyed them. The only problem was some of the clips don&#x27;t work right, and a small single extension had a broken clip, I had to throw away.</li>
    <li> this was my first time buying synthetic hair exitensions and I was a little sketched out because of the price and just because of the fact that it&#x27;s not human hair but I thought I would try them. I got them in the mail this morning and was beyond amazed on the quality of them! They are super soft and don&#x27;t get tangled easy! I wore them ALL DAY and they looked amazing! I got so many compliments! I highly recommend these!!! :D will definitely be buying these again In the future!!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and in good condition. It does tangle pretty quickly so you have to brush it A LOT. If you were to buy this, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you wear everyday. But it&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> These extensions are aweful even for syntehic. You can&#x27;t do anything with them. They are so shiny and way to flimsy to even style. Perfect for a Halloween costume, but aweful for every day use. Doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> True black does get ratty easily but I like the hair</li>
    <li> Love it! Shipped fast and looks great!!</li>
    <li> I love these soooooo much omg ! Just got them today and I&#x27;m In love😍😍😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I really disliked these extensions, they are very tangly making your hair look like a total mess. Would never buy nor recommend.</li>
    <li> tangled up as soon as I pulled the strands out of the box.</li>
    <li> Super straight hair. Unfortunately, Its tangles soo fast. And also alot of hair was shedding. I decided to remove the clips and add them to real human hair. I would suggest this for cosplays, Halloween but everyday IMHO it would get raggedy really fast, maybe so oil might stop that and some light ironing but I didnt wanna deal with it. About the texture of flat ironed asian hair.</li>
    <li> Not good hair at all.. Guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> These clip ins are awesome!! Only flaw is they DONT match my hair color.</li>
    <li> I ordered my extensions five days ago and got it today, which is actually a week earlier than I was supposed to get them. I read reviews that said they shed so I made sure to carefully take them out of their package and carefully brushed them out from the ends to the roots and it didn&#x27;t shed really at all. If you have thicker hair you can/should order two sets but I have layers in my hair so one set is perfect for me. I would HIGHLY recommend reading the instructions on the back of the package on how to take care of them. For $10 they are perfect quality and soft, and I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I needed them for a wedding, but sadly the fell apart as soon as I took them out of the package. After trying on what I had left, they felt way to heavy and the clips hurt my head to the point where they got tangled with my hair and was literally ripping my hair off. I was Beyond mad, but you get what you pay for. If I could I would give them 0 stars.</li>
    <li> pretty good for price</li>
    <li> Tangles really bad after 2 days. Pretty for single use : ) wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> need two to three to get full effect, didn&#x27;t work well for me, gave to a friend</li>
    <li> Good.. Can take heat.. But if you have a big head get 3 packs..  There kinda thin..</li>
    <li> My daughter was begging me to get her clip in extensions but there was no way I was going to pay the prices they wanted to charge in the store. Because these seemed to be such a good deal I was worried they would look cheap and fake. I am amazed at the quality. You can&#x27;t even tell she has extensions in when she wears these. She can braid them and everything. It looks very natural and they are easy to work with. When they get &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; from being braided she just mists them down with water and dries them straight again. The only reason these are getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don&#x27;t really think one package is enough. If you really want it to look natural you need to order two sets. Other than that these are absolutely perfect and are still a good deal purchasing two sets.</li>
    <li> Love love love its must have :)</li>
    <li> Ahhh! I was so skeptical about these extensions, so i decied ehhh there only $10 so it doesnt hurt to try. First off, they came 10 days early than the Expected Delivery from amazon. Perfect timing for my vegas trip ;) They came in very nice packaging and a case to keep them in! They are very soft and the blend perfectly with my hair. I am 5&#x27;3 and they go to about my hip, soooo gorgeous! I bought the Off Black and its the perfect black. You can style them as well! Just make sure you wet them first and let them  air dry and style eiter straight or curly but keep the heat under 300! They came with cleaning and styling instructions as well! I am definitley going to order another pair just for the future. I am going to tell other people about them toO! I mean come on $10 jeeeeez! 1000000%</li>
    <li> extremely fast shipping, very soft hair, color matched perfectly. definitely a go-to buy for extensions.</li>
    <li> Can I put iron curling on the extension hair ? Or flat iron?</li>
    <li> Way too long. Looks faker than fake. It&#x27;s unbelievable. don&#x27;t waste your money and end up looking like the grudge.</li>
    <li> they are ok, but they look really fake and it gets tangled really easy</li>
    <li> The color matched fine, but they suck for being synthetic. A lot of synthetic extensions I bought from the mall I could at least brush through with not a lot of issues and stuff. These I couldn&#x27;t even set down for 5 minutes without getting horrible knots.</li>
    <li> Ordered it but then I didn&#x27;t get it for about two and a half weeks later, and by then my hair was too light for them. It&#x27;s okay hair, but it sheds and tangles a lot. Also I&#x27;ve only worn them twice since it&#x27;s the wrong color now.</li>
    <li> So silky smooth I used them to lengthen a wig...great price!</li>
    <li> Its really pretty to wear. I matches my hair greatly. I totally love it. I would recommend this product to anyone. XD</li>
