      <li>This wig is absolutely amazing and exactly how I pictured it!</li>

      <li>What I love about this wig is it&#x27;s easy to maintain and keep clean.</li>
      <li>-  It can tangle easily, so I like to style it in braids.  </li>

      <li>Overall it is a beautiful wig.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My all time favorite  wig. The  top is a but purpley er than I thought  but it&#x27;s gorgeous</li>
    <li> I had to fix it a lot but other then that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> gorgeous but its more purply than gray</li>
    <li> a little on the thin side, but cute and workable none the less.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for my birthday, and I am very pleased with it! It is a bit thin, but there are no bald spots, it looks realistic, and it is easy to detangle. I have a larger head, so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find wigs that don&#x27;t look like they are about to fly off at any movement, but this one feels secure and very comfortable on my head. Like most nicer wigs, this wig has little straps so you can tighten it on your head, so if you don&#x27;t have a giant head like me, it will still fit snugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are a bit long, but with the way they are styled they look very nice swept to the side and they seem to stay in place pretty well without any styling gel or hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is slightly different from the picture they provided. It&#x27;s not a very dramatic ombre, and the top doesn&#x27;t appear as prominently grey, but more of a plum color. If you look closely though, it&#x27;s the same lavender as the bottom but with grey streaks in it. Regardless, I think it&#x27;s really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed was that this wig doesn&#x27;t shed too badly! Very big upside, especially considering how it&#x27;s a bit thin to begin with. Some wigs I&#x27;ve had shed like crazy, and you can&#x27;t even run your fingers through them without taking out a clump of hair. That is not a problem with this one. I ran my fingers through it countless times and only got one hair here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a gorgeous wig that looks very realistic and very pretty! It is definitely worth the price it is :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig, first of all, It came 2 weeks after I placed my order, I was very pleased! It does indeed shed A LOT but it&#x27;s worth the amount it is for.</li>
    <li> Ordered and received it in 2 days, I got many compliments on it and everyone loves it. It sheds a lot, but for the price it&#x27;s very beautiful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fun wig. The cap is a bit weird and small but maybe I just have a big head. It&#x27;s good for cosplay or just to have fun hair every now and then. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as an everyday wig though.  The color isn&#x27;t really as shown in the picture. It&#x27;s much more purple all over... But hey, I like purple.</li>
    <li> Nice color. I put 4 stars because it is not easy to put it to my hair . My head Should move softy  with this wigs. A little bit bigger than my head . Anyhow , I love it for photography .</li>
    <li> So cute! Arrived a lot earlier than amazon said so that&#x27;s great. The wig is so beautiful and easy to detangle. Bangs are super cute too. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> My wig came and it was entirely purple.  Slight brown highlights</li>
    <li> Love it :3 the colors are just what I wanted and I took this in the sun and this is not filtered so I took it in good lighting and it looks great also you can straighten it I didn&#x27;t in this pic but you can and honestly I think this is a great buy</li>
    <li> I received the wig. Just as I expected. Long and beautiful. But unfortunately one of the adjustment bands was hanging by a thread...very disappointed</li>
    <li> The grey tone doesn&#x27;t really show up in real life. It looks more like two shades of purple that aren&#x27;t very different. It&#x27;s two-toned, yes, but it&#x27;s subtle. I should also mention that the back of the wig is THIN. If anything is uneven back there, it will show up easily. Maybe cute if worn with a hat, but I don&#x27;t really have a hat to go with it. I got it mostly for taking pictures and the view from the front, so it will be acceptable for that, but definitely not for wearing out in public.</li>
    <li> I love this, but I read the reviews and knew what to expect with it.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t match that gray and purple. Mine was a lot more wine/red colored with purple at the bottom. Still, it is a really gorgeous wig (though wig isn&#x27;t as fair a word as maybe hair piece?) I wanted something fairly thin and natural that I could wear outside or with a hat without getting too warm in humid weather. It isn&#x27;t very full and I believe it&#x27;s not supposed to be worn without some kind of head covering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still I really like it, it&#x27;s cute, and does exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> ordered two.love color ..make it work its different</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this it&#x27;s grey like an+old woman hair and bald spots,the+hair will+not hold hair dye either don&#x27;t try it ,the pics are after I dyed the grey part and it sat for two hours dark purple and didn&#x27;t hold any of the dye</li>
    <li> Great quality and super fun.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an adorable wig! Also, It ships really really fast!&lt;br /&gt;I opened up the box and the wig was darker than in the picture, but no worries about that because it looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first wig i have ever owned and i adore it, it looks so real and it was way softer than what i thought it was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;It is really fun to style too! So experiment with it!&lt;br /&gt;I took a couple pics with the wig and i personally like the ponytails better.&lt;br /&gt;And just a warning, the wig does indeed shed upon usage, so be careful with the darling thing.</li>
    <li> This is very well made. Some people actually believe this is my real hair. its soft and does not tangle easy and fits very well.</li>
    <li> NEVER F$#@&amp;%# CAME IN ITS BULL$@#&amp;</li>
    <li> Adorable and good quality</li>
    <li> Alright, this was my first wig purchase EVER and may I say, I was very satisfied. Delivery was incredibly quick and free of issues. I had ordered another two at the same time as I did this one and this was the first one to arrive at my doorstep. The product color was basically what it looks like on the picture except for the greyish looking tone is a bit more brownish grey with lilac in person (if you take pictures it will look exactly like the ones on here) but it is LOVELY, OH MY GOODNESS, iT IS LOVELY. The wig itself is quite thin but that is also what it looks like in the pic, that is all the hair you get. You may need to tweek it a bit since it comes folded in the package but after a little wearing it basically looks just like the image and I love it. Overall it is a beautiful wig. Thank you, I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again. &lt;3</li>
    <li> It was a little on the thin side, and if you don&#x27;t part it in the right spot, you can see the netting beneath. But I wear wigs on a regular basis and that was easy to work with. What I love about this wig is it&#x27;s easy to maintain and keep clean. And the plus side to it being thin is I can wear it out and about in hot days and not feel like I&#x27;m going to croak from heat exhaustion. If this is your first time wig, I suggest wearing a little cap with it, and carry a brush with you because this is a very brushable wig. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Got it after Christmas and I placed my order on the beginning of the month, so that was about two weeks. The wig is exceptionally full. It does have a somewhat desaturated auburn color that makes it grey. The fibers don&#x27;t look completely natural, but I was really surprised how thick it was and how beautiful it is. It looks like the picture for the most part. Do I recommend it? Definitely. Totally impressed with the quality from this store, I&#x27;ll be back again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the highest quality wigs I own! It looks realistic, even without a hat. It was a little too shiny at first, but I sprayed it with dry shampoo for some texture, and it&#x27;s perfect. I love the way the colors blend together, and even though it&#x27;s long, it isn&#x27;t too heavy to wear all day. I get so many compliments when I wear this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Keep a comb in your purse though -  It can tangle easily, so I like to style it in braids.  I&#x27;ve uploaded a couple images of what the wig looks like on me.</li>
    <li> They grey is a little more of a brown-grey than it looks in the picture, but it&#x27;s pretty dang close and it&#x27;s really cute still. It&#x27;s not really all that shiney, so that&#x27;s pretty great! Got here really fast too!</li>
    <li> It was really nice tho, its just that the wigs color and style is not accurate as the picture its like all purple.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s lightweight and looks and feels natural!</li>
    <li> I adore this wig! My hair is fine and boring, and dye jobs have nearly destroyed it. I was looking for an exciting but not tooexpexpensive solution while my hair grows out. This wig is my fourth from amazon, but my first from this seller. So far this one has been the best! It brushes out very easily. It feels like real hair and looks real enough. I had a girl ask me where I got my hair done! It also has excellent coverage. Since my head is small, I have to tighten the clips pretty far. On one of my other wigs, this causes the netting to show through. Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;Some cons... it took awhile to arrive (theres no overnight from asia) but I expected that. In fact I forgot I ordered it which made it feel like I got a present instead of something I bought. It was still less than the predicted two to six weeks :) Also, though the top provides full coverage, it isnt bulky, and thins out over its length . If your looking for something thick to braid, I wouldnt recommend this particular one. Its also a really bright neon purple at the end ( which is exactly what I wanted) not so much the bluish in the picture, and the top is brownish greyish. I think its stunning, but the pic isnt a perfect representation. I havent washed it yet, or tried curls or anything, so I dont know how it handles with that.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent buy for the price. I cant wait to try some of their other ones!</li>
    <li> I love it. If you put it on right it looks really natural. I went to a fair and my friends who I hadn&#x27;t seen the a couple months just thought my hair grew twelve inches super fast. However, the hair has been falling out. I don&#x27;t mind, because Its not much, but, it makes the ends uneven, and eventually it will be bare.</li>
    <li> I received this wig earlier than expected. Normally, it takes a month for me to receive a wig from China. But it took approximately a week and a half to get mine.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is EXCELLENT for it&#x27;s price. I took pictures with it and shared them with family/friends and they all thought it was my real hair, just dyed. It looks so natural, and not too shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are easy to part to either side.&lt;br /&gt;I love this wig so much! Would definitely consider purchasing from here again!</li>
    <li> The name of the product states that it is gray to purple, the picture denotes a light milk tea brown to light purple,  but it is more of a dark gray -&amp;#62; gray.&amp;#62; (and layers) with baby blue. The wig is definitely very easy to use and put on, and there are straps to tie together the two sides of temple area (if that makes sense?) I believe its used so your wig doesnt fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore the wig to EDC and danced all night and didn&#x27;t have any problem. Head the wig on in the Vegas heat and it does get hot (from covering your own hair and the limited movement of your hair below since they&#x27;re all strapped in now, but that&#x27;s an inherent problem to all wigs.) This wig itself I think is very breathable and has no problems what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying my 2nd and 3rd wigs just to check if I can carry certain hair colors. 5/5 quality!</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t grey on the top but I still like it a lot.</li>
    <li> The one I got was NOT x and y. This one was blue and periwinkle. It didn&#x27;t fade in either. It was rough and dry feeling. It also shed a lot, my floor literally covered in random little hairs, and all I did was run my hand over it.</li>
    <li> It tangles way to easy and it hair fell out easy with a wig brush but other than that it was great wig.</li>
    <li> Nice wig, I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> i love it it so pretty i enjoyed wearing it thank you.</li>
    <li> I just got it today, it came in 13 and a hald days, and that&#x27;s because I live on the west coast of the United States. Color: almost exactly like the image, but with the expected difference in shade due to my screen. Very soft, feels real and looks healthy. The grey almost looks closer to brown for me, just slightly. The picture is very accurate. And I got the X&amp;Y Angel tag! Another great product! This is my third wig from this company and they haven&#x27;t disappointed me yet! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This wig is very nice and fits my head shape very well. The wig isn&#x27;t very heavy, but as with all wigs, may be hot in the summer. The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is very soft and looks extremely natural. I wore it to school and everyone was asking if it was my real hair or not, and that it looked very good on me. But there is one downfall to this wig. There may be a lot of loose hairs, but that may just be because I am used to very high quality wigs. I thought I would give a lower-priced wig a try, and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> The wig had come earlier than expected! But I feel there are a lot of issues with this wig I have purchased. The wig looks like it only has one tone which is all purple but if you look closely it has some brown and the wig sheds a lot. But over all it looks real and it feels soft and it fits perfectly for someone with a big head like mine!</li>
    <li> Got this item in and was a little worried that when it got here that it would not be the colors it showed in the picture. Glad to say that it looks exactly like it does in the picture. Love that it is thin and doesn&#x27;t shed much.</li>
    <li> Very good wig for the price,does tangle but not so much that it gets annoying. Looks natural nd fun to wear</li>
    <li> Finally wore this out, and loved it! It&#x27;s super soft and didn&#x27;t tangle really bad. It&#x27;s light and easy to wear. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This wig is true to color. A bit shiny, but it&#x27;s a given because it&#x27;s made from synthetic fibers. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using heat on it because it doesn&#x27;t take well to curls. Sheds a bit and I would keep a brush in your purse. Everyone believes this is my hair when I wear it. It&#x27;s cute and perfect for going out. I just purchased another X &amp; Y Angels wig :)</li>
    <li> I have this four stars because the color is way more blue than lavender.  Does not bother me.  I love it. I see a couple reviews that say it&#x27;s thin. I feel like for a 10$ wig it&#x27;s pretty full. Nice an long. </li>
    <li> My absolute favorite wig that I own, detangles easily, no bald spots, and it honestly just so pretty. I trimmed the bangs to go straight across, but you can honestly do whatever you like to them.</li>
    <li> The wig is surprisingly long and realistic. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed on the color though; it&#x27;s purple at the top and a lighter shade of purple at the bottom, which is nothing like the picture. I have a tan/brown color skin, so I didn&#x27;t think the wig matched really well with me. But I&#x27;ve been told it does so idk..</li>
    <li> It looks JUST like the picture, the color is perfect, just a little darker. but that&#x27;s the light :) It came early and is very nice and thick, everyone complemented me. It looks realistic, and feels realistic, got some leave in conditioner for it, good that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you use organic on a wig or not! LOVE THIS WIG</li>
    <li> The colours are totally wrong!</li>
    <li> good quality, but it is more gray at the top than lavender. my grandddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> aha. i bought the wig with high hopes, read through most of the reviews etc. so of course when it shows up i&#x27;m hella hyped. the wig i got wasn&#x27;t like the one shown though? it&#x27;s definitely black instead of gray and it doesn&#x27;t have the same style exactly? it&#x27;s still a really good wig, and i enjoy it, just not the wig i had ordered. so yeah, three stars because it&#x27;s still a very good wig, it&#x27;s got a good covering and it isn&#x27;t too heavy and it feels pretty nice, but it&#x27;s the wrong color and stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the bangs and the color. It is a little thin around the crown area. Over all it is a great wig for the price.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite wigs out of a 100+ collection.. It does not look exactly like the product description photo color wise (does not look gray on top in person, it is more of a purple blended with ashy brown on top which fades to completely purple ends. It looks like a muted purple which fades to a brighter purple, see the photo I posted. It is kind of thin but it looks realistic that way I think. I don&#x27;t have a problem with tracks showing. I love this wig but I wish the colors were exactly like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT*** please note I bought mine directly from X&amp;Y Angel and I can not vouch for other sellers, as I have bought a cheaper version of the same wig in the pink/brown color from another seller and the quality was much worse.</li>
    <li> Bangs very long, but otherwise ok.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome wig for the price. It&#x27;s a little thin, but it&#x27;s super soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that there seem to be no highlights-- the entire wig is a purpley color.  But that is alright.  It is still very great. :)  It came early, too.</li>
    <li> I wear wigs all the time! My experiences with wigs from Amazon haven&#x27;t always been fruitful, but THIS wig is one of my favorites out of my huge collection. The cap fits snugly over my very thick natural long hair, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or give me a headache. The color is  beautiful, a little more on the ashy grey side at the top (not as purple in the picture), but with the purple tints it looks magnificent. It doesn&#x27;t shed. It is thin enough to where tangles are hardly a problem. With proper care I know this wig will last me a long time. The bangs are long, however if you are not comfortable with cutting them, wearing them to the side with a clip looks cute and very doable. I was very impressed with this wig and am excited to get more like it. What a great find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping is a long wait, but that was to be expected and not a surprise. Packaging was perfect and it fit in my mailbox so it wouldn&#x27;t have to sit out in the rain. It came with a fish net wig cap, it is on the small side, however and probably won&#x27;t be of much use to me. I already have quite the collection of wig caps that work best for me. So if you have a large head or lots of hair I highly recommend you get a bigger wig cap.</li>
    <li> Color is pretty. It fits fine, but I wish it was a bit fuller.  The strands are thin.  Cute for cosplay costume.</li>
    <li> Its a really great wig. Its not as bright as in the picture, its more lavender. It came a week early. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely amazing and exactly how I pictured it! It&#x27;s soft, and isn&#x27;t tangled at all!:3 totally would get it. It is a little shiny but nothing a little dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix, if you are thinking of buying it, I say do it</li>
    <li> Bought this wig gor a friend and she loves it ^-^&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna have to buy one for myself as well, but the wig looks and feels great, also it looks as described which is nice :)&lt;br /&gt;My friend really enjoys it</li>
    <li> This is hands down by far the best wig I own! It&#x27;s looks real and it&#x27;s not too thin. This wig has been through everything with me and it&#x27;s still going strong! I love it! And for the price!!! Ugh I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> It doesnt feel fake like those cosplay wigs that you see at stores. It is really nice! It does have more purple than what it shows on the images and instead of that light gray color on top it is light brown. the shipping date Also came earlier then it said it would.its great!(:</li>
    <li> I love the color of this wig! its beautiful :D Arrived quickly and it is overall fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t LIKE marvelously accurate to the color but people did think it was real and I like to wear a beanie sometimes.  Kinda thin not as full as other wigs I&#x27;ve bought from these people but meh. It didn&#x27;t come in the x&amp;y angel packaging none of the wigs I bought did but I got tired of returning them so I just kept them. the third picture has a filter but the color is still nice it&#x27;s more of a between blue and purple but I wouldn&#x27;t say violet</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! It looks realistic and I&#x27;ve gotten so many complements! This is my first, so I was a little scared, but I&#x27;ve always wanted long  hair and never had the patience. Also, my actual hair is suffering from a case of &amp;#34; I dye my hair a new color every month &amp;#34; so I can let my hair get healthy, while hosting a social experiment!</li>
    <li> I like this wig a lot it is very soft not like the Halloween wigs which are extremely plastic. I love the color(light dark gray with a periwinkle)maybe its hard to describe not exactly as pictured. I might color my own hair i like it so much. I did mess with it a lot and tangled it and it still combed back straight and soft. I did cut shorter bangs  into wig. I don&#x27;t know if its the real brand because I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere on Amazon to actually buy from the actual retailer. But it is damn good for what I want it for. Some good ol cosplay. For the price its a must if u like to play around with wigs.</li>
