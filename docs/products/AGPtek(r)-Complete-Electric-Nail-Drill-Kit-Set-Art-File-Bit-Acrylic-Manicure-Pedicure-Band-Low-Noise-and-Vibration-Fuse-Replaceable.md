<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This drill works great with my gel nails - filing down, removing nail art and glitter, buffing, etc.  Its comfortable to hold also and I love the reverse feature.</li>
    <li> Great price! Product works perfect! And I love all the little extras they sent with the drill. Will definitely go to again when this one wears out!</li>
    <li> A few months ago I purchased the Babytree Pink Professional Drill on Amazon and loved it. However, after 2 months of use, &amp;lt;every 2 weeks, so 4 times total&gt;, I went to use it and it wouldn&#x27;t work. The base turned on but the hand drill did not work. I tried to get the drill bit out and it was stuck in there.&lt;br /&gt;SO I had to get another drill. I read many reviews on many drills, and this drill seemed to have the best reviews, so I ordered it. I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed is that this machine is VERY quiet! Compared to the BT Pink- this machine has no noise whatsoever. That is a plus all in itself! This machine has 25,000 RPMs and the pink one had 30,000, but it really isn&#x27;t that much of a difference. This drill does what I need it to so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m missing out. Not to mention the BT Pink base still works and the hand drill from this machine will fit in the Pink, so if need be, I could switch. The hand drill is a lot nicer as well, and although it&#x27;s very similar to the Pink one - the bits go in and come out much easier and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that.&lt;br /&gt;I had my nails done at the salon, by the same girl, for the past 17 years. I spent those 17 years watching how she did my nails, and after having a few drills, I think this is the closest I can get to her drill without paying hundreds of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the perfect drill for beginners, as well as the pro&#x27;s. For me, it&#x27;s great as I do my nails at home.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this drill. And the seller got it to me within 2 days, so that was a bonus!</li>
    <li> this is amazing I got it today a day after but its okay it was worth it it is awesome  if ur looking for a nail drill get this one wow!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!  I am an at-home ameteur looking for professional quality...found it!  Kit is complete with everything I could need.</li>
    <li> We own allready another one. Now my daughter wanted to have one ... We ordered it. It´s new and works well.</li>
    <li> This machine is okay a problem i have with it is that when filing close to my cuticles i have to have it on for speed so it wont stop spinning which is scary. Stops when a bit of pressure is applied.I would return it if i could!!</li>
    <li> Works great. We use it to file our dogs nails.</li>
    <li> love this.  Does what it says, easy to use, inexpensive for personal use!!</li>
    <li> I do my own gel nails, and this product is the best!! It&#x27;s very professional, easy to use, and well worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This drill came and is very nice! Came exactly as pictured and the drill bits all fit very nicely, Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and just as described  !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this drill a year and it already gave out and it vibrated really bad, hurt my clients and couldn&#x27;t use always. Never go cheap again. It would have been good for individuals but not business.</li>
    <li> So far so good, do not known how durable, and how long it will last, will update in the future.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and fair price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Works well. I had no issues with the drill kit and comes with some extras. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work when I got it in the mail. The company was good about returning the broken one in just a couple days.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Totally satisfied with my purchase:)</li>
    <li> Sister in-law school gift, really enjoys product, price is good and works to her liking, good buy for person going to school for cosmetology.</li>
    <li> I do my own acrylic nails and this is just perfect. I love the attachments and the speed control. Highly recommend to anyone doing their own nails or professionally in moderation.</li>
    <li> This nail drill kit is awesome! Just like the ones that are used at the salons. Power/drill speed is not an issue and the different file heads are really handy.</li>
    <li> I was super disappointed when I received my order only to find it didn&#x27;t work when I plugged it in.... whomp,whomp...boo! The upside is they respond quickly to my email and refunded my money. You get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect drill! It also has a lot of power and is durable! Handle doens&#x27;t get hot either.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this drill! Very little vibration and quiet compared to other drills I&#x27;ve owned. Best drill I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Product was received timely, packaged very well,  and in working order.  The drill works extremely well,  in fact just like the salon.</li>
    <li> Works great for home salon.  Powerful and lightweight. I haven&#x27;t had any clients complain about vibration.</li>
    <li> Bought this product thinking I was get professional quality and what I got was equipment with a cheap motor that burned out the first day I used it.</li>
    <li> Great for the price..</li>
    <li> Love it! My nails look great. It cuts big time the time I know used to spent filing my nails! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. No complaints. Would def recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great drill but I&#x27;ve had to buy five of them because the motor goes in these.  They are just the right price though and work well so, I cant help but buy another.  They are very easy to work although I have never tried the foot pedal.  This one from this company has been the best so far because, it came with a few little extras and to me that was a very nice surprise and worth it.</li>
    <li> Great! It&#x27;s awesome. I love how smooth it runs and how easy it is to use. The best drill ever!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Returned. I was disappointed, and purchased a smaller, home type file for a beginner like me to use.</li>
    <li> This is the second machine I ordered. The previous one broke immediately, I mean one nail.  I was hesitant to reorder but this one works well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the drill for a good month now. So far so good. I rated 4 stars because after a while of using the drill it gets a little hot. But it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Bought extra bits as it only comes with the basoc bits but works beautifully</li>
    <li> Great drill! It has good power and is easy to handle and use. I used the drill bits that were sent with the drill and they worked fine, but I personally prefer the gold carbide bits. So I&#x27;ll purchase one to use with this drill. But for the price this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> i love this machine!! i use it to give myself a manicure and am trying to use for my acrylic nails but havent got the hang on making my nails look professional.  the machine works great though! thank you!</li>
    <li> Enjoying it I love it</li>
    <li> It is an amazing set it is easy to set up and a breeze to use.I got it 3 days after I ordered it and it works really well. I think it is a great tool and very easy to set up.</li>
    <li> I received this drill today. Started doing my own acrylic nailed at home last weekend. I thought I could do them without a drill but I was so wrong! After looking at what felt like a million drills on Amazon, I decided to go with this one. It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;My nails turned out REALLY well this time and I have the drill to thank for it. It&#x27;s very quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate my hands too much. Got a little warm but I was using it for a long time since I am new to using the drill and doing acrylics. I am so happy I got this little gem!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, I was amazed by the power and ease of the machine. I&#x27;m no expert however, the manicure set is an excellent buy for beginners.</li>
    <li> I recently started doing my own nails at home.  Although this drill isn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34;, it gets the job done.  The speed adjustment is great and the forward/reverse option is a big plus.  Worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works like gem!!</li>
    <li> This thing got way too hot way too fast! I would drill one nail and it would be too hot to even touch! Piece of garbage!</li>
    <li> Has not failed me yet</li>
    <li> The AGPtek® Complete Electric Nail Drill Kit Set Art File Bit Acrylic Manicure. is really nice for my teenage daughters,They love doing each others manicure ,And off course, I love it.Nice and handy</li>
    <li> I am a professional and use my drill daily.  It does vibrate some and it does get warm.  It&#x27;s a good starter drill for professionals,  if you don&#x27;t have the money to put out for a great drill.</li>
    <li> I love my AGPtek drill. The price was fantastic. I wish that it came with a couple of really good quality carbide drill bits, but that&#x27;s ok, you can find those anywhere. THe ones it does come with get the job done very adequately. It works perfect!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It works, it&#x27;s not loud and the price was exceptional . It was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This nail drill was ordered to replace another brand that went a little &amp;#34;haywire.&amp;#34;  It arrived quickly and had a few goodies with it, including a pack of sanding bands, some rhinestones to decorate your nails and a buffer. The main machine seems well built and the handle is comfortable to use. Be sure you reads the easy instructions regarding the use of the on and off button and how it relates to the foot pedal or hand control.  I sure hope this little machine lasts longer than the previous brand I purchased.  I&#x27;m trying to do my manicures ( gels) at home to save $ and the time it takes to drive to an appt. You really need this type of nail drill kit to sand off hard gels.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much!!!  I love it!  I didnt think itd be this powerful!!  This is a wonderful machine and is exactly what I wanted!! 💜💜</li>
    <li> First I did receive this super fast-no issue there. The equipment itself does not seem to be made to use it as frequently as I would like. The foot pedal never worked and the drill piece itself gets SUPER hot when in use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great to shave hubbies claws. Love this product, I recommend this to anyone who has been scratched in the night by a mean toe nail, be it your spouses or your own. This works great</li>
    <li> Cords: The base unit is labeled, so you don&#x27;t have to guess where to connect the drill or foot pedal. If sitting at a desk, they are long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:  You can leave the foot pedal plugged in and flip the switch to use the drill in an &amp;#34;always on&amp;#34; mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed:  Smooth dial for fine adjustments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction:  Time will tell, of course, but the unit is heavy and solid.  The foot pedal is appropriately sensitive to pressure and responsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refills:  uses industry standard-sized drill bits and bands</li>
    <li> I wrote a positive review (5 stars) when I bought this drill 7 months ago. I used it for 6 months and was very happy with it. Then I had a problem with the drill not starting. Not knowing if the product had a warranty, I contacted BD. With their high commitment to customer satisfaction, they replaced the drill immediately. I have received it and it is running great. Even with good products we sometimes need a good warranty standing behind them. With BD I found that to be true. I would buy this product again and especially from BD, knowing their level of commitment to customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> SUCKS!!!! Used it like five times and it broke</li>
    <li> this is a very good deal!!!! and it works very good with the right pieces i am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical bc it&#x27;s so inexpensive and foreign, it came sooner than expected on the day it was to arrive..I ran to the ups truck like a kid on xmas morning.. opened and plugged it in and I am AMAZED! Worked great! Kept up with all my clients the whole day, had power to get thru the acrylic quickly &amp; came with lots of fun little gems and extra sanding bits, etc.. the only thing I did notice is the hand piece gets a bit heavy and the cushion could be lower for where I need to hold it, but overall I&#x27;m super stoked on it. Best 40$ invested in awhile! Its a must buy again for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so thankfull I got this drill.... I looked for a long time and kept hesitating for one reason or another. I finally chose this one because of the price, the reviews, the bits and the pedal (although I have not used the pedal yet but its very professional)&lt;br /&gt;I use the drill to file down my Gel nails to do fills and rebuilding. The grit tips work the fastest for me (and it came with a whole bunch of replacements) and I use the highest setting so I can apply good pressure without the drill slowing. The lower setting work great to if I&#x27;m doing something more gentle, I use one of the cone shaped attachments to remove the cuticles around my toes or my fingers to prepare the nail for the gel. I use the drill continuously for at least 20+ min sometimes to remove gel on my nails and toes and it will get a little hot on the handle but I&#x27;ve never had a problem even working it that hard. (I guess the pedal might prevent that since it can wind down between nails but I have to yet to try) I love this drill and if you want one that feels and works like your at the salon, you will too.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever write a review. I ordered this because I read a lot of good reviews about it. I am really not happy with this drill at all. The sanding band is either too small or too big for the drill bits plus the drill bits sucks! I contacted the seller and still waiting for the respond so we will see!</li>
    <li> Great works pissah!!! Just like the ones at salon. Will have to invest in better tips but equipment is great</li>
    <li> So far I love i.  I purposely took of my acrylic nails just I could use it the day I got it. Mind I had been using a very cheap drill from Walmart so trying to get bumps out of acrylic were not that easy.  But I used this drill and it cut my time in half.  Like other reviews it does get slight warm while using and the drill bits r slightly hard to get out but whatever.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> About the seller....&lt;br /&gt;My device arrived on the day  it was expected and was neatly packaged. I would definitely order from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product...&lt;br /&gt;Simply Amazing!!!  First of all, it can be used with or without the foot pedal that comes in the packaging. If the machine is Off and the foot pedal is connected, then you can control when the machine is operational. If the machine is On, then the drill continuously spins whether or not the foot pedal is connected. This info is in the instructions. Some people wrote their sanders did not fit the drill bits. I did not have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first manicure....&lt;br /&gt;I figured this out pretty quickly. My natural technique was to use small sweeping motions and move the wand toward my body. I figured out to use the Forward setting on my right hand and to use the Reverse setting on my left hand. This will avoid skipping on your nail and drilling your skin. Maybe this will help someone else. It just depends on your natural rhythm. If you sweep the drill away from your body, just do the opposite. I did not use a back and forth motion because at some point I was skidding off my nail and getting skin which is not a good thing. Fortunately, I kept the speed setting low and did not draw any blood. A lower setting helped with control. My nails turned out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con though...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I pressed too hard or the sander bit was too course but there are streak marks in my nails. Actually, I used acrylic on my natural nails, so the streaks are in the acrylic. But this can be easily covered with polish. Its not really a con. More like an observation. Maybe once I get the hang of it, I can correct this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am loving this drill. It is exactly what I needed. I&#x27;ve decided to stop going to the salon and paying someone else. I learned how to apply the acrylic by watching dozens of YouTube tutorials. This machine will pay for itself in no time. I wouldmost definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Using it for the first time it stop an starts, this not how it suppose to work returning product unless they can tell me how to fix it. Will update this once issue is resolved</li>
    <li> Worls good but uhm the foot pedal doesn&#x27;t work ....</li>
    <li> Works great really fast and cuts the timing to finish nails quicker</li>
    <li> So easy to use and works great. I&#x27;ve never left a review for anything, so this says a lot. I think the price was great and even if it only lasts six months I&#x27;ll just buy another. I want to thank the seller for keeping the pricing down on a product that is great!!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and easy to use. I am not a professional nail tech, so for me it does the job. I only apply gel overlay to my nails and this does the job quickly and saves me lots of time. the price was just right for all of the things it comes with. i didn&#x27;t use the foot pedal, but it&#x27;s nice to have. The rhinestones are nice and a good addition to the purchase. As well as all the extra&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new nail drill, so I came on amazon and looked through a lot of them and I found this one and knew it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t so expensive b/c I&#x27;m a future nail tech who works in my home. I love the speed control and the pedal. I love love love this e-file NO COMPLAINTS</li>
    <li> It came much faster that I expected. I bought one to try it out. I had purchased another brand previously and had a bad experience with it and the company. So, I was giving another company and drill a chance. I&#x27;m very glad that I did. It works beautifully. So much so, that I am ordering another.</li>
    <li> Bought. Took care of it. Used 10-15 xs and it quit. Great features but no good broke! Junk</li>
    <li> I bought this drill for my wife and she used it 4 times before it stopped working all together. It heated up and burned one of her clients and she had the speed on low. My wife is very upset and does not recommend anyone buying this drill its a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this product deserves some recognition. I frequently get my nails done at the salon. I have been to every nail salon in my city. I finally got tired of spending so much money on my nails, so I decided to start doing them myself. I was reviewing other nail drill set, but seen some flaky reviews. I decided on this one, after reading nothing but positive results. I must say it is exactly like the drill set they use on your hands in the salon. It is really powerful and get&#x27;s the job done. I am highly satisfied with my at home salon kit. It also has plenty of extra pieces to replace the file when it wears down. I Highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my girl and she is very happy with it, she loves it. she never used one before, she is learning fast and no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> It does not have the power that I thought it would. But I guess that whats happen when you buy cheaper items. The more you pay the better quality you will recieve. Lesson learn the hard way..</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to do my nails, and just one month later the machine has broken. I have only used the machine a total of 2 times. It started by constantly turning off and now it won&#x27;t work at all. Not to mention that it isn&#x27;t quite like it claims to be. I think that this is a waist of money. I have purchased cheaper machines before that have lasted longer. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> I was disapointed to find immediatly that this drill actually DOES vibrate, to the point that it was uncomfortable for my clients. Had i never used an electric file befor, i may have thaught this was normal. It doesnt have a locking devise in the wand for the bit, so there is play. The little add ons in the box were nice but really in the end, its the drill. Probly okay for the occational use.</li>
    <li> So handy for doing nails on my time. Easy to operate. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for were the extra drill bits that came with it, they looked as if they were just thrown together. Not bad though...</li>
    <li> Used this tonight for the first time.  While I am new at this, it seemed to go well.  If it continues to work like it did tonight, this will be an excellent purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update It is now January 2014 and my drill is still working like a charm.  I will say though that now I am using carbide bits with it instead of the ones that came with it and I love it even more!</li>
    <li> Thank you soooo much Brainydeal, I love my electric nail file. It&#x27;s something I have been wanting for a long time and I picked the perfect seller to buy it from!!! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> The foot pedal don&#x27;t work but my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good drill for the price. Perfect speed for novice tech..minor vibration on the highest speed. Worth every penny. Once u get comfortable with e filing, you may want to upgrade to higher rpm and leas vibration</li>
    <li> ITS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!! WORKS REALLY WELL!! I AM A NAIL TECH STUDENT AND THIS IS PERFECT!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS NAIL DRILL TO ANYONE!! ITS JUST AS GREAT AS THE ONES IN THE NAIL SHOP!!</li>
    <li> DRILL WENT OUT ON MY FIRST NAIL THE PEDAL NEVER WORKED</li>
    <li> I purchased this drill to replace the Nails Art Professional Manicure Electric Nail Drill File&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the Amazon link if you are uncertain of the tool previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the Amazon link if you are uncertain of the tool previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Nails-Professional-Manicure-Electric-Drill/dp/B004N2EYY4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1351104366&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;nail+drills+for+acrylic+nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nails Art Professional Manicure Electric Nail Drill File worked well for about one month and completely stopped during acrylic fill in filing and got extremely hot while operating too hot to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched this nail file set and it appear to seem durable. So far so good I can immediately tell the difference. The only downfall is I wish that I would have purchased 30000 rpm for faster speed. The product is a good by for your money.</li>
    <li> I gave it five stars because it helps me not have to attend the nail salon. I think I can do my manicures and pedicures better than anyone else has with my personal file. It has not been used on anyone but me so I don&#x27;t have to worry about whose hands and feet have used my file. It was shipped quickly and all parts were intact and packaged neatly in the box. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my nail tech, and she loves it! She said the attachments could be better quality!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. Now I can do my nails at home! yay :)&lt;br /&gt;So anyways...this kit comes with everything in the picture, and it works just fine. It is easy to use and works, all that matters to me.</li>
    <li> Great drill for the price. It comes with a lot of extras too! This would be good for someone just starting school.</li>
    <li> This drill is exactly what I was looking for.  It is strong enough to file off gel nails or gentle enough to work around the cuticles.  My this was a gift from my husband and I really like.  Certainly, I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> When I received this I was so excited to start my new journey doing my own sets for myself and y daughters. I remember opening the box and was so surprised because it turned out to be so much better than I expected. It was priced so cheap, I thought the quality would also be cheap. But it is very well made and would totally buy this again if I ever needed to!</li>
    <li> This nail drill works just like the professional salons machines. The drill is easy to use and comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> I like this electric nail drill it works very well doesn&#x27;t bog down very  I definitely recommend this product  to all. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a beginner and this tool is perfect and easy to learn how to use! i love it ! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it ^_^</li>
    <li> This Drill kit is easy to use and works like a charm. I find The purchase was well worth not having to sit in a nail salon and wait to be served.</li>
    <li> I had this drill for just over a month and it no longer works. There is power going to the box but the hand piece wont work. I was hoping it was the fuse but it wasn&#x27;t. Im really upset about this!</li>
    <li> this was the first drill i bought to do my own acrylics. So far so good. its very quiet, i can do my nails in the livingroom with the baby asleep and he doesnt get disurbed. doesnt get too hot. i have already recommended this to another person!</li>
    <li> I love this drill, it really gets the job done.... The only con about it, is that the hand piece gets hot, other tan the its GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> THIS MACHINE IS WONDERFUL.....IT IS SO EASY TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS YOU DONT HAVE TO GO TO THE SALON!  GREAT  AND REALLY WORTH THE MONEY!  THE COMPANY IS VERY ATTENTIVE AND EASY TO DO BUSINESS WITH!  THANKS</li>
    <li> I got this drill in November and have used it maybe 20 times to drill off gel nails. It started shorting out at the base where the hand piece plugs in and now it won&#x27;t work at all. Very disappointed because I can&#x27;t get even a partial refund. This still was a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
    <li> great product came fast and with a lot of bonuses for a great price. hope it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing nails for over 35 years and have had several nail machines. This machine is just perfect for me and especially great is the ability to use the foot pedal or the switch for running the drill. This is a well made machine and I would recommend this for professional nail techs and at home users.</li>
    <li> got it for my nails..but found it was even &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; for my feet....became a foot saver!  Still learning how to use it</li>
    <li> Cause it don&#x27;t work , is broken , has a lot of vibration ,doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power ,</li>
    <li> awesome product, does get hot but i dont use it for professional use so its great for me</li>
    <li> I love this kit, although I think that a little prior knowledge is helpful.  The drill works well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been a Nail Tec for over 20 years.  I have to say this drill is better than any I have ever purchased before.  The best deal ever and I cannot find anything I do not like about it.  I have use all kinds of drills too and this beats them all.</li>
    <li> This nail file system not only meets but exceeds all my expectations! I absolutely love it. I will be looking too see if there are more of the things I need. Thanks for the great deal!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a beginner at this nail tech stuff and I believe that I chose the right drill to start with. im still a little rough around the edges with it lol however I do love the drill. I would suggest to buy better drill bits however which I already have on the way. my drill was used for about three hours and it didn&#x27;t get hot. it got a tad warm but not like I thought it would. it came with everything that it says it would come with and it was very nicely packaged. it did come a day late  for me however I didn&#x27;t mind the wait I was just so ready to get my hands on it lol&lt;br /&gt;hope this was helpful for someone out there I know the reviews I read helped me out a lot.</li>
    <li> Very good buy. I love it. Durable. No lie  it was better than I expected. Hope it lasts me long tho.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student and I was looking for a drill that was durable, easy to handle and versatile. This drill met all those requirements and had my fellow classmates excited about getting one! It&#x27;s nice to see a product that is affordable but still has the quality that you don&#x27;t really expect!! Thank you Brainydeal or whoever but I&#x27;m sending more customers your way!</li>
    <li> This drill is really grate  it really gets the job you need dun really fast I certainly recamened  to by this product</li>
    <li> I ordered this about a week ago, it came with everything it works great , nothing was broken spilled or out of place. I just love it and it came quickly!!! Thank Amazon !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just received this a few days ago. I do at home gel nails, and this is perfect! great for artificial or acrylic nails. Not cheap whatsoever. Wonderfully made. And I love that this set includes some rhinestones and other things as well:) great price. I have spent over 100 dollars on something of similar quality. great purchase!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot, but the foot pedal doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> First time using a drill . Easy to use wish had instructions for each tool. It does tend to get hot quickly when set on high speed . So far so good only had it few days but have used it for 3 sets of acrylic nails already</li>
    <li> This drill is awesome. It works perfectly. I haven&#x27;t used the foot pedal yet but the hand held is nice.</li>
    <li> I REALLY DONT LIKE THE BITS,TO ME THERES NOT ENOUGH GRIP TO SMOOTH THE ACRYLIC,WHICH TAKES IT LONGER TO SMOOTH</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews, but I felt I had to say something about this nail drill - because I had such a disappointing experience with it. I purchased the kit about 6 months ago and it worked beautifully for a while. I used it less than 20 times during this period and always handled it and stored it with care. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped working - the unit wouldn&#x27;t turn on when plugged in. I sent an e-mail to BrainyDeal customer service and they ignored it. At less than $50, this is a competitively priced professional nail kit, but it&#x27;s a total waste of money if it will only last you a few months. At this point, I have had better luck with battery-powered nail kit sets purchased at discount stores for less than $10 that have lasted me for years. Very disappointed with this purchase and definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend either this item or this seller.</li>
    <li> Works great ...... light weight and small but powerful. It was able to fit perfectly in my drawer</li>
    <li> Only used 1 year before it quit</li>
    <li> Works very well and doesn&#x27;t get hot like I thought it would. Great product. I would recommend this drill to anyone.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome machine for regular nails AND acrylic/gel nails.</li>
    <li> Came on time an with everything inside nothing was damaged an it was completely new but when I went to try it out it didnt work not even a little vibrating nothing im going to just stick to using nail files ....so disappointed &#x3D;&#x60;(</li>
    <li> I have to totally guess what drill bit is for what purpose?  So irritating because I cannot use it to it&#x27;s full potential.  The only plus it that it did come quickly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get my nail bit out... It was hard to push in and now it&#x27;s impossible to get out.. Can anyone help me?</li>
</ol>
