      <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
      <li>I have tried it after putting a moisturizer on and before and id say it works best using it without having moisturizer on.</li>
      <li>Also when using it on your hands and feet it works best to use the mitt and just pat it on those areas rather than rubbing it in.  </li>
      <li>Great color and going to continue to this!</li>
      <li>This is probably the best tanning product I have ever used.  </li>

      <li>Quick and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>But overall,  wonderful,  natural color.</li>
      <li>I love the mitt and followed the directions, starts tanning pretty quickly, after a day</li>

      <li>It goes on easily and gives a gorgeous bronze shimmer that is not too orange and not too green</li>
      <li>It takes a little maintenance, but it really is a great product.</li>
      <li>After it developed over a couple hours, I was a bit more brown, it wasn&#x27;t orangey at all.</li>
      <li>i exfoliated, did two full coats on my body and the bottle still was almost full, so i was happy that it would be lasting me a long time.</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product much.</li>
      <li>But, make sure to moisturize the rough spots before hand, elbows and knees.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>, it looks natural and spreads on pretty evenly.</li>
      <li>Aside from that, I get a ton of compliments on the color of the tanner, everyone was pretty surprised by how natural it looked!</li>
      <li>Tan looks natural!!</li>
      <li>I wear Soft Ivory or Classic Ivory foundation if that helps you any..</li>

      <li>And had spots where it completely came off.</li>
      <li>natural on my too white skin, not orangey.  </li>

<li> Tan looks natural!!</li>
<li> I wear Soft Ivory or Classic Ivory foundation if that helps you any..</li>
<li> It really gives you a deep bronzed tan look.</li>
<li> And had spots where it completely came off.</li>
<li> natural on my too white skin, not orangey.  </li>
<li> It gives the same natural color and only goes on dry not wet.</li>
<li> I have been using St. Tropez for some years now which I still love although St. Tropez takes longer to dry than Fake Bake.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry well and even was coming off next day.</li>
<li> it wasn&#x27;t until a few days later that my skin was looking patchy, especially my chest.</li>
<li> I will be using this for a long time!!</li>
<li> It does have a slight odor, but definitely recommend!</li>
<li> You can see where you put it so streaking is minimal.  </li>
<li> But, I took a star off because the mitt that is given to help you put on the tanner, starts to shed off after a couple uses, leaving your skin covered with black fuzzies.</li>
<li> I was in the shower and rubbed it slightly with my hand (not exfoliating)</li>
<li> Makes a mess.</li>
<li> This streaks like crazy and my skin color has patches of white in different places!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m gonna have to rub it all off and restart with each application so it won&#x27;t be uneven.</li>
<li> it is messy</li>
<li> (I find San Tropez too green for me).</li>
<li> I am half Portuguese and half Scottish,I usually get real dark in summer,but I am trying to avoid skin cancer.</li>
<li> Received mine and they both spilled out by the time I received them :/</li>
<li> It only took about five applications for mine to get like this, so I was a little disappointed on the front.</li>
<li> Seriously!</li>
<li> The worst thing is,it&#x27;s too late to send back.</li>
<li> I just hate the smell, I wish they could figure that out...  </li>
<li> This stuff is horrible.</li>
<li> Awful!</li>

    <li> Awesome product! Tan looks natural!!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, and very realistic look.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have tried. It goes on easily and gives a gorgeous bronze shimmer that is not too orange and not too green (I find San Tropez too green for me). This is my absolute favorite and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Awful! I looked for 2 weeks, read all the reviews of various products. This streaks like crazy and my skin color has patches of white in different places! I just wanted a healthy looking color. The worst thing is,it&#x27;s too late to send back.</li>
    <li> This product goes on easy, with the results you want. I do npt use the mitt that comes with it, i just use latex gloves. The smell is not bad at all.. love it.</li>
    <li> definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I received an order of two and was so excited at first! i exfoliated, did two full coats on my body and the bottle still was almost full, so i was happy that it would be lasting me a long time. also, it smelled super good, unlike a lot of self tanners. After it developed over a couple hours, I was a bit more brown, it wasn&#x27;t orangey at all. So i was loving it. it wasn&#x27;t until a few days later that my skin was looking patchy, especially my chest. I was in the shower and rubbed it slightly with my hand (not exfoliating) and it was rubbing right off. It wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, since I could just apply again, but I was looking so patchy all over! I&#x27;m gonna have to rub it all off and restart with each application so it won&#x27;t be uneven. looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking with my neutrogena spray that seems to stain my skin instead of adding a tan film over it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Looks real!</li>
    <li> Fast service and great product!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best tanning product I have ever used.  I just hate the smell, I wish they could figure that out...  it is messy so do it in the shower or tub.  You can see where you put it so streaking is minimal.  I will be using this for a long time!!</li>
    <li> I really like this tanner for its color, it looks natural and spreads on pretty evenly. But, I took a star off because the mitt that is given to help you put on the tanner, starts to shed off after a couple uses, leaving your skin covered with black fuzzies.

    <li> I Love this product! I am half Portuguese and half Scottish,I usually get real dark in summer,but I am trying to avoid skin cancer. This is so easy and looks so real! I love the mitt and followed the directions, starts tanning pretty quickly, after a day, I look like I was out on the beach! Great price! Will be ordering again, I ordered 2 bottles right away after reading the reviews!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Quick and easy to apply.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to come off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural on my too white skin, not orangey.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do well on airplane ride in suitcase tho.. lucky I put in a Ziploc!</li>
    <li> Need to order extra mits. Once they have fuzzies  on it, it leaves streaks. But overall,  wonderful,  natural color.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have been using St. Tropez for some years now which I still love although St. Tropez takes longer to dry than Fake Bake. It gives the same natural color and only goes on dry not wet. You can see the color right away and then it gradually gets darker. It does some what spray everywhere especially if your spraying your legs it may spray on the ground but easy to clean up. Awesome stuff. Comes out extremely even and smells good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It really gives you a deep bronzed tan look. Especially if you have a darker skin tone. It goes on good. Just make sure you exfoliate well before you apply or it will wash right off.</li>
    <li> Ok, this self tanner is the best you can get! Seriously! Such a flawless tan if you exfoliate before hand.. I have tried it after putting a moisturizer on and before and id say it works best using it without having moisturizer on. I have heard different but for me it just seems to come off quicker using a moisturizer before. But, make sure to moisturize the rough spots before hand, elbows and knees.  Also when using it on your hands and feet it works best to use the mitt and just pat it on those areas rather than rubbing it in.  I have tried multiple self tanners and have fair skin.. I wear Soft Ivory or Classic Ivory foundation if that helps you any.. I have over 5 bottles of this stuff lol.</li>
    <li> Great color and going to continue to this!</li>
    <li> really great.  No smell - wonderful</li>
    <li> Great product.  Best self tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product that goes on without streaking and leaves you with a great tan. It does have a slight odor, but definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible.Doesn&#x27;t dry well and even was coming off next day.Makes a mess.And had spots where it completely came off.The color is nice but that&#x27;s about it.</li>

    <li> Absolutely the best self tanner I have ever tried! I have tried SO many brands and most end up the garbage can.</li>
    <li> A friend told me good this product was, and I have to agree. It&#x27;s the healthiest way to tan. It dries fast, goes on easy and looks very natural. It takes a little maintenance, but it really is a great product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product much. It was pretty easy to apply, but it turned me orange.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Next best to tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! No orange color. I look like I&#x27;ve layed out all day and have a beautiful summer glow. Fast shipping. This product will definitely keep me out of a tanning bed.</li>
