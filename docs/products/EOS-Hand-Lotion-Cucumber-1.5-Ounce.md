<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have a couple of the Chapsticks..cause it&#x27;s not lip gloss. Saw this and wanted to c how it was. Small and cute for the purse.</li>
    <li> Even though this pocket sized bottle is a little pricey for its size, I just love this lotion so I bought it anyway. It makes my hands and shoulders very soft-- great for stressed out summer skin and the scent is fresh and light. I love the compact shape of the bottle as well. The downside--it wont last very long.</li>
    <li> Great stuff bought mine last night at Kroger for 1.99</li>
    <li> Love the scent and got at a good price of $2.  I really like the EOS brand and this little container is the perfect size to fit in my purse, which is just what I wanted.  I love the Cucumber scent and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for someone that I ordered late (but it still made it on time) and they love it!</li>
    <li> Good, not fantastic product. We love the lip balm but this is a bit watery and very small for what it is. My wife may feel differently but as a guy, I think they could spare a little more than what&#x27;s in here. It&#x27;s tiny.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I work at a cafe and dishes always need to be done. The soap we use is terrible on your hands. I use to have pretty nice hands, but now they are dry to the bone. I bought this for the size and the brands reputation and I must say this did not disappoint. I think people who said it had too strong of a smell have sensitive noses, and if you are sensitive to smell get something unscented? Because in my opinion this has a pretty light scent to it but it&#x27;s a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Most lotions are to greasy but this makes my hand feel baby soft, with no grease feeling.</li>
    <li> I really adore this hand lotion. Feels really nice and absorbs very fast. The only thing is how tiny it is! I mean, I only paid 2 bucks, and I do think it&#x27;s worth it, I just wish it came in a bigger size!! I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> EOS has really great products, we have bought a lot of their products and have always been pleased. The smell is also very nice.</li>
    <li> It has nice smell but no comparison to hand cream.  Maybe ok for summer time.  Will not buy it again!</li>
    <li> The scent of this lotion is beyond amazing! I love the small size too!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Absorbs quickly! Smells great!</li>
    <li> EOS is popular for a reason - it works.  Lovely scent and easy to carry in my purse!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now. It has a pleasantly sweet smell. But both the smell and the lotion itself wears off very fast, especially if you&#x27;re just putting it on on-the-go. Now in winter that it&#x27;s so dry and cold, my hands are desperately in need for moisturising, but I found that I had to keep on reapplying every fifteen minutes because it wears off so fast before my skin could absorb it.</li>
    <li> I used to love this lotion but can never find it anymore and I love the other eos products.&lt;br /&gt;It came early in the original packaging as well. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I love it and I will keep buying it&lt;br /&gt;smell good and doing good and Ilike the shape</li>
    <li> Smells really really good. The case is really small though- not much lotion in this one but that might be what you&#x27;re looking for to fit in your bag or purse</li>
    <li> It is on the very small size but i use it for my school backpack. smells really good works great love all the Eos products</li>
    <li> Love the light scent and kept my hands soft!</li>
    <li> Hello this product is excellent and thank you, you accelerated access was very fast I will recommend my friends, I thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;  This product is excellent</li>
    <li> Nice smell and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the lip balm too.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly into the skin, which I love.</li>
    <li> beautiful scent very useful for dry hands 😄😄😄😄👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  The size is perfect to carry in your purse or backpack . Great product to get as add on</li>
    <li> Its a really nice lotion and it smells really nice! It also has a cool/ unique shape to it thats different.</li>
    <li> It smells great, I have very dry hands so it helps moisturize them and the packaging is really cool. Definite re-purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this as part of a gift, since I love the smell of cucumber and am always using hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I like the lotion at first, especially the smell. It didn&#x27;t moisturize my hands for very long, but I was able to overlook that and just use more.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is a point where this to makes it extremely difficult to get more lotion out. It is also not the type of tube that can be refilled. I am currently trying to squeeze as much out of the tube as possible, and it is now very difficult to get any out even though I know that there is still some more in there.&lt;br /&gt;Two full stars off for the tube. One star off because the moisture doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife at Christmas a stocking stuffer.... she loves it and it smells great.  It&#x27;s definitely cucumber scent, but really also has a melon scent to it as well.</li>
    <li> Works fast. Smells so good. Bought one for every female on my list for Christmas.  They all loved it too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful. I like the fact that it&#x27;s so small and compact but also that it keeps your hand really looking good. The smell is a little strong in the beginning but it lightens up a bit after a while. You don&#x27;t need much because a little goes a long way. I wanted to buy 6 but your limited to only 3. I&#x27;ll add more onto a purchase I&#x27;ll be make soon, hopefully there still in stock.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful and fits in a pocket in my purse.  Love it. Sometimes gets air in it and has to be squeezed multiple times.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. One thing that made me mad was that I lost this in the gym and could not find it maybe someone stole it and thought it smelled good too and decided to keep it.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. Leaves my hands feeling so good!i am so happy how good my hands look.... Just wish it came in a larger bottle</li>
    <li> Thank you love the lotion!</li>
    <li> I really like EOS products, they really help with dry skin and lips.  I like the smell of this cucumber and haven&#x27;t seen it available in stores, so it was nice to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Good scent and nice texture.  It fades into my skin like it is supposed to with no greasy feel to it.  I like the shape of the bottle because it&#x27;s different and easy to find in my purse.  The lid is not as easy to get off as some, my hands are arthritic, but that&#x27;s not a huge problem.  It&#x27;s sort of fun to play with if you are thinking and need a tactile type toy to distract that part of your mind.</li>
    <li> It smella really great and it leaves your hands feeling auper soft :) I just wish it came in a bigger ammount, 1.5 ounces is so little!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brand, especially the lip balm, so I said what the heck, for such a low price I&#x27;ll try it. Smells great, super smooth. Highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> Smells good and it feels good.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it makes hands soft and it&#x27;s so convenient to carry in the purse or jacket pocket. Smells great too not too strong.</li>
    <li> made with natural oils, it leaves hands soft but not greasy. I just wish it was a little bigger bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> Was just ok...not enough lotion for the price.</li>
    <li> The lotion smelled really good, however it was a very small container and I didn&#x27;t feel it helped my dry hands any better than plain lotion and was a bit more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful the Cucumber smell is just amazing. It&#x27;s smells so good. I had gotten this for a friend but I&#x27;m giving her a different one cause I love that way this one smells and I&#x27;m never a fan of the cucumber lotion but this one is amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It nourishes my dry hands and smells great. It does not leave a greasy or sticky feeling either. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry hands who hates using sticky greasy lotions.</li>
    <li> nice cream, smell great and not too harsh for my sensitive skin. This is a great size my my handbag, my only issue is that although it moisturizes well, it doesn&#x27;t last long as the cream a bit on the thin side.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion is great, it is moisturizing but not greasy, smells nice but not too strong. It is the perfect hand lotion in my opinion. The bottle is very cute and easy to carry as well.</li>
    <li> Smells good!  It&#x27;s not a very large container BUT this makes it perfect to take with you on the go.  It&#x27;d be nice to have a larger size for keeping at home.</li>
    <li> This is a good size to keep in my smallest purse, smells great and absorbs easily. Packaging was excessive in my opinion though.</li>
    <li> I saw this was cruelty free so I tried it, so glad because I love this cucumber hand lotion, not greasy like other lotions. Smells great. You think it might be expensive but you only need a few drops.</li>
    <li> Our daughter legs eos so we got this for Christmas, it is a very nice hand lotion with a light scent and goes on nicely.  Not sticky or watery, just right.  Good size for a purse.</li>
    <li> Compact and perfect for carrying in a purse or taking on a trip especially on a cold weather. Also very pleasant smell and texture</li>
    <li> This product is cool. It has a really nice fragrance,  and I literalIy just applied it and noticed how powerful the scent really is. You only need a few drops and the scent lights up the entire room. Definately turns heads... You may be asked to share with others at this point, but only if you choice too. ;). Its not too oily or greasy, and I finally found it at an awesome price. More stars! I like the one that smells like some type of flower, (floral) in the darker green color I think it is... That one is Lovely in my opinion! Now Im just waiting on the Blossom (pink).</li>
    <li> good lotion but barely any in the package.  doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as happy with this product. The lotion took a long time to rub in and it was hard to get out of the tube.</li>
    <li> I love it makes my hands super soft , and it conveint to carry around. Would deff purchase it again. I wish they sold it in regular stores</li>
    <li> Love this lotion I just wish it would come in bigger bottles. The only problem I had with the lotion is when I opened it I guess from it being in the cold when shipped it exploded all over the room. Other then that I would recommend this product to everyone that loves lotion and the brand.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hands soft during what is usually a hard time to keep my hands from being chapped, nice smell</li>
    <li> Really great lotion and perfect size for&lt;br /&gt;purse or backpack. I bought one for my&lt;br /&gt;daughter and she loves the lotion.</li>
    <li> this makes your hands feel smooth. great product for nurses. small enough to keep in your pocket and smooth enough to keep your hands moisterized</li>
    <li> Great smell. I would like to try the other fragrances. I also like the slim size. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This smell amazing, feel good on the skin, and smells very fresh!!</li>
    <li> Lotion is so soothing!  Feels and smells amazing! My ONLY complaint is how hard it is to open. I broke 2 different nails trying to get it open the first few times. I thought it would loosen up and it hasn&#x27;t much. I guess that is good though; it won&#x27;t pop open in your purse and make a mess! :)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It feels great and small enough to fit in the purse, and a surprisingly nice amount of lotion.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion smells great and keeps my skin soft.  The bottle is small so it is great for carrying around in any bag.  I would buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love this product feels so smooth, i love the smell, and perfect for my purse :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This is my Favorite lotion! I can&#x27;t find anything even close to it. It&#x27;s not watery but not oily either. Is smells So good.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this. It is a nice size &amp; shape for my purse or desk drawer. But the scent is a little too much for me.  It&#x27;s cloyingly sweet. Not bad enough that I&#x27;ll throw it away, but I&#x27;m not as excited to use it as I thought I&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> The perfume smell is too strong and irritates my sinuses. I have become very sensitive over the past few years and one I apply my nose starts to itch and before long I have a runny nose and scratchy throat. :(  Wish I could use it cause I love the chapstick.</li>
    <li> I gave this lotion to all of my friends for Christmas.....and myself!  Everyone just loves the product.  Highly recommend!  Does not make hands greasy and they stay nice and soft all day!</li>
    <li> The lotion smells good, very moisterizing and aborbs fast onto the skin, however it is a bit pricy for the size, 2 oz. I hope the manufacture sells bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. Paraben free. It absorbs well and leaves the skin lightly moisturized. A great product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I only docked it a star bcuz I found it 60% cheaper at my local drug store. Its amazing quality hand lotion though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and the smell was nice. Skin feels soft after use. would like a little more in the bottle though but 5 Stars</li>
    <li> Love the scent - cucumber is very mild; not over-powering. The lotion made my skin feel smooth and cool. Gave them as stocking stuffers and everyone seemed pleased.  One said she&#x27;ll keep it in her purse.</li>
    <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t greasy and has a nice smell. Although expensive for how small it is, the size is perfect for work and for my purse.</li>
