      <li>Best concealer that i have tried, i have really oily skin and really bad dark circles</li>

      <li>I also use this under my eyes and it covers dark circles VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I feel like this product was blendable enough that it didnt matter too much that the color was a little off.</li>

<li> I hardly used it, yet and it dried out quickly with the cap on.</li>
<li> Cheaper than other places, such as target and Walmart!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bit dry</li>

<li> only complaint (and the reason I took off one star) is that the product does not last very long.</li>
<li> and this color is darker than i had expected.</li>
<li> I used this as my regular everyday concealer</li>
<li> If you roll the stick all the way up, you will see that there is not much product inside the plastic stick container.</li>
<li> I use this for blemishes and dark spots as well.</li>
<li> and the color is an odd color...</li>
<li> A bit heavy for me.</li>
<li> I was too lazy to return it for another unbroken one.</li>
<li> so that sucks.</li>
<li> Big disappointment.</li>
<li> After that bad sight, I put a small amount on my finger (not to mention I couldn&#x27;t apply it properly) and put it under my eyes.</li>
<li> not what I was expecting, and definetly not good as the foundation, and It came with  a bonded portion of the lid.</li>
<li> I was looking forward to this product only to be disappointed.</li>
<li> I can only compare it to bad fake color tan from the 80&#x27;s  </li>
<li> I have never experienced a concealer that covers as well as this one!</li>
<li> but it can get expensive over time.</li>

    <li> A bit heavy for me. I prefer a lighter and softer cover up. I was too lazy to return it for another unbroken one.</li>
    <li> Covers my pimple scars and dark spots which is great. It doesn&#x27;t blend great so if you put too much on so go ought the put more on if you need it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin oily but other than that it&#x27;s okay as long as you use some type of acne cream. Also make sure that this is your skin color.</li>
    <li> Its awfull! not what I was expecting, and definetly not good as the foundation, and It came with  a bonded portion of the lid.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is one of the BEST concealers I have ever used! It is &amp;#34;super blendable&amp;#34; just like the name suggests. The coverage is amazing! I have never experienced a concealer that covers as well as this one! I have light olive complexion skin and I purchased the light/medium color. It was a little too light for me. However, I feel like this product was blendable enough that it didnt matter too much that the color was a little off. I also use this under my eyes and it covers dark circles VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint (and the reason I took off one star) is that the product does not last very long. If you roll the stick all the way up, you will see that there is not much product inside the plastic stick container. I used this as my regular everyday concealer and I only got about a month worth of use out of it. That may seem fine but it can get expensive over time.</li>
    <li> Best concealer that i have tried, i have really oily skin and really bad dark circles so i have tried a lot lf drugstores concealers and this is by far my favorite , this is my fourth one and i will repurchase it it covers everything and stay in place all day and doesn&#x27;t crease either it doesn&#x27;t make a good job at highlighting but it will cover your under eye circles like no other...it can be  little bit to drying on top of acne something so its better for you&lt;br /&gt;R under eye area just keep that in mind,,best concealer ever</li>
    <li> i love this product, but mine did come broken....so that sucks. and this color is darker than i had expected.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to this product only to be disappointed. I opened it, and it was melted. All over the place. After that bad sight, I put a small amount on my finger (not to mention I couldn&#x27;t apply it properly) and put it under my eyes. Super cakey, thick and very orange. I tried to blend and blend, but nothing seemed to work. Big disappointment. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and blends to your skin color. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> first concealer for me that works great on covering my dark circles.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bit dry so i recommend it for oily skin, mine is dry!</li>
    <li> Great products,  did just what I wanted it to do.  Covered very natural and not cakey. Nice color, blended right in. Loved it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great to shave. Cheaper than other places, such as target and Walmart! I will be buying again! Although, you need to use more and it can finish fast!</li>
    <li> I looove it. Just make sure you blend well!</li>
    <li> I use several different foundations because my skin tone changes throughout the year, but this concealer crayon is my favorite for use with all of them.  It gives the best coverage and is the easiest to apply.  No mess, no smears, no fuss.</li>

    <li> I had honestly just purchased this on a whim, hoping that it would work for me. I&#x27;m kind of newer to the concealer world, but I&#x27;ve used True Match products before and loved them. This one was no different!</li>
    <li> Good coverage and staying power. I have combination skin that is mostly dry, but still find most concealers to be too oily. Not this one. I use this for blemishes and dark spots as well. This is a TRUE match!</li>
    <li> nice concealer, easy to take around in your purse and easy to alppy.</li>
    <li> Honestly...this is kind of cake like...and the color is an odd color...I can only compare it to bad fake color tan from the 80&#x27;s  its too yellowish...maybe you like that kind of thing...not knocking it....to each is own....i&#x27;m only the messenger...its up to you what you do with that information.</li>
    <li> I hardly used it, yet and it dried out quickly with the cap on. It had a very cakey feeling and was just not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Conceals wonderfully! I have had others ask what I use.  Would definately purchase again. Great product, you won&#x27;t regret trying it.</li>
