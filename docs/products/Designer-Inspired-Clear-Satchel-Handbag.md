<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smaller and lighter than regular stadium bag and includes smaller bag inside.  Handles could be a touch longer then I could put over my shoulder, but it suits my needs.</li>
    <li> I love this bag I was looking for a clear bag so I can see what I&#x27;m looking for, I love the style, if only it had a shoulder strap. This bag is so clear I can find things in it without a problem, the change purse is cute, I use it to put my cellphone in it. I was surprised that it has side pockets, I love how clear this bag is, I hope it stays that way.</li>
    <li> Very nice Handbag.  Well made and fit the criteria of the use of a clear bag for safety reasons.  I love the design,  I have others but this one is more professional look.</li>
    <li> Got compliments :) it really helped working at the mall!</li>
    <li> Item is prefect for all those stadium games and getting through security was a breeze.  My only complaint is that the vinyl is a little stiff; could be more flexible for easier access.  All in all a more stylish (and more secure) alternative to the &amp;#34;tote&amp;#34; bag.</li>
    <li> too small, thought was bigger. oops.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bag, and just what I needed.  I will use it to carry my yarn and tools for my crochet projects.  It is a nice heavy vinyl and larger than I expected.  The hardware is heavy and strong.  The small bag on the inside has a sturdy chain.  One nice feature is metal feet on the bottom. I often set my crochet bag on the bench or on the ground when I am out, and the feet will make it last a lot longer.  I am very happy with this bag. The two end pouches are snug and will hold my phone nicely.</li>
    <li> This bag works really well for those of us who have to carry a see through bag.  My only criticism is that I wish the opening were a little larger.</li>
    <li> If it had been larger I probalbly would keep it.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning as soon as possible. Now I have to send it back at my own expens!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it gives me a different look when I do not have a matching purse!  Word of caution people will stare to see what you are carrying and  may even inquire why you chose a &amp;#34;see through&amp;#34; purse where everyone can see your contents!  I am not the type of person to allow someone else&#x27;s view to deter me from my fashion purchases!  Follow me on PinInterest at BrooklynGirl626</li>
    <li> great purse for to take into the NFL games. Looking forward to using it all year. I like how the black has a slight sparkle to it! great amazon find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purse! It&#x27;s very well made. I&#x27;m glad that I ordered this one. I looked at several. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Most clear bags are tote style or very thin cheap stitching. This bag is pretty sturdy and stylish. I love the side pockets on outer bag. Perfect for my lip balm or my vapor cig. It holds quite a bit of stuff for its shape. The only problem is what others have said about it is the zipper is narrow or short. Like I can put my iPad mini in the bag but I have to angle it upright then turn it side ways. I understand why it&#x27;s designed that way cos it makes the overall bag sturdier and holds its shape that way but its hard to get longer or bigger objects in and out. Like if you had a clutch wallet or a makeup bag you have to put it in certain angles but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to bring to NFL games. They gave me a little bit of grief at the front (it does look a tiny bit bigger than they ask for), but I was allowed into the game. Great construction, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I needed this purse for work and it is perfect. The only problem I have with this bag is that it is a bit too small (for my taste) but otherwise great. If you are in need of a clear bag...............this is it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very well made and fits a lot of stuff in it...it&#x27;s the perfect purse for work as well as just an everyday purse. I would recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Bag is too small - top opening not wide enough.  Only using bag until I can find something else I like better.  Price is too high for this tiny bag.</li>
    <li> The zipper opening is small and can be difficult to get bigger things in and out</li>
    <li> This item is a little to small to use as a everyday handbag. Quality is very so so. I find the handles start to crack after a year or two.</li>
    <li> Perfectlying sophisticated and fashion forward, very strong plastic with good straps. The only issue I see with this bag it&#x27;s like the other reviewers said the ZIP IS SMALL, but if you are look for a SMALL durable bag, this is it.</li>
    <li> Loved it it&#x27;s cute durable and big</li>
    <li> Good quality with nice look.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than what i see in the picture but it is very classy..</li>
    <li> Perfect work bag. Thx</li>
    <li> I love this purse for Seahawks games- I put a seahawks keychain on it for decoration- but it is roomy and has a little zip purse for money. If beer spills, it is zipped shut. Plenty of room for what you&#x27;d need- I put plastic bags (for wet seats in the stands), gloves, tickets, cell phone, etc. It is well made, too.</li>
    <li> 5/16:  I purchased this satchel for my lady friend because she is required to carry a clear purse while at work and she loved it. It was big enough to hold all the essentials a woman on the go needs... She says it has the feel one of her more pricey purses and though the coin purse/I.D. pouch was cool. So far is has held up to her standards. I will follow up on this comment to see if it still holds up.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints the bag is perferct for where I work. Would definitely by again. The original bag was defected and the seller immediately solve the problem.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, looks just like the picture!&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy handles, great inner zip pocket, nice construction.&lt;br /&gt;No plastic smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great when you work in retail and need a clear bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to use when you live in a climate when it rains a lot - just take what you need and leave your nice bag home!&lt;br /&gt;A great buy!</li>
    <li> When I first got this satchel I was in love. With one exception, the zipper opening was quite narrow since the zipper only unzips across the top. It should unzip slightly down the side to allow easier time of removing things from the satchel. After using it a few times the piping on the handles started to come off and on one handle the vinyl material just split across the handle and separated. For the price of this that was a little unacceptable. I am giving it 3 stars only because of the style?..........I am editing this review to add another star and to say this company stood behind their product, replaced my bag and has the best customer service!</li>
    <li> If you plan to attend NFL games this year please beware of the new rule requiring ladies to only carry clear bags that meet a size requirement.  I refuse to give extra $$ to the NFL. Besides, this bag is much more stylish.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product originally because it was unusually different, my Mother thought it was too invasive.  But after going through TSA check point at the airport, I Love MY Purse!  I only gave it four stars because I thought it would be a little bigger, but I love it just the same.</li>
    <li> I just attended an NFL preseason game with this bag and I was informed that my bag didn&#x27;t meet the NFL standards...??</li>
    <li> Hard platic really liked it</li>
    <li> Compared to the others i&#x27;ve tried, this bag exceeds my expectations.  i thought it would be flimsy, but it was not.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I needed a clear bag for Football games and this filled the bill perfectly!!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband said &amp;#34; you can even find stuff in it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love it it is great I am telling al my friends, they are getting it for work. Will be getting more</li>
    <li> i got this for my girlfriend because she needed a clear bag for work. she loved it so much she just uses it pretty much all the time now. the only thing she said bad about it was she wishes the opening was a little bit larger but other than that she loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this handbag and I get compliments everywhere I go. It&#x27;s easy to find things in it.</li>
    <li> Very small.  Very difficult to put anything inside due to the small zipper opening.  Very expensive for what I got.  Would not order or recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it, it is fantastic.  Serves the purpose and can put a good bit of stuff in it.  We go to the University of Pitt games and this is what they allow in.</li>
    <li> The bag looks great, looks roomy and all that but its not. The zipper at the top makes it so small that you literally would scratch your hand up if you tried to put anything in there at all. If the zipper went down the sides to make it open wider, it would be a perfect bag, but as it is - not so much.</li>
    <li> Durable! and great for work!</li>
    <li> I love this bag but it doesn&#x27;t hold up very well. The handles start coming apart.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s cute and small.</li>
    <li> Too small than expected for work.</li>
    <li> Our mother works in a retail store and all emplyees have to carry a clear bag for security purposes.  Her old one had fallen apart and we bought this one for her as a gift.  She really appreciated it and has carried it in the store every day since.  She commented that she really liked the size and sturdy construction.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful handbag, and I think everyone should think about purchasing this product. Thanks so much! Perfect size.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a clear cosmetics bag I was using for work. This is so much better. The handles are my favorite part, weird as that sounds. I find everything I&#x27;m looking for by just looking through the bag first.</li>
    <li> The plastic is so stiff that it will never look like this picture, and one seam was not stitched to the plastic so that saying this is a well-make item is not true. It is very poor quality materials and workmanship. Going back in the box, and sending back, for sure.</li>
    <li> Had to buy for work and I have had so many compliments on it from my co-workers.  Plenty of room, side pocket for phone, water, whatever you need.  Don&#x27;t think twice!</li>
    <li> The plastic is clear and thick but pliable. The size is perfect for an everyday bag to work.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the bag. Very well made.</li>
    <li> It really suits my need for attending RAMS games at the dome.  I bought another purse that had a patent leather shoulder strap that I can use with this handbag.  I like crossbody shoulder straps..--mlg</li>
    <li> our store was robbed by an employee so now we all have to carry clear bags.  This was perfect and all the girls love it.</li>
    <li> Pretty trendy to use on game day watching my Hawks... Go Hawks!!!! Love it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returing this bag. It&#x27;s too stiff and small.</li>
    <li> difficult to get in and out of because of how stiff the bag is.</li>
    <li> i wish the bags was bigger with a wider opening.  The plastic is still stiff.  I tried the solution for the problem, but it wouldnt stay soft and flexible.</li>
    <li> This bag is well constructed &amp; the price is just the bag I had been looking for. would recommend it to my co-workers.</li>
    <li> I love this bag, I purchased it for work, it is so, sophisticated, and I love the quality of this bag, nice sturdy handles. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Needed this for a job I was working at its cute med. Size and everyone loved it</li>
    <li> Although a bit pricy, I purchased this bag to attend NFL games, even though it is a tad wider than what is allowed. NFL wants a clear bag no larger than 12L X 12H X 6W. This bag is 12L X 7.5H X 6.5W. I didn&#x27;t think is have a problem getting and I was right! This bag is cute and was great for the game. However, the very next day I went to the mall with the bag and the zipper broke off as I went to unzip it. For $32 that&#x27;s not acceptable. I like it enough and will return for a replacement and try it again.</li>
    <li> Bought the bag a few months ago because my work requires a see-though bag. Everyone loves it. It&#x27;s not a tote and its not a clutch. It is the perfect size and durable. This bag is way better then the $5 pouch they gave up. It took me a long time to find this size of bag and I love it. Worth the search and investment.</li>
    <li> Sending the purse back !!  Parts if it weren&#x27;t even sewn.  Hard to get anything in or out of the opening and not worth the price at all !!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this bag. Required to have a clear bag for work. I get tons of compliments. Thank you from a happy customer</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced  Professional look. I get lots of inquiries on this bag. Great quality. Fits enough stuff but I&#x27;m not an over-stuffer.  Would re-order from same company</li>
    <li> I LOVE this bag.  It is exactly what I was looking for and has left me wanting a second bag in a different style.</li>
    <li> Nice price, nice look and very very chic.............different style of all handbags that I have. Good size and comfortable.  Fashion !</li>
    <li> I like the strong metal attachments but the zipper opening is too small to fit something that would theoretically fit inside.  Slightly larger one desired.</li>
    <li> This is a very stylish version of a clear plastic handbag.  Those of us that have to carry a see-through handbag because we work in a Retail setting, where they are almost always mandatory, need a stylish version so we can feel better about having to carry a clear plastic handbag.  This handbag fits that need.  The company sent great instructions along with the bag on how it revive it from its shipping/packing state.  Fast delivery was also met by the company.  So I give this company and this bag five stars for the variety of criteria that was fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish every company was as easy to deal with as this one.  They go above and beyond to satisfy you.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as shown.  It&#x27;s perfect for my daughter&#x27;s job which requires her to use a clear handbag.  While it gets the job done, it&#x27;s also nice enough that she doesn&#x27;t mind carrying it!  This product is perfect for her needs and the quality is excellent!</li>
    <li> Have to have clear handbag for retail job. This is a really good quality of plastic. I know it&#x27;s going to last! Received e-mail ahead of delivery telling me how to get it back into correct shape - worked great! Would recommend this handbag to everyone who has to have a clear purse.</li>
    <li> Adorable little bag!! I&#x27;ve worked In a casino for 4 years now and it&#x27;s a requirement that all bags/purses be see-through. I&#x27;ve gone through many clear bags and this one is definitely my favorite. It&#x27;s small enough to easily fit in a locker or cabinet but it holds a lot. I can easily carry my wallet, keys, makeup bag, tip cup, a bottled water, my travel size body spray, phone charger, an extra shirt, gum/mints and even a little snack in this cute bag. My favorite thing though is the side pockets. I keep my work ID and cell phone in there so I can quickly and easily pull them out when needed. I LOVE the satchel look... Very modern and fashionable. I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on it and when I told some of my coworkers where I got it from, they went out and bought it too. :) The handles are thick and sturdy, as is the plastic. I haven&#x27;t experienced any discoloration or wearing and I&#x27;ve had this bag for over 6 months now. If it does eventually need replacing, I would certainly buy this same one again.</li>
    <li> I love this bag! It much better than the picture but a little heavy to carry around</li>
    <li> need it for work.....very roomy</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this bag ;(&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s my solution ?</li>
    <li> This is a good size and perfect for anyone that works in retail who has to have clear purses. Time will tell if it holds up or not.</li>
    <li> I needed this clear bag for work and it is large enough to carry anything I need. It is well made and I recommend it totally!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked on the official clear handbag website and they were charging alot more for the same bag. I&#x27;m glad i purchased on Amazon because not only was it cheaper the shipping was fast. The bag has held up pretty good considering I use it everyday for work. I am very pleased with my purchase and for future handbags, i will be using Amazon.</li>
    <li> At my job it is required to use a clear bag for work. Everyone loved mine and asked me where I got it from. I love it just as much!!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like my new clear plastic handbag a lot, have not taken it with me to work yet though.  I like that it is roomy enough, very good quality material, also one person from the company that sells them contacted me to let me know about \\&quot;tricks\\&quot; to get the bag in shape once I received it, fantastic and unusual advice, but it worked to perfection.</li>
    <li> This is a nice bag. I use it for my Scentsy and Jamberry business to show of my catalogs and samples. The only issue I have is that I wish it came with some form of slots and had some inside pockets.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL bag! Delivered on time, and it&#x27;s the perfect size!!! Sturdy, fashionable, and DOES NOT look cheap. I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this purse when going to the football games, they require a clear bag for entry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy about my bag, it is very comfortable,easy to carry and the material that is made is very very strong.....great! especially for my job</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT IT&#x27;S REALLY ELEGANT AND LOOK MUCH BETTER IN REAL THAN IN THE PICTURES THE SIZE IS PERFECT AND THE WEIGHT IS REALLY GOOD NOT HEAVY AT ALL</li>
    <li> Again I must say I love this handbag. I will recommend this bag to my friends. It&#x27;s perfect for what I&#x27;m going to using it for.</li>
