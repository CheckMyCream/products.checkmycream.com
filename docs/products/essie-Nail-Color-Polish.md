      <li>Plus i love the name!</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color.  </li>
      <li>goes on nicely, I would recommend using a topcoat over it.</li>
      <li>Such a bright cheery coral color!</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>Wish I could give more stars since this was the fastest, cheapest shipping for any purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon, ever.</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure about this color but the minute i tried it on</li>
      <li>but I guess I was&#x27;t in love</li>
      <li>Also love the shimmer.</li>
      <li>The color has a bit of shimmer and its more of a pinkish coral color.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>I love this color on my nails.</li>
      <li>Cute coral with shimmer on it.</li>
      <li>Love the color.  </li>
      <li>Definitely in my top 5 favorite polishes out of the 50-something</li>
      <li>Perfect pink!</li>
      <li>So I love essie and the color was rich and beautiful, though the picture is not really what it looks like in person.</li>
      <li>:) I highly recommend this one, ladies :)</li>
      <li>brand new as description, love the price!</li>
      <li>Originally was for me</li>
      <li>Love this colour, exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color, and it has smooth application.  </li>
      <li>In sunlight, the silver shimmer is very beautiful, but still subtle.  </li>
      <li>The pink has a tint of shimmer in it which looks amazing in the sunlight!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s held up so far with a top coat.  </li>
      <li>The color is more of a pink, then light coral.</li>
      <li>a side note, the polish arrived very fast, a day before the shipment stated.  </li>
      <li>Shipped on time, item exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I put 3 very thin coats on and my nails look flawless.  </li>
      <li>Love the shimmer to it, actually matches the color in the bottle really well.</li>
      <li>-- this color is vibrant and has the TINIEST [and i mean TINY] amount of sparkle to it -- it is a great go-to color for when you can&#x27;t decide at the salon -- for ALL AGES!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really ever use it again.</li>
      <li>Very summerish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very summery feminine polish.</li>
      <li>She gets compliments on it all the time, and like other Essie polishes, it doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
      <li>Color doesn&#x27;t fade but normal chipping happens with use</li>
      <li>This nail polish also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out as fast as others.</li>

<li> Looks like its very shimmery in the bottle but its actually very subtle when it&#x27;s on and makes it look brighter in the sun.</li>
<li> either since I keep choosing other colors to wear besides this one.</li>
<li> Less money than I have seen it at any store  </li>
<li> The color looks like a shimmery less pastel version of Coral Reef by Sally Hansen.  </li>
<li> After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.</li>
<li> I bought a few extras for my bridesmaids.</li>
<li> Usually I chip polishes fast because my nails are in awful condition from school, work, guitar, and piano.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t hate the color</li>

    <li> I LOOOOVE Essie polishes - they wear great, don&#x27;t chip, and have dozens and dozens of colors you can&#x27;t find anywhere else -- this color is vibrant and has the TINIEST [and i mean TINY] amount of sparkle to it -- it is a great go-to color for when you can&#x27;t decide at the salon -- for ALL AGES! :) I highly recommend this one, ladies :)</li>

    <li> Okay. I wore this color once. I didn&#x27;t really ever use it again. I didn&#x27;t hate the color but I guess I was&#x27;t in love either since I keep choosing other colors to wear besides this one. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it another shot. Also, it does have a slight shimmer to it, which I am not a big fan of so maybe that was it for me.</li>
    <li> Love this colour, exactly as described. Wish I could give more stars since this was the fastest, cheapest shipping for any purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon, ever. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color, and it has smooth application.  I put 3 very thin coats on and my nails look flawless.  In sunlight, the silver shimmer is very beautiful, but still subtle.  It&#x27;s a very summery feminine polish. The color looks like a shimmery less pastel version of Coral Reef by Sally Hansen.  I painted my nails with Sunday Funday last night and they haven&#x27;t chipped 24 hours later.  Usually I chip polishes fast because my nails are in awful condition from school, work, guitar, and piano.  But it&#x27;s held up so far with a top coat.  Definitely in my top 5 favorite polishes out of the 50-something I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the polish arrived very fast, a day before the shipment stated.  The polish was properly wrapped in bubble wrap and then put into paper packaging that was encased with bubble wrap as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the summer.  Looks like its very shimmery in the bottle but its actually very subtle when it&#x27;s on and makes it look brighter in the sun.</li>
    <li> I love this color. Essie is always a hit or miss for me. This is definitely a hit! Plus i love the name!</li>
    <li> I really loved the color, and that&#x27;s why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this color for summer! The pink has a tint of shimmer in it which looks amazing in the sunlight! I received this product a day before the expected delivery date so I am very happy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Such a bright cheery coral color! I bought a few extras for my bridesmaids. Love the shimmer to it, actually matches the color in the bottle really well. I&#x27;ve had others in this shade (in the bottle) that look fire engine red on the nails. This doesn&#x27;t do that. Love it on my toes!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who loves nail polish.  It arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color.  She gets compliments on it all the time, and like other Essie polishes, it doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, item exactly as described. I love this color on my nails. Perfect summer color to wear. Also love the shimmer.</li>
    <li> brand new as description, love the price!</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure about this color but the minute i tried it on I was in love!  The color has a bit of shimmer and its more of a pinkish coral color.</li>
    <li> Perfect pink! This nail polish also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out as fast as others.</li>
    <li> Love love love this color!!!</li>
    <li> This color is really cute! Cute coral with shimmer on it. Originally was for me but my mother ended up taking it for herself.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Very summerish. It&#x27;s a great polish.  And the price was great. Less money than I have seen it at any store  The quality is great too. They use it at all the nail salons</li>
    <li> So I love essie and the color was rich and beautiful, though the picture is not really what it looks like in person. The color is more of a pink, then light coral. It took almost three weeks to be delivered.</li>
