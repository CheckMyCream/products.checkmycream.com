### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is so awesome!!</li>
      <li>a convinced no one product line is perfect.  </li>
      <li>This is the best gel I have ever used.</li>
      <li>HAVE A GREAT DAY!</li>
      <li>So this product is one of the best products for curly hair out there.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome...</li>
      <li>This is definately my perfect combo.</li>
      <li>My hair was still a bit frizzy and the curls didn&#x27;t look that great.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product thinking it was a good thing.</li>
      <li>There is NO way I could just spray some Botanical Boost and look good.</li>
      <li>the Curl Quencher gel is also good.  </li>
      <li>and she loved it.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll also have great results but definately do all the steps...</li>
      <li>Make sure to section your hair and coat every strand for perfect, frizz free curls.</li>
      <li>This product will make you finally love your hair!</li>
      <li>Well, I am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>My curls will hold up, frizz free and look great.  </li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>I like the Climate Control the best for summer and really humid days</li>
      <li>I too have been on a lifetime search for an effective hair gel.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I do and EVERYONE is loving my curls.     </li>
      <li>I am loving this stuff.</li>
      <li>So easy!  </li>
      <li>By the way, I have spiral curls, but my hair is very fine.</li>
      <li>Ouidad truly is the Queen of Curls and using this gel along with her whole regime makes my hair so beautiful, it is unrecognizable from before I used it.</li>
      <li>Very light scent.</li>
      <li>Before Ouidad I mostly had hair dressers stop me and ask if I knew my hair could be straightened, now they also ask how I do it.  </li>
      <li>I think that I can get better results with over the counter products.</li>
      <li>Never was able to get all these things to happen with a system or combination of products.</li>
      <li>Got this as a free deluxe sample at Sephora.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more definition from a $4 can of mousse.</li>
      <li>I love this gel and will continue to spend the money on it</li>
      <li>Okay, well that could be the case IF the package was dented in any way.  </li>
      <li>I have really wavy and curly hair, so I thought this product would be great.  </li>
      <li>my curls are great, my hair isn&#x27;t sticky and and you don&#x27;t have to use too much.     </li>
      <li>The gel is more like a gel and a serum combined so it moisturizes and sets curls in one step.</li>
      <li>I returned package to sender and because they did not receive in appropriate time frame charged my account another $19.95.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t believe your hair had such great curl and bounce!</li>
      <li>You need to decide which type of gel/styling crm will work best for your curly hair type and there are many different curls out there.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting better results from this product.</li>
      <li>In December of 2009, I decided to donate 14\\&quot; of my hair to Locks of Love.</li>
      <li>and I was, as mentioned, very excited to see what the gel was going to do to control my curls.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to receive this product.</li>
      <li>You will wind up with beautiful, soft looking curls.</li>
      <li>I also use the Deep Treatment on a twice monthly basis (and it is AMAZING!!).  </li>
      <li>So worth it!!</li>
      <li>that is what is really most important.</li>
      <li>products get discontinued too quickly these days!    </li>
      <li>At night, clip the front and side pieces to the top of your head, then in the morning just release them and all the curls will be there nice and soft and well formed.  </li>
      <li>, so I pre-conditioned my hair and washed with an organic shampoo (Shea Moisture - which is FABULOUS).</li>
      <li>When I called once again to ask where the remaining $9.95 was they said I was charged that amount for a restocking fee even though their advertisement clearing states FREE returns.</li>
      <li>So, when I saw this product finally available on Amazon,  I wanted to spread the word about Ouidad products for us curly-haired people.  </li>
      <li>and it is super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>My original order was placed on 5/10/2011.</li>
      <li>It seems to me, that in this day and age, with the economy being what it is,  perhaps Ouidad is more interested in lining her pockets, than to cater to   customers....</li>
      <li>full disclosure</li>
      <li>Now they all seem to curl together in nice looking tendrils and the weight is not heavy</li>
      <li>What I really like about this gel is even if you over apply, your hair does not feel crunchy like most gels.</li>
      <li>I used to have tight unmanageable curl on most my head and then on the very top stringy strands that hung strangly over.  </li>
      <li>In short, I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>It made my hair look great with little (no) effort.  </li>
      <li>All the models were Caucasian except for two African-American women who clearly did not have tightly-woven curls, but more so straight, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Other products are all good..</li>
      <li>but then you use Ouidad&#x27;s pomade to open up your hair to amazing soft, frizz free curls.</li>
      <li>I can put this in my hair in the morning, then spend an entire day outside in 80+ degree and extremely humid weather and my curls stay perfectly defined and frizz free.</li>
      <li>This product does leave your hair crisp</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty curly</li>
      <li>It also had this funny unnatural look to it - like each curl was coated in plastic or something.  </li>
      <li>I really believe you need to use the right Ouidad conditioner and gel for your hair type.</li>
      <li>If you go to their website, ALL the reviews are positive.</li>
      <li>I still have three unused large samples ...</li>
      <li>I used the product twice just to give it a fair shot and each time, the hair was left dry.</li>
      <li>I use a gel by Redken that leaves my curls feeling soft and natural and takes care of the humidity factor just fine.</li>
      <li>(Sephora) if you really want to try this product.</li>
      <li>It totally works and it&#x27;s light, not crunchy.  </li>
      <li>Yet, it still gets really frizzy with the slightlest humidity.  </li>
      <li>When I tried to return it, the people were very unhelpful an now I&#x27;m out $70 for a product that doesn&#x27;t even work.  </li>
      <li>I gave it to a friend with much thicker curly hair</li>
      <li>But, so far worth it.</li>
      <li>did they really expect me to   enroll in an automatic shipment program for a product I have yet to try??  </li>
      <li>This gel is the only product that truely de-frizzes my hair and keeps my style there even in the hot and humid summer months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how people are using it, but it&#x27;s a unique product that cannot fail to deliver SOME kind of good to everyone&#x27;s hair</li>
      <li>It looks good even wet, as it dries, and once it is finally dry -</li>
      <li>The Ojon styling crm will form a nice curl and then the hair becomes very fluffy.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting to have my curls more defined and less frizzy, but they weren&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>but I actually find it looks better (softer)  the second day.     </li>
      <li>I have used one particular Matrix product forever.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to tame my curls, but the only product that I&#x27;ve found that actually makes my curls look beautiful and controlled is Ouidad (I use the climate control gel).</li>
      <li>I have whole cabinets full of products that didn&#x27;t do what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I use Dove Shampoo (currently) &amp; Folicure hairspray because the stylist told me I could use absolutely any shampoo to clean my hair &amp; any hairspray to set curls and have the same results</li>
      <li>I told them the conditioner must have left their facility with a loose top.  </li>
      <li>I normally would not spend this much on a hair product, but this is the first time in a long time that I don&#x27;t feel the need to straighten my hair to make it look presentable.</li>
      <li>Climate Control is going to be my new product.</li>
      <li>Also using the Ouidad products has evened out my curl and given it new life.  </li>
      <li>I rake a substantial amount of the gel through my curls right out of the shower (no towel drying!), and then I \\&quot;wet</li>
      <li>A big positive in my book.</li>
      <li>Also, you should touch your hair as little as possible once you do the rake and shake to apply the gel as touching it increases frizz.</li>
      <li>My hair was so soft and shiny</li>
      <li>This by far beats everything that I have underneath my bathroom sink.</li>
      <li>Use your fingers to \\&quot;rake\\&quot; the product through, letting your hair fall naturally into strands that will become your curls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this as a free deluxe sample at Sephora. Was underwhelmed. Did not manage my hair, or do anything to make it less frizzy. In fact, it made my hair dry and lifeless. I still have three unused large samples ... I wil give them away or toss.     Also, I put a well thought out, but critical review on Quidad&#x27;s website. They did not print it. If you go to their website, ALL the reviews are positive. Not credible at all. Just leaves a bad taste.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with other Ouidad products.  I used to dread rainy days or humidity, my curls never held they ended up frizzy and awful.  Also, I live in a place where during the summer time all the retail establishments run misters heavy enough to leave clothing doused.  I used to have to dodge these all the time, for fear it would frizz out my hair.  Leaving me looking like an awful mess.      Bring on the rain, humidity and even the overworking misters!!! My curls will hold up, frizz free and look great.  I get compliments all the time and women with naturally curly hair stop me all the time to ask how I get my hair to look like it does.  Before Ouidad I mostly had hair dressers stop me and ask if I knew my hair could be straightened, now they also ask how I do it.  I tell them all it&#x27;s the products:  Ouidad.    Also using the Ouidad products has evened out my curl and given it new life.  I&#x27;m not sure if one individual product is responsible or if it is using Ouidad&#x27;s whole system in conjunction which I do, including the deep treatment conditioning every so often.  I used to have tight unmanageable curl on most my head and then on the very top stringy strands that hung strangly over.  Now they all seem to curl together in nice looking tendrils and the weight is not heavy so I get lift at the root even, without the use of a root booster.</li>
    <li> My client received a bottle of Ouidad Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity Gel at a Blogher event in NYC. She handed it over to me - the one with the curly hair!    In short, I absolutely love it! I have used one particular Matrix product forever. That product was discontinued and while I try to save the last few bottles for special occassions, I have been testing other products here and there.    Climate Control is going to be my new product. It&#x27;s awesome...my curls are great, my hair isn&#x27;t sticky and and you don&#x27;t have to use too much.     I hope this product sticks around for a long time....products get discontinued too quickly these days!    Nicole, NYC</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to tame my curls, but the only product that I&#x27;ve found that actually makes my curls look beautiful and controlled is Ouidad (I use the climate control gel). It is similar to John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease, but it&#x27;s not waxy or sticky. It also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy or hard. It doesn&#x27;t make your scalp itch. I like the smell and it is super easy to apply. Curly girls-- Get this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping it would help with my tight curls, unfortunately it left my hair extremely dry. I tried using the mist to help, but that did not last long. Considering the amount of money I spent on this product I am extremely disappointed with the result. I can&#x27;t stay it will not work for you, but it definitely did not work for me. My hair is short and kinky so if you have similar hair texture I would not recommend, but do your research and decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> There is NO way that Ouidad&#x27;s Climate Control brings no good to anyone. I&#x27;m not sure how people are using it, but it&#x27;s a unique product that cannot fail to deliver SOME kind of good to everyone&#x27;s hair it&#x27;s applied to. It really DOES reduce frizz to almost next to nothing. I dare even say NOTHING, in my case anyway. It&#x27;s not crunchy or stiff, and if it does dry a little more clumpy than a person likes, just scrunch your hair when it&#x27;s dry. That&#x27;s what I do and EVERYONE is loving my curls.     Readers, be careful of the negative reviews posted here. Some of them are DEFINITELY uncalled for!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product. I actually purchased mine off of hsn. While the product definitely puts curl in your hair, my hair was left extremely dry and stiff. I used the product twice just to give it a fair shot and each time, the hair was left dry. I also used her leave-in. I used the leave-in once and also used the gel without the leave, just to see if there would be a difference. Also my hair is very thick african american hiar. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking it was a good thing. When I received it and tried it I found it was oily and yucky feeling on my hair. The company then sent me another package even though I said I did not want it and charged me $29.90. I returned package to sender and because they did not receive in appropriate time frame charged my account another $19.95. I called and told them I mailed it back 3 plus weeks before and gave them the tracking numbers to which they then credited my account $39.90. When I called once again to ask where the remaining $9.95 was they said I was charged that amount for a restocking fee even though their advertisement clearing states FREE returns. This company is a JOKE and hopefully anyone considering ordering from them takes note. Otherwise you will feel as screwed as I do..... HAVE A GREAT DAY!</li>
    <li> I have really wavy and curly hair, so I thought this product would be great.  It&#x27;s not worth the money!  It weighted my hair down so it was even less curly than without the product.  It also make my hair look dirty.  When I tried to return it, the people were very unhelpful an now I&#x27;m out $70 for a product that doesn&#x27;t even work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> My hair was waist-length &amp; the last 5 inches of it was completely dry and damaged. For years I had to bounce, aimlessly, from produt to product, desperately searching for something that would add shine, keep me safe from split ends, control frizz and keep my curls defined and soft to the touch. This was virtually impossible. Never was able to get all these things to happen with a system or combination of products. By the way, I have spiral curls, but my hair is very fine. In December of 2009, I decided to donate 14\\&quot; of my hair to Locks of Love. Since I never, ever had a drastic haircut in my life I decided I would have my hair cut in a fancy, upscale, curly hair salon. I was recommended the Ouidad Salon in NYC and chose to have them \\&quot;do the deed\\&quot;. Well, I am so glad I did! I have been totally re-educated about how to care for my curls. Now, I use both the Ouidad Daily Balancing Rinse Conditioner 3 times a week and the Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity Gel to style and touch-up between washings. I use Dove Shampoo (currently) &amp; Folicure hairspray because the stylist told me I could use absolutely any shampoo to clean my hair &amp; any hairspray to set curls and have the same results (so they are not just trying to hawk their products). Ever since then my hair is soft to the touch, frizz-free and has no split ends--and I have not cut my hair since then (it is now May 2011. How do I do it? I swear by 3 things: 1) Ouidad Dialy Balancing Rinse Conditioner, 2) Combing my hair w/ a wide-tooth comb in the shower while it is wet and with conditioner applied- prevents breakage!! DUH! &amp; 3) Ouidad Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity Gel applied with the \\&quot;Rake and Shake\\&quot; method, hairspray and go!!! It is so awesome!! The gel is more like a gel and a serum combined so it moisturizes and sets curls in one step. I really believe you need to use the right Ouidad conditioner and gel for your hair type. This is definately my perfect combo. My hair is now mid way down my back and I still get compliments virtually on a daily basis. I sleep on my curls and they bounce back the next morning with a spritz of water and a little gel on the top and ends. It is amazing. I recommend this product and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll also have great results but definately do all the steps... don&#x27;t just think the gel will work as well in isolation. Do the 3 steps I describe above. I buy the 33 oz bottles of each product direct from the salon 4 times a year&#x3D; approx $450 a year. So worth it!! Curly girls, DON&#x27;T WASH YOUR HAIR EVERYDAY!! &amp; ONLY COMB HAIR WITH CONDITIONER ON-- that is what is really most important.</li>
    <li> So this product is one of the best products for curly hair out there.  I also want everyone to know that there are also certified ouidad stylists.  They specialize in only cutting curly hair.  So go to the ouidad website to find out where they are.</li>
    <li> After reading the materials that were sent to me and getting Ouidad to send me a tiny sample (after practically begging and trying to get them to understand that I was not going to pay their outrageous price for something I had never used before), I was enthusiastic and sure that this product would work (after the claims they make about the product in their materials, you would have thought this was a miracle product!), so I pre-conditioned my hair and washed with an organic shampoo (Shea Moisture - which is FABULOUS). My hair was so soft and shiny and I was, as mentioned, very excited to see what the gel was going to do to control my curls. YUCK! This product left my hair DULL and curls CRUNCHY and dry. I couldn&#x27;t believe it had taken away my shine and soft curls. I ended up having to wash it out of my hair and start all over again!  This product does not seem to be for African-American natural curls, as I should have figured from the photos on the materials that were sent. All the models were Caucasian except for two African-American women who clearly did not have tightly-woven curls, but more so straight, fine hair.  NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This gel is the only product that truely de-frizzes my hair and keeps my style there even in the hot and humid summer months. I can put this in my hair in the morning, then spend an entire day outside in 80+ degree and extremely humid weather and my curls stay perfectly defined and frizz free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Believe me, I have searched and tested TONS of products, and NONE have come close to this! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I know other people like this product, but it leaves my curls feeling VERY crunchy/crispy. I&#x27;ve even tried using less and less amounts of the product each time, but it still leaves the wet/crunchy look.  Considering the VERY expensive price tag, it is not worth your money.  I use a gel by Redken that leaves my curls feeling soft and natural and takes care of the humidity factor just fine.</li>
    <li> I too have been on a lifetime search for an effective hair gel.  My hair is pretty curly - kinda like Julianna Margulies from the ER TV series.  The other gels I have tried before this one were either so light that they did not control the frizz or too heavy that they left my hair feeling sticky, gummy or stiff. I put this gel in my hair when it is pretty wet to set the curl and let it dry.  It dries a bit crispy but then you use Ouidad&#x27;s pomade to open up your hair to amazing soft, frizz free curls. Ouidad truly is the Queen of Curls and using this gel along with her whole regime makes my hair so beautiful, it is unrecognizable from before I used it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Ouidad package.  When it came in the mail, the conditioner had spilled out all over everything.  I emailed the customer service staff and they responded it was the fault of UPS.  Okay, well that could be the case IF the package was dented in any way.  It was not, so I told them the conditioner must have left their facility with a loose top.  They denied it, and were rude.  Needless to say, I did not get to try the products yet, but regardless, I won&#x27;t be ordering from them again.  A customer should at the very least, leave satisfied, if not happy.  I was neither.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel I have ever used. I used to be a hair product junkie before trying this product. I will not waste my money again. Very light scent. Does not clash with my perfume. A big positive in my book.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that for the past few years I have straightend my hair because I did not know how to deal with my curly hair. Always frizzy, course and just plain unruly. Well I recently had my haircut by a Ouidad Stylist and she suggested this gel. I will tell you it is VERY expensive. But, so far worth it. This by far beats everything that I have underneath my bathroom sink. I normally would not spend this much on a hair product, but this is the first time in a long time that I don&#x27;t feel the need to straighten my hair to make it look presentable. Apply this gel to soaking wet hair. Do not towel dry. Make sure to section your hair and coat every strand for perfect, frizz free curls. Your hair needs to be very wet when applying. What I really like about this gel is even if you over apply, your hair does not feel crunchy like most gels. Dry your hair with a diffuser if you do not have time to air dry. You will wind up with beautiful, soft looking curls. I am loving this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair but it&#x27;s not super thick.  Yet, it still gets really frizzy with the slightlest humidity.  I gave this product a try at the suggestion of a stylist at the Ouidad salon in NYC.  But it&#x27;s just too heavy for my hair.  I give it three stars because it did keep my hair frizz-free, but I hated the way it made my hair look.  It was really weighed down and looked flat.  It also had this funny unnatural look to it - like each curl was coated in plastic or something.  I gave it to a friend with much thicker curly hair and she loved it.  We both felt it left our hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, so I would say that you need a pomade or some other finishing product to get the crunch out after the gel dries (I like my curls to look soft so I use a pomade with almost every gel).  If you have really thick curly hair, I&#x27;d say give this a try.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better results from this product. My hair was still a bit frizzy and the curls didn&#x27;t look that great. I think that I can get better results with over the counter products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a zillion products before, but only Quidad&#x27;s gels do the trick.  I like the Climate Control the best for summer and really humid days - it&#x27;s actually my standard - but the Curl Quencher gel is also good.  To use it, work the gel into your combed, just washed hair, with less at the roots.  Use your fingers to \\&quot;rake\\&quot; the product through, letting your hair fall naturally into strands that will become your curls. (You can scrunch once or twice - but don&#x27;t keep doing it as it dries or it&#x27;ll get frizzy.)  You can let it dry naturally if you have the time (it will take a LONG time) or use a diffuser with your blow dryer.  You won&#x27;t believe your hair had such great curl and bounce! It looks good even wet, as it dries, and once it is finally dry - but I actually find it looks better (softer)  the second day.     Hint:  At night, clip the front and side pieces to the top of your head, then in the morning just release them and all the curls will be there nice and soft and well formed.  If anything isn&#x27;t quite right, just \\&quot;rake\\&quot; a little water through with your fingers to reset them.  So easy!  This product will make you finally love your hair!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what you may not know, when placing an order w/Ouidad....    In order to purchase the kit that is advertised on TV, you must enroll  in their automatic delivery program....Yes, that means....you have to   buy the product, and authorize the Ouidad company to charge your credit  card, and automatically ship this product to you.    I called, and asked for clarification....did they really expect me to   enroll in an automatic shipment program for a product I have yet to try??  The customer service representative said, Yes.  She also said that was the only  way to purchase the kit advertised on TV....    It seems to me, that in this day and age, with the economy being what it is,  perhaps Ouidad is more interested in lining her pockets, than to cater to   customers....how can you expect, in a struggling financial economy, for people  to try a product, and then if you are not satisfied, deal with the credit card  company to stop Ouidad from continually billing and shipping to you??  Is this  how a company should do business nowadays.      Beware if you purchase, I read other reviews where Ouidad representatives were  NOT helpful to customers who were not satisfied and had trouble getting the auto-  matic deliveries and charges stopped.</li>
    <li> Just got the TV products the other day. I washed my hair as directed. Dried my hair as directed. Followed the instructions for the Botanical Boost and Climate Control and was NOT impressed with the outcome.     I was expecting to have my curls more defined and less frizzy, but they weren&#x27;t. My hair looked the same as if I didn&#x27;t put anything in it at all, with the exception of it feeling like it needed to be washed again.     I&#x27;ve had more definition from a $4 can of mousse. When I got up the next morning, my hair was a wreck. There is NO way I could just spray some Botanical Boost and look good. Maybe this works at a salon with a stylist, but it&#x27;s not practical for at-home use.     In my opinion, it&#x27;s just another niche-marketing sales gimmick. Save your money, buy the mousse!</li>
    <li> Please try this product if you have curly hair.  the product will leave your hiar stiff; however your hair will relax and not frizz out.  for example, I use Ojon products which will perform equally well on curly hair.  The Ojon styling crm will form a nice curl and then the hair becomes very fluffy.  The Ouidad will form a tighter curl; thereby, keeping the curl closer to the head.  You need to decide which type of gel/styling crm will work best for your curly hair type and there are many different curls out there.  Another reviewer had said to read the Ouidad site which will explain curl types.  I am a convinced no one product line is perfect.  This line works because it has a tighter control of the curl.</li>
    <li> I bought this product directly from the Ouidad site. It is expensive but if used properly can make a HUGH difference in your curly hair. There is a technique to styling curly hair called the \\&quot;rake and shake\\&quot;.  It is described in detail on the Ouidad website.  This product does leave your hair crisp but once it is completely dry all you have to do is use a small amount of shiner to take the crunch out.  Also, you should touch your hair as little as possible once you do the rake and shake to apply the gel as touching it increases frizz. I love this gel and will continue to spend the money on it, I have received numerous compliments on my curls since I began using it about a year ago.</li>
    <li> When trying to purchase the kit advertised on tv, you must enroll in their auto-ship program. You are assured, however, that if you do not like the product you can cancel within 30 days and only be billed for the inital shipment.     What they don&#x27;t tell you, is that they bill you 30 days from your order date, not 30 days after you receive the shipment. By the time you receive the shipment (3 weeks later), you have only days to try it and decide if you want to cancel the auto-ship.     My original order was placed on 5/10/2011. I called on 6/9/2011 to cancel the auto-shipment/renewal. They told me my card was already pending a charge for the auto renew on 6/10 and the renewal order could no longer be cancelled, but that all future shipments would be cancelled.    Seeing to sense in paying another $15 in shipping and handling to send it back, I held onto the June 10th shipment and figured I would eventually use the product. Lesson learned.    Imagine my surprise when I have ANOTHER pending charge on my credit card on July 12th.     I waited 15 min on hold to speak with a \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; representive. When questioning why I was still being charged after cancelling the renewal over a month ago, I was told the June shipment was billed in 3 installments \\&quot;for your convenience.\\&quot;     This product did NOT do what it said it would (although it is not the WORST product out there -- it&#x27;s in line with the $3 suave you can get at walmart); however, their customer service is a sham and NOT worth the hassle!    Beware of dealing directly with Ouidad --- purchase somewhere else (Sephora) if you really want to try this product. This company does NOT treat their customers well!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the most expensive gel I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it works wonders.  Like other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s the right texture, so it defines and controls your curls without weighing them down or making them feel sticky.  I rake a substantial amount of the gel through my curls right out of the shower (no towel drying!), and then I \\&quot;wet iron\\&quot; my hair by using my hands like a flat iron over large sections.  Then I scrunch and diffuse--voila!  If you let your hair air dry, your curls will feel a little stiff, but you can soften them up by using the pomade (which I personally don&#x27;t like) or the shine glaze (which I love!).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how much money I&#x27;ve spent on drugstore products (and even salon products) just to use them once and throw them away.  Once I discovered Ouidad, though, I never bought anything else.  People actually come up to me on the street now to ask me about my hair!  And I always rave about the Ouidad product line and encourage them to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For full disclosure, I use Ouidad for everything, so I can&#x27;t say whether this gel would work as well in combination with a different shampoo and conditioner line.  My Ouidad routine is: Clear &amp; Gentle shampoo, Balancing Rinse conditioner (combed through hair in shower), Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity gel, Shine Glaze serum, diffuse dry.  I also use the Deep Treatment on a twice monthly basis (and it is AMAZING!!).  I can&#x27;t say enough about how these products have changed my life.  You should definitely give them a try!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, you probably are always looking for a product that will work.  I have whole cabinets full of products that didn&#x27;t do what I expected.  So, when I saw this product finally available on Amazon,  I wanted to spread the word about Ouidad products for us curly-haired people.  This is the only, and I mean ONLY, gel that has ever done what it said it would..and then some.  It made my hair look great with little (no) effort.  I&#x27;m not afraid of rain, beach weather, or other crazy-hair-making weather anymore!  It totally works and it&#x27;s light, not crunchy.  Other products are all good..you can&#x27;t go wrong.  But, if you buy only one, this is it.  I use this, the deep treatment, and the clear pomade.</li>
