### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is, otherwise, probably the best comb.</li>
      <li>Ace combs used to be the best you could buy.</li>
      <li>These combs are the best there is.</li>
      <li>They are very good</li>
      <li>I was happy to see that I could still get the ACE Barber comb since I have used one for years.  </li>
      <li>I guess, lol.</li>
      <li>Great price for a great comb.  </li>
      <li>This turned out just to be a fair deal, not a the great one I thought I was getting.</li>
      <li>I hae looked for a good comb for ages.  </li>
      <li>Recommend Silkombs brand for great, fine teeth.</li>
      <li>I like the barber comb as I trim my own hair, beard and all, and this gives me greater control.</li>
      <li>You can see them if you hold the comb in front of a bright light.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 (to test), I should purchase 10 more :)</li>
      <li>I was so pleased at finding it, I bought four.  </li>
      <li>They had lost too many teeth.</li>
      <li>What more can I say.</li>
      <li>I have had a Barber comb in use for many years now,</li>
      <li>When these are gone, I&#x27;ll buy four more.  </li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>But not any more.</li>
      <li>Love it, gets the job done, light weight, easy to handle</li>
      <li>It works good, just that the old one was better quality.  </li>
      <li>Truthfully they don&#x27;t even comb through your hair as smoothly as the original ones.</li>
      <li>One end is too fine and ripped my hair.</li>
      <li>I would have given this 5 stars if the fine teeth were not so close together.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap as I had thought it might.  </li>
      <li>We loved the old Ace combs.</li>
      <li>I bought one, but I returned it to the seller (who very nicely took it back)  </li>
      <li>The fine, short teeth are perfect for my short, curly hair.</li>
      <li>This was not a comb for it, It feels flimsy and my first use felt like I was about to break it with every light pull.</li>
      <li>What I loved about the old combs, was how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; the teeth, especially the fine teeth, were.</li>
      <li>and if you are absolutely elated with the notion of using a genuine ace barber shop comb; well, go for it.  </li>
      <li>It looks the same, but this comb is a cheap piece of junk that they should be embarrassed to charge more than 50 cents for (and it might be overpriced even at that).  </li>
      <li>I do not think this is worth the money.</li>
      <li>I was honestly expecting something with quality for 7 dollars, could of got one of these at a local store for 99cents.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re an older gentlemen who just needs to comb his hair in-between the day, this will work fine.</li>
      <li>It was just right, and I bought three -</li>
      <li>but this will do till I find the right taper</li>
      <li>Not a hard rubber comb, cheap plastic ripoff?</li>
      <li>I finally needed to replace some 5+ year old Ace barber combs that I loved.</li>
      <li>THIS WAS THE EXACT ONE.  </li>
      <li>husband says it is exactly the comb he remembered and wanted.</li>
      <li>For short men&#x27;s hair, there is no beating the Ace barber comb--it removes dust, lose hair and skin flakes reliably, and allows quick styling and accurate parts.  </li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t need short fine teeth.</li>
      <li>Found that very thing when I purchased the ACE BARBER hAIR COMBS.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long and sturdy, good for long hair and doesn&#x27;t catch too much garbage in the teeth of it.</li>
      <li>This comb works much better on my hair than other combs.</li>
      <li>Got an ace comb years age that worked much better, but this one&#x27;s black</li>
      <li>SO GLAD WE CAN PUT THIS SUBJECT TO BED.</li>
      <li>This particular comb was well made and proportioned.  </li>
      <li>Difficult to find locally this is the best comb for men that you&#x27;ll find.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wanted a little more taper of a comb</li>
      <li>The new ones have a reverse knife edge between the tines which grabs onto and pulls ones hair out.</li>
      <li>Ace judging by the photo, instead I got one of the new cheap knock offs made of plastic and the generic letters ACE on the left corner.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair that has occasional knots that I use a good comb for.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t last long since it&#x27;s some kind of cheap \\&quot;hard\\&quot; plastic instead of the real hard plastic that used to be used.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting the old style</li>
      <li>I bought it thinking that I was paying too much for what I wanted - a simple comb.</li>
      <li>I bought this comb to replace an ACE barber comb that I had for over 20 years--my favorite comb ever--that finally lost a few teeth.  </li>
      <li>I would still buy another since it works and is full length black.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a comb, not really hard to mess up right?</li>
      <li>Not worth the hassle to return such a cheap item.</li>
      <li>Still have a pocket comb I bought years ago and so far it only lost one tooth, age</li>
      <li>I was completely surprised to receive a comb that is extremely similar in structure since I thought they didn&#x27;t make them anymore.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that it will break easily if not careful</li>

<li> teeth is just a little too far apart on the bigger side of the comb</li>
<li> This was just as expected -- good for cutting hair at home even if you are not a real barber!</li>
<li> Between the teeth, especially the fine teeth, there are transparently thin webs of the black plastic</li>
<li> Hope it&#x27;ll last forever, like other ACE combs I&#x27;ve had.</li>
<li> , I had to go get a cheap too thin and breakable hard plastic barber comb at Walgreens.  </li>
<li> Ace is almost indestructible, a characteristic I wanted, but the teeth in the small end would not accept my heavier facial hair.  </li>
<li> It might be stiff enough to comb a crew cut, but who combs a crew cut anyway?</li>
<li> I wish it had been a bit less expensive but, in the end, worth it.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not the real thing but fake made in china</li>
<li> teeth is just a little too thick on the bigger side of the comb</li>
<li> Sadly, these new combs are not made as well.</li>
<li> Used to find them in local stores but with the big box stores taking over common every day use products like this comb are difficult to locate, that&#x27;s why we need amazon.com  to fill in the gaps that keep appearing.</li>
<li> I am worried that if I tried to force my hair into this comb, it would damage my hair because it is not smooth between the teeth.</li>
<li> However, from my previous experience with Ace combs throughout my life, there&#x27;s no way they can be beat!</li>
<li> little hard to manage when using to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not a very good value</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hard plastic ones are fine--nothing to worry about.</li>
<li> I have used ace hard rubber combs for years.</li>
<li> Ace been around forever, hard rubber comb.</li>
<li> They are no longer made from hard rubber.</li>
<li> I had been searching for ages for the Ace hard rubber combs I used to buy from beauty supply stores.</li>
<li> I used to buy ACE combs all the time because they were thick, durable and had no flaws, but the quality of this one is horrendous.&lt;br</li>
<li> I suggest you look around for another comb, beause if you buy the new Ace you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
<li> I mean it&#x27;s plastic</li>
<li> Believe or not, I was not able to find this comb anywhere in my neighborhood and it is all my husband will use!</li>
<li> I have used Ace Barber Combs for years, but they have been very difficult to locate locally.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> /&gt;The plastic is too thin, the teeth all had burrs that would have scratched my husbands scalp if I hadn&#x27;t taken a closer look after noticing the flimsiness of the comb.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing this comb</li>
<li> This comb is so thin and bendy that it can&#x27;t comb my hair (and my hair isn&#x27;t even difficult to comb).  </li>
<li> I KNOW THIS SOUNDS SILLY</li>
<li> Unfortunately it seems they have lost the recipe.  </li>
<li> But I was ordering stuff, I didn&#x27;t want to go out to a store, so I ordered a very expensive comb.  </li>
<li> My eye swelled wider and and I was disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I mean it&#x27;s plastic and yes versatile and if you are absolutely elated with the notion of using a genuine ace barber shop comb; well, go for it.  it does its job.</li>
    <li> These combs are the best there is. Used to find them in local stores but with the big box stores taking over common every day use products like this comb are difficult to locate, that&#x27;s why we need amazon.com  to fill in the gaps that keep appearing.</li>
    <li> Love it, gets the job done, light weight, easy to handle and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap as I had thought it might.  Buy it !</li>
    <li> I KNOW THIS SOUNDS SILLY BUT THIS COMB I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AND BOUGHT ABOUT 20 THAT DID NOT SUIT MY HUSBAND. HE KEPT TELLING ME WHAT HE WANTED. THIS WAS THE EXACT ONE.  I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR 2 YEARS  IN STORES.  SO GLAD WE CAN PUT THIS SUBJECT TO BED.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the old style Ace judging by the photo, instead I got one of the new cheap knock offs made of plastic and the generic letters ACE on the left corner. This turned out just to be a fair deal, not a the great one I thought I was getting.</li>
    <li> My husband has been complaining about the men&#x27;s combs I have been buying him for years, telling me that the teeth on the comb he wanted should be finer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I went on a mission, and checked all the area drugstores and supercenters for a comb with finer teeth. The only ones they carried were the ones I had been buying, and that he didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this comb online searching for \\&quot;barber comb\\&quot;. It was just right, and I bought three - just in case they stopped making this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband says it is exactly the comb he remembered and wanted.</li>
    <li> This comb works much better on my hair than other combs. The only drawback is that it will break easily if not careful</li>
    <li> I finally needed to replace some 5+ year old Ace barber combs that I loved. They had lost too many teeth. What I loved about the old combs, was how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; the teeth, especially the fine teeth, were. I used them to separate and style my bangs. Sadly, these new combs are not made as well. Between the teeth, especially the fine teeth, there are transparently thin webs of the black plastic the combs were molded from. I say molded, because if these teeth were &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; into the comb, these &amp;#34;thin webs&amp;#34; between the teeth COULD NOT exist. You can see them if you hold the comb in front of a bright light. This prevents the comb from sinking into my hair and &amp;#34;combing&amp;#34; it. I am worried that if I tried to force my hair into this comb, it would damage my hair because it is not smooth between the teeth. Not worth the hassle to return such a cheap item. Recommend Silkombs brand for great, fine teeth. Or Kent if you don&#x27;t need short fine teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used ace hard rubber combs for years. I could not find them in stores in my home town so I ordered them form amazon.com. They are very good a nd I will try to always find them for my personal use.  Yes, I would recommend the to all patrons</li>
    <li> I do not think this is worth the money. I bought it thinking that I was paying too much for what I wanted - a simple comb. But I was ordering stuff, I didn&#x27;t want to go out to a store, so I ordered a very expensive comb.  It works well.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars if the fine teeth were not so close together.  Ace has been my comb of choice since boyhood when I carried one in my hip pocket, but now my hair is sparse, and I have a mustache and go-tee.  I have had a Barber comb in use for many years now, but on a trip the TSA broke it.  Ace is almost indestructible, a characteristic I wanted, but the teeth in the small end would not accept my heavier facial hair.  My eye swelled wider and and I was disappointed.  That&#x27;s it, I had to go get a cheap too thin and breakable hard plastic barber comb at Walgreens.  It is, otherwise, probably the best comb.</li>
    <li> For short men&#x27;s hair, there is no beating the Ace barber comb--it removes dust, lose hair and skin flakes reliably, and allows quick styling and accurate parts.  Do not settle for imitations!  The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hard plastic ones are fine--nothing to worry about.</li>
    <li> what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Combs hair.  Seriously.</li>
    <li> I hae looked for a good comb for ages.  Found that very thing when I purchased the ACE BARBER hAIR COMBS.  I was so pleased at finding it, I bought four.  When these are gone, I&#x27;ll buy four more.  I highly recommend them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elaine, ELA67@AOL.COM</li>
    <li> If you cut short hair, you need this comb. I&#x27;ve been using Ace combs to cut my family&#x27;s hair for years and its thin teeth and light weight make this an essential tool for Mom, the home barber.</li>
    <li> Ace been around forever, hard rubber comb. It meets my need and expectation. It arrived promptly. Ace is the way to go.</li>
    <li> We loved the old Ace combs. Still have a pocket comb I bought years ago and so far it only lost one tooth, age I guess, lol. I like the barber comb as I trim my own hair, beard and all, and this gives me greater control.</li>
    <li> One end is too fine and ripped my hair. I didn&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s purpose and so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Difficult to find locally this is the best comb for men that you&#x27;ll find.  This particular comb was well made and proportioned.  I wish it had been a bit less expensive but, in the end, worth it.</li>
    <li> I used to buy ACE combs all the time because they were thick, durable and had no flaws, but the quality of this one is horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is too thin, the teeth all had burrs that would have scratched my husbands scalp if I hadn&#x27;t taken a closer look after noticing the flimsiness of the comb.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing this comb, I&#x27;ll be going to a store and checking out a comb in person before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> It has all its teeth, unlike the one it replaced. Hope it&#x27;ll last forever, like other ACE combs I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I, must have read the initial purchase information incorrectly. I thought it stated 6 combs for the price. To my dismay I only received i for $6+.  Not a very good value jj</li>
    <li> I had been searching for ages for the Ace hard rubber combs I used to buy from beauty supply stores. Those combs were almost indestructible, but I bought them by the dozen not because they would break, but because I would lose them. The fine, short teeth are perfect for my short, curly hair. I was completely surprised to receive a comb that is extremely similar in structure since I thought they didn&#x27;t make them anymore. While I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 (to test), I should purchase 10 more :)</li>
    <li> Great price for a great comb.  Use every day and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not a hard rubber comb, cheap plastic ripoff? Don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s not the real thing but fake made in china</li>
    <li> Got an ace comb years age that worked much better, but this one&#x27;s black so I got it.  It works good, just that the old one was better quality.  I would still buy another since it works and is full length black.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb.  What more can I say.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see that I could still get the ACE Barber comb since I have used one for years.  I bought 3 of them.  Unfortunately it seems they have lost the recipe.  The new ones have a reverse knife edge between the tines which grabs onto and pulls ones hair out.</li>
    <li> What more can I say? I have thick hair that has occasional knots that I use a good comb for. This was not a comb for it, It feels flimsy and my first use felt like I was about to break it with every light pull. It won&#x27;t last long since it&#x27;s some kind of cheap \\&quot;hard\\&quot; plastic instead of the real hard plastic that used to be used. I was honestly expecting something with quality for 7 dollars, could of got one of these at a local store for 99cents.</li>
    <li> I have used Ace Barber Combs for years, but they have been very difficult to locate locally. The combs were as high-quality as always.</li>
    <li> Believe or not, I was not able to find this comb anywhere in my neighborhood and it is all my husband will use!</li>
    <li> As a matter of fact, I haven&#x27;t used any of these combs yet.  However, from my previous experience with Ace combs throughout my life, there&#x27;s no way they can be beat!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb to replace an ACE barber comb that I had for over 20 years--my favorite comb ever--that finally lost a few teeth.  It looks the same, but this comb is a cheap piece of junk that they should be embarrassed to charge more than 50 cents for (and it might be overpriced even at that).  This comb is so thin and bendy that it can&#x27;t comb my hair (and my hair isn&#x27;t even difficult to comb).  It might be stiff enough to comb a crew cut, but who combs a crew cut anyway?</li>
    <li> This was just as expected -- good for cutting hair at home even if you are not a real barber!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb, not really hard to mess up right? Ehhh... wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It combs hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, comb is flimsy&lt;br /&gt;Comb teeth is just a little too thick on the bigger side of the comb&lt;br /&gt;Comb teeth is just a little too far apart on the bigger side of the comb&lt;br /&gt;A little hard to manage when using to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re an older gentlemen who just needs to comb his hair in-between the day, this will work fine. If you&#x27;re planning to use it for any kind of styling or hair cutting, look else where.</li>
    <li> wanted a little more taper of a comb but this will do till I find the right taper the end</li>
    <li> Ace combs used to be the best you could buy. But not any more. They are no longer made from hard rubber. They are now made of plastic. They are cheap, thin and flimsy. Truthfully they don&#x27;t even comb through your hair as smoothly as the original ones. I bought one, but I returned it to the seller (who very nicely took it back)  I suggest you look around for another comb, beause if you buy the new Ace you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s long and sturdy, good for long hair and doesn&#x27;t catch too much garbage in the teeth of it. Seems like a quality comb.</li>
