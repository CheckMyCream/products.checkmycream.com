      <li>This hair dryer is lightweight, looks great and has been successfully drying my hair for the last two years.</li>
      <li>This gave me the convenience of using it anywhere in the room and had more power than those supplied by the hotels.  </li>

      <li>It works much better than those found in most hotel rooms.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love knowing that if I travel overseas again all I have to do is switch this to 220 volt</li>
      <li>The directions say to \\&quot;use the appropriate tool\\&quot; to change voltage, but there is no tool.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic quality!</li>
      <li>so I was able to work around it.</li>
      <li>just what i needed in a dual voltage hairdryer, i am always finding myself in a 220v environment (europe and australia) and these are perfect for the long haired musician on the go</li>
      <li>We first used this hairdryer at a Marriott we were staying at, and loved it.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to have something to bring along for a low price that would work over there, and it was mostly fine.</li>
      <li>I used it in New Zealand and Australia and it worked great with plenty of heat and power.</li>
      <li>I stayed at a number of hotels that had dryers available, but in most cases, I used this one instead.  </li>
      <li>Bonus: The price was right!!</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to change from 110V to 240V and the nozzle makes getting to the roots of your hair a snap.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s easy to do.</li>
      <li>The unit is easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Worked great with a cheap international adapter - NOT a VOLTAGE CONVERTER!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and works well.</li>
      <li>It also still needs an adopter to fit in the electric sockets over there.</li>
      <li>(it was so cheap in 2010)</li>
      <li>I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Works great and has a lot more power than I expected.</li>
      <li>I had to return both original and replacement dryer.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Received quickly.</li>
      <li>I took this on a recent trip to Italy and it worked perfectly the entire time.</li>
      <li>I find it dries my hair quickly</li>
      <li>Gets the job done quickly</li>
      <li>Great little hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Because the price was so reasonable and because I had to reach $25 for free shipping, I bought two and kept one for myself.</li>
      <li>So far, after 6 weeks of ownership, I am pleased with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>Compact, portable, powerful.</li>
      <li>It dries my hair very quickly on the high setting.</li>
      <li>It is ESSENTIAL that I have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage.</li>
      <li>I am using this in Stuttgart Germany right now.</li>
      <li>high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune.</li>
      <li>I first tried this hair dryer on vacation and thought it was great because it was small and delivered the power I needed.</li>
      <li>Good little product.</li>
      <li>it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on the first time i tried to use it.</li>
      <li>The larger, higher wattage more bells and whistles dryers frizzed my hair with their power, drying it out, but this lower wattage keeps my hair supple.  </li>
      <li>I stayed at a Lowe&#x27;s hotel in LA last year and they had this hairdryer in the hotel room and feel in love with it.  </li>
      <li>And if you should happen to find yourself in a hotel that doesn&#x27;t have one, you can probably buy something better than this one for about the same money while you&#x27;re there, and you&#x27;ll have saved yourself the hassle of packing it.</li>
      <li>Be sure to read the directions and be sure to change the voltage and only use on low when out of the U.S.</li>
      <li>Pretty compact for travelling, too.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s true that you only get one functioning speed when using the dryer with 240 volts, the speed you have is very powerful.  </li>
      <li>If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it&#x27;s a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be.</li>
      <li>It gets really hot and dries my hair fast.  </li>
      <li>Perfect little hair dryer, especially for international travel.  </li>
      <li>I really liked how fast it dried my hair</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
      <li>It works well in the 220v but the 125v didn&#x27;t blow much at all.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight.</li>
      <li>It also does not take up much space under the cabinet.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say how long it will work as I&#x27;ve only used it for my 10 day trip, but there isn&#x27;t anything that makes me believe that it wouldn&#x27;t work great for my next travels.  </li>
      <li>The only dissapointment is that you can&#x27;t clean the vents out.</li>
      <li>I use this to travel internationally (so far just Denmark and Spain) and it worked fine with the European adapter.</li>
      <li>High was far too hot for me.</li>
      <li>This means that I have to be sure that my hair is dried and styled to my content before I switch the thing off, so I can&#x27;t really stop and rest, I have to go all the way to the end.  </li>
      <li>High speed/High heat.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a reliable travel dryer.  </li>
      <li>My hair is somewhat long (little below shoulders) and this dryer is light, powerful, and drys my hair quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is not the best hair dryer that I wanted but its still does its job. Cute, handy and affordable.</li>
    <li> It works. It is small and compact. But the details need to be clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The voltage must be manually set by turning a little dial (don&#x27;t forget to do that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The unit has only two speed/heat settings, NOT two for each.&lt;br /&gt; High speed+High heat OR Low speed+Low heat, and ONLY when used with US 120V power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When set to 240V power, there is only ONE setting. High speed/High heat. There is no low speed option with euro power.</li>
    <li> Good little product. However, there is a switch preset at 110 volts. If you bring the air dryer to France, and forget to manually switch it to 220 volts (as we did), the thing burns out within 60 seconds.</li>
    <li> Worked great in Italy with one of those all-in-1 plug adapters.  Pretty compact for travelling, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Italy. I was very happy to have something to bring along for a low price that would work over there, and it was mostly fine. There&#x27;s a small screw you have to turn to change it to 220 volts but that&#x27;s easy to do. It&#x27;s light weight and works well. The only problem is that it only works on high once you&#x27;re in the 220 volt setting which blew my hair almost off my head every time I used it. Styling was out of the question but I was wearing hats almost everyday so I was able to work around it. Still, be forewarned. It also still needs an adopter to fit in the electric sockets over there. Overall I was pleased that it worked with any hitches such as over heating or short circuiting.</li>
    <li> Loved the product however it was not automatic dual voltage.  I didn&#x27;t move the switch to the European voltage - and burned up the hair dryer the first day.  The product was good - the user was not!</li>
    <li> Bought for a trip to France &amp; Spain.  Worked great with a cheap international adapter - NOT a VOLTAGE CONVERTER!  A lot of power in a little hair dryer.  Be sure to read the directions and be sure to change the voltage and only use on low when out of the U.S.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to keep in my desk drawer at work to dry my hair that gets a little damp on rainy days walking in from the parking lot. Sometimes my shoes/socks get a little damp also and I can use it for that. I used to be cold for hours until my hair or shoes dried off. I am pleased with the high temperature output and the airflow of this small dryer. I like that the handle doesn&#x27;t fold because a folding handle is often a weak spot with travel dryers and can break. This dryer is small enough that it fits in the back of a small drawer in my desk and isn&#x27;t in the way. I might let coworkers use it on days that they forget their umbrella and get wet hair.</li>
    <li> I have not yet taken it abroad to try the other voltage, but will in about 2 weeks. That is why I got it, but it does work well here, not too noisy and it&#x27;s a nice size.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for a trip to Europe.  It worked great.  The dual voltage is very easy to change.  Small, so it didn&#x27;t take a lot of room in my luggage.  Great product.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;m surprised at the punch this little hair dryer has. It&#x27;s compact, light weight, doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space in the bathroom &amp; is a nice size for travel. Bonus: The price was right!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip and it&#x27;s a good size and blow dryer strength.  The only thing that would make it better would be a cold shot button to blow cool air.  All and all a good travel hair dryer though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was dual voltage and traveled to South America with it. For a month. The second time I used it there it completely died. I left it in Bolivia and I slept with wet hair for the remainder of my MONTH LONG TRIP. Had I not tossed this piece of dead weight in my pack, I would be returning it.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for a trip to Ireland because my usual high end T3 ceramic/tourmaline professional hair dryer wasn&#x27;t designed to be used overseas.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100+ on a tourmaline ceramic travel dryer, and hesitantly purchased this one based off of all the great reviews.  It worked great. I have thick, baby fine, mid back length hair, and it dried my hair just fine without a lot of frizz like I was expecting.  Another plus, the low setting wasn&#x27;t too low, and the high setting didn&#x27;t blow your hair around like a cyclone.  Took a little longer than my professional dryer, but then again, I would expect it to.  The dual voltage meant that I didn&#x27;t have to use a power converter, all I needed was the adapter.  It never lost power, and worked flawlessly. I highly recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a reliable travel dryer.  I can&#x27;t say how long it will work as I&#x27;ve only used it for my 10 day trip, but there isn&#x27;t anything that makes me believe that it wouldn&#x27;t work great for my next travels.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> This little dual voltage dryer worked like a charm in Europe.  It&#x27;s easy to change from 110V to 240V and the nozzle makes getting to the roots of your hair a snap.</li>
    <li> Works great. Compact, portable, powerful. So far so good. Would purchase again. Purchased to replace an older model of same brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace one that I borrowed from a friend that burnt out because I used the electric converter incorrectly. Because the price was so reasonable and because I had to reach $25 for free shipping, I bought two and kept one for myself. I use this dryer every day and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. My hair is somewhat long (little below shoulders) and this dryer is light, powerful, and drys my hair quickly. It would make a terrific travel dryer. It works much better than those found in most hotel rooms. At this price you can&#x27;t go wrong. The fact that it has the dual voltage is a nice plus.</li>
    <li> Use this little dryer on a daily basis.  Works great and has a lot more power than I expected.</li>
    <li> I first tried this hair dryer on vacation and thought it was great because it was small and delivered the power I needed. Now, I don&#x27;t have to hold heavy blow dryers twice the size to do my hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I took this on a recent trip to Italy and it worked perfectly the entire time. I use this everyday now as my other hairdryer is not nearly as powerful as this one. I love knowing that if I travel overseas again all I have to do is switch this to 220 volt and I&#x27;m ready to go. For the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this little hair dryer after my Andis 33805 mini hair dryer stopped working having dropped it on the floor so many times.  I would have reordered the Andis (it was so cheap in 2010) if it hadn&#x27;t doubled in price, but I decided to look for an alternative.  This hair dryer is lightweight, looks great and has been successfully drying my hair for the last two years. The dryer has two heat settings and I always use the high heat setting to quickly blow dry my hair. The volume doesn&#x27;t seem to be any louder or quieter than other dryers I have used, so the high setting does not bother me. I haven&#x27;t taken the dryer abroad yet, so I cannot comment on its dual voltage capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this dryer is that once I switch it off, the circuit breaker will kick in to cool it down, so the dryer will not turn on for another 5-10 minutes.  This means that I have to be sure that my hair is dried and styled to my content before I switch the thing off, so I can&#x27;t really stop and rest, I have to go all the way to the end.  This is an issue that I&#x27;ve noticed with a lot of small travel dryers, but for the price, it does not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an affordable, lightweight hair dryer, then I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am using this in Stuttgart Germany right now. It works well in the 220v but the 125v didn&#x27;t blow much at all. With a regular U.S. outlet adapter into a German 220v outlet it works fine. Blows drys my very long hair quickly on low. High was far too hot for me.</li>
    <li> Good product. Received quickly. As expected.</li>
    <li> Got this to use on my dog who needed to be bathed almost every day.  Gets the job done quickly which is what I wanted.  Have owned it for five months and hope that it has a long life.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer in the hotel room while on vacation.  I really liked how fast it dried my hair so I wrote down the info and googled it when I got home.  To my surprise this hair dryer was inexpensive so I ordered it.  It works great.  It gets really hot and dries my hair fast.  The only dissapointment is that you can&#x27;t clean the vents out.</li>
    <li> Have only taken it for a test run to see if it functions upon arrival, since this is a back up in case my old 1600 watt dryer goes.  It&#x27;s very lightweight, easy to hold, all I need is the simple settings to style and dry my short hair so it&#x27;s not a curly mess, and it seems to do the job.  The larger, higher wattage more bells and whistles dryers frizzed my hair with their power, drying it out, but this lower wattage keeps my hair supple.  I&#x27;d recommend it, so far, but really haven&#x27;t given it any work to speak of.</li>
    <li> Did not work. I bought it to take to Europe and when I got there it never even turned on! Junk</li>
    <li> Powerful and light, perfect for travel!  Used on trip to italy subs didn&#x27;t have any issues.  I have thicker hair and sometimes the smaller dryers overheat before my hair is dry, but I didn&#x27;t have that issue with this product.</li>
    <li> this dryer is a piece of trash. it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on the first time i tried to use it.</li>
    <li> We first used this hairdryer at a Marriott we were staying at, and loved it. So we researched it and found it online and ordered it.  We have loved it!  It is very light weight, yet packs plenty of power.  Best hairdryer we have ever used.</li>
    <li> I took this hair dryer with me on a trip to Europe this summer.  It takes up very little space and is powerful.  In other words it does the job for which it is intended.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised without problems.  It just has limited options except speed.</li>
    <li> best dryer I&#x27;ve had in years!</li>
    <li> I took this hair dryer on a trip to Lebanon and Turkey, and it worked great.  So, if you need to use outside of the US it should work for you.</li>
    <li> Great little hair dryer. Very lightweight. Dual voltage for overseas travel. And. A long cord.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these dryers and both were defective.  The directions say to \\&quot;use the appropriate tool\\&quot; to change voltage, but there is no tool.  It is impossible to get the dial to change position. I had to return both original and replacement dryer.</li>
    <li> I used this hairdryer while on a trip to Ireland.  While it&#x27;s true that you only get one functioning speed when using the dryer with 240 volts, the speed you have is very powerful.  I stayed at a number of hotels that had dryers available, but in most cases, I used this one instead.  This gave me the convenience of using it anywhere in the room and had more power than those supplied by the hotels.  It is very light weight and compact for packing.  I would definitely recommend this to others who want to be certain they have a functioning hair dryer while in European countries without having to purchase and take the risk of using a convertor.  A plug adapter is still necessary.  A simple turn of a screw using your fingernail changes the dryer from 120-240 volts.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my trip to Irleland. It is lightweight and easy to handle. My hair is long and thick and it dried it just fine.</li>
    <li> While preparing for a few weeks in Europe, my girlfriend mentioned bringing her hair dryer. I explained that hair dryers can&#x27;t simply be plugged into an adapter. You need a complicated, often expensive, voltage converter that can handle the power draw of a high wattage appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured for the price of a converter we could likely just find a 220v hair dryer and then rather than carry her giant hair dryer, AND a bulky converter, we&#x27;d just have one compact device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, we stayed in several hotels, and ALL OF THEM had hair dryers in them. We didn&#x27;t need to bring anything at all. Moreover, this one is pretty weak, and the ones in the hotels tended to be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my advice is this: if you&#x27;re going to Europe, don&#x27;t bother buying and packing a hair dryer. Just use the one in the hotel. And if you should happen to find yourself in a hotel that doesn&#x27;t have one, you can probably buy something better than this one for about the same money while you&#x27;re there, and you&#x27;ll have saved yourself the hassle of packing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color with healthy hydrated curly textured hair. It is ESSENTIAL that I have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage. I didnt expect anything from this $13 dryer, but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally. I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED. I&#x27;ve spent HUNDREDS of dollars on T3, CHI Pro, Superstar -- and they all work GREAT. Well, while this isnt  100% comparable, its near 80% comparable. Fantastic quality! This is one of your best bets for a good quality, high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune. I will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when I hit the DC humidity than it does when I use my other blow dryers. But still, a small, minor complaint given that it is less than $20, travels well without taking up space, and gets a decent temperature with good air flow.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little hair dryer. Seems to work well. If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it&#x27;s a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be. But all in all, a nice dryer.</li>
    <li> I use this to travel internationally (so far just Denmark and Spain) and it worked fine with the European adapter. Just make sure to flip the little voltage switch before you use it!</li>
    <li> I stayed at a Lowe&#x27;s hotel in LA last year and they had this hairdryer in the hotel room and feel in love with it.  I liked it&#x27;s compact, lightweight feel and it comes with a diffuser that I keep on all the time.  I find it dries my hair quickly and it was relatively inexpensive for the $19 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to find good hair dryer with 16oo watts. I live in an older house and the 1875 watts are too high a wattage. This dryer is small and very light. I was delighted at how efficient it is. It dries my hair very quickly on the high setting. The controls are simple. The unit is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> just what i needed in a dual voltage hairdryer, i am always finding myself in a 220v environment (europe and australia) and these are perfect for the long haired musician on the go</li>
    <li> I used it in New Zealand and Australia and it worked great with plenty of heat and power. I was glad to have the voltage change switch.</li>
    <li> So far, after 6 weeks of ownership, I am pleased with this purchase.  I was looking for a small, compact dryer--which this is, plus one that had an adequately low setting that would not blow hair all over the place as it is drying it--which this doesn&#x27;t do.  The nice size prevents &amp;#34;arm weakness&amp;#34; from usage.  It also does not take up much space under the cabinet.  Although not a big deal, the one I received was not exactly like the one on the Amazon site.  The size was the same, but the lettering was different.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Perfect little hair dryer, especially for international travel.  No issues switching between voltages.  It&#x27;s powerful for something so small.  The low setting doesn&#x27;t do much, you basically have to use high.  Compact.</li>
