      <li>Great product, great service.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job.</li>
      <li>This is a great sponge.</li>
      <li>I had a great experience with this seller.  </li>
      <li>As someone mentioned already - use deluded hydrogen peroxide to soak the sponge once in a while, about every month is perfect, to kill off the bacteria and make sure there&#x27;s no chance of mold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was a good find.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great size and one of my favorite bath accessories.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>The lather I get with body wash is amazing.  </li>
      <li>With that said, it&#x27;s still a really nice bath sponge</li>
      <li>Love the sponge - seems to be good quality, seems like it will hold up.  </li>
      <li>It balls up nicely into the size you need to scrub with.</li>
      <li>this sponge is attractive and useful for shower or bath</li>
      <li>It is soft and a wonderful exfoliant.</li>
      <li>This is not that extra high superb quality from Germany what I was looking for but it is very good.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality -- they last forever.</li>
      <li>After using this authentic sea sponge, I can&#x27;t imagine ever being satisfied with anything else.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought from eBubbles before, and I would gladly buy from them again.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely sponge.</li>
      <li>Will update when I have more info.</li>
      <li>Great soft sponge.</li>
      <li>more thing worth noting - they do require periodic maintenance.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll just need to order another one for bathing, because this sponge is just plain AWESOME.  </li>
      <li>You feel scrubbed clean.</li>
      <li>Very soft and fits in your hand nicely.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s just another sponge and not anything special.</li>
      <li>I like the slightly rough texture of this sponge, and it works great.</li>
      <li>About to purchase it again because my boyfriend wants one for himself after using mine :)</li>
      <li>I am loving it so far.</li>
      <li>The first one&#x27;s lasted about 8 months and is still going strong despite losing a a chunk here and there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not round like the picture, it&#x27;s more of a rectangle.</li>
      <li>So I think I got my moneys worth. ..</li>
      <li>My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>So soft that my baby love to bath with it.</li>
      <li>I started using this sponge instead of a wash cloth and the soap rinses right off.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 and both of them are very large size.</li>
      <li>This is something I purchased for faux finishing, and now I feel like it&#x27;s almost a little too good to have used for that.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>First it broke into halves.  </li>
      <li>So far this sponge outlived most natural sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Really...</li>
      <li>Just like with most natural sponges there&#x27;s an initial break-in period.</li>
      <li>Lathers beautifully, particularly if you use a liquid soap.  </li>
      <li>It seems like it was cut from the middle of a growth, as the top and bottom of the sponge is flat.</li>
      <li>They were surprised as well and have commented on how much they like this product.</li>
      <li>It bounces right back after each shower.</li>
      <li>Most of the others are small, undersized, and whimpy.</li>
      <li>I got this one quick and it&#x27;s big enough to split it and make Two!!</li>
      <li>The vendor should make this distinction clear to the buyer before purchase is made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Latka</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this sponge a year ago and it lasted so far.</li>
      <li>I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a real sponge for bathing.</li>
      <li>So far has held up well.</li>
      <li>Get something rougher for exfoliation and use this after for major lathering.</li>
      <li>but I believe both are inevitable with natural sponges.  </li>
      <li>As ridiculous as this sounds, I actually did a lot of reading and research on sea sponges before deciding to purchase this one, and aside from it not being quite as rough as I was initially hoping for, I am still very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>We bought another one (from Amazon) as replacement but will likely order this one again in the near future.</li>
      <li>Minor issues compared to the absorbency and softness natural sponges provide.</li>

<li> We bought another one (from Amazon) as replacement but will likely order this one again in the near future.</li>

<li> The sponge split down the middle along what seems like a natural split in how the sponge grew, but it seemed to be glued together.</li>
<li> The only thing I was a little disappointed about was that I was hoping it was going to be a bit more exfoliating, when in reality it&#x27;s pretty soft when wet.</li>
<li> The only thing is that it is a large spherical sponge cut in half, basically making it round on one side and completely flat on the other.</li>
<li> Also, dry it well after each use.&lt;br</li>
<li> Just remember to rinse it and squeeze it dry.</li>
<li> But because the sponge is so big even half can be used.  </li>
<li> couple of small pieces broke off but nothing major.</li>
<li> We have soft water and it&#x27;s hard to get soap to rinse off.</li>
<li> I was replacing a sponge I had purchased in Greece 4 years ago, used everyday, and only replaced it because it wearing out from the usage and cleaning.  </li>
<li> It never completely disintegrated like the much less expensive ones you would normally find at the large chain stores although from time to time a few small pieces does fall off.  </li>
<li> This Natural Sea Grass Sponge is not appropriate as a bath sponge, it is too hard.  </li>
<li> It will feel a little scratchy for a week or two but it will soften up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
<li> ; I bet it&#x27;d be just plain luxurious in a bath tub!</li>
<li> Not so bad, just not natural.</li>
<li> Such a disappointment!</li>
<li> It dries well, so it doesn&#x27;t stay damp in your shower or smell bad or anything like that.</li>
<li> Too bad this one is just for painting</li>
<li> It is the worst sponge I have ever used!</li>
<li> This Sponge is terrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product, great service.  I&#x27;ve bought from eBubbles before, and I would gladly buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Love the sponge - seems to be good quality, seems like it will hold up.  The lather I get with body wash is amazing.  It&#x27;s a bit abrasive, but not enough to exfoliate your entire body (maybe your face).  Get something rougher for exfoliation and use this after for major lathering.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for over a week now and it&#x27;s been great.  Very soft and fits in your hand nicely.  So far so good.  I might update this review later on when it starts to break apart which I guess is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The sponge started breaking apart after about 8-9 months of daily use.  First it broke into halves.  But because the sponge is so big even half can be used.  It never completely disintegrated like the much less expensive ones you would normally find at the large chain stores although from time to time a few small pieces does fall off.  We bought another one (from Amazon) as replacement but will likely order this one again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I like the slightly rough texture of this sponge, and it works great. However, after only 4 months it is starting to degrade. I fear it will fall apart soon. Will update when I have more info.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge a lot. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was that I was hoping it was going to be a bit more exfoliating, when in reality it&#x27;s pretty soft when wet. With that said, it&#x27;s still a really nice bath sponge and I use it every time I shower. It dries well, so it doesn&#x27;t stay damp in your shower or smell bad or anything like that. As ridiculous as this sounds, I actually did a lot of reading and research on sea sponges before deciding to purchase this one, and aside from it not being quite as rough as I was initially hoping for, I am still very pleased with this product. About to purchase it again because my boyfriend wants one for himself after using mine :)</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this seller.  My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  I would definitely transact business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> We buy them every year now. Excellent quality -- they last forever. I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a real sponge for bathing. It is soft and a wonderful exfoliant. It balls up nicely into the size you need to scrub with.</li>
    <li> This sea sponge is great. I&#x27;ve had it for well over a year, maybe even two; its just now starting to fall apart. So I think I got my moneys worth. ..</li>
    <li> I had a synthetic sponge and bought this one to replace it it&#x27;s a great size and one of my favorite bath accessories.</li>
    <li> I use it every day. It does a great job. Really... it&#x27;s amazing. We have soft water and it&#x27;s hard to get soap to rinse off. I started using this sponge instead of a wash cloth and the soap rinses right off. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m still slimy with soap. Now I told this to some family and they didn&#x27;t believe me, so I bought several of these and gave to them to try. They were surprised as well and have commented on how much they like this product.</li>
    <li> This is something I purchased for faux finishing, and now I feel like it&#x27;s almost a little too good to have used for that.  I guess I&#x27;ll just need to order another one for bathing, because this sponge is just plain AWESOME.  I can run water into it for what seems like an eternity before it comes thru the bottom.  Too bad this one is just for painting; I bet it&#x27;d be just plain luxurious in a bath tub!</li>
    <li> I bought this item cause someone said it helped remove the soap when using a water softener.  It didn&#x27;t help at all.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s just another sponge and not anything special.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these.  More expensive than the nylon scrubbers you can get at the grocery store but they stay fresher longer.  Just remember to rinse it and squeeze it dry.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. Its big. It bounces right back after each shower. I am loving it so far. hopefully it will be as durable as I am hoping</li>
    <li> This is a great sponge. Most of the others are small, undersized, and whimpy. I got this one quick and it&#x27;s big enough to split it and make Two!! I cut one piece off for a face sponge and was left with a big one for the bath.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second.  The first one&#x27;s lasted about 8 months and is still going strong despite losing a a chunk here and there. It also has some darker sections but I believe both are inevitable with natural sponges.  Minor issues compared to the absorbency and softness natural sponges provide.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely sponge. So far has held up well. The only thing is that it is a large spherical sponge cut in half, basically making it round on one side and completely flat on the other. Not so bad, just not natural. Otherwise, I am totally happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This Sponge is terrible! It&#x27;s not round like the picture, it&#x27;s more of a rectangle. It seems like it was cut from the middle of a growth, as the top and bottom of the sponge is flat. The shape could be overlooked, but I&#x27;ve had it for a month and it&#x27;s already falling apart. The sponge split down the middle along what seems like a natural split in how the sponge grew, but it seemed to be glued together. There is sticky material in between the two split parts. The sponge would actually be a lot smaller if the two sides weren&#x27;t glued together. Such a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Great soft sponge. I ordered 2 and both of them are very large size. So soft that my baby love to bath with it.</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband, he loves it. It&#x27;s not too soft, and not too rough. Perfect for a man.</li>
    <li> this sponge is attractive and useful for shower or bath</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this sponge a year ago and it lasted so far. Just like with most natural sponges there&#x27;s an initial break-in period. It will feel a little scratchy for a week or two but it will soften up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of small pieces broke off but nothing major. So far this sponge outlived most natural sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing worth noting - they do require periodic maintenance. As someone mentioned already - use deluded hydrogen peroxide to soak the sponge once in a while, about every month is perfect, to kill off the bacteria and make sure there&#x27;s no chance of mold. Also, dry it well after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good find. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Arrived in excellent quality! I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> It is not just a one piece. They sticked sponges together to make a bigger one! And after it soaks up some water it started to break even in my 3rd use!! Do Not Buy this product!! It is the worst sponge I have ever used!</li>
    <li> After using this authentic sea sponge, I can&#x27;t imagine ever being satisfied with anything else. The sponge may not be as durable as washcloths or body scrubbers, but the feeling of luxury is unrivaled.</li>
    <li> I used this sponge 8 days and it totally fell apart into shreds.  I was replacing a sponge I had purchased in Greece 4 years ago, used everyday, and only replaced it because it wearing out from the usage and cleaning.  This was a waste of money.  DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> Nothing like this in the shower.  A brisk, cleansing sponge tops anything else.  Lathers beautifully, particularly if you use a liquid soap.  You feel scrubbed clean.</li>
    <li> This Natural Sea Grass Sponge is not appropriate as a bath sponge, it is too hard.  I should have purchased the Sea Wool Sponge.  The vendor should make this distinction clear to the buyer before purchase is made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Latka</li>
    <li> This is not that extra high superb quality from Germany what I was looking for but it is very good.</li>
