<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything and it has an incredibly strong horrible smell. Tried it for a week but the smell was too much.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. It keeps me moisturized through the whole day, and the scent is natural and appealing. I have used it after showering, and applied it to damp skin, and also used it on dry skin. It works well both ways.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Made my skin feel and look amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love the product since I have been using it my skin is so hydrated and soft. I would recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;m getting ready to try the facial products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWSOME!!! I received it just a few days after ordering. I put it on right after i showered like directed and my skin looks and feels great! I will order this product again and i have never been so satisfied with a product like this before. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Great product, not oily. Makes skin so soft and amazing helps tan!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very much but what it&#x27;s done for my tan is great! :)</li>
    <li> This smells exactly like bug spray. Not sure I would ever use it in public to tan.</li>
    <li> Just receivedid this product in the mail and have to admit the smell is less than pleasant but as soon as I sprayed this on my extremely dry, sensetive skin, it felt quenched and soothed for the first time in months!  Maybe I&#x27;ll add a fee drops of lavender essential oil to help with the smell.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Smell was just okay.  Although it is an oil, it goes on nicely without feeling greasy but probably not something I would order again.  Didn&#x27;t really see where it made my tan glow or last any longer.</li>
    <li> This natural tanning oil is so gentle. It leaves just the right about of moisture without being oily while helping me to get a beautiful tan. My skin drinks this in like water, it’s refreshing. I use this on my face with great results. My face is smooth and glowing!</li>
    <li> Very silky feel, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It does exactly what people are saying. Smooth skin, great for a bronzed tan (was only outside for a half hour or so) and I love that the ingredients are safe to put on your skin. I would definitely buy their products again.</li>
    <li> LOVE. I have been laying in the South Florida sun for years and as I got older I noticed I wasn&#x27;t tanning as well. I used this outside one time so far and I can&#x27;t believe how well it worked! It normally takes me days just to see the result I got from this one time! Makes my skin amazingly soft. Defiantly have to use on moist skin, if not it&#x27;s hard to spread.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of the reviews on here I was worried this serum would stink but thankfully, IT DOESN&#x27;T!!  It smells more natural/spa like than deet/bug spray-esque.  Haven&#x27;t suntanned with it yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what this does for my skin.  I have dry, sometimes uber itchy skin and I&#x27;m really hoping this with soothe it.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin super smooth without being oily after application, it soaks right into your skin. The smell is also amazing. I took my bottle to the beach and all of my family and friends wanted to try it out as well because of the scent!</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic...makes my skin feel so smooth and I swear it&#x27;s even making my laugh lines around my mouth&lt;br /&gt;less noticeable. I&#x27;m in love with this product! It evens out my skin tone and really makes my skin smooth and soft. I have&lt;br /&gt;a tendency to break out, and this hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all. It actually seems like my skin is clearer and I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;using it for a few weeks now</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;I even have my friends ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s makes your skin so soft and natural glow</li>
    <li> This is gold people! I love this stuff! I first saw it on Pinterest and then read up on it.  I can’t say how beautiful my skin looks and feels! Amazing!  I now have four others hooked on it. When I laid out for the first time this summer I used this as my tanning oil and I had a beautiful, brown tan on the first day!!  I’m 44 and was starting to get crepey skin and creases on my chest, they are almost gone! I’ve only been using two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to moisturize but I look forward to applying this daily! I love the fragrance. It soaks in completely and keeps my skin from feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I found this to be awful and I threw it away!!  It is very oily and gets everywhere.  Other posts say that it gets absorbed in your skin quickly but I found that not to be the case. It did absolutely nothing for the texture or feel of my skin but make it oily and messy.  It also has a nasty smell like bug spray.  I would never have worn it in public.  I bought it because I had hoped it would give me a golden tan in the tanning bed (getting ready for vacation).  IT DID NOT!  Stick with the lotion designed for tanning beds, it works MUCH better.  The picture of the person on Pinterest with the dark beautiful tan advertising the product could not possibly have gotten that way by using this serum. Reminder to self: if it seems too good to be true, it usually is!!!!  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Starting off with shipping speed. It was expected to be delivered August 10-13. I got it August 7th!&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened it I definitely thought it smelled like bug spray but it&#x27;s not a bad scent. It&#x27;s like citrusy and natural and when you put it on your skin it&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s not bad at all! I kind of like it! The oil it easy to rub it and feels dry and moisturized. Gonna try using it after a shower since I didn&#x27;t get a chance to do that yet. I think it&#x27;ll work even better. It&#x27;s been cloudy so I haven&#x27;t tested the tanning aspect of it yet</li>
    <li> Really gives you that tanned look when out in the sun</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. It smells so great &amp; keeps my skin moisturized all day. I have very dry sensitive skin &amp; have a hard time finding products that work or don&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love that it&#x27;s all natural &amp; uses essential oils. I would recommend this to anyone! It really is amazing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Makes skin have a beautiful glow. Baby soft!</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! The only thing I will use in the sun!</li>
    <li> Stuff is wonderful love it</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin.... Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I love it and plan to order more!</li>
    <li> I worried about the octinoxate and octisalate in many products. I figure I would rather use all natural ingredients to tan and be on the safe side. It is a lot more expensive than chemical-based sunscreens but it is a great product to keep my skin moisturized while getting an awesome tan.</li>
    <li> Skin has never felt or looked better!</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin has never felt this soft or had this much of a glow. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I seen this on Pinterest and was always curious. I absolutely love the smell and love the oil. It soaks in my skin and leaves it hydrated all day. I do have sensitive skin andust be careful but I love natural products and this product does extremely well on my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Love this as my after shower moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Great tanning solution. I was impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> Worst smelling stuff ever</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels amazing! It has smooth the rough patches and has given it an even tone! Love.</li>
    <li> This body serum is amazing! I read many reviews before purchasing this product. I apply it every night before bed and again every morning. My skin is super smooth and supple after using it. I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and smells great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for moisturizing your skin but I didn&#x27;t care for scent. Smelled like geraniums to me,could have a tropical scent.</li>
    <li> It smells fabulous, I haven&#x27;t really seen a major change but I assume it takes some time.</li>
    <li> Very nice feeling on my dry skin. Will get it again.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. It helps with keeping your from looking dry and gives your body a nice flow. I really like this newfound product.</li>
    <li> This is super soft. I had heard on other sites that this helps boost color in your skin (natural tan) so I decided to give it a shot. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if that&#x27;s true or not yet. But I love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have dermatitis and itchy dry red patches on my skin. I bought this as a last-ditch effort. It has all but totally cleared it up in 3 weeks. The smell is NOT bad, I think it smells good! I only wish they made a bigger bottle. I will use this as my daily moisturizer and buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale this is the only product I&#x27;ve used that turn my skin golden in the sun. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product really works in the sun it is different than normal sun Yan lotions and you can notice a difference in a few sun bathings</li>
    <li> I ordered this with high hopes because I had seen it all over Pinterest for its &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; on the skin. I originally got it because many said it was good for tanning, whichever have found it is not. I am Italian and have natural olive skin which tans very well, but I felt as if this oil slowed down my tanning process. The smell is really citrusy and gross (when I had it on people would complain about how it smelled also) and Bees are VERY attracted to it haha. It didn&#x27;t help my skin tan and it just left me with a really weird feeling on my skin. I love lotions and oils but this one was just not for me.</li>
    <li> Shopping was fast I got it a day early. I purchased it to use for tanning so haven&#x27;t tried it for that yet but used it after I took a shower and smells and works great!</li>
    <li> It feels really nice,  but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference.</li>
    <li> While the product works well, the smell is less than desirable and stains light clothes.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing body serum that has helped me tremendously with my dry, itchy skin. This lightly scented oil feels so luxurious on my skin. I like to apply this body serum after I had a shower I find my skin absorbs it well when I apply it when my skin is damp. I simply use the spray nozzle that comes with the serum. Another way I like to use this serum is by adding about 1 -2 tsp to a bath. Since hot water is super bad for dry skin by adding this oil in my bath I have noticed less itchy skin. If adding this oil to  bath be very careful because it can become slippery.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this oil if you have dry skin or are just looking for more hydration.</li>
    <li> Oh balls! It does smell like fly spray!  Or what the other half says,  deet...I&#x27;m taking this puppy campin&#x27;! Hopefully I&#x27;ll have beautiful legs by the time we&#x27;re back!</li>
    <li> Love using this.some people have said the smell is bad.I think it smells great.</li>
    <li> received 2 days ago, and already love this</li>
    <li> Love it , it does exactly what it claims !</li>
    <li> Love the oil, but it spurts and splatters when you spray it on your skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived late and after putting on the squirt nozzle and trying it for the first time it broke. I emailed the company and they were very quick to respond to the issue.  They&#x27;re in the process of sending me a new nozzle and refunding me my purchase. After trying the product I fell in love. It smells amazing and conditions your skin to the maximum. After one use it has gotten rid of my eczema and healed any dry patches of skin. Ialso have real bad bumps on my arms that have almost disappeared over night. I am a customer for life. It&#x27;s a miracle worker. And I&#x27;m looking forward to using it as a tanning  product too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My skin loves it. I had these random red dots that magically went away after I began using this product. It also helped valence out my face. My problem areas are tamed and my looks and feels beautiful. It smells great and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dry skin because I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore . Been using it for over 3 weeks now and I can tell the difference . My skin is now hydratated and feels nice when I touch it . The smell is not very pleasant but can get over it because it really helps and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me .</li>
    <li> I just got it in last week and I used it for tanning outside in the pool.  Does it wash off in the pool or something because I just got burned, no tan and that was my purpose of getting it.  I read on pinterest it was a great tanning source.  I am kind of afraid to use it again in the sun.  I even got out to re apply it kind of like you would sun screen.  Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
    <li> Smells great, not  greasy , skin is baby soft.</li>
    <li> Product made me break out and burn. Threw it away. Will never use again</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product at first. I read several positive reviews &amp; feedback on Pinterest, so I decided to check out the reviews on Amazon. They were all positive as well, so I figured I would give this a try. So far I am very pleased - this product smells great and goes on and absorbs quickly, without leaving my skin feeling too oily. My skin tends to look dry often, so I have to reapply lotion regularly. I like being able to use this &amp; not feel terribly oily afterwards.</li>
    <li> This made my skin feel so so soft! I know others speak of the tanning aspect but I love the smoothing feeling.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this stuff because all the ad&#x27;s and hype made it sound great but boy was I disappointed. First off let me tell you I tan very easily it takes a lot for me to burn. My cocoa butter tans better than this. I will say if your looking for a nice body oil it&#x27;s great, but not for getting a better tan as it claims.</li>
