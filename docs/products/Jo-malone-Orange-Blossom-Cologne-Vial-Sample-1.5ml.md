      <li>Magnificent scent.</li>
      <li>We moved from upstate NY to Calif in 1957 and as a child I thought how wonderful Calif smelled.</li>
      <li>Jo Malone Orange Blossom is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I was raised around orange groves and the beautiful fragrance of orange blossoms.  </li>
      <li>This was great to try a product that I may purchase soon</li>
      <li>Nothing is more beautiful than the scent of orange blossoms.</li>
      <li>smells great and it doesn&#x27;t take much to smell wonderful.</li>
      <li>Nice and smells very refreshing</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>My new favorite fragrance!!!</li>
      <li>Fresh scent - so pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Got this as a gift for christmas and wanted more.</li>
      <li>I love the scent - a nice, light floral that doesn&#x27;t choke you out as a wearer or outsider.</li>
      <li>It smells better than Lushes Orange Blossom.</li>
      <li>More like a gardenia.</li>
      <li>The scent is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume.</li>
      <li>Better name would be &amp;#34;Gardens of Versailles&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Versailles&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I bought a Jo Malone &amp;#34;Nectarine and Honey&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s more to my liking - my husband loves it too.</li>
      <li>This is - as most Jo Malone scents are - light.</li>
      <li>While the scent is lovely indeed its a bit too light.</li>
      <li>This sample was pricey but worth it!  </li>
      <li>Jo Malone&#x27;s cologne comes close, although there&#x27;s nothing like being blessed to have a bouquet of fresh orange blossoms around!  </li>
      <li>Light and not too sweet.</li>
      <li>Very powerful at first, use lightly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, orangey and fun!</li>
      <li>Bought this to see if it was worth buying the full size and let me tell you....</li>
      <li>this is okay but not like the old one I remember</li>
      <li>Lasts all day when applied the right way.</li>
      <li>Reminded me exactly of Gardens at Versailles when orange trees were in bloom.</li>
      <li>Alas, many of the large citrus groves have gone, but I can still recall the scent with this amazing fragrance.</li>
      <li>Malone&#x27;s fragrance is a gentle reminder...</li>
      <li>So far no luck!</li>
      <li>I first caught this scent in passing from a nurse who was helping me in post-op last summer in the ER.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me exactly of all the orange groves growing up in Southern California.</li>
      <li>Lush discontinued theirs and couldn&#x27;t find a comparable scent.</li>

<li> TOO small with large shipping</li>

<li> similar to citronella - certainly not orange blossom.</li>
<li> Too expensive for such a small item, especially when you add on the shipping and handling cost.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid I have to find a scent for less money.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so expensive</li>
