      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Acts more like a barrier.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the stuff.</li>
      <li>We used this for a bedsore healing program and it seemed to work pretty good for keeping infection out and healing the skin.</li>
      <li>kind of like desitin as far as texture wise....</li>
      <li>Now, when ever I see any bit of redness on her bottom, I apply this at bedtime and by morning she&#x27;s a good as new!</li>
      <li>It has a cooling effect and some ingredient in it like pixie dust that heals skin very quickly.  </li>

      <li>love this stuff so much.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know why pediatricians don&#x27;t suggest this right away.  </li>

      <li>Didn&#x27;t help much with what i wanted it for.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Overall, this product is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>live and learn.</li>
      <li>used this at my dr&#x27;s recommendation for my 16 month old son - cleared his diaper rash up immediately!  </li>
      <li>for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t completely heal the area so we switch off between calmoseptine, triple paste and balmex which does the job.</li>
      <li>I use it for everything, it&#x27;s completely waterproof and has a soothing, cooling effect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just felt itchy before using it, but after use it for only one night, the whole skin turns red and rashes came out!</li>
      <li>Her back end gets very sore and red.  </li>
      <li>It goes on thick, water will slid right off of it and the menthol is very soothing to the skin.</li>
      <li>Really calms and heals and the same time and stays on a long time.</li>
      <li>Put a thin layer on it with some cotton pants and by the morning it is all better.</li>
      <li>One needs to apply it in the evening and again the next morning directly on the bed sore and around any red area and do this every day.</li>

<li> Product is non irritating and mildly anesthetic.&lt;br</li>
<li> for a calming physical barrier betwixt irritated tissues and fluids, other irritants.</li>
<li> I am currently using this on a patient and it has healed a problem area that would not heal with other OTC Ointments.</li>
<li> Only a small amount need be used and it will last a long time were one to use a Q-tip to apply it.</li>
<li> and I tried all the regular creams with no success.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is viscous, stiff, and has low water solubility.</li>
<li> i imagine it cuts down the acidity of her stool.</li>
<li> I tried it because of some previous reviews saying how it had been a miracle for them.</li>
<li> The pinkish/reddish dots all over my sides disappeared in less than 2 weeks when I used it faithfully.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick, that little tube will last the rest of my life!</li>
<li> Can get a little messy.....</li>
<li> I still itched like crazy and it was still really inflamed.</li>
<li> It is thick, sticky, and pink.</li>
<li> There is no thinning of delicate tissue, like a cortisone ointment can cause.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really not useful besides, it makes my skin even worse!</li>
<li> this was actually recommended by my daughters urologist to help treat her horrible diaper rash caused from the daily antibiotics she is required to take.</li>
<li> My son constantly had really bad diaper rashes as a baby</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to wash off your hands!</li>
<li> If you have to resort to using a tegaderm then it is really tough getting this off.  </li>
<li> This cream is very thick and cooling.</li>
<li> when the area is bad we use a thick layer of it but a very thin layer for daily use when the rash isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> Bought this for my 5 month old daughter who had a nasty diaper rash.  </li>
<li> My skin desperately needed moisture</li>
<li> There have been a couple times where the pain is so bad that I can&#x27;t even walk.</li>
<li> BUT LEAVES A VERY BAD STAIN ON CLOTHS</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s really not useful besides, it makes my skin even worse! I just felt itchy before using it, but after use it for only one night, the whole skin turns red and rashes came out! So regret to use it!</li>
    <li> this was actually recommended by my daughters urologist to help treat her horrible diaper rash caused from the daily antibiotics she is required to take. it takes away all the redness from the rash and helps heal the large and small open sores. for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t completely heal the area so we switch off between calmoseptine, triple paste and balmex which does the job. when the area is bad we use a thick layer of it but a very thin layer for daily use when the rash isn&#x27;t bad. as a note, we found that adding solid food to her diet has kept her rash gone!! i imagine it cuts down the acidity of her stool. if i would have known that before i would have introduced food to her before her 6mth bday. ugh. live and learn.</li>
    <li> used this at my dr&#x27;s recommendation for my 16 month old son - cleared his diaper rash up immediately!  Much better than desitin clear or aquaphor - you&#x27;ll notice the results within hours.</li>
    <li> Great for people who have Crohns</li>
    <li> It works great! Big Happy Face!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why pediatricians don&#x27;t suggest this right away.  It works wonderful for red irritated skin.  Clears up the rash within a day or two and soothes irritation and pain.  The best diaper rash treatment!</li>
    <li> good product. would buy again</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  My son constantly had really bad diaper rashes as a baby and I tried all the regular creams with no success.  My neighbor recommended this stuff and it works like a charm.  Within 24 hours the rash was gone.</li>
    <li> We tried every diaper rash ointment on the shelf and none of them compared to Calmoseptine. This is an outstanding product which can be used in numerous ways. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This ointment work wonders on a weeping rash.  It protects the skin from the moisture and has a nice light menthol sensation.  It&#x27;s so good it&#x27;s hard to wash off your hands!</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL BUT LEAVES A VERY BAD STAIN ON CLOTHS</li>
    <li> This stuff is so sticky you can&#x27;t wash it off with soap. I have always used Zinc Oxide for skin issues. This is used in places where abrasion causes redness and it stays.  If you have to resort to using a tegaderm then it is really tough getting this off.  So choose wisely where you use this...</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product for healing!</li>
    <li> Thrilled with product n shipping!</li>
    <li> kind of like desitin as far as texture wise....Can get a little messy..... Really works on bottom rash......Will buy again....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a type-one (juvenile-onset) diabetic and I use a Medtronic Paradigm Silhouette insulin pump. A nurse gave me samples of the Calmoseptine and recommended it based on the comments of another patient. It works really nicely in getting rid of my infusion scars so quickly! The pinkish/reddish dots all over my sides disappeared in less than 2 weeks when I used it faithfully. (Maybe 3 days?) I can wear a bikini without worrying if the pinkish-red dots are showing since they no longer exist! So I decided to purchase a full-size tube of this stuff. It is thick, sticky, and pink. Rub it in well. If any of the Calmoseptine gets on your clothes, it washes out easily. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This came highly r ecommended and I know why - it works!</li>
    <li> If you are a woman who has disruptive vaginal itching, or vaginal dermatitis, or you have a baby with severe diaper rash, Calmoseptine is for you.  This ointment provides a protective barrier that promotes healing. It also soothes and cools the itching. There is no thinning of delicate tissue, like a cortisone ointment can cause. Overall, this product is well worth the price. I have been using it now for 3, or 4 years, and and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have a scratch or injury?  This stuff is great.  It has a cooling effect and some ingredient in it like pixie dust that heals skin very quickly.  I love it.  It&#x27;s a must have for every medicine cabinet.  If you get a paper cut or slice your finger, put this stuff on it for a couple of days.  It&#x27;s a miracle cream.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 5 month old daughter who had a nasty diaper rash.  After using this for a day, the rash was practically gone!  Now, when ever I see any bit of redness on her bottom, I apply this at bedtime and by morning she&#x27;s a good as new!</li>
    <li> A nurse-friend turned me on to this product. I use it for everything, it&#x27;s completely waterproof and has a soothing, cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for bites, rashes, irritations, and I&#x27;ve even used it on my dog-it stops the itch!!  I&#x27;d recommend keeping some on hand&lt;br /&gt;all the time. Love this product!! Jarjudy.</li>
    <li> I have a cat, that tends to urinate on herself because her anatomy is built that way.  Her back end gets very sore and red.  My Vet recommended this product for her, to keep her comfortable, and to keep her behind from getting infected.  It works great, and is ok for use on cats.</li>
    <li> is what it is.  I like this because it&#x27;s not greasy but still forms an obious layer over sores or just chapped hands.  We used this for a bedsore healing program and it seemed to work pretty good for keeping infection out and healing the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for a diaper rash. My dermatologist recommended this to me when I had a rash. It goes on thick, water will slid right off of it and the menthol is very soothing to the skin. This the the only thing that I will use on my baby.</li>
    <li> Best product out there for skin rashes, makes such a difference in a very short time, often this is only thing that relieves itch and pain,</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I used it ONCE and it worked immediately.  I was so impressed with it that I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Product is non irritating and mildly anesthetic.&lt;br /&gt;It is viscous, stiff, and has low water solubility. Stays put.&lt;br /&gt;Good for a calming physical barrier betwixt irritated tissues and fluids, other irritants.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the promptness of delivery and the condition of the product.</li>
    <li> I started using this for some eczema that I had on my back. I tried it because of some previous reviews saying how it had been a miracle for them. I found that it really didn&#x27;t work for me. I still itched like crazy and it was still really inflamed. It wasn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing. It&#x27;s more for keeping parts of the skin dry. I can see how it would be a successful product used for a different set of symptoms. My skin desperately needed moisture so I started using Aveeno lotion for eczema instead.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have been using this for many years.</li>
    <li> Acts more like a barrier. Didn&#x27;t help much with what i wanted it for. Will use it now and then. It&#x27;s very thick, that little tube will last the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Calmoseptine ointment is the most effective ointment I&#x27;ve found to treat bed sores.  One needs to apply it in the evening and again the next morning directly on the bed sore and around any red area and do this every day. Only a small amount need be used and it will last a long time were one to use a Q-tip to apply it.</li>
    <li> Works great used before</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered only 6 tubes of Calmoseptine oint 4 oz.  BUT to my surprise when the order came  It seems I ordere 18!  Don&#x27;t know how that happened.  But I guess in time I will use all 18 tubes!!!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful ointment. I am currently using this on a patient and it has healed a problem area that would not heal with other OTC Ointments.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick and cooling. Really calms and heals and the same time and stays on a long time.</li>
    <li> I was given samples of this cream when I was seeing a doctor about anal fissures. The actual doctor had been prescribing me a blood pressure medicine in a paste form to help heal my fissures, but one day he was out of the office and his assistant gave me the samples. I absolutely love the stuff. When I have a little anal itching all I have to do is pop some on the tender areas and I&#x27;m usually good in a couple of days. Also use it for hemorrhoids with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use for it is chafing. I am a bit overweight and sometimes I get some chafing on my inner thighs. There have been a couple times where the pain is so bad that I can&#x27;t even walk. Put a thin layer on it with some cotton pants and by the morning it is all better. No redness and no trace of even having any chafing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff so much. Trying to get my dad to use it on his eczema to see if it works!</li>
    <li> There are other similar products available that I have tried but they cost more and they don&#x27;t work as well.  Calmoseptine ointment has been tried and true for me.  I have been using Calmoseptine for over eight years and will never change.</li>
    <li> Best best diaper rash cream ever!!</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant smell and has the bonus of being somewhat arousing to me - it&#x27;s like a cooling lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets all over your underwear though so don&#x27;t wear fancy underwear.</li>
