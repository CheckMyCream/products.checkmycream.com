      <li>while I can&#x27;t say one way or another that it helps with dandruff, I can say that it smells great and seems to be okay for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo works just as good and has a very crisp fresh scent.</li>
      <li>That said, the smell is very very mild.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have all that strong a scent.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, and it seems to work just fine for a shampoo with pyrithione zinc.  </li>
      <li>It makes such a great lather, even if you do not use a lot.</li>
      <li>importantly, it works.</li>
      <li>I really liked this shampoo -- so much that I reordered after the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34</li>
      <li>In terms of actual anti-dandruff, this works great.</li>
      <li>This light shampoo protects against shampoo.</li>
      <li>He says it makes his hair feel smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell girlie.</li>
      <li>This CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Shampoo has a nice mild scent, lathers up quickly and nicely, and does help alleviate the dryness in my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I switched over to this type of CLEAR and dandruff is still gone, hair is &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean and It smells good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It prevented our scalp from itching and it did clean our hair - even the hair that was filled with spray and sand.</li>
      <li>and we are happy with how long it lasts between shampoos.</li>
      <li>does clean the hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>The shampoo gets hair clean and it stays clean.</li>
      <li>but I honestly think that&#x27;s an advertisement gimmick since it doesn&#x27;t smell very masculine.</li>
      <li>The CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo does a great job of cleansing his hair but most importantly keeping the necessary moisture to his hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>After a few uses, the Clear Men Scalp appears to be of good quality, and a great shampoo to keep in one&#x27;s long-term rotation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So far so good, I&#x27;m still married,</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue on his hair and it really embodies the name, \\&quot;Clear.\\&quot; Just a good, clear shampoo!</li>
      <li>It does keep his mild dandruff problem in check.</li>
      <li>We girls also liked the way this shampoo lathers up, nice and thick and the way it left our hair feeling, nice and clean and easy to run fingers through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did clean my hair and left it feeling nice.</li>
      <li>price is pretty good for a 12.9oz bottle, especially with the Subscribe &amp; Save discount.  </li>
      <li>All the different versions are great as an anti-dandruff shampoo and the scent while fresh and clean smelling is barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>The smell is minimal, and the dandruff control appears to be good.</li>
      <li>It seems to keep those unsightly flakes under control, so when we had the chance to try CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Deep Clean Hydration, we were hopeful this product would be as good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a somewhat muted scent but really nice, appealing and not overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>The king of Dandruff shampoo brands, Selsun Blue, is a great product but puts me off due to the strong medicine smell it leaves after the shower.</li>
      <li>However when my hair gets very itchy and dandruff filled in the winter time, I have doubts that this is strong enough to control it since it seems so gentle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It can give you a little tingly feeling when you leave it in, but that can feel good.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant but subtle aroma and my hair feels clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>It pretty well shampoos and conditions all in one.</li>
      <li>I love the deep cleansing it provides his hair</li>
      <li>Flip side of that, however, is the first day</li>
      <li>Generally speaking, I can&#x27;t use anything branded &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; (deodorant, body soap, shampoo), because the perfumes used are usually strong and it sets off my skin and it takes weeks to get the itching under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clear Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo provides my son&#x27;s hair clean hair and scalp without drying his hair and scalp out.</li>
      <li>Head and Shoulders has been a staple in our home for many years but we&#x27;ve changed to CLEAR after trying the CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>The shampoo itself is thicker than other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used, and is certainly a less is more kind of thing.</li>
      <li>The smell is very pleasing and it does seem to hydrate the scalp somewhat.</li>
      <li>It lathers up really well and didn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair.</li>
      <li>really like this shampoo, and</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t absolutely promise that they never test on animals, but claim to have as a goal the elimination of animal testing.</li>
      <li>though it is marketed to men, tho whole family likes it.</li>
      <li>Because, do you really want the person you&#x27;re dating to think you have dandruff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some of these tea tree mint/medicated shampoos are too intense.</li>
      <li>For those with dryer scalps or needing a stronger anti-dandruff shampoo, Clear may not be an option as Selsun Blue is really one of the better over the counter options in my opinion.</li>
      <li>As such, Clear works for me to help make sure flakes don&#x27;t fall on my clothes when at work or out on the town.</li>
      <li>At the price Amazon offers for it, I&#x27;ll likely buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>Deep Clean Hydration, 12.9 Ounce&lt;</li>
      <li>I consider my scalp to be mildly dry and not in need of a strong medicated anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>Yes, it’s only a feeling, but it does make you feel like something special is happening to your hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t exactly have a dandruff problem, but I do have sensitive skin (not just on my scalp).  </li>
      <li>I have tried a number of mens shampoos over the year and most are come and go, this one is a little better than the other brands I have tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but I think it smells a little too much like candy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It’s more like the consistency of a conditioner, just slightly thinner.</li>

    <li> Dandruff and dry scalp are sometimes an issue for me. I usually keep a separate bottle of anti- dandruff shampoo on hand for occasional use and I’m always up for trying a new brand. This is what led me to consider CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti- Dandruff Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used anything from CLEAR before so I went into this experience with no previous brand- name bias. And I am happy to report that the results are positive. My hair feels soft and my scalp feels less dry than before. There is less itching and my hair looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is thick and it has a scent that is menthol- like. When applied to the hair and scalp, it produces a cooling, tingling effect that is not unlike other shampoos with tea tree mint. Yes, it’s only a feeling, but it does make you feel like something special is happening to your hair and scalp. I like that the scent isn’t overbearing and the same could be said of the cooling effect. Some of these tea tree mint/medicated shampoos are too intense. CLEAR seems to have everything in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its ability to control dandruff and make my hair look and feel great, CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti- Dandruff Shampoo earns a high recommendation from me. I don’t know how readily available this product is at my local stores, but it’s definitely a product I will look for and purchase again.</li>
    <li> My son feels special that he has his own man&#x27;s shampoo. He says it makes his hair feel smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell girlie. (insert eye-ball roll here) It does keep his mild dandruff problem in check.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders has been a staple in our home for many years but we&#x27;ve changed to CLEAR after trying the CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner. We were all quite impressed with how it worked. It seems to keep those unsightly flakes under control, so when we had the chance to try CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Deep Clean Hydration, we were hopeful this product would be as good. IT IS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is marketed to men, tho whole family likes it. The smell is very pleasing and it does seem to hydrate the scalp somewhat. We have hard lime water that seems tough on the skin, so we can use all the hydration we can get. The shampoo gets hair clean and it stays clean. No worries about greasy hair by evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it continues to perform as well as it has been, CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Deep Clean Hydration will be another CLEAR product added to our hair care routine.</li>
    <li> Decent as dandruff shampoos go.  Personally I still prefer Head &amp; Shoulders Men but this will do as a substitute.</li>
    <li> This shampoo says it is for men, but it has worked for the ladies in the family too. It has a clean unobtrusive scent and the way the bottle is made, it can stand upside down so that you can get the last little bit of shampoo out without wasting any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It prevented our scalp from itching and it did clean our hair - even the hair that was filled with spray and sand. However when my hair gets very itchy and dandruff filled in the winter time, I have doubts that this is strong enough to control it since it seems so gentle.&lt;br /&gt;It does clean the hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t exactly have a dandruff problem, but I do have sensitive skin (not just on my scalp).  Generally speaking, I can&#x27;t use anything branded &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; (deodorant, body soap, shampoo), because the perfumes used are usually strong and it sets off my skin and it takes weeks to get the itching under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been 10 days, but I haven&#x27;t had the usual flare ups I get from switching shampoos, so fingers crossed it stays that way.  The shampoo lathers nicely and rinses out clean.  It also doesn&#x27;t have all that strong a scent.  It&#x27;s quite pleasant, and though it&#x27;s branded &amp;#34;men&#x27;s,&amp;#34; my wife agrees that the scent is unisex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this shampoo, and while I can&#x27;t say one way or another that it helps with dandruff, I can say that it smells great and seems to be okay for sensitive skin.  At the price Amazon offers for it, I&#x27;ll likely buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of mens shampoos over the year and most are come and go, this one is a little better than the other brands I have tried. I have a history of having bad dandruff and I tried the head and shoulders and that just left my hair feeling slimy, I tried the T-Gel but the smell was terrible and then I came across CLEAR brand and have tried a number of the mens clear shampoos and all seem to do the trick even the ones that are not specifically for anti-dandruff. I switched over to this type of CLEAR and dandruff is still gone, hair is &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean and It smells good. What more could you ask for in a shampoo?</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and so does my daughter (she the one who has dandruff). My husband didn&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; fragrance but my daughter and I both liked the smell.  We girls also liked the way this shampoo lathers up, nice and thick and the way it left our hair feeling, nice and clean and easy to run fingers through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are always trying new dandruff shampoos for my daughter and some of them smell really horrible, thankfully as I said this has a nice smell to it.  The active ingredient in this shampoo is 1% Pyrithione Zinc.  We have her alternate between the Pyrithione Zinc shampoos and the Salicylic Acid ones to get the best control for her dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the shape of the bottle and the way the top opens up.</li>
    <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoos. It smells great, is very refreshing, and cleans well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue on his hair and it really embodies the name, \\&quot;Clear.\\&quot; Just a good, clear shampoo!</li>
    <li> I’ve found so many dandruff shampoos over-dry hair, leaving it straw like and unmanageable. The Clear Men scalp &amp; hair is a daily anti-dandruff shampoo that claims to have a hydration lock formula.  So far I found that I see no evidence of over dried out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made with Ginseng, Tea Tree and Mint which leaves the hair healthy and refreshed.  If you lather up and leave the suds on your head for a few minutes before rinsing you’ll feel a slight tingle which is probably from the Pyrithione zinc.  As soon as you rinse you’ll feel a cooling chill as the water cleanses and revitalizes your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist has advised that my family does not wash our hair with shampoo daily but on a day on/day off basis.  This shampoo is working well for our needs.</li>
    <li> I like everything about CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff shampoo except for the smell.  It&#x27;s not awful, but I think it smells a little too much like candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is pretty good for a 12.9oz bottle, especially with the Subscribe &amp; Save discount.  It lathers really thick so a little bit will go a long way too.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but it seems to be as effective as Head and Shoulders for me, which is what I was using before.  I like it enough that I think I&#x27;ll try a different scent when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, and it seems to work just fine for a shampoo with pyrithione zinc.  That&#x27;s the same ingredient as Head &amp; Shoulders and it&#x27;s similar in action to the selenium shampoos like Selsun.  Pyrithione basically prevents high cell turnover hence less dandruff.  If you find that the pyrithione and selenium shampoos don&#x27;t work, try a shampoo with an antifungal like ketoconazole.  Ketoconazole is supposed to be similarly effective to selenium, but some products work better for some than others. All of these treatments are equally effective after four weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, leave the shampoo in for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing.  The shampoo may be used every day initially, and then every other day as symptoms improve.  If one type of shampoo doesn&#x27;t improve symptoms after 4 or 6 weeks, try a different shampoo - one with an ingredient different from pyrithione like selenium or ketoconazole.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this shampoo. The Tea Tree and Mint blend together for a really unique and pleasant smelling shampoo. They are marketing it as an anti-dandruff shampoo, but my understanding was that Tea Tree naturally fights dry scalp.Either way, a very nice smelling shampoo. One that I will definitely consider buying in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the corporate policy is to eliminate if at all possible all animal testing. They don&#x27;t absolutely promise that they never test on animals, but claim to have as a goal the elimination of animal testing.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different dandruff shampoos in the past but all tend to leave my hair extra dry and with a medicine like smell. I was hoping that the Clear Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff shampoo would be different and in some ways it was.  The first thing you notice is that the shampoo is a very thick white solution (Not clear by any means).  The scent is more like a faint apple but nothing like the ginseng and mint that its supposed to be.  It is better than most anti dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulder which have more of a medicine like fragrance.  The next thing you notice with this shampoo is that it takes a few times before you get any type of decent lather.  I am used to applying a shampoo twice before I get a lather but this one took 3-4 times before I got anything.  Once my hair dried it did look more hydrated than  it does with other dandruff shampoos so that is a big plus and no dandruff flakes could be seen.</li>
    <li> This CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Shampoo has a nice mild scent, lathers up quickly and nicely, and does help alleviate the dryness in my scalp.  It is a nice and creamy shampoo, and my hair feels clean and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo for my husband but I&#x27;ve also used it because I ran out of our regular Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo. This shampoo works just as good and has a very crisp fresh scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell masculine at all. I know that it says it&#x27;s for men but I honestly think that&#x27;s an advertisement gimmick since it doesn&#x27;t smell very masculine. It lathers up really well and didn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair. It was very moisturizing and that&#x27;s very important because I&#x27;m an black woman with natural hair. It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> The king of Dandruff shampoo brands, Selsun Blue, is a great product but puts me off due to the strong medicine smell it leaves after the shower. This is where competitors like Clear Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo shine. Lacking the thick consistency and medicine smell of Selsun Blue, Clear is a nice alternative that still provides decent dandruff control for my scalp. I consider my scalp to be mildly dry and not in need of a strong medicated anti-dandruff shampoo. As such, Clear works for me to help make sure flakes don&#x27;t fall on my clothes when at work or out on the town. For those with dryer scalps or needing a stronger anti-dandruff shampoo, Clear may not be an option as Selsun Blue is really one of the better over the counter options in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this product because of the scent of it. It&#x27;s got a somewhat muted scent but really nice, appealing and not overwhelming scent. In terms of actual anti-dandruff, this works great. I get out of the shower with a clear scalp, and don&#x27;t really notice a lot of flakes by the end of the same day. I typically wash my hair every other day, and even the next day my dandruff is minimal at most. The one downside is it also made naturally oily hair get oily faster than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. Flip side of that, however, is the first day gives my hair a great shine and healthier appearance comparatively. The shampoo itself is thicker than other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used, and is certainly a less is more kind of thing.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works better than Head and Shoulders. Hair is shiny and clean and scalp is less itchy. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I really like the thick, rich, creamy texture. It doesn’t slide off your hand when using it as a body wash. I use much less of the Clear than I do any thin, runny regular body wash. I get out of the shower smelling great- just have to avoid the odor police for 30 minutes. It leaves a nice silky feel to your skin. The anti-dandruff addition actually seems to help slow down the skin flaking off all over the body.</li>
    <li> CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Deep Clean Hydration, 12.9 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, the shampoo is not “clear” it is a creamy white color. It’s more like the consistency of a conditioner, just slightly thinner. That said, the smell is very very mild. If you use just a bit too much, it lathers on the heavy side, kind of thick and dense. It did clean my hair and left it feeling nice. I still used a conditioner, afterwards. It’s a good shampoo, just use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo -- so much that I reordered after the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; Vine bottle was empty. It pretty well shampoos and conditions all in one.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this brand of shampoo for about a year and has never been disappointed.  All the different versions are great as an anti-dandruff shampoo and the scent while fresh and clean smelling is barely noticeable.  What he likes about this version is that it feels like he has used a conditioner on his hair when in actuality he has only used the shampoo.  He thinks that it has to do with the hydration part of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Though I&#x27;m no longer single, I used to get the regular Heads and Shoulders and try to hide the bottle or at least turn it around back in my bachelor days, because I like to over-analyze things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?  Because, do you really want the person you&#x27;re dating to think you have dandruff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now enter the Clear Men Scalp and Anti-dandruff shampoo where you can still have dandruff, but it is not blatantly obvious that you do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, I&#x27;m still married, THANK YOU CLEAR MEN SCALP and ANTI-DANDRUFF SHAMPOO for being subtle about it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Clear Shampoos in the past and this one performs well, just as expected. It lathers nicely and has a nice clean scent. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t smell overly masculine (which seems like a silly thing to say now that I&#x27;m typing it) or too girly and this shampoo, while being advertised as a &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s Shampoo&amp;#34; could easily be used by women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all the other shampoos I&#x27;ve used from Clear this one cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too dry, and the dry flakiness I sometimes get on my scalp, especially near where my hair is parted, isn&#x27;t noticeable at all.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of small complaints about this shampoo: Its consistency is pretty thick, and in a small confined space (such as a shower stall) its smell is very strong. However, it&#x27;s not too thick to lather up my hair and wash it out with a little effort, and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on me after the shower is over, so these are minor complaints indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now, and while my scalp wasn&#x27;t particularly dry before, I now feel appreciably hydrated. This is a winner and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent. It makes such a great lather, even if you do not use a lot. It has a pleasant, but not overpowering smell, and it worked really nicely at stopping the dandruff and making my hair look great. It can give you a little tingly feeling when you leave it in, but that can feel good. It rinses out nicely and leaves your hair clean and moisturized. For what it does, it&#x27;s a good value. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Clear Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo provides my son&#x27;s hair clean hair and scalp without drying his hair and scalp out. My son has a very low hair cut and if his hair has dandruff you can actually see it but the medicated shampoos seem to dry out his scalp. The CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo does a great job of cleansing his hair but most importantly keeping the necessary moisture to his hair and scalp. I love the deep cleansing it provides his hair and we are happy with how long it lasts between shampoos.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t have dandruff, I do occasionally have an itchy scalp. This shampoo has a pleasant, somewhat fruity fragrance. It lathers nicely and I let it sit for a few minutes. My hair look nice and my scalp felt great. My brother, who does battle the flake, alternates this with another Clear brand. He finds it effective against dandruff and a good alternative to Head and Shoulders. The active ingredient is pyrithione zinc and is supplemented with ginseng, tea tree and mint. It is a viable option if you suffer from periodic itchiness or flaking.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo. It has a pleasant but subtle aroma and my hair feels clean after I use it. As advertised, I don&#x27;t have dandruff when I use this shampoo (though I don&#x27;t have dandruff when I don&#x27;t use the shampoo either). Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Clear&#x27;s anti-dandruff shampoo is one of the best on the market. This light shampoo protects against shampoo. Best of all, it&#x27;s refreshing and, unlike so many anti-dandruff shampoo, it does not have a medicinal or a chemical smell. This is easily one of the best, most effective shampoos I have ever come across. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After a few uses, the Clear Men Scalp appears to be of good quality, and a great shampoo to keep in one&#x27;s long-term rotation.  The smell is minimal, and the dandruff control appears to be good.</li>
