      <li>but other then that good</li>
      <li>IF YOU ARE A TRUE PROFESSIONAL DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS INK!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really stick in the skin well</li>
      <li>firstly, the ink is not stored in opaque bottles, it&#x27;s in clear bottles.</li>
      <li>... let&#x27;s just say the pigment in this ink sucks so much I ended up having to order better ink and touch up/finish</li>
      <li>so fast it looks like a three-week old tattoo is three YEARS old.</li>
      <li>two stars instead of one only because it&#x27;s good for inexpensive beginner&#x27;s practice on fake skins.</li>
      <li>I purchased due to decent reviews, clearly unprofessional people who don&#x27;t care about quality control.</li>

    <li> Was just as described.</li>
    <li> This tattoo kit is no good I have 10 years doing tattoos  after I received it I had a client booked so I decided to use it and after 5 minutes of tattooing the gun stopped working .&lt;br /&gt;The power supply stopped working&lt;br /&gt;I got sold a bad one&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy at all&lt;br /&gt;I paid money for this and it don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Very bad product. My son&#x27;s client skin was a mess after having been tattooed with this ink; moreover, the color did not stick.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller then I thought but other then that good</li>
    <li> Love it. I Am happy with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with your product and the quick shipping experience was excellent thankyou</li>
    <li> ink does NOT stay!!!!</li>
    <li> If I can give no stars I would. This ink is the worse. None of the colors stay in the skin. Just trouble don&#x27;t waste your money go and buy American ink like Starbrite. From now on that is all I will purchase. DO NOT BUY. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really stick in the skin well its ok</li>
    <li> IF YOU ARE A TRUE PROFESSIONAL DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS INK! I purchased due to decent reviews, clearly unprofessional people who don&#x27;t care about quality control. firstly, the ink is not stored in opaque bottles, it&#x27;s in clear bottles. but i booked a last minute appointment and needed small amounts of color over-nighted to me, on a budget... let&#x27;s just say the pigment in this ink sucks so much I ended up having to order better ink and touch up/finish the poor girls color for next to free. **also** a girl i worked on with no history of red ink allergy (she already had one tattoo with red ink in it, done a few years prior by a different artist) ended up getting a pretty horrific (delayed) allergic reaction to one of the reds in this set. same thing with another guy and green shades - AWFUL bubbled and blistered reaction! this has never happened before EXCEPT with this ink. AND, even the black fades to gray so fast it looks like a three-week old tattoo is three YEARS old. two stars instead of one only because it&#x27;s good for inexpensive beginner&#x27;s practice on fake skins.</li>
    <li> Not Great.  Had worse... Have better.</li>
    <li> White ink was empty due to leak.</li>
    <li> Just got an email  from  amazon  saying this ink has bacteria in it don&#x27;t use it people  are getting sick</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good product nice color selection</li>
    <li> great ink and fast shipping</li>
