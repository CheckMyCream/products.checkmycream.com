    <li> Per Braun instructions, you should replace the shaver head every 18 months. Once I recieved my new cassette, I popped it on, oiled it, and it shaves like a brand new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those that gave a poor review because it didn&#x27;t fit your razor. Remember to look under your trimmer, it usually will tell you what replacement cassette or head you need.</li>
