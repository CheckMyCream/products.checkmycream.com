    <li> Beautiful sent and much less expensive than stores.  Get your woman to test it in a store and if she likes it, buy it here.  Think out of the box guys, this is a different scent and a nice spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I buy Angel normally through Macy&#x27;s and get compliments on how wonderful it smells on me.  Won&#x27;t ever buy it online again as the bottle I received through Amazon stinks and I mean that - it makes me nauseous to wear it.  I don&#x27;t know if it had been sitting on the shelf and was old but yuck.  I know, should have sent it back but trusted it was ok, still had some left in my other bottle so got rid of the paperwork - my mistake.</li>
    <li> I love Angel and use the body lotion daily.  My order was sent promptly and packaged securely.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume/body lotion anybody can smell on me. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and to this day still get compliments. I keep a constant supply!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance! I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> if you like the scent of Angel, you&#x27;ll love it in this body lotion!  It is awesome worn alone, but paired with a spray or two of Angel parfum, you&#x27;ll be surrounded by it&#x27;s lovely scent all day long.</li>
    <li> the best lotion ever.  It last better than the perfume.</li>
    <li> This is all my wife will ever use.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite fragrance. A little goes a long way, so use it sparingly. Good price as well.</li>
    <li> Love this !!  I use the oil first then layer the lotion on top and the fragrance smells wonderful , lasts all day and get many compliments too.</li>
    <li> this is my fragrance and the lotion makes my perfume last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is an authentic product, it does not smell like Angel.</li>

    <li> The best perfumed lotion on the market!!!!</li>
    <li> Best price for this quality perfume... I get compliments all the time.. I like the lotion because it&#x27;s less overbearing then the perfume spray. The scent lingers just enough and lasts all day... This seller was prompt and the product was authentic. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells very good however not as close to the perfume smell. It leaves my skin moisturized but not sticky. Love it! You can wear one or the other but this along with the perfume is too much!</li>
