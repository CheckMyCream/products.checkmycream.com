      <li>Not any more.</li>
      <li>Made a big difference for the best.</li>
      <li>This product used to be much better.</li>
      <li>The spray works much better.</li>
      <li>Very good especially during sleep periods</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge part of the oral market so why doesn&#x27;t another company offer competition with better performance?  </li>
      <li>All of the Biotene products are very mild.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy to use</li>
      <li>Oragel Oralbalance Dry Mouth Relief is a very good product.  </li>
      <li>When I use the gel it coats the mouths and it tastes fine to me.</li>
      <li>Everything was fine.</li>
      <li>You have to experiment a little to see what amount of gel works best for you.</li>
      <li>thank you amazon for making the gel available.</li>
      <li>And happy to finally be getting some relief from mouth ulcers.</li>
      <li>I contacted the manufacturer, who confirmed that they changed formulation of ingredients, and notified Amazon as well.  </li>
      <li>A bit spendy, but porch delivery is important for those of us who can&#x27;t get out.</li>
      <li>Very Useful, Recomended,&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>I&#x27;v been using this product for a couple of years now, works great when taking meds that tend to dry out mouth and throat.</li>
      <li>It cleans well, has a neutral taste, and does everything a toothpaste is meant to do, e.g., clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I take a great deal of medications and we all know that they can cause &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;, and this condition can contribute to tooth decay.</li>
      <li>but my Dad &amp; his feed back is really good</li>
      <li>No other product is as effective.</li>
      <li>I love biotene but the price was too high one one tube</li>
      <li>It seems as though the formula was recently changed and I experienced severe burning in my mouth when I opened this new order.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this, super quality super fun of shopping!</li>
      <li>, this is the solution to my problem, finally&amp;#34;, I might think the price was worth it.</li>
      <li>This is the one Biotene product that has been worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Using some of this before falling asleep worked, but the price just keeps going up and up, no monger worth even thinking</li>
      <li>I also use it periodically during the day to keep my breath fresh.</li>
      <li>Love both of them, no odd flavors or taste in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>But the Amazon price was right</li>
      <li>Although it says you can swallow it, I try not to swallow too much, as it gives me a feeling like mild heartburn.</li>
      <li>Works well but has a very funny metallic taste that really disagrees with me.</li>
      <li>It would be better if they make this in bigger volume.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommended by my dentist,after a change in my medications and my first cavities in years.  </li>
      <li>Sure enough it does!  </li>
      <li>act works in several good case especially the loozenger</li>
      <li>I never thought I would be able to use a fluoride rinse at night because of problems with dry mouth.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it was recommended by my Dentist for my dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>It taste ok and does take care of dry mouth issue on the go.</li>
      <li>Most Biotene products haven&#x27;t provided much relief for my dry mouth issues.  </li>
      <li>In my experience, Biotene Oral Balance is the best product available for dry mouth (difficult to find).  </li>
      <li>I really like this toothpaste because I don&#x27;t like mint</li>
      <li>and it really works.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>Thsi product works reasonably well in moisturizing your dry-mouth problems.</li>
      <li>I find I do not need as much water at night.</li>
      <li>It is pleasant to use and is long lasting as far as moisturizers go.  </li>
      <li>I use the Biotene every night before bed and it really does help the normal production of saliva and reduce the possibility of waking up with &#x27;Death Valley&#x27; in your mouth!</li>
      <li>This product works really well, but it takes quite a bit of gel in your mouth to be effective, and thusly the tubes don&#x27;t last that long..</li>
      <li>Been using this stuff for over 5 years, better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>An essential and effective product for those who suffer from dry mouth.</li>
      <li>Works fine for dry mouth while sleeping.</li>
      <li>I use it mainly at night and chew gum or use mints during the day.</li>
      <li>When my tongue sticks to the top of my mouth, I wake up and smear a bit of the BIOTENE GEL on my tongue and upper roof of mouth and go back to sleep.  </li>
      <li>I mainly use it at night.</li>
      <li>It completely covers the mouth surfaces is pleasant tasting and lasts longer than other dry mouth products.</li>
      <li>Accurately described, promptly delivered, quality as expected.</li>
      <li>I like the spray better even though it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the gel.  </li>
      <li>I actually started using it right before bed any night</li>
      <li>he finds great relief after using it though I find it a little bit expensive other wise</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When my mouth and especially my tongue was burning from having a dry mouth caused as a side effect from a medication, a small amount placed on my tongue and spread around my mouth was a great relief to the burning sensation.</li>
      <li>I am a college professor, so I am constantly needing to talk, and this product has significantly improved my dry mouth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not as good as ora-gel.  This is too thin and dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> I decided to go against my instincts (and some of the reviews) to try this product. UGH! BLECH! HURL!  It tastes and feels like poison. It kind of burns my tongue and the taste is artificial sweetener and chemicals.  Sadly I guess this was once a good product. Not any more.</li>
    <li> Only works for a little while, them mouth dries out again.</li>
    <li> it does work as mouth much less dry when sleep, and I live in very dry New Mexico</li>
    <li> Works well for dry mouth. I carry one in my purse and have one at my bedside.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this and it works great. I never thought I would be able to use a fluoride rinse at night because of problems with dry mouth. But she said to put this on after I use the rinse and it works all night. Sure enough it does!  You just rub the gel around your mouth and it keeps your mouth moist for eight hours. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Most Biotene products haven&#x27;t provided much relief for my dry mouth issues.  I have Sjogrens so my dry mouth can be pretty severe at times.  I&#x27;m finally using a prescription toothpaste prescribed by my dentist and I use this Biotene gel to supplement between brushing.  This is the one Biotene product that has been worth the money.  Love it!  And happy to finally be getting some relief from mouth ulcers.</li>
    <li> 3 Stars, Just Ok, apx 5.70USD, 04-15, Too Pricey, Tube Too Small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price, a person should get at least 3 oz of product, which would be about half the size of a now-standard tube of toothpaste. At a mere 1.5 ozs., it will run out very quickly if everyday I follow the directions of using a half inch strip. If this moistened my mouth so well that it pleasantly surprised me, made me think &amp;#34;yes, this is the solution to my problem, finally&amp;#34;, I might think the price was worth it. But that is not the case. The gel took away the dry for about 3 minutes. That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ve tried the mouthwash too: even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Recom: Wait for it to go on sale and keep your expectations low.</li>
    <li> Excellent gel to keep your mouth watered.</li>
    <li> This is the toothpaste I&#x27;ll use for the rest of my life.  IT DOES NOT STING THE INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH!!!  It cleans well, has a neutral taste, and does everything a toothpaste is meant to do, e.g., clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every other toothpaste in search of one that won&#x27;t sting.  And thankfully, Biotene Oral Balance (it&#x27;s a gel) is refreshing but without the pain caused by other products.</li>
    <li> Works well but has a very funny metallic taste that really disagrees with me. I only use it when I really have to.</li>
    <li> Nice to use before bed.  Very helpful in the winter if you wake up with a dry mouth or throat from your heating system.  Helps reduce the puffiness of gums for anyone who breathes through their mouths at night.  I actually started using it right before bed any night that I&#x27;ve had a few drinks to help avoid waking up with a dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Hubby uses this all the time.  Was recommended by his dentist.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to relieve me of the dry mouth symptoms longer</li>
    <li> This helps with dry mouth until I can get breakfast ready.  It works for only about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Works well to prevent and/or treat dry mouth</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works to stop dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I take a great deal of medications and we all know that they can cause &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;, and this condition can contribute to tooth decay. I also sleep with a CPAP machine that keeps my airway open. I use the Biotene every night before bed and it really does help the normal production of saliva and reduce the possibility of waking up with &#x27;Death Valley&#x27; in your mouth! I also use it periodically during the day to keep my breath fresh. It tastes good too!</li>
    <li> Helps with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it at bedtime every night for years and it keeps my mouth moist.</li>
    <li> The spray works much better.</li>
    <li> Nothing out of the ordinary.  Flavor is not un pleasant but somehow reminds me of something used at the dentists office.</li>
    <li> I have had dry mouth for quite some time.  I tried the Xylimelts and found after a while they were breaking out my mouth.  Someone suggested that I try the Boitene Gel and it has worked so well.  It is so easy to use and if I wake up in the night, I use it again and find that my dry mouth is under control.  I would recommend it for anyone with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Very helpful for dry mouth symtom.</li>
    <li> Accurately described, promptly delivered, quality as expected.</li>
    <li> SLIPPERY AND SINGULAR SELECTION!&lt;br /&gt;Biotene seems to have the dry-mouth medication market cornered.  Very few other products compete with this one.  The OTC offerings for dry mouth are scant and sadly so.  Do they have a monopoly on caring for this &#x27;disease&#x27;?  It&#x27;s a huge part of the oral market so why doesn&#x27;t another company offer competition with better performance?  Biotene does not offer overnight saliva production.  It must be applied several times.&lt;br /&gt;I give a five-star only because it&#x27;s the only medication that I&#x27;ve had to use by default.&lt;br /&gt;PM</li>
    <li> This product used to be much better. It has greatly declined in it&#x27;s quality.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for over 5 years, better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Good - Good  all went well shipping, etc,</li>
    <li> Works for short period</li>
    <li> I like the spray better even though it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the gel.  Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to the gel.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hygienist: I suffer from dry mouth on account of being a mouth breather when I sleep, and also due to side effects of certain medications I take. This works EXCELLENTLY! I am a college professor, so I am constantly needing to talk, and this product has significantly improved my dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Good to use at night if you are a mouth breather. I wake up 2-3 times nightly with a DRY mouth and have to drink some water. When I use the gel it coats the mouths and it tastes fine to me. I find I do not need as much water at night. I take a tube with me to use during the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I put some in my bite guard at night and it keeps my mouth from drying out all night.  No other product is as effective.</li>
    <li> No better or worse than comparable products</li>
    <li> GEL IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR ME!!</li>
    <li> It travels easier than the rinse and you can swallow after using. I purchased it to help with Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, but it only helps minimally.  Sjogren&#x27;s is a tough nut to crack and maddening to boot.</li>
    <li> Excellent selller and product, 100% happy with it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work all night.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Made a big difference for the best.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for dry mouth caused by medication. It taste ok and does take care of dry mouth issue on the go. Ease of travel and discretion would recommend this product for anyone who suffers from dry mouth and needs a remedy while on the go.</li>
    <li> In my experience, Biotene Oral Balance is the best product available for dry mouth (difficult to find).  It is pleasant to use and is long lasting as far as moisturizers go.  I have tried them all. It completely covers the mouth surfaces is pleasant tasting and lasts longer than other dry mouth products.</li>
    <li> Purchased for mother.  Everything was fine. Product was hard to fine in stores locally so I tried Amazon.  Pricing was all over the board but finally found reasonable pricing so I thought I would try it.</li>
    <li> All of the Biotene products are very mild.  This is a clear gel that helps moisten you mouth to keep everything in balance.  Great for you purse or nightstand if you wake up during the night.  I use all of their products they have been around a long time and I love them!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this every night at  bedtime.  She has COPD. Walgreen&#x27;s has not carried this product for several months.  I knew I could&lt;br /&gt;rely on Amazon to get this product for me.</li>
    <li> Expensive for 1.5 ounce.  I got it for travel.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> Really helps with my dry mouth.  Dentist gave me a sample and it really works.  I use other oro gel products as well</li>
    <li> Ok. use when dry mouth gets bad</li>
    <li> I keep this by my bed for those mid-morning dry mouth issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Very Useful, Recomended,&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dentist,after a change in my medications and my first cavities in years.  After using this, no cavities, no waking up in the middle of the night searching for water in the dark because of my cotton mouth!</li>
    <li> These are real tiny little 1.5oz toothpaste tubes.  Look for the bigger size.</li>
    <li> Resolved my very long term &#x27;dry throat&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for me.  I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome and VERY DRY MOUTH.  This is the only product that helps.  I sleep on my back and so I lay this tube on my chest and go to sleep.  When my tongue sticks to the top of my mouth, I wake up and smear a bit of the BIOTENE GEL on my tongue and upper roof of mouth and go back to sleep.  Thank you, BIOTENE Company for this much needed help for DRY MOUTH patients.</li>
    <li> Bought for relative with extremely dry mouth due to both medications and disease process.  She says it really helps and usually several times a day.</li>
    <li> Works instantly and really well.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I had tried this product before and it doesn&#x27;t completely take care of my dry mouth problem. But the Amazon price was right and I bought 3 tubes hoping that the more I use it, the better it may work.</li>
    <li> I wear dentures and, quite by accident, discovered that Biotene Gel dissolves denture creme. I pull my denture out at night, wipe it out and apply the gel. In the morning all the sticky creme is gone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times before.  It is helpful although I sometimes have to use it again during the night.  It isn&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
    <li> I love biotene but the price was too high one one tube</li>
    <li> Medications give me and my husband dry mouth!  This is helping us over come that dry feeling.</li>
    <li> Thsi product works reasonably well in moisturizing your dry-mouth problems.</li>
    <li> An essential and effective product for those who suffer from dry mouth. I use it mainly at night and chew gum or use mints during the day. Although it says you can swallow it, I try not to swallow too much, as it gives me a feeling like mild heartburn. But it&#x27;s very effective and soothing. I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, as I go through about a tube a week.</li>
    <li> purchased for husband whose salivary glands not working. after suffering dry mouth this product is very appreciated. not in store, only rinse. thank you amazon for making the gel available.</li>
    <li> Oragel Oralbalance Dry Mouth Relief is a very good product.  I use a CPAP machine and my mouth gets very dry.  The gel helps my mouth to say moist.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this, super quality super fun of shopping!</li>
    <li> i have had severe oral dryness after radiation therapy, biotene has allowed me to sleep at nite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been using this product for a couple of years now, works great when taking meds that tend to dry out mouth and throat. Especially at night when in the past I have been woken up because I could not swallow.  Have been having trouble finding the product at local stores and reasonable price.  One drug store chain charges twice what I can buy it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works fine for dry mouth while sleeping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not me that I used it but my Dad &amp; his feed back is really good he finds great relief after using it though I find it a little bit expensive other wise he loves it</li>
    <li> biotin products seems to enhance the dryness in my mouth. It might be helpful for others but it makes my mouth drier. the product oasis works really well I&#x27;m going to look deeper into it to see what&#x27;s behind it but it works. act works in several good case especially the loozenger</li>
    <li> Dry mouth from cpap and mouth breathing so tried this product. It works fairly well.</li>
    <li> A bit spendy, but porch delivery is important for those of us who can&#x27;t get out.</li>
    <li> Great product. It works. It would be better if they make this in bigger volume. (2-3 oz)</li>
    <li> This product works really well, but it takes quite a bit of gel in your mouth to be effective, and thusly the tubes don&#x27;t last that long.. Also it does have a lot of xylitol in it, so expect lower GI consequences if you use it too often..</li>
    <li> Works well; not harmful if swallowed.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it was recommended by my Dentist for my dry mouth.  I use the gel each night.  I also use their mouth wash and toothpaste.  Love both of them, no odd flavors or taste in my mouth.  Great products Biotene gel, mouth wash and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Helpful in so many ways...always a customer&lt;br /&gt;Sasha</li>
    <li> This stuff has never helped me.  I have an extremely dry mouth (one of my Parotid Glands was almost completely removed).  I thought the other one would kick in, but alas, it does not seem to be.  I have ordered some other stuff from Amazon to see if this new stuff helps.  I am loaded with crowns and root canals because of dry mouth and it is extremely uncomfortable,  plus very expensive. I would give this a zero rating (because of my experience with it) but it does not allow you to.</li>
    <li> I use it before bed to ward off dry mouth. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This gel works for about 10 minutes, tops.My doctor recommended it for bedtime to stave off the dry mouth that is caused by my CPAP. It was gone from my mouth by the time I walked from the bathroom to the bedroom and got my mask strapped on.</li>
    <li> My mouth was very dry each morning, and my dentist and diabetes doctor both told me that I should consider the Biotene OralBalance products. I decided to do some research and came up with four products that I used to combat dry mouth. The night has always been a challenge, especially since I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and I always awoke with a mouth so dry I could hardly speak. Now I keep a tube of this gel on my nightstand and place a glob on my tongue night; I awoke without a dry mouth for the first time in years. You have to experiment a little to see what amount of gel works best for you. The rest of the day, I use [[ASIN:B002KAOB8U Biotene PBF Plaque Dissolving Toothpaste]] , along with [[ASIN:B002KAO7TI Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash]]after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and while on the move during the day, I keep [[ASIN:B002KAOAUE Biotene Mouth Spray]] handy in case my mouth gets dry to prevent bad breath.</li>
    <li> Medications have caused me to have dry mouth symptoms at night.  I have tried many sprays &amp; gels etc. to keep the mouth moist while sleeping.  This stuff is the BEST!!  If you have dry mouth, do not hesitate to buy and try this.</li>
    <li> When my mouth and especially my tongue was burning from having a dry mouth caused as a side effect from a medication, a small amount placed on my tongue and spread around my mouth was a great relief to the burning sensation. The tube was small enough to carry with me even away from home.</li>
    <li> It stings a bit in the throat</li>
    <li> i use it at night so my mouth wont dry up</li>
    <li> I have extreme dry mouth and I have used biotene for years.  I really like this toothpaste because I don&#x27;t like mint so this is perfect and great for my dry mouth and my gums.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I also liked the Liquid Oral balance, but it seems to be out of stock. I use the mouthwash and the toothpaste, also.</li>
    <li> Due to chemo, I have chronic dry mouth.  This product works well for me to add moisture to my mouth.  I mainly use it at night.</li>
    <li> Very good especially during sleep periods</li>
    <li> I would wake often during the night with a mouth so dry I couldn&#x27;t swallow, a combination of dry air during the winter and using an incontinence patch (side effect).  I put this in and usually wake up only once.  It not as dry as before.  I bought a spray so I put that by the bed and squirt it in and go back to sleep.  It&#x27;s not really a spray, just a stream of mint fluid but works well enough for the rest of the night.</li>
    <li> Works great as toothpaste, but not for its intended use.</li>
    <li> Helped relieve painful sores my mom had from chemo.</li>
    <li> I have lichen Planus (mouth)&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use any toothpastes they aggravate my gums even.. When my mouth isn&#x27;t inflammned ...this stuff is great.. I use it always when I brush..&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price!</li>
    <li> This gel is good for keeping your mouth moist at night, but frankly, it just too expensive. I was purchasing it because one of the medications I was taking caused bad dry mouth and I would take it at night going to bed and wake up with fire mouth. Using some of this before falling asleep worked, but the price just keeps going up and up, no monger worth even thinking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically they have priced their product out of the market, or my market anyway; so I give them three stars. But I have to say, it does work.</li>
    <li> This was formerly part of my arsenal to combat dry mouth caused by autoimmune disease.  It seems as though the formula was recently changed and I experienced severe burning in my mouth when I opened this new order.  I contacted the manufacturer, who confirmed that they changed formulation of ingredients, and notified Amazon as well.  Amazon was helpful as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice Cubes Gum has been helpful with the dry mouth per my dentist&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
