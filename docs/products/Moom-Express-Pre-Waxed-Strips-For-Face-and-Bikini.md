### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful...  </li>
      <li>it fits perfect for my needs!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so they work perfectly.</li>
      <li>and I am so happy I did!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a great product!</li>
      <li>These are the best way to do your eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I have used the Moom sugar kits which I think are very good</li>
      <li>The concept of disposable strips is great, and perhaps I need to give them another chance.  </li>
      <li>Works great for me, and my husband as well.</li>
      <li>but I thought this would be great for travel</li>
      <li>These strips are SOOOO much better!  </li>
      <li>I used to own Wellness Anti-Aging Clinics.. retired.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the plastic paper the wax strip is made of</li>
      <li>The Parissa strips are much, much better.</li>
      <li>IT IS SO AMAZINGLY DIVINE, once the scent hit my nose, I smiled so much, because it was even more delicious smelling than I could have possibly imagined!</li>
      <li>the better you get you will feel no pain at all and have extra smooth beautiful legs!</li>
      <li>easy... and cheap!  </li>
      <li>the top of his nose is a smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
      <li>It is so awesome to not have to be bothered with messy wax pots any more..</li>
      <li>Which is fine for an unwanted mustache.</li>
      <li>The strips worked great and I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
      <li>When I woke up the next morning, my skin looked great</li>
      <li>The only good thing in this kit is the tiny bottle of pleasant oil.</li>
      <li>The good thing is, you can use them several times.</li>
      <li>quick ...</li>
      <li>Plus, the company is supposed to be owned by women (which I think is unique, and I have been trying to be more conscious about the companies I support).</li>
      <li>It does remove the coarse hairs and leave most of the fine fuzz (which is what I want it to do), but the stickiness and breakouts make it a no-go for my beauty routine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine done professionally tons of times, but I trust myself better than anyone else.</li>
      <li>All and all, I used about three strips for the bikini line, thus I felt like it was efficient, effective, and I didn&#x27;t have to do a bunch of extra attempts (which hurts after a while!)</li>
      <li>Back to warming up my Moom jar for 20 seconds in the microwave and using my muslin strips (which I can use over and over if I so choose, since they are Moom-free after a warm water rinse).</li>
      <li>I really like that Moom uses more natural ingredients like beeswax, its more gentle and doesn&#x27;t take off skin as well.</li>
      <li>My skin is very fair and aside from peach fuzz, the offending hair in those places is quite dark and coarse.  </li>
      <li>it is exactly what I was looking for...</li>
      <li>It is my favorite wax so far but no longer purchasing from amazon to save myself shipping costs as it is readily available in shops like winners and London drugs in Canada at the same price.</li>
      <li>They are ok for upper lip but so much stronger than using the cloth strips they feel like scotch tape ripping off your skin!  </li>
      <li>I love the regular Moom in the jar, and figured I&#x27;d give these strips a try, for the pure convenience.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These strips work somewhat well on certain kinds of hair in certain places.  </li>
      <li>this is pure organic , works well</li>
      <li>I really like the moom remover from the jar</li>
      <li>The regular Moom washes off with only warm water.  </li>
      <li>Wish you got more strips and less oil for the money.</li>
      <li>I will stick to their sugar kits which are a little more work to prep and use</li>
      <li>Best of all the Hair is pulled out at the follicle thus each time you wax you damage some of the follicles and slowly but surely you get less and less hair growing back...</li>
      <li>These are my new go-to wax strips.</li>
      <li>Definitely works better than the Sally Hensen wax stripes I previously used.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend for folks with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Simply pull close to the skin do not lift upwards but straight back rapidly!  </li>
      <li>Right after I used the strip, the area tingled and was red for a bit, but that is to be expected.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, the wax strips were smaller than I expected, a bit less than an inch wide, but the wax works WAY better than the previous wax strips I was using (Parrissa), and I was able to use the same strip several times.</li>
      <li>The bad thing is, if you are like me you will HAVE to go over and over areas to get them clean and smooth.  </li>

<li> These strips work well, very little pain and very efficient at pulling hair.  </li>
<li> The formula is very different from the &#x27;regular&#x27; Moom, was very sticky and it was hard to remove the residue afterwards.  </li>
<li> It is doable, but the small size of the pre waxed strips I got made the whole process seem kind of a silly waste.</li>
<li> I really wanted to like these strips, but they are very messy, and just don&#x27;t work as well as the kit does.</li>
<li> but this is a very minor issue.  </li>
<li> Love the Moom wax, but this was a disappointment due to the size of the strips.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m pretty annoyed I paid for this product to only receive half of it.</li>
<li> There was only 10 small strips in there when there was supposed to be 20 strips, 2 different sizes.</li>
<li> Then I pull them apart, and apply the one side (and if your eyebrows are the same, the other part will work on your other eyebrow).</li>
<li> Strips where a little smaller that I had expected.</li>
<li> The other reviewers weren&#x27;t kidding about that cucumber oil.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve had pimples popping up for three days since I used them - not fun.  </li>
<li> Soon you will have it &#x27;down pat&#x27;</li>
<li> I ordered this and half of the box was missing.</li>
<li> It left a lot of hair behind.</li>
<li> there was a lot of hair left behind - and I followed all the instructions.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
<li> But worse than the poor performance, these strips leave a very sticky residue on your skin.</li>
<li> It caused a dermatitis reaction of rash, small pimples and abrasive skin texture that still has not gone away on my chin.  </li>
<li> They are too small and they don&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> I found this to be overly sticky and hard to remove.  </li>
<li> He had started to complain that his hair ON his nose was flapping in the wind, no more!</li>
<li> Wax strips are very small</li>
<li> And that&#x27;s not good for your skin, I wouldn&#x27;t think.  </li>
<li> Sadly, they are not effective.</li>
<li> Plus they are quite sticky, and the sticky stays on your finger tips and makes additional smoothing and pulling difficult without washing in between each attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I was wrong!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wax strips are very small but I use them to wax my face so they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> These can not be used for bikini.  They are too small and they don&#x27;t work.  They are ok for upper lip but so much stronger than using the cloth strips they feel like scotch tape ripping off your skin!  I really like the moom remover from the jar but I thought this would be great for travel and I was wrong!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> I really like that Moom uses more natural ingredients like beeswax, its more gentle and doesn&#x27;t take off skin as well.</li>
    <li> Definitely works better than the Sally Hensen wax stripes I previously used.  These are my new go-to wax strips.</li>
    <li> Works great for me, and my husband as well. Didn&#x27;t plan on him using them, but as he seems to grow hair everywhere these days, I guess it was meant to be. Following the directions I no longer have a mustache (YEAH) and the top of his nose is a smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. He had started to complain that his hair ON his nose was flapping in the wind, no more! It works!</li>
    <li> I have used the Moom sugar kits which I think are very good and I thought I would try their pre-waxed strips kit. Sadly, they are not effective. I think I would say they got maybe 15%. But worse than the poor performance, these strips leave a very sticky residue on your skin. The only good thing in this kit is the tiny bottle of pleasant oil. I will stick to their sugar kits which are a little more work to prep and use plus it washes off and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Has almond oil in it, and I didn&#x27;t know that/ my dads allergic and I wish I would&#x27;ve known before I brought it.</li>
    <li> The other reviewers weren&#x27;t kidding about that cucumber oil. IT IS SO AMAZINGLY DIVINE, once the scent hit my nose, I smiled so much, because it was even more delicious smelling than I could have possibly imagined! Plus, the company is supposed to be owned by women (which I think is unique, and I have been trying to be more conscious about the companies I support). Lastly, the wax strips were smaller than I expected, a bit less than an inch wide, but the wax works WAY better than the previous wax strips I was using (Parrissa), and I was able to use the same strip several times. All and all, I used about three strips for the bikini line, thus I felt like it was efficient, effective, and I didn&#x27;t have to do a bunch of extra attempts (which hurts after a while!) It&#x27;s definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nad&#x27;s facial strips for my upper lip for a couple of years and I always had irritation afterwards.  After reading the comments on Amazon I decided to try the Moom strips and I am so happy I did!  These strips are SOOOO much better!  The wax grips even the smallest of hairs and left no bumps, pimples or marks.  Right after I used the strip, the area tingled and was red for a bit, but that is to be expected.  When I woke up the next morning, my skin looked great and I had zero bumps.  I don&#x27;t love the plastic paper the wax strip is made of - I prefer a cloth strip - but this is a very minor issue.  The strips worked great and I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> this is pure organic , works well but you should follow the instructions otherwise you will not get the results. It is my favorite wax so far but no longer purchasing from amazon to save myself shipping costs as it is readily available in shops like winners and London drugs in Canada at the same price.</li>
    <li> I found this to be overly sticky and hard to remove.  It left me with a rash, and after that, pimples appeared, which has never occurred with waxing before.  The Parissa strips are much, much better.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these strips, but they are very messy, and just don&#x27;t work as well as the kit does.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to the product.  It caused a dermatitis reaction of rash, small pimples and abrasive skin texture that still has not gone away on my chin.  No adverse reaction to the underarms.</li>
    <li> I love the regular Moom in the jar, and figured I&#x27;d give these strips a try, for the pure convenience. The formula is very different from the &#x27;regular&#x27; Moom, was very sticky and it was hard to remove the residue afterwards.  The regular Moom washes off with only warm water.  I used them for my upper lip and I&#x27;ve had pimples popping up for three days since I used them - not fun.  I would not recommend for folks with sensitive skin.  It does remove the coarse hairs and leave most of the fine fuzz (which is what I want it to do), but the stickiness and breakouts make it a no-go for my beauty routine.  Back to warming up my Moom jar for 20 seconds in the microwave and using my muslin strips (which I can use over and over if I so choose, since they are Moom-free after a warm water rinse).</li>
    <li> Strips where a little smaller that I had expected. Which is fine for an unwanted mustache. It is, however, not at all big enough for the bikini area. Love the Moom wax, but this was a disappointment due to the size of the strips.</li>
    <li> These are the best way to do your eyebrows. I&#x27;ve had mine done professionally tons of times, but I trust myself better than anyone else. The way I use these is I hold it up to my eyebrow (before taking apart the two sides), and I use a pen to mark my eyebrows on the strip. Then I cut them according to the marking. Then I pull them apart, and apply the one side (and if your eyebrows are the same, the other part will work on your other eyebrow).</li>
    <li> These strips work well, very little pain and very efficient at pulling hair.  Wish you got more strips and less oil for the money.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  It left a lot of hair behind.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and half of the box was missing. There was only 10 small strips in there when there was supposed to be 20 strips, 2 different sizes. I&#x27;m pretty annoyed I paid for this product to only receive half of it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful...  I used to own Wellness Anti-Aging Clinics.. retired.  It is so awesome to not have to be bothered with messy wax pots any more..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat waxing the hair off... quick ... easy... and cheap!  Best of all the Hair is pulled out at the follicle thus each time you wax you damage some of the follicles and slowly but surely you get less and less hair growing back... Just the opposite of shaving where it stimulates the hair growth and causes it to grow back thicker and darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply pull close to the skin do not lift upwards but straight back rapidly!  Soon you will have it &#x27;down pat&#x27; the better you get you will feel no pain at all and have extra smooth beautiful legs!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Moon Express Pre Waxed Strips for Face &amp; Bikini, 20 strip box as an experiment, in hopes I could buy the larger kit for legs and underarms if this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips work somewhat well on certain kinds of hair in certain places.  The concept of disposable strips is great, and perhaps I need to give them another chance.  It&#x27;s just that when I used them on my face (along the jawline and mustache areas) there was a lot of hair left behind - and I followed all the instructions.  My skin is very fair and aside from peach fuzz, the offending hair in those places is quite dark and coarse.  The good thing is, you can use them several times. The bad thing is, if you are like me you will HAVE to go over and over areas to get them clean and smooth.  And that&#x27;s not good for your skin, I wouldn&#x27;t think.  Plus they are quite sticky, and the sticky stays on your finger tips and makes additional smoothing and pulling difficult without washing in between each attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, then I tried them on my forearms just to see if that would work.  It is doable, but the small size of the pre waxed strips I got made the whole process seem kind of a silly waste.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work ... will never order it again</li>
    <li> it is exactly what I was looking for... it fits perfect for my needs!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for No Pain hair remover experience.</li>
