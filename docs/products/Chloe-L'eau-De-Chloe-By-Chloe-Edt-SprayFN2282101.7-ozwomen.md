    <li> This fragrance is wonderful.  I am so happy I bought it. However, so pricey.  It isn&#x27;t a daily fragrance for me, but one for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I tried this smell on in perfume shop, and was aware of the product.&lt;br /&gt;On time delivery, good fresh smell, smells as it should  smell, the scent stays till next day.&lt;br /&gt;If you like fresh a little bit of vintage citrus smells, then you can try this perfume on.</li>
    <li> Favorite Scent.... anything CHLOE is a must have!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this Cologne and it stays with me all day. I recommend this Cologne.  A very unique scent.</li>
    <li> This perfume is a wonderful scent for summer or spring. It&#x27;s a classic green/chypre scent. It reminds me a little bit of Eau du Soir by Sisley. It has good staying power. I get lots of compliments on it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The item arrived kinda late, however,  the quality is same as original and the price was 30% less than macys.  I returned the one I got from macys and kept this one.</li>
    <li> totally fake!!!!!!! i am so mad</li>
    <li> Daily scent for work. Not offensive to even the most sensitive nose.</li>
    <li> Great perfume! Special to summer nights!</li>
    <li> The price was great!! Was exactly what I wanted.Looked around for the best price this was it .Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I can use. I hate anything too fruity or floral. This is a light clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a new scent and read reviews about this perfume and it does smells great! I wore it for the first time last night and EVERYONE kept smelling me and men were super into it. The scent doesn&#x27;t last a terribly long time...I might also purchase the concentrated version.  Overall, I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Easy to wear.  Holds to the foot nicely.  Would order again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very gooddIt&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very goodvIt&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very good</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume people always want to get closer and smell me. The proce was great.vin the department store where I usually buy it, it costs so much more for the same size bottle.c</li>
    <li> Chloe is one of those rare fragrances that evokes&lt;br /&gt;more than compliments. In its own way it can&lt;br /&gt;transport the wearer to memories of beautiful&lt;br /&gt;experiences.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been wanting this one for awhile. I love it. Nice clean easy scent, not too strong, kinda citrus bloom</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Chloe L&#x27;Eau de Chloe and had to have more!  This is a light floral fragrance, great for everyday.  Very feminine and wears well.  The fragrance lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;turn&amp;#34; like some perfumes do.  The scent stays true all day long.  I received my product quickly and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; ve received a Chloe L&#x27;Eau De Chloe set (with lotion and body wash) instead of  the ordered perfume. The scent of the perfume in the set is not even close to what it should be. It smells like a spoiled, old perfume. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> So happy I found my perfume.</li>
    <li> .... smells different from the sampler I got from a department store and the quality of the ribbon on the bottle which fell off seems really different.</li>
    <li> Perfect deal , my wife like it well</li>
    <li> Looks like it is an original parfume, not a fake.</li>
