<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My girlfriend loved this! She smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to order another bottle soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this men!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-star product!</li>
    <li> I love this scent, when I am out, people often comment on it, and are surprised when I tel them it is by Taylor Swift!</li>
    <li> You would never regret!</li>
    <li> not as good as expected</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance- Not too &#x27;tweeny&#x27; for people in their late 20&#x27;s, early 30&#x27;s. I recommend it if you want to smell flowerly and fresh. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on it!</li>
    <li> it smells like sweet perfume the X wife likes it I don&#x27;t mind it the bottle has cool dangles on it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I used Byzance by Rochas for years but then it got too costly and too hard to find so decided to try Wonderstruck and I LOVE it! Nice fresh scent and just the right amount of a wonderful mix. I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to purchase this product because I was afraid it was fake. However, upon receipt it was the real deal and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price and quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! This company is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Not too heavy but have received many compliments  light and airy. Not a heavy smell at all</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my sister-in-law. She was pleased with the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Hate to say it, but I love this perfume!  I bought it for my tween for Christmas and, well... I borrow it every morning now.  My mom even loves it.  And the bottle is so pretty.  A++</li>
    <li> This fragrance initially smells like vanilla on me.  Then it turns into an a spicy fragrance where the amber and sandalwood come through.  The scent will last on me for more than 12 hours.  I put it on in the morning and I can still smell it at night.  This is complex perfume and I would classify this as a mature scent.  As a teenager, I would not have liked this scent but as a 37 year old woman, I love it!  Taylor Swift is a great role model.  I have no problem supporting her through the purchase of her perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently 14 years old, and on August 30th, I&#x27;ll be 15. My mom bought this for me as an early birthday present since I&#x27;d like to wear it over the summer. I love it. it&#x27;s very sweet and girly. I think the scent fades though. It lasts longer on clothes than skin.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely! My daughter is a &amp;#34;Swiftie&amp;#34; and fell in love with this fragrance. She received it as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my sister who was 10 at the time. She absolutely loves it-and I can honestly say  I like the scent too.  Shipping was quick, and I love the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> i love it, sweet smell that lasts  i&#x27;d buy more for sure....</li>
    <li> I love the scent but it has no staying power!  I can spray all I want and not worry about over doing it because you can barely smell it an hour later!</li>
    <li> At first, this perfume smells lovely and sweet, but it&#x27;s extremely strong, especially when used by younger gals who have not yet learned the art of going easy on stronger scents. I&#x27;m not normally sensitive to fragrances, but this one gives me a headache and makes my sinuses go crazy.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume..buy it all the time, perfect scent!</li>
    <li> The day this came out I went to the store to try some of this stuff. The bottle feels very nice in the hand and the 3.4oz is a good amount. I sprayed this perfume on my wrists and OH MY GOODNESS it smells so good! When I first smell it it smells very floral, but it finishes with a peachy, musky scent. After reading up on it a little bit I found that it has peach, sandalwood, raspberry, vanilla, and others. All my favorite things! It is not at all a young scent which some people are worried about. It smells very fresh and just...yummy. It is now about 10 hours since I sprayed my wrists and I can STILL smell it (even after wearing a wool sweater over them). This is some quality stuff and it&#x27;s perfect for me! The only thing that perturbs me is the price of $60 for a 3.4oz bottle. I might wait a bit to see if the price comes down before actually buying myself some. I think I will be making a lot of trips the the beauty store to use the tester in the meantime :P</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this perfume!! This is my go-to fragrance. Have been using it for the past few years and I just ran out:( SO GLAD I found it! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe something like perfume is categorized as &#x27;dangerous goods&#x27; by Aeropost. You can buy perfumes even on a plane yet Aeropost&#x27;s wisdom has listed this as &#x27;dangerous&#x27; and charged an addition US$15 to be release! Before you buy this check with your shipper else it will not be worth it with these &#x27;ficticious&#x27; charges.</li>
    <li> It smells so nice. For those of you who like a light,slightly musky,sweet vanilla/floral scent this is for you. If you ever smelled tanning lotion it smells like that too, which is good. Some people said it doesn&#x27;t last long, i personally think it does, i only spray two times, one on my wrist and one on my chest, and rub into my other wrist. Smelling good all day :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for X-Mas. She loves it and I kind of like the fragrance it puts off. So if you would like to give something special for that certain someone who is hard to buy for this would be nice.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this last year. I had a chance to buy it this year. Great purchase and delivery.</li>
    <li> sweet but it dont´last long</li>
    <li> So inlove. I was surprised about how big it is! Ive had this before in much smaller forms. One of my best purfumes. GREAT scent!! Came about 3 days early, very big, great price. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted. Came all in tack. Not broken</li>
    <li> My grand niece was ecstatic (according to her Mom) about the gift. Of course, her Mom tipped me on what she&#x27;d love to have for her birthday, and she has not stopped marveling how uniquely scented she is when she puts it on.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this gift! great price for the size you receive.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and it smells great. Recipient loves it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!!!💗 I&#x27;m 53 yrs old and love how this smells on me, how long it lasts and ALL the great COMPLIMENTS I get....you smell so good, what are you wearing?! I hear that ALL the time.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great too. Yummy...my husband loves it...makes for fun evenings AND days! ❤️ LOL</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for a teenager of 16, it was perfect!  The girl loved it, the fragance is very nice and the packaging and the design of the bottle is very feminine and made for a princess. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love it and it last all day</li>
    <li> gift for my daughter and she loves it..</li>
    <li> Great price! Cost is almost 2x as much in the department stores for the same thing.</li>
    <li> My new alltime favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> The perfume was 2 years old. So them smell was not lasting long. I gave this to my gf as a gift.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume!  I&#x27;ve never tried a celebrity perfume before but Taylor did a SUPERB job!  I love her music so when I saw it in my Ulta store, I was smelled it out of curiosity and then it took me about 5 seconds to decide to buy it and that it was worth the $60ish for the biggest bottle.  I also want to find the roll on for my bag and just to dab on when I just want a little bit on.  I didn&#x27;t tell my boyfriend that I bought it, cause I wanted his untainted reaction and when I saw him later that day, he hugged me and immediately pulled me closer and asked what I was wearing and then he spend the night leaning over to smell me.  And even a couple months later, he still&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not an expert on perfume so I have no idea what the individual scents are, but I can tell that there is a vanilla smell to it and just smells warm to me.  When I spray it on my body (wrists, neck) I find that it lasts about 6 hours, but when I spray it on my clothes (usually just one squirt where I try to get my neck and the upper part of my shirt at the same time) the scent lasts until I wash my shirt even if it&#x27;s a week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this perfume has become my signature smell.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this...and actually so do I .  I love the way she smells while wearing this perfume !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decently large-sized bottle, and not an overwhelming scent. Purchased for my 13yo as an Easter gift after a friend had used it on them and it smelled nice, not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This bottle is HUGE!!! The scent is a bit more peachy than the first bottle of Wonderstruck that I purchased from a store but it still smells wonderful.  One of the first compliments I receive when meeting new people is, &amp;#34;Wow! You smell great!&amp;#34; This perfume, of course, wears off as the day progresses but not by much! My clothes still smell wonderful at the end of a long work day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen daugther, who is, of course, a great Taylor Swift&#x27; s fan (We both are). This perfume has a great fragance and the bottle is very pretty. She loved so much this present! She wears it all the time!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Great price online for it, and was packaged very nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and possibly embarrassed at how much I love the smell of this perfume!  Wear it for fun special occasions and have gotten two other girlfriends hooked on it!</li>
    <li> Received a look alike. Very disappointed with my purchase</li>
    <li> Ever since I heard about this perfume, I&#x27;ve wanted it.  I got a free sample of it from Taylor Swift&#x27;s Facebook page, and I loved the scent of it so I asked for it for Christmas and I got it.  I&#x27;ve worn it when I&#x27;ve gone out with friends a few times and they liked the scent too.  It&#x27;s really good and it&#x27;s a good addition to anyone&#x27;s collection of perfume!</li>
    <li> The bottle looks great and the perfume last really long. It&#x27;s a bit too sweet for my taste, but even though I don&#x27;t usually go for sweet perfumes, I found myself using this one quite often. I reccomend it, specially if you like sweet scents</li>
    <li> This smells D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s fruity, but in a yummy way, not tweenish. But it&#x27;s not all fruit, you can also smell the mix of other things, like vanilla. It&#x27;s just a perfect blend, not too much of anything. But it&#x27;s definitely yummy. :)</li>
    <li> Good perfume. All ok. Thanks</li>
    <li> I had no intention of buying this. I am not one to go out and buy celeb&#x27;s perfumes, half the time they annoy me the other half they break me out. Besides, I am well over my tween years and I was worried that it smell to tweeny for me. But I happened to stop just to see if it was actually something that smelt halfway decent. And let me say this, kudos to Taylor. This stuff is amazing! I tried it out for awhile and couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists. I fell in love with it. Even my own husband who is not a perfume kind of guy at all, couldn&#x27;t get over how amazing I smelt. Finally!! Bonus that I had no reaction. This is a great perfume if you don&#x27;t like overpowering, over the top flowery smells that you find in most products. A great all around perfume, that I hope will be in stores for awhile...</li>
    <li> The bottle has a nice presentation.  But the product was below my expectations.  The sent was not what I expected and it did not last.  I do not recommend it .</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and It just lasts and lasts! I didn&#x27;t think that I woulld like it but I just loive it and I will be buying myself some more of this.</li>
    <li> Smells so pretty.  This is my #1 favorite perfume.  OMG I love it</li>
    <li> My dtr loved for christmas! It was at a comparable price, and free shipping!  All the stores I looked in were sold-out.</li>
    <li> If you really like the scent of vanilla, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this perfume! It has such a sweet and clean scent. I love it, boyfriend loves it, all my girlfriends have gone out and bought it now, and you wouldn&#x27;t even imagine all the compliments I get everywhere I go. I would recommend this to any age. Heck, I&#x27;m 28 and ordering another bottle and the scent stick!!! 5 STARS BY FAR!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me at Christmas after we smelled a sample at the store.  Really nice scent with my body chemistry, but it definitely fades mid-day.</li>
    <li> Smells good lasts a while very satisfied</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m twenty years old and love this scent- it&#x27;s light and flowery and sweet, but definitely not overly so. It can still be smelled on me later on in the day, which I love (it&#x27;s so hard to find a perfume that keeps you smelling great all day). A lot of reviews are about people being disappointed in the size they got, which is only because they didn&#x27;t select the correct one on the top of the page. I made triple-checked my size and order (the 3.4 oz) and it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> My Daughter is a big Taylor Swift fan and this perfume smells wonderful. She is the one I purchased this for and she loves it. If you want to smell good for a long time I highly recomment it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 22 yr old granddaughter.  She loves Taylor Swift so I took a chance.  It not only smells great it is very pretty!!!  She was thrilled.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews I was hoping to love this perfume.  It&#x27;s not bad, but much too strong for my liking.  If you want a strong, lasting perfume, this is it.  If you like something a little more subtle you might want to try something else.</li>
    <li> I sprayed this on me today, left it on my wrist for about 30 min to an hour for it to set in before I judged the scent. Now I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist. This stuff is amazing! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with Taylor Swift, BUT I am so so happy with this perfume. To me, it&#x27;s classy (anyone could wear this, older, younger, whatever), light, slightly musky, mixed with vanilla-y notes. (I never read the actual notes because I don&#x27;t really understand it... but that is my version of what it smells like. lol) It first reminded me of Fantasy by Britney Spears, but it seems like a lighter smelling version of that. I find that sometimes Fantasy can be overpowering, although I really do love that one as well! This is a bit pricey, which is unfortunate, but it&#x27;s worth the price if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my eight year old daughter.  She wanted perfume, and always wants to wear mine.  However I think that she needed something younger, and different then mine.  So I went out sniffing at the stores and ended up with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it. It is not too old, and its Taylor Swift and not Nikki Minaj.  And honestly I want my young girl to idolize one of those over the other.  It was prices right, it smells good, and I&#x27;m happy with it all the way around.</li>
    <li> i purchased this for my daughter based on the great reviews and she loves it! It smells fresh, clean, and feminine. The bottle is so pretty, too.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great smell!</li>
    <li> Love this, smells so fresh and sweet and isn&#x27;t too much for a highschooler like me. Would totally recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Most perfumes I have tested have a scent that is too strong for me, but I love the light and soft smell of this perfume. I got a free sample from a link on the Taylor Swift Facebook page and received my sample (a little towelette in a card) through the mail. I loved it and didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this perfume. The bottle is a nice extra, very pretty.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas must have. My daughter really wanted this. I think the price is a little high for something being marketed to younger girls. The bottle is fancy and the perfume is one of a softer scent so it is not offensive. It was delivered promptly in time for Christmas although the shipping dates had it arriving after the 25th.</li>
    <li> She loves it, ordered for our daughter using her gift card.</li>
    <li> Dont get me wrong, I am a huge taylor swift fan, but this perfume just did not do it for me. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get it since she first came out with it, but never had the money until recently. well, its going back tomorrow. In the store I thought it smelled fruity, and fresh, and YOUNG, but when i got home it smelled more woodsy, bland and OLD! I mean, im a 21 year old girl and i want something flirty and fresh but this just was not it. really wish i could say I loved it, but i think i just wanted to love it cause it had taylor&#x27;s name on it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Bought for my Daughter who has used this since it originally came out.  Still the best of the Taylor swift perfumes.</li>
    <li> Perfume can change scent based upon one&#x27;s skin chemistry, it is a very sweet, fruity top note.  The middle note is a softer, lighter scent resembling floral (definitely the Freesia).  I actually like it a lot, but if you do not like sweet smells, this is definitely not for you.  The base note is vanilla and woody.    My only complaint about this scent is that it is not very long lasting.  I spray myself twice.  One tip, to make it longer lasting you can use lotion, preferably a creamy lotion (does not need to be scented), prior to spraying as that will help perfume stay on longer.  I will say, I bought this without smelling it...I couldn&#x27;t find it in any Sephora (nice marketing ploy?)  I also use Very Irresistible by Givenchy and that one is VERY strong, I only need one spray and it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I love you Taylor Swift!!! How are you so awesome?  I&#x27;m a guy, bot this for a gift - I have two settings for perfume, good and bad.  This falls into the good category.  That it is marketed by Taylor Swift makes it worthy of the highest possible rating.  long live taylor</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing!! I got it from my boyfriend the other day. I opened it and fell in love, the bottle is so cute! Then I sprayed it and after about 5 minutes I was like OHMYLORD. It smells so good!! Love love love love!</li>
    <li> Just got this delivered today and put it on immediately. I&#x27;m obsessed, it smells so good. I keep smelling myself! I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Lovely scent! This bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was very happy when she received the eau de parfum at Christmas. She is 15 years old and very fond of Taylor Swift.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my niece had it, I tried it a couple of times and the scent is just so pleasing to me. The shipping was wonderful, I received it before I expected.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Has nice vanilla overtones, and it gets me lots of compliments. If you like soft warm scents, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> I love Taylor swift and after I saw an ad for her perfume I knew it had to be worth a shot after I read the notes and positive reviews I instantly ordered it with my Christmas money! One of the best I have ever smelled honestly! I can see my self using it over and over!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing! I get compliments on it every time I wear it(especially from my husband!) The scent lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of wonderstruck from some vendor somewhere a little while back. I found it in my bag today when I was at Marshalls so I looked to see if they had it. I didn&#x27;t know there were a couple of different wonderstruck scents. There is the original which is this one in the purple bottle and enchanted wonderstruck in a red bottle. I didn&#x27;t know which one I had a sample of because it didn&#x27;t specify so I chose the purple one. It turns out I had the enchanted one but I have to say I am not by any means disappointed.  This one is even better I think than the enchanted. It is such a light beautiful scent.. i cannot stop smelling my wrist! I have only been wearing it for about two hours and I have gotten so many compliments.. just beautiful.  It&#x27;s vaguely reminiscent of my true religion hippy chic. Except it is much more mellow.  A must have for your perfume collection for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! My boyfriend&#x27;s first words about it were \\&quot;wow, this is EXACTLY what a girl should smell like!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> O.m.g the smell of this perfume is absolutely amazing i have not found any other perfume that i have liked as much as this one, also one time I was on the bus and a cute boy that was sitting there told me i smelled really nice, he couldn&#x27;t take his eyes of me the whole ride home, I don&#x27;t know what it was, but we ended up exchanging numbers D:</li>
    <li> I love it!!! My Auntie got it for me for Christmas. In the pack came a tiny one for my purse and lotion. YUMMY!!!! Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long. Like my Betsey Johnson and Halle Berry. But other than that its GREAT!!! I would def buy it for someone else. Not to mention that it comes in a cute bottle...</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Perfect, was sort of expecting flaws for this price but it was standard retail quality for about a third of the price!  Will order from them again!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a sweeter smell, but it smells okay I suppose. I can&#x27;t smell it on me when I put it on and I don&#x27;t use it often, however my friends mother notice it right away and commented on how lovely it smelled. I was embarrassed to say it was Taylor Swift though.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this perfume!</li>
    <li> It was the right one! It was perfect. I received it just in time before Christmas and it was the one I wanted.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping ordered it on Thursday and got it on Monday.... Couple of months ago I paid almost $50 for this at CVS and it was the little bottle since you really can&#x27;t find 3.4 oz at the store and if you do your going to pay A LOT of $$!!!!! I love this smell very nice and my husband loves it to, I get a lot of compliments when I&#x27;m out. This is a great deal and I highly would recommended it especially the price and size you really can&#x27;t beat it unless you love paying a lot of money for little bottles. I&#x27;m going to be ordering more of this and communication with seller was great very fast responsive!! AAAA++++++++</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first because I don&#x27;t usually go for celebrity brands. My boyfriend also has asthma, so I can&#x27;t wear anything too strong. This perfume turned out to be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light enough that you won&#x27;t choke up people around you, but you can still smell it. The scent also lasts for quite a while. I sprayed some on my wrists as soon as I got it, showered later that day, and even out of the shower, I could still smell it a little on my wrists!</li>
    <li> Smells good, not too girly like flowers and stuff (which I don&#x27;t like). I wear it everyday.</li>
    <li> Not only is Wonderstruck one of those generic overly sweet/candy-like perfumes, it smells like glitter too. The bottle is pretty though (that&#x27;s what the 1 star is for).</li>
    <li> Love it. I smell vanilla, green tea and a hint of honeysuckle along with fruits and soft florals. Try it before you buy it! The bottle is adorable and has a nice heft to it. The 3.4 oz. is the best value. Not the teen fragrance I thought it would be. Very pleased.  Update:  I had to lower the rating because this fragrance was just too heavy and sweet. I really liked it in the store but now I just can&#x27;t wear it. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. If I had a sample to try for longer, I probably would not have purchased a full size.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my wife. She loves it!!! I definately recommend this to anyone needing a special gift for a special person!</li>
    <li> My friend visited with this on. It was driving me nuts!  Finally, I asked what it was since it did not wear off like stale smoke from a transit lounge  or cab.  I am a lung doctor and have probably thought some of my patients were still smoking if they wore this to my office.  Obviously, perfume interacts with the individual&#x27;s chemistry. Avoid this if you are over ?? years and can&#x27;t sample it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It smells really strong and it smell like some type of syrup.</li>
    <li> If this item is too dangerous, toxic, and hazardous to &#x27;return&#x27; to Amazon or the seller-- than it must also be too dangerous, toxic, and hazardous to be purchased for our young daughters and other little girls.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I got it it in a mini size and had to get a bigger one. It&#x27;s a fresh clean smell and any age can wear it</li>
    <li> Im not a Swift fan but I love the smell and I got a way bigger bottle and a better price then what my boyfriend was able to get lol.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price and next day delivery. Item just like described. Would definitely buy from again!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Taylor Swift and was thrilled to see she came out with a perfume! It was a sophisticated smell for younger teens. I got it fro Christmas and sprained the instant after I got it. It smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Sweet and female tast.</li>
    <li> I got the .5 ounce bottle as a gift and loved it so much I bought this one. It smells really amazing and lasts quite a while. I&#x27;ve smelled her two other perfumes and this one is by far the best. I know most of her fans are young but this perfume is really great for all ages.</li>
    <li> Oh I loooove this parfume, its amazing! the bottle is huge and the scent lasts all day! I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. Unfortunately, when my perfume arrived, the box was rattling. Never a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;The bird had broken off of the chain and it was rattling around inside the box with one of the gold chain links. I was able to repair it, although with great difficulty since the chain links are very, very tiny and not the highest grade metal. I still give it a 5 star rating for the scent, but the construction/design of the chain around the top of the bottle leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item, very well priced. I received it as a gift from my boyfriend for my birthday! Can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
    <li> Im very satisfied with the perfume.I bought this perfume relying on the reviews here because i had never smelled it before but I took a risk and bought it.Boy was I impressed.The packaging was good.It came in bubble wrap and in the authentic unopened TS box.The smell is strong and on me it lasted a whole workday (5-7 hrs).Really Recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and Amazon seems to always have the best price for it.</li>
    <li> This product is really cute and beautiful.  My friend really like it.  And it smells good also.  Pretty good! I like it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents but this particular purchase lacked. The scent was weak and had a strong alcohol smell when first applied. The scent only lasted about an hour. It made me wonder if this particular one might be a knockoff. I purchased it because of the price, and I got what I paid for. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s so wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this perfume. But I tried a smaller bottle from our local store and am in love with this fragrance. So I came on amazon and it was cheaper for the larger bottle than in our store so I purchased it and will be ordering more before this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> Live this perfume and was a great price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume! It&#x27;s actually hard for me to believe that this perfume is by a celebrity because I usually dont like perfumes by celebrities because they differ from perfumes by actual brands!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure on how to describe this scent, but it smells so good! It&#x27;s very feminine, kind of fruity, but also a little woodsy. Haha, Im not good at describing scents but it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very cute! I love the charms on it. The box and perfume bottle remind me of a magical forest or something haha.&lt;br /&gt;The second main thing I love about this perfume, besides the scent, is how long it lasts! It lasts forever on you and your clothing! I can always still smell it on my clothing days later. It&#x27;s very important to me that a scent lasts long and this does!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so very happy with this scent, my wife is a 30 year old mother who probably doesn&#x27;t even know who Taylor Swift. When this arrived I was hoping it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money and when she tried it on I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet yet womanly smell that can be worn on a night out or even to the grocery store... Very versitile perfume and I recomend it to any man trying to buy a scent for a woman, younger or older!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice scent. I have never been a fan of Taylor Swift at all, and because of this I have spent a lot of time overlooking her line of perfumes. Actually, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever really looked at celebrity perfumes much at all, unless you count designer fragrances (Vera Wang, Princess is my go-to). But I wanted to try something new, maybe a bit less expensive because I&#x27;m on an outdoor campus all the time and perfumes don&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;m glad I got this, however, this is a bit more musky than I was hoping for. My body may also be to blame for this because, like my mother, musk scents agree with my skin, really stand out, and tend to last a fairly long time. And one day I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love that, but right now, at age 21, I don&#x27;t really want \\&quot;musk\\&quot; to be prominent in my daily scent. Probably due to the women I smelled as a child, I associate musk with things like having children or being ready to settle down or something. Because of that, I think this scent would go better on someone in the 25-35 range, if it smells on them the sort of way it does on me. This strikes me as a perfume for a young woman who knows where she is (or will soon be) in life, who is confident but not too serious (because the flowery bouquet is playful and stands out).    Depending on your feelings about the musk scent, this could be great for a younger person, too. I will still wear it, but probably mostly just as an evening scent because it feel a bit \\&quot;mature\\&quot; for me. Regardless of my personal feelings, I have gotten compliments from many people on this perfume, even a few hours after I have put it on.</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and I think this smells good.  I cut the chain/charms off.  Thought those were unnecessary and annoying.  I will also mention that the bottle is heavy and the lid isn&#x27;t very secure, so when you go to pick up the bottle DON&#x27;T pick it up by the little lid.  It will fall and break.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful. Smells good! This perfume lasts long, combines smell of fruits and flower. I just love it so much! Can&#x27;t get rid of it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She loves the smell. The bottle is a decent size and the price is very fair. Great gift idea for your significant other.</li>
    <li> Bought my girls both scents. The bottles are adorable and they love the way the perfume smells. Great gift for teen girls.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift. The item is great and they loved it.  I received it promptly at a great price.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Allergic to it. I smelled it and it started making me light headed and nauseous ... that&#x27;s the first signs to my allergic reaction. I am allergic to most perfumes and was hoping this wouldn&#x27;t have the same effect on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally my reaction to these types of perfumes is I get light headed, nauseous and I faint or start vomiting then followed by a rash. The first two symptoms is when I know to avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally the smell is just okay nothing special like others claimed. With it having freesia and apples, etc I thought it be a more organic smell but to me it smells like so many others that I&#x27;ve smelled previously. I&#x27;ll probably go with the Freesia Spritz by Victoria Secret ... I&#x27;ve never had allergic reactions to their perfume line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you can&#x27;t return it without contacting Amazon&#x27;s customer service. When I hit &amp;#34;Return&amp;#34; it gave me the following message: &amp;#34;This item isn&#x27;t eligible for return. This item can’t be returned since it requires special transportation and handling which we can’t provide. Use the Contact us button for help addressing your issue.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t return it. It didn&#x27;t exactly come in the best packaging. It was a small box just able to fit it and had brown packaging paper. It was very snug in the box. Not exactly special transportation conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted customer service via chat and they are happily refunding my money. I Love Amazon! The best customer service anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be contacting Amazon and see what they say since I am allergic to it. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended based on the smell - nothing special.</li>
    <li> love it - wish it continued to smell all day, after about 4 hours or less the smell has gone away!</li>
    <li> I love Taylor Swift&#x27;s Wonderstruck perfume! It is not overwhelming, but just the perfect touch of floral. I wear it all the time and was so happy to find the 3.4 oz bottle at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, they loved it.</li>
    <li> smells really good. I was hesitant to buy it (don&#x27;t want to be labeled as one of &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; taylor swift fans but I smelled the product on my younger cousin and liked it so much that I bought it for myself. my favorite perfume so far...</li>
    <li> I generally do not buy celebrity perfumes because they always seem to smell really cheap. This perfume is actually a very mature blend between flowery and sweet (not an overpowering amount of sweet). It&#x27;s a very complex scent that clearly had a lot of thought put into it. It&#x27;s subtle enough to smell just when you&#x27;re hugging the person wearing it and I get compliments all the time. Side note- very sturdy bottle: I dropped it from about five feet onto a tile floor today and all that happened is the sprayer popped off- it popped right back on and works again! This has become my daily go-to. Just do it, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> The description indicated that I would receive 3.4 ounce bottle of parfum.  After comparing prices I found this was by far the best deal. I received the package and was wonderfully surprised by what I was sent.  I was sent a gift package (containing the parfum, lotion, AND bodywash) which was much more than I thought I was going to get.  I also received a discount coupon and samples of other parfums. I&#x27;m going to defiantly order from this company again!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and it came exactly as it said and she seems very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I get this for my God daughter every year for Christmas. She loves it and can&#x27;t get enough of it. I like the fragrance because it is not too overbearing like some of the other ones out there!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I received a tiny bottle last year for Christmas and used every last drop! The scent is light but noticeable. I always get compliments when I wear this perfume!</li>
    <li> This is my daughters favorite perfume.  She was excited to get it.  They also sent sample with the set and that was nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She previously has worn and loved [[ASIN:B000AQF50Y D &amp; G Light Blue By Dolce &amp; Gabbana For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces]], but got tired of the fragrance and wanted something different. She loves this fragrance and I find it very pleasant. I like how the scent profile changes; starting with a fruity, almost sweet scent to changing to a musky, earthy and slightly floral scent later in the day.</li>
    <li> I saw Taylor on the Ellen Show and she described her fragrance - I just had to get it and I am glad I did. Excellent delivery time, too!</li>
    <li> Received it fast and loved the price but I believe it is old(is that why it&#x27;s so cheap?). When first spraying it, it smells just like what I&#x27;ve bought in store but then it has that old perfume smell. Hard to explain, just reminds me of perfume you find in a drawer that&#x27;s been there for years.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter wanted some of this perfume so I bought it for her for Christmas. I guess she likes it because she wears it all the time. It stinks like hell.  I&#x27;d prefer the smell of sweat resulting from hard work but I reckon that ain&#x27;t happening.  It&#x27;s hard to break a sweat no matter how hard you work on Facebook.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and this particular bottle did not smell the same, something is off.</li>
    <li> Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell smells… Smelly. *Mr. Krabs voice*</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite scent . . . an annual purchase!</li>
    <li> Perfume is so hard to buy because it can smell different on different people based on their pheromones.  I love the smell of this perfume.  It is light enough not to overwhelm, but still noticeable.</li>
    <li> At first the perfume was spraying fine until it got stuck and didn&#x27;t want to spray anymore. My girlfriend just got it and after a few uses the spray nozzle malfunctions and nothing comes out! Pretty sad</li>
    <li> Smells sooooo good! I get compliments still when I put it on &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> the best perfume ever! I really like the fresh scent. not too over powering. absolutely perfect! this is a great product</li>
    <li> The woman I purchased this for really does like it. And she also liked the attractive way it is packaged.</li>
    <li> hola el prefume es delicioso, para las que les gusta las escencias dulces , la super recomienedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its fantastic, if you like main accords with sweet  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it. Cannot say more than just love it. Lasts all day. Every strong and lasting</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  I got it for a Christmas gift this past year. Every store was wanting an outrageous amount for a tiny small bottle. I am SO SO SO happy I purchased this! For under $30.00 I received a HUGE bottle, lotion, AND a perfume stick! LOVE LOVE LOVE them all!! Thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really great but is very strong!!  I am not sure what makes it so potent but one spray is enough to have everyone know you are coming before you arrive.  If you can get past the strength or are okay diluting it, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was happy to get my perfume, it also came as a gift set! I wasn&#x27;t aware of that, big bottle of perfume, travel lotion and perfume stick. I am taking away points be cause the stick smells better than the bottle of perfume, maybe it is old?</li>
    <li> smells amazing and the bottle is gorgeous. it is huge it will definitely last me awhile! what a great value.</li>
    <li> I was pretty happy to recieve Wonderstruck after reading many reviews watching reviews on youtube and hearing all the rave about this on instagram. I finally recieved the product immediatly sprayed it on. Well.. it smells like grape cough syrup. I can even taste it. Horrible. So the next day i decided to give it another try. Nope.. my husband even told me if i were drinking cough syrup. What the heck did i buy... ill give it 3 stars because the packaging was VERY well done a lot of support. And the bottle is just STUNNING</li>
    <li> I knew my niece wanted this so I got it for her birthday. It was better priced on Amazon than in stores and she was excited to get it. Smells sweet and nice!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister in law and she loved it. She told me that this perfume has a rich and fresh scent, with a twist sweet and a little stronger than &amp;#34;Enchanted Taylor Swift Wonderstruck&amp;#34; (the red one). Excellent for young women. This one is ideal for night use and the red one is better for day use.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a fresh and sweet scent and was greatly disappointed. I think the scent is too.. Mature and a tad too musky.</li>
    <li> Something about WONDERSTRUCK is definitely capturing. At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure, but when I couldn&#x27;t smell it any longer I was looking for the bottle to replenish it! The ornate box and bottle are just stunning and make me feel glamorous to have them in my possession (he he). It comes in a smaller size but both are perfect for carrying around and are very comfortable in thr hand and easy to spray. I find it very difficult to describe this perfume as I can oddly pick up all of the notes of Freesia, Green Tea, Apple Blossom, Raspberry, and Dewberry simultaneously, but in a subtle way...magical! This perfume is suitable for both teenagers and women and can be used while dressed up or dressed down, basically for any ocassion; I can even grab for this when visiting the grocery store! It isn&#x27;t overbearing and seems to be well adjusted for anyone I come in contact with, as I often receive compliments when I have this on. WONDERSTRUCK isn&#x27;t as sweet as it&#x27;s ENCHANTED counterpart, not that enchanted is THAT sweet anyhow, but it&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance for those looking for something on the less sweet side. For a young woman of Taylor Swift&#x27;s age I consider this perfume a bit pricey on the pockets of peers who want to wear this. It is mid-price ranged and, for Eau De Parfum, its staying power mimics that of an Eau De Toilet or body splash. I don&#x27;t feel too bad about this because thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great price you can purchase this with a nice discount, and I believe mine shipped for very little (less than$5) or for free. Although reapplication is necessary after a few hours of wearing this, I fancy having to dig into my purse to be WONDERSTRUCK once more. Wonderstruck is a versatile perfume (like it&#x27;s seemingly mature, yet innocent country pop girly creator) that serves as the perfect marriage between sophistication and simplicity all bottled in one. I absolutely recommend this Eu De Parfume &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> YES I DO ADMIT I TRIED IT ONCE AND NO PUN I WAS &amp;#34;WONDERSTRUCK&amp;#34;. Made a lovely gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> I had sampled this perfume in person in stores before, and finally decided to get a bottle. I have had people comment that they love the scent, and I completely agree. It is not an overwhelming scent, but I like the floral smell. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this people, both men and women, ask me what it is.  It stays on all day long and has a great earthy sophisticated berry fragrance.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great item! Arrived on time and it smells great. I feel like it wares off after a while but overall I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Really nice with a bit of spicy.  Not overpowering.  Not weak.  Out of 20 perfume samples I got, this one was one of the top 5.  I liked it quite a bit.  Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!!! I get sooo many compliments from everyone, especially guys! ;)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase!  It has a spicy undertone that I was unsure of at first.  But once it settles in, it smells so good.  I smelled it on a friend first and that is how I got hooked!</li>
    <li> Easily one of my favorite scents.  It&#x27;s light and pretty, perfect for day and night.  It lasts for several hours.  I&#x27;m definitely buying more when mine runs out!</li>
    <li> This perfume was perfect for my wife.  She loved this scent and it shipped very quickly.  I will recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Well, she loved it. Not too savvy with perfumes, but she said that this one was better than the new one, which is supposed to be a red instead of a purple colour.</li>
    <li> SCENT MEANT FOR A TEENAGE GIRL...THIS PERFUME IS JUST OK..OTHER PERFUMES HAVE THIS ONE BEAT!</li>
    <li> Smells great and I can&#x27;t stop smelling myself. I get compliments on it all the time. Wow, and it wasnt too expensive. Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Steels amazing!</li>
    <li> Received the largest 3.4 OZ bottle of this yesterday. I was worried this would be too much of a tween fragrance for those of us over 25, but I was pleasantly surprised. I purchased this without testing it first when I read the notes. (The top notes are raspberry, dewberry, freesia and apple blossom. The heart has sweet vanilla along with honeysuckle and white hibiscus and it finishes with amber, musk, sandalwood and peach in the base)     Peach, vanilla and raspberry are some of my favorite notes in fragrances so when I saw all three in this one I couldn&#x27;t resist. Upon first spray it smelt like BS Fantasy (which is one my favs) but that only lasted for about 2 seconds and then it evolved into something completely different.     For the first 10 minutes, Wonderstruck smells mostly of vanilla and candied raspberries on my skin, then the heart comes through and you do get the white hibiscus and more of the freesia from the top note. The apple is hard to detect, I can smell it when first sprayed slightly, but only for the initial spray, it really is overpowered by that raspberry. There is also a strong note of honeysuckle in this and combined with the vanilla it is a very sweet scent. Once it settles on my skin the fragrance is a very fruity raspberry-vanilla-slightly floral-honeysuckle. Very very sweet, it&#x27;s definitely a gourmand scent, so you really need to like gourmands to like this.     Lasting power is pretty good, about 6 hrs on me. Towards to end of the day when it&#x27;s down to the base it leaves a nice vanilla-y amber scent on the skin, I never do detect any peach in this at all at any point throughout the day, so if you&#x27;re not a peach fan, nothing to worry about there. It does remind me slightly of a mix of BS fantasy (which is a sweeter cake gourmand and PH Can Can (very sweet but slightly oriental feel), it definitely has a candied sweetness about it, but it&#x27;s much more vanilla based than both those. A nice sweet vanilla scent that doesn&#x27;t feel too young.</li>
    <li> My wife and I are both 50-something. She originally wanted this perfume for the purple bottle. OK- good enough reason for me to buy her a present-lol. I don&#x27;t know a lot about top notes, bottom notes, woodsy, herbal, spicy or whatever. All I know is when she comes downstairs wearing this perfume, we usually end up upstairs again asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> This amazing perfume is a nice fresh and clean scent  it is the perfect perfume for young and teen girls  The light citrus perfume will leave you smelling amazing all day long. I recommend this perfume.to everyone. You will fall in love with wonderstruck once you try it.</li>
    <li> Came just as shown in the picture, came on time and my wife loved it. Box was in great condition and arrived in a few days.</li>
    <li> The lady that received this was thrilled beyond words. I have not had the pleasure of smelling this fragrance on her. But her reaction was priceless.</li>
    <li> Bought this about two months ago for my sister who is 20...she looooooooooooooooves it...it is really teenagey!  The bottle though is reaaaaally nice and beautiful...Nowadays there are many celebrity perfumes out there but no one seems to care about the design (expect for Justin Bieber&#x27;s :))) )</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 19 year old girlfriend on a whim and honestly had no idea what it would smell like. I myself am very picky on what perfumes she wears. I&#x27;m not a fan of overly musky perfumes or even heavy smelling perfumes. I also don&#x27;t like perfumes that don&#x27;t have a lasting scent.  This perfume went above and beyond all expectations. My girlfriend absolutely loves it, and I love when she wears it. It&#x27;s not just a young person perfume. Even her mother and father (who is a very tough, manly man) love the scent. I would highly recommend this smell to anyone who wants to smell sophisticated yet playful.  The smell is a somewhat sweet mixture of vanilla, hibiscus, and many other faint smells. It ends up leaving a pleasant berry aroma which satisfies rather than overwhelms your senses.  The perfume arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The bottle is pretty gnarly too. My girlfriend still can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it, even a month later.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne!  I receive compliments each time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great price, smells good but doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> One of my favorite  scents. First tried at Sams. Light floral scent. Great for any age if you want a nice scent for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Always receiving compliments on it. I am not a teenage girl and people laugh when I tell them it is Taylor Swift because they cannot believe how elegant it smells! Love it</li>
    <li> Wonderstruck is one of my favorite perfumes. I get a lot of compliments on this perfume. I wear it to work and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear perfume, but I started making exceptions to the rule for this one. It smells wonderful! Very light and summery.</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume and wear it all the time.  Actually it is my favorite.  Would highly recommend. Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume... which is why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it was just the perfume I received, but this has no staying power. I have dozens of samples of this... which last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for scent....  had to mark it down for staying power.</li>
    <li> Yes It Was Great But Fragrance refunded me everything they not take out for the perfume I was to pay for</li>
    <li> Lovely smell,.. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I hate Taylor Swift, but this perfume smells so good. So good, that despite my hatred for Taylor Swift, I bought her stupid perfume and wear it every day.</li>
    <li> This is the first perfume I&#x27;ve worn that I received compliments on and I&#x27;m in my late 20s. I&#x27;ve worn dozens of different perfumes over the years and never had one person mention that I smelled good until I wore this perfume. It has now become my scent and I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I love the bottle as well, it&#x27;s very attractive! Price on amazon is awesome too! I purchased my first bottle at Sephora for about $20 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I paid $45.63 on amazon in December 2012...price is $28.85 today, 3/3/14! WOW!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has lasted me for over a year. Note that I do not wear perfume daily, as it is not permitted in my workplace (I&#x27;m an esthetician and work in close quarters with clients)</li>
    <li> This cologne has a nice refreshing scent. Bought it in the store previously, but got a better price on line.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. The wife loved it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice  everybody loves it&lt;br /&gt; l0\</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d describe this as a woodsy floral scent.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried Enchanted Forest body spray by Bodycology (found at Walmart) you&#x27;ll really like this stuff.  Wonderstruck is much more potent than Enchanted Forest and lasts WAY longer on you.  I put this stuff on at 5pm and it lasted well past 9pm for me.  It does fade a bit but it&#x27;s definitely still there.  I was smelling my wrists the whole evening :)  I love this perfume so much!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  It smells terrific.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Thank you SO much! I LOVE this perfume!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, but very little lasting power.</li>
    <li> SMELL REAL GOOD AND LAST A LONG TIME STRONG PERFUME WITH A SWEET SMELL</li>
    <li> just got this in the mail today, two days after ordering. It smells awesome and for any age. got the biggest bottle and its gorgeous. a pearly light purple with gold letters and golld top and three gold charms. smells amzing, and looks amazing and im proud to have it in my collection. the only thing was that it was a little pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> It smells very good, it just doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I&#x27;ve had Bath &amp; Body Works body sprays that have lasted longer than this. Do better, Taylor Swift, do better.</li>
    <li> All berries smell similar when used in perfumes, but WONDERSTRUCK has slightly more distinctive notes of raspberry and blackberry. After the berries the peach is the next strongest fruit - which surprised me as it&#x27;s meant to be a base note, yet it develops soon after being applied to skin. The soft vanilla is present through all of the fragrance, with adds a creamy sweetness and warmth to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WONDERSTUCK is meant to contain thirteen different floral notes, but - aside from a breeze of freesia - none of them are strong enough to stand out from the fruits and vanilla. This is  definitely a fruity perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant trickle of raspberry, peach and vanilla. The sandalwood and musk are mingled closely together so it is a warm and creamy mix - nice, but it is a blend that is used in many fragrances today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent notes: Raspberry, dewberry, green tea, freesia, apple blossom, vanilla, honeysuckle, white hibiscus, amber, musk and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I think WONDERSTRUCK is &#x27;nice&#x27;, very wearable and wears quite well, I won&#x27;t be replacing my bottle.  As whilst it is pleasant to wear, it&#x27;s nothing new and it doesn&#x27;t excite me. Lots of people compare this to Britney Spears Fantasy [another EA release], but I don&#x27;t get the comparison at all. I&#x27;d say this is more along the lines of a Harajuku Lovers release; Music.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got a tester and used it to the last drop. Loved it so much I got her a bottle. Sweet, elegant, and very girly, she smells great. Not too powerful - nice hints every now and then. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> It is the best perfume I have see or smelled in my life. It came earlier then it should have. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift for my wife...she smells excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wunderstruck for a year now, and I&#x27;m like other people who wear it:  I cannot stop smelling myself!!!  I absolutely LOVE it!!  Thought it would be too young for me, but have had more compliments with the perfume than any I have worn.  You cannot go wrong with this scent, no matter your age.  I highly recommend it!  If you have any doubts, go to a store that sells it, and spray some on your wrist.  You won&#x27;t be sorry...........hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....delightful!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this perfume gift set from my local Belk&#x27;s store. The gift set includes a full size bottle with a roll-on applicator. I really enjoy it! Sephora lists the different notes of the fragrence as \\&quot;Freesia, Green Tea, Apple Blossom, Raspberry, Dewberry\\&quot;. It smells sweet and floral, kind of like an insense, but not so much that it would be considered appropriate for just teenagers; adults can appricate it, too! I will say that sprayable purfume lasted longer than the roll-on application as far as my testing has gone. The lasting power for the fragrence spray is atleast 7 hours, longer on clothes than on skin, and the roll on application was maybe 2 hours top on skin. There&#x27;s a lot of reviews that question how long this product will actually last and my advise is to go to your local mall, store, wallgreens, whatever, if possible, try it on, do some shopping (or walk around a bit) and if you like it at the end of the day, purchase it! If not, try again with a different perfume. All fragrences will react differently with everyone&#x27;s skin and biochemestry, so the only way to be sure that you&#x27;ll like it is to try it.</li>
    <li> My teenager loves this perfume. Not sure if its the smell or how much she uses, but it seems a bit strong to me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my teenaged granddaughter is a Taylor Swift fan and this was on her Christmas Wish List.  She loves the look of the bottle and the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I brought this for $39.98 which is cheaper than Macy&#x27;s. it&#x27;s for my sister and she loves it, I got it for her for Christmas and I don&#x27;t regret it its a great item.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice. I think any age group could pull this off. I also like how it&#x27;s not too over powering but you can still smell it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and these were her words - &amp;#34;LOVE IT! It&#x27;s the most amazing perfume ever made!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased the \\&quot;3.4 oz\\&quot; bottle without noticing there are 2 sellers: 1 from \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; and 1 from Sephora. The \\&quot;3.4 oz\\&quot; bottle is a fake. The 1st note evaporates almost immediately. The 2nd note smells cheap and watered down. I&#x27;ve sampled ~15 perfumes and colognes during the Christmas holiday and I really LOVE Wonderstruck. All 3 days, I brought a sample of Wonderstruck home to remind me when the package comes in. It came in today with a big disappointment. I really wanted to gift this perfume for a friend but I&#x27;m very cautious when gifting perfumes. I&#x27;m glad I caught the fake bottle in time and Amazon&#x27;s Customer Support for giving me a swift refund as Amazon&#x27;s policy forbid returning flammable items.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells a little flowery &amp; classy. Every time I wear it to work, all of my female coworkers ask me what it is!</li>
    <li> I really love the scent!💞</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical based on user reviews -- but this is the same as the tester i have smelled at ulta and kohl&#x27;s. smells great, lasts all day. great price</li>
    <li> I am a young adult and I LOVE THIS PERFUME LIKE NO OTHER. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before. It&#x27;s not too fruity, it just smells GOOD. I&#x27;m VERY picky with my fragrances, and I wouldn&#x27;t endorse this if I didn&#x27;t absolutely love it. The bottle is absolutely beautiful as well. It&#x27;s purple and it shimmers. If you hold it up against the light, it becomes a solid shade of violet. My bottle is half gone, and I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase another bottle. Best perfume and definitely my signature perfume. Perfect, light scent. ONLY bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, but the smell is enough to overcome this one negative. Overall, I&#x27;d purchase it again and again. Probably one of my best purchases ever, and on Amazon it&#x27;s cheaper than what it is in the real world.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. This perfume is for sure a great perfume. I am sure this perfume is worth the money. I have to admit, the only reason I wanted this perfume in the first place is because it was by Taylor Swift. (No matter what people say I will always be her number one fan!) That&#x27;s when I went to Macy&#x27;s with my mom and I sniffed a sample. Then that&#x27;s when I begged my mother to give it to me for Christmas.Luckily, I got the perfume. It smells fantastic and I highly suggest that it should be bought. Wonderstruck left me Wonderstruck!</li>
    <li> This deserves 10 stars (seriously)! Everywhere i go, i get complemented. My family and friends cant get enough of it. I was a little skeptical on whether or not it would match my body chemistry, but it did. In fact it matches mine and others. It&#x27;s suitable for all ages and you will smell amazing. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Good price compared to local stores, wife and grandaughter both liked it so that&#x27;s all that matters so  it gets 5 stars</li>
    <li> It is great smelling and she loves it.  And more words and more words and more words and more words.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. We both really like it.  It seems to have a very sexy aroma to it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it and so does her freinds. My wife likes it too so I got her Enchanted for Christmas, she loved it. Thanks Taylor!!!!</li>
    <li> It smells so good! I got it for my girlfriend for valentines day and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and I am over 50.  Not just for the young, but for the young at heart as well.</li>
    <li> It depends on personal opinions.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money I paid for it. I even saved the box the bottle came in, everything about this perfume if beautiful- the box, the bottle, the scent, everything. I love it.</li>
    <li> I honestly am not a fan of Taylor Swift...Like most above-20 year olds, I find her to be quite immature/irritating...That being said, I got a sample of this perfume from Sephora many months ago and I really loved it...But I just couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of forking over my hard earned money to a celebrity for their perfume....I sort of forgot about the sample and it sat in my drawer. I recently started smelling it again and JUST HAD to buy it....I&#x27;m justifying this by thinking about how Taylor Swift gives a lot of money to charity, so my dollars are sort of going there! LOL. Anyway....SO NOW TO THE SCENT...It is very sweet and gourmand for sure....There is a strong raspberry smell, but it&#x27;s  not a gross 5 dollar body spray type of smell...It smells so classy, not candy syrupy sweet...The other strongest smell is vanilla, to me...At the end of the day, the perfume smells quite woodsy and sweet...this perfume does not last well on skin, for me at least. I usually spray my clothes with it, and like that, I can definitely smell it the whole day, sometimes even the next day when I spray it on my coat or scarf....Overall though, lasting power isn&#x27;t too great. BUT IT SMELLS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOD.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE........TERRIFIC PRICE</li>
    <li> Bought this as birthday gift for wife, she seems to love it. The smell is really good, but it may not be long lasting.</li>
    <li> my niece really enjoys the perfume great product for her will be ordering more for her for the holiday season</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, bought it for my daughter we both like it.  Good job Taylor Swift you rock.  Not much else to write.</li>
    <li> Hated it. Gave it to my daughter-n-law who is 21. I should have known better but when I sprayed it at Kohls, it was surprisingly nice. Leave it to the younger girls! I&#x27;ll stick to classic parfums.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone who likes this..  box came perfectly as you would from a store. don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
    <li> The scent last only for two minutes and it&#x27;s not that strong, even Victoria Secret body mist last longer, and the Victoria Secret Body Mist Love Spell smells much better and more precious.  This is an okay smell but don&#x27;t expect it to last too long.  I suggest you try it out at a mall first, because if you don&#x27;t like it, Amazon will not allow you to return it due to it being a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This perfume offers a sweet scent that is appropriate in both the office and in casual settings.  It&#x27;s also lovely on women of all ages, as both my mom (50) and I (25) wear it.</li>
    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;Gift for grandchild&lt;br /&gt;15 year old&lt;br /&gt;On childs Christmas list&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to parents&lt;br /&gt;to time consuming to answer&lt;br /&gt;Need to many words in evaluating</li>
    <li> Smells incredible.  I&#x27;m a guy so thats about it for this review.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance. Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing !!!! The bottle its huge 😃😃😃..&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves it and it was in good condition when I received it.   I would order it again.</li>
    <li> When I first received a sample of Wonderstruck I had to buy it! I love the smell it&#x27;s floral, but sweet and soft! I get so many compliments from people everytime I wear it!</li>
    <li> Wonderstruck review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I walked through the fragrance section of department stores and sprayed this perfume. My eyes fell longingly at the beautiful purple bottle and three charms-Moravion star, dove, and birdcage- practically calling my name. Something about this perfume just MADE me spray it every single time. I then saw the price tag and slowly and solemnly walked away, wondering when I would smell heaven again. Something in the perfume made me feel so elegant and beautiful that I became obsessed. As much as anyone, I love the scent. Then, Finally, I decided to check amazon. I was surprised to see the perfection on sale at about $50. I immediately rubbed my eyes and concluded I was dreaming. Right there in front of me was my most prized possession. All I had to do was click. And so I did. Everyday after that, I anxiously waited for my Wonderstruck to arrive. It felt like months, except only a few days had passed. Then about four days after I ordered it, a UPS deliveryman knocked on my door. I swear, right then was the happiest moment of my life. I literately hugged the mailman and shut the door. I cleaned my room, put on my prettiest dress and played enchanted (mostly to prepare myself for the moment). Then I did it. I squeezed the little knob and the liquid that had just been in the bottle misted my neck. I felt beautiful. Incredible. I no longer felt like the regular 14 year old I am, but a beautiful princess. You might call my review a little exasperated, but it&#x27;s the truth. This little bottle changed my life. The next day at school, the guy I had liked for the longest time, asked me to sit with him. He kept breathing in, I hoped I smelled good(which of course I did!) it was the best day! We ended up going out and every date we went on, I wore my magic perfume. He seemed almost enchanted! Thank you so much Taylor! This perfume gave me my best friend! It&#x27;s so perfect! And it makes me feel perfect too. Like I&#x27;m wanted, loved, enchanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and girlfriend they really love the smell and the bottle. Smells good. Not to much money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my daughter since she loves the wonderstruck perfume. It is hard to find the 3.4 oz bottle in stores. This even came with a little purse. Great buy and fast service.</li>
    <li> this is my first online purchase.i got what i expected. especially i love the cute botte. overall it is a good poduct</li>
    <li> My husband did good and picked this out for me.  Great smelling and great price.  Love this parfum would order it again</li>
    <li> At the beginning I did not want to buy a perfume that I could not smell before, but when I had it in my hands I just LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product and this website!&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this is for a person that likes Taylor Swift.</li>
    <li> This product totally met my expectations. It arrived packaged safely and in a very timely manner. Thank you so much. 😄</li>
    <li> Got this for my teenager who loves and is a huge fan of Taylor Swift so I got her this as a Birthday present ,it&#x27;s comes in an attractive bottle with lovely charms and a great scent !!!!! Great buy !!</li>
    <li> Obviously scent is a personal preference so saying it smells good doesn&#x27;t really help you, but it was WAY bigger than I was expecting. This bottle should last me an entire year, I was very pleasantly surprised by that. Probably 3 times more than my old bottle which was the size I expected.</li>
    <li> Item packaging was nice, scent is great and my sister loved it. I recommend this product to anyone. I had already knwe the scent when ordering, you should smell any perfume at a store and then buy it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this perfume from Birchbox, fell in love. After looking in my local stores and online, I found the cheapest and easiest to be Amazon! Great price, fast shipping and great product! &#x3D;) its a sweet fruity smell that softens after a while but isn&#x27;t overwhelming like most perfumes are now.</li>
    <li> These fruity scents will make you notice when they are applied, but I have not found them to be overbearing in comparison to many others that are on the market (including significantly more expensive ones). Though you are certainly paying for the name, it has a pleasant scent to accompany it.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my niece and she was thrilled to receive it.  The scent is light and perfect for a young girl.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and I enjoy the smell it made her smile from ear to ear. So happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law who absolutely loves this perfurme!  It is all she wears.  The packaging is really cute too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it, and the bottle is really pretty and sparkely</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife at Christmas  ......Here is what she says:  smells very nice and is not overpowering......she loves the fragrence and the beautiful bottle is a bonus........BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of taylor swift so I bought this perfume. It smells so sweet and soft that I wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> When I received this in the mail, two charms were broken! I was willing to let it go because I was so happy that I finally had Wonderstruck. The next day, I went and smelled it in an Ulta, and its a definite fake!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this sent and I like the  price .</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and lasts all day and night! But the price is what really made me buy it. Wonderstruck costs at least $40 in store but for $25 or less? What a steal!!! Well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this at the store and 2 days later I decided I wanted it. I love this perfume. Floral and fruity, not overpowering, simply lovely and long lasting (about 5-6 hours). People have said that I smell wonderful, and ask what am I wearing. I really don&#x27;t know her music but I love this perfume.</li>
    <li> Good price. Fast delivery. Smells perfect however it seems as if the scent isn&#x27;t as strong and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the one I&#x27;ve bought at the department store. Possibly why it&#x27;s a little cheaper on-line.. I&#x27;m not sure. But over all it was a decent buy. I&#x27;ll probably go back to purchasing my fragrances at the department store though.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of T. Swift&#x27;s Wonderstruck. I didn&#x27;t expect such a yummy smelling perfume from TS but she proved me wrong. I love sweet smelling perfumes, not the strong bitter kinds that grandma&#x27;s wear, so this is perfect for me! The smell also last a while. I work 8 hour days and by the end of my work day, my coworkers will still tell me I smell good :)</li>
    <li> Thank you for offering a chance to get designer perfumes for a 1/3 of the price at the department stores!! It came with extra samples and a cute makeup bag as well! Sooo happy</li>
    <li> I love this Wonderstuck Parfum. I got my first one last year and had so many compliments from everyone that I got around. I recommend this to everyone that loves so smeill awesome as this I hope will alway be able to buy. AA++</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition - still in plastic wrap and all - which was important to me because I bought it as a gift. Would do again!</li>
    <li> Dont like it.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth money, feel bad that i purchase it really.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy it again sure.</li>
    <li> The perfume was a flop.  It smelled nothing like the fragrance I smelt in the department store, and had no &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; power, very upset I wasted the money.</li>
    <li> Made a wonderful Christmas gift for our teen-aged granddaughter who is really into Taylor Swift.  Very nice fragrance, suitable for all ages.</li>
    <li> Smells great but I broke out in hives. This is the 1st perfume that caused me to have an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Grand-daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Sister loves it. Smells great and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great perfume.  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... Smells Terrific !</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a great product, would order again.  excellent!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling perfume! I love how it is not to overbearing and I can use a good amount without getting an awful headache from the fumes. I am definitely using this from now on!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me for my birthday. I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for several years, but I usually purchase it from a department store or beauty store. I was very excited to get this as a gift because it&#x27;s become very hard to find. The packaging looked identical to bottles I had purchased in the past, but upon opening it, the top of the bottle completely came off, which has never happened before. I didn&#x27;t even think that the top COULD come off. I immediately became concerned, but brushed it off because it was a gift. I put the top back on, sprayed the perfume and found that it smelled NOTHING like what I&#x27;ve always bought. I suspect that it has been opened and refilled with something else. We are not pleased with this purchase, especially since we are not able to return it.</li>
    <li> Wife LOVES it and so do I!</li>
    <li> It smells like heaven and love.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth selling your soul to get it.&lt;br /&gt;I regret nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this freaking fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance the best on my wife. We tested almost all the different ones at different stores in the mall and this one was our favorite. My wife and I tend to like the more sweeter fragrance and definitely not soapy or flowery. I just hope they never discontinue it. It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than buying from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Went to a perfume place in the mall and this was twice as much as it was on here. Bought another expensive perfume and gave my wife this one and the other. She wears this inexpensive bottle and just loves it. If I had one gripe it would be that the smell is a bit short-lived.</li>
    <li> When I started looking for a new parfume, I was stuck between this one and Live Luxe by JLo.  I was only able to go by the notes because I&#x27;m deployed overseas and I don&#x27;t have the luxury of sampling perfumes.  Informally wear Boss for women by Hugo boss and moon sparkle by escada.  I ended up getting both the live luxe and wonderstruck.  The first one to arrive at my house was was live.  My husband said he liked it and that it smelled really nice.  It made him think of something more upbeat and on the move to wear like the boss to go dancing in or running around town.  He sent me an email saying the wonderstruck came in and it was by far the best parfume he has ever smelled period.  He said it has to him a later in the evening smell for seduction lol.  Something you would put on for a night out of bonding or tempting.  If you could bottle seduction this would be it.  The raspberry notes are perfect and light where the lower notes of some sweet flower sticks to you and and really makes the whole Ora of the smells perfect.  I&#x27;m not a Taylor swift fan but I am of this parfume.  The live luxe smells good too though.</li>
    <li> I love the scent (yay! Swiftie here!)</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this perfume! smells amazing</li>
    <li> Beautiful inside and out!</li>
    <li> My 10 yr old granddaughter was quite happy with this parfum.  I think it&#x27;s a bit much for a 10 yr. old, but this is what my&lt;br /&gt;daughter-in-law suggested.  I really has a very light smell.</li>
    <li> quick delivery nice scent</li>
    <li> Great price!  Gave as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how much I liked this fragrance. My other favorite is Hanae Mori, and I loved Sun, Moon, Stars by Lagerfeld. This is very much along those lines, a lovely- somewhat spicey frangrance.  This would be a sophisticated scent on a teen, and youthful without being too young for adults.</li>
    <li> A gift for my 16 year old granddaughter who is a huge Taylor Swift fan.  This was a huge hit and her first (besides CD&#x27;s) TS product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be legit and not a knockoff</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, I get compliments whenever I wear it!</li>
    <li> I bought this blindly since I&#x27;ve heard such great things about it. The truth is... its mediocre and that&#x27;s being positive. First spray smells woodsy and kind of fruity? I guess. But it also smells like straight up dirt (I think that&#x27;s the \\&quot;green tea\\&quot; note.) After that initial forgiveness aroma goes away, it smells decent. I guess...</li>
    <li> this is an amazing scent! I prefer to wear it in the winter though beause its very sweet and it makes me  feel  warm and cozy. It has a very sweet scent to it, if you don&#x27;t like strong sweet scents i don&#x27;t recommend this it wears off at about 4 hours later, it stays on the clothes until they are washed. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I wear it all the time, I collect perfumes for their bottles and sometimes i find a scent that I just love, this is one of them! I would recommend this perfume to anyone!! :-)</li>
    <li> I would have done a better job myself for free. I just wanted to save time, but I will think twice next time.</li>
    <li> Originally got this for our daughter last Christmas.  I thought I would try it since it smells so wonderfully on her.  It&#x27;s now one of my favorites as well.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Taylor Swift, but I do love this perfume.  It has a nice, clean, somewhat floral but not over-powering scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for niece.  She liked it and she isn&#x27;t the type to lie to safeguard my feeling, which I found out one birthday.  Good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Both this for my gf as a small gift. She absolutely loves T Swift and loves the perfume, or parfum? In my opinion, it smells pretty good (I would give it an 8 out of 10) but it makes her happy so that makes me happy. As a guy, having a gf tell you what to give them as a gift makes my life a whole lot easier. Plus, buying it online prevents me from having to actually go to a store to buy it and the cheaper price online compared to in-store is always a plus. Overall, my gf likes it and I saved time/money &#x3D; five stars!</li>
    <li> great buy, great service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one for celebrity perfumes, and I most certainly do not like Taylor Swift, but this perfume is great. Definitely one of my favorites! It&#x27;s a beautiful scent, perfect for younger women. Not too childish, not too sexy.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter absolutely LOVED this.  She put it on right away.  Really nice perfum.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind borrowing it myself!!!!!</li>
    <li> My 15 year old granddaughter was over the moon with this gift.  I had even liked it, a lot, and intend to get some for myself.</li>
    <li> This is the full size bottle of perfume for a great price! Prime shipping made it even better! My niece asked for this for her birthday and I was happy to find it for a steal!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this perfume because it is associated with Taylor Swift, but I think the scent is a little overpowering.</li>
    <li> very good product great gift smells great just great great great great! ....................... . . . . . . . !</li>
    <li> Delightful! Men love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite for an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Love it! It smells a bit like Ck Euphoria. Hope they&#x27;ll repackage it though. it&#x27;s a bit hard to hold but smells great. i love the sweet scent. will definitely get this again</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great, however this is not one of my personal favorite. The smell reminds me of Britney Spears perfume Midnight Fantasy.</li>
    <li> Delicious! Sweet and sophisticated. I&#x27;m a fragrance consultant and i like this better than some designer fragrances :)</li>
    <li> The mail carrier delivered it to the wrong house but my neighbor brought it to me.  Love the perfume</li>
    <li> Luvvvv it. This perfume smells so good.</li>
    <li> A few years back, I&#x27;d received a sample vial of this from my neighbor...&amp; I was instantly hooked!  On me, &#x27;Wonderstruck&#x27; smells delightfully of berries.  I was pleasantly surprised, as this is a lovely, youthful debut fragrance from Ms. Swift.</li>
    <li> excellent  My wife loves</li>
    <li> Love the smell and price. Great buy!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT price!!  The price for this size was the same price for the small one at local stores.  : )</li>
    <li> Awesome, actually was sent an entire package with a bigger bottle, a smaller purse bottle, and also a body cream. So im a happy camper!!</li>
    <li> i love it, this smell so amazing :x  i&#x27;ll buy more if u can discount more and have some promotion for me :)</li>
    <li> I consider choosing this rating, because it smells really good, I love it SOOOO much and you can basically wear it anywhere! It&#x27;s not like those types of perfumes where you just wear it one time and then you&#x27;re done with it!:)</li>
    <li> such a deal compared to buying in the store, smells great!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by this little scent. I thought I&#x27;d be getting a fruity sugar bomb like so many other celebrity fragrances but what I actually ended up with was a fantastic blend of berries, woods, and black tea. This is much less girly than I thought it would be. It is feminine, of course, but you&#x27;ll feel like you should be reading a book in a coffee house or going hiking rather than walking a pink poodle to the ice cream parlor when you wear it. The scent lasts pretty well, by the end of the day it has settled into sandalwood and a bit of fruit which is still pleasant.</li>
    <li> I just received this item today. It came a day earlier than it said it was. I was so happy. It was packaged with bubble wrap very securely. When I opened the box and removed the wrap I was so shocked. There was a very large wonderstruck box. I opened that box and inside was the 3.4 oz bottle as I ordered along with a tube of lotion AND a perfume stick. (Not the roll on kind. It was like a solid white stick). I was so happy. The only thing in the description and reviews was the perfume. On the box it said that it was an $85 dollar retail value. But I got it for only 24 dollars. I would give this 10 stars if I could because of the quick shipping, excellent packaging, extra items I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and excellent quality. Will definitely buy again and recommend 100%!</li>
    <li> When i chose this product because it looked pretty. And when i smelled it it smelled like flowers with candy together. I mean it smelled good! I would mostly have this on in a work day or school day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of shopping in stores around the holidays, so I heavily rely on feedback, especially with something like perfume.  My wife loves it, and so do I.  Smells as good as Taylor Swift looks ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to describe it as well as some others can, but I can say that her teenage sister loved it, her mom loved it, and her grandma loved it too.  Win/Win all around.</li>
    <li> The price for this size was outstanding. Shipped within a few days. First time I purchased gifts online. Would purchase another product again.</li>
    <li> The bottle is very beautiful, and the perfume is very good. I like this style. I will buy this product two more.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY NEICE.  SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!!!!  SHE HAS BEEN USING IT SINVE IT CAME OUT</li>
    <li> This perfume has several scents mixed in, and I notice them throughout the day. This is the type of mellow perfume that you can wear all day, every day and be happy with it. I put this on in a store, and kept sniffing my wrist all through the mall- then had to go back and buy some. It&#x27;s definitely worth replacing my bottle when the time comes!</li>
    <li> it has a beautiful scent. I bought the large bottle and I&#x27;m actually glad because I was able to pass it onto my little sister after I decided to try another perfume.</li>
    <li> I love the smells but doesn&#x27;t stay on long .</li>
    <li> Good to have for daily use dont last long</li>
    <li> I just love the bottle and charms. My fave color is purple. This stuff smells great. It&#x27;s a little sweeter smelling then her other. However, her enchanted scent lasts longer.</li>
    <li> When I found out Taylor Swift had a fragrance, I immediately assumed that it would be reminiscent of that overly-sweet, vanilla-y scent that plagues middle school locker rooms. Then I got a sample, and I was surprised to discover that it&#x27;s a pretty decent scent. It&#x27;s definitely not the tweeny smell that was so reticent about. It&#x27;s sweet, yes. But not overpoweringly so -- it&#x27;s nicely balanced in its softness and femininity. At the $40 price point, it&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> I am 35 and really was reluctant in purchasing this perfume.  I have to tell you I am so glad I did.  The packaging is SUPERIOR! It is so beautiful I would almost go as far as to say it is a piece of art.  The scent is delicious and not too overpowering.  Definitely not a TWEEN scent like I thought it would be. I have been complimented on this perfume more than any other scent I have ever owned and I have some very HIGH END perfumes.  Two thumbs up and I say go for it! You will be very happy when you get it.</li>
    <li> This eau de parfum was a gift to my daughter who loved it.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume since I bought it last year. The lovely scent lasts 6-7 hours on my skin and I receive many compliments on it. I was not expecting much when I sampled it at the store, but I am very impressed. I plan to buy it again!</li>
    <li> This smells great got lots of people love the smell . Nice and sweet smelling</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I would like a taylor swift perfume. Shes very young and Im in my late forties. I smelled it at a Macys departmrnt store and really liked it so I bought some.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother and upon her opening it, the prayer wouldn&#x27;t work and we couldn&#x27;t figure out why. Come to find out there is no liquid in the perfume bottle and I look like a fool giving my mother an empty bottle of perfume that was never filled from the manufacture. Great quality check going on with this product. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time. I&#x27;ve tried many different perfumes and currently own a lot as well but I always come back to this one. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but this perfume last all day, on the other hand, other more expensive perfumes I&#x27;ve bought fade rather quickly, and people always compliment me on it so that&#x27;s a plus. Also, I was a bit worried about ordering it online since I&#x27;m used to buying it at Ulta, Target, Sephora, or wherever I see it in person but the perfume is the same. Nothing to worry about and it arrived faster than expected. So, I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I first saw this perfume at Kohl&#x27;s but saw it was about $55 and I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much. So I thought I would look on amazon to see if i could find it any cheaper and I did especially since I had a credit balance. It ended up really only costing me like $7. I smelled it while I was at Kohl&#x27;s and thought it was light and not to strong, it smelled like a light airy type of fruit smell I really like it.</li>
    <li> My wife smells beautiful.  She was thrilled to get this decorative bottle to display on her dresser.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely wonderful and the scent lasts almost all day for me.  The bottle and the charms are really unique, looks great sitting out.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE PERFUME. EVEN GOT MY AUNT HOOKED</li>
    <li> The price is great! I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves this. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> this perfume smells wonderful but as soon as you spray it on it doesnt last ten minutes, I think its a waste of money either its not the genuine wonderstruck and its a watered down version or this perfume really doesnt have good lasting power period, I think it was a rip off the price I paid for it, I can&#x27;t imagine if I had of paid full retail value for it, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this perfume!!! Its really perfect! It smells like a mix of berries and vanilla. Smells so good and not too sweet. It lasts a long time too!  Older women can wear this! Doesnt smell too youthful like some other celebrity frangrances so thats a huge plus!!! After it sets in the scent is very gentle and not over powering. Im not a fan of taylor swift but wow she does make some great perfume! I will keep buying this when i start running out. Beautiful bottle too!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my twin sister and she loved it! It smells great! No musky smell which is how I like it and my sister as well!</li>
    <li> Is as described. Love the nice clean scent and fresh yumminess...It arrived as promised. Would order again. ++++ Thank you!</li>
    <li> the perfume bottle was broken and spilled in the box. I&#x27;m hoping I can return it</li>
    <li> I bought this purfume for my daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> Great smelling perfume for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved the scent. Bottle is very appealing as well. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> wife smells sweeeet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! was a great gift for christmas or anytime time needed.thumbs up on the wife meter.get it!!!! you wont b disapionted</li>
    <li> It smells great! My daughter is thrilled that I bought it for her! We will definitely order more when she runs out! Great product for a great price!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this perfume and I&#x27;ve got to say you can not go wrong with wonderstruck by Taylor swift. The scent is strong but not too strong and lasts for about 6hr if not more even on a hot summer day. I love this perfume and if you are contemplating on purchasing it you should just do it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. It lasts a long time. The delivery was very quick. Very satisfied with my order. 😊</li>
    <li> When I first got this I couldn&#x27;t smell it after a few hours and thought hat it was going away.  I realized it must last all day because I was getting tons of compliments on how good I smelled.  Great perfume!</li>
    <li> The bottle is so pretty, smells fresh floral,woodsy but not super strong to be over powerful. I love it and my 13 y/o love&#x27;s it&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever! I totally recommend it to everyone! It has a great sense of smell!! Buy it now! 5 stars</li>
    <li> The smell is so amazing!! Fruity and last all day.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, but the scent only lasts 2 minutes. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> It is too good :) I got it for my mum and she loved it !</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mother in law she absolutely loved it. Was a good price Would buy again. Smelled great. Light scent nothing over powering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Christmas gift for my daughter - can&#x27;t wait to give it to her - I know she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Love the sweet smell. You can wear it during the day.</li>
    <li> smells great and lasts a long time! The bottle looks beautiful as well!</li>
    <li> Love, this perfume. Would highly recommend to those that like fruity scents.</li>
    <li> got this perfume for my girlfriend of one year and she loves the sweet smell to it. not too strong and not too soft as in cannot smell it.</li>
    <li> The scent itself is good. On my skin, it settles to a vanila-berry note. It is not too sweet and is very cozy. However, it does not have a strong sillage; it is a more intimate scent. So, if you want a perfume with a lingering trail, it is not it. Besides, it could be more lasting: I have to overspray to make it last half a day.</li>
    <li> The scent is light and very nice.  Just what you would think Taylor Swift would choose.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the price and delivery time for this perfume.  The bottle is gorgeous and it smells wonderful!  3.4 ounce bottle for the price of the smaller bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stand the singer but the smell was like heaven. Got it for the wife and oh boy! Winner, winner chicken dinner.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great. It is a very nice scent for the day. I would totally recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> really nice perfume!!</li>
    <li> I love this scent it just pops and instantly became a favourite for me. The scent is soft but powerful but you may have to spritz twice or three times but really no more than that. Ive only had smaller bottles of this one but i love it so i just bought the full size.</li>
    <li> The scent changes slightly over time as you wear it and it is one of those perfumes you don&#x27;t get tired of...still not sure? Go into the mall at one of the perfume stands and smell it yourself :)</li>
    <li> I just freaking love this perfume. It&#x27;s really sweet but not too much. It&#x27;s just perfect. And the box is really pretty.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great! I am a little disappointed because I don&#x27;t feel it lasts very long. I had read some other reviews saying the same thing. My sister has the same perfume she bought from a department store and it lasts much longer.  I don&#x27;t think in would purchase from here again.</li>
    <li> love it .smells good on me tried it on first and then knew it was worth the purchase. try it</li>
</ol>
