      <li>Great !!</li>
      <li>Great 4 traveling! ...</li>
      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>she mentioned how great it will be to take to summer camp this year.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush was a great gift for a teenager,  she loves it.  </li>
      <li>Comes in great colors.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a number of these as gifts and everyone who received them loved them.</li>
      <li>Ladies, it is a perfect fit in your clutch bag.</li>
      <li>A good toothbrush to carry with you for emergencies.  </li>
      <li>it came with as well as my own battery from home.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s handy and compact for travel.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it as it is a good size for traveling, didn&#x27;t need to be plugged in and compact and easy to put in a travel case.</li>
      <li>it is smaller,&lt;br /&gt;it is better than my Expectation,</li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush ...</li>
      <li>I love this TB.</li>
      <li>but this toothbrush makes my teeth very clean and smooth all day even though I suffer of plaque.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is fine for travel or convenience but don&#x27;t expect it to be anything close to a Sonicair because it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>I took the advise of others and purchased on size smaller in the waist fits great.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I&#x27;m going to brush with it all the time.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I want!!</li>
      <li>Works as well as my full size sonic brush.</li>
      <li>Good enough for a toothbrush</li>
      <li>(I also left the cap off of the top after the 1st week of using, to let it air out and avoid just this sort of thing!)</li>
      <li>I was happily surprised to find it has a strong vibration and seems to clean well.  </li>
      <li>Fun and useful for travel.  </li>
      <li>i liked the colors and it comes with extra toothbrush.</li>
      <li>For the price, it just isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>Right?</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a stylish, convenient sonic toothbrush, then look no further.</li>
      <li>I love it, especially at the $9.32 price!</li>
      <li>No bigger than most manual brushes, so it travels well.</li>
      <li>Zips fast just like a Sonicare! ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big enough to get a really good grip on it.  </li>
      <li>That is what anyone giving a gift wants.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>As we were traveling a lot I appreciated that the cap was vented.</li>
      <li>Does just what it says - better than manual brush for travel but not a Sonicare or similar professional for home use.</li>
      <li>I started trying to figure out how to clean it, but after thinking for a minute was too grossed out about putting that back in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>I liked this on vacation but the brush is too small and the power isn&#x27;t the level I like with my home electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>The sonic action is still pretty pleasing though.  </li>
      <li>However, after less than a month today I was rinsing the brush and saw something on the handle that wasn&#x27;t rinsing off, so I unscrewed the top...</li>
      <li>This is so much better than the little folding travel toothbrush I&#x27;ve been carrying.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even normally use an electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>I am wondering if I can purchase new brush heads and will have to look into that.</li>
      <li>I could buy new brush heads, but it&#x27;s bound to happen again.  </li>
      <li>Amazaon won&#x27;t send out a new item without receiving the old item that does not work.</li>
      <li>but really it&#x27;s just the entire thing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t vibrate at nearly a high enough frequency to actually clean your teeth like a Sonicare would, and the bristles are much lower quality than your standard toothbrush (after a few uses they&#x27;ll start to fall out), but if you use it as if it&#x27;s a standard toothbrush that adds a little vibration, it&#x27;s aight.</li>

<li> but, I needed something small and this toothbrush is smaller than my normal brush.</li>

<li> but I made due while on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Item will be returned, instead of replaced due to the time frame of my vacation plans.</li>
<li> After reading a few bad reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>

<li> Not cool.  </li>
<li> What a waste of time.</li>
<li> The brush head is not secure after a few uses.</li>

    <li> i liked the colors and it comes with extra toothbrush. I&#x27;ve also found refills for it online. It&#x27;s handy and compact for travel. My coworker uses hers for work</li>
    <li> I liked this on vacation but the brush is too small and the power isn&#x27;t the level I like with my home electric toothbrush but I made due while on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LS</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is fine for travel or convenience but don&#x27;t expect it to be anything close to a Sonicair because it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Fun and useful for travel.  We will see how long it last! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</li>
    <li> I was gone for a month in India and this toothbrush got me by! I don&#x27;t even normally use an electric toothbrush but, I needed something small and this toothbrush is smaller than my normal brush. I liked it so much I&#x27;m going to brush with it all the time. This is a must for both travel and regular use!</li>
    <li> The brush head is not secure after a few uses. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I took the advise of others and purchased on size smaller in the waist fits great. Color as ordered. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush ... The battery lasted 5.5 weeks while in Europe ... Zips fast just like a Sonicare! ... Great 4 traveling! ... Won&#x27;t leave home without it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the little folding travel toothbrush I&#x27;ve been carrying.  It&#x27;s big enough to get a really good grip on it.  And it fits into my purse just right.  Granted, the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action doesn&#x27;t come close to my other toothbrush but it&#x27;s 1/10 the price!!  The sonic action is still pretty pleasing though.  I should buy one for each purse so I don&#x27;t have to switch it everytime I switch purses!</li>
    <li> A good toothbrush to carry with you for emergencies.  Just a little larger and heavier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. After reading a few bad reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure but this toothbrush makes my teeth very clean and smooth all day even though I suffer of plaque.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a stylish, convenient sonic toothbrush, then look no further. Ladies, it is a perfect fit in your clutch bag. I love it, especially at the $9.32 price!</li>
    <li> Does just what it says - better than manual brush for travel but not a Sonicare or similar professional for home use. No bigger than most manual brushes, so it travels well. Will have to see how well the battery lasts.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I want!! Great !! It can also vibrate. It is like the addition to its value. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I was happily surprised to find it has a strong vibration and seems to clean well.  However, after less than a month today I was rinsing the brush and saw something on the handle that wasn&#x27;t rinsing off, so I unscrewed the top... the inside under the brush is hollow with a little rubber circle that is removable.

    <li> The bristles/ head should be what vibrates but really it&#x27;s just the entire thing.  Good enough for a toothbrush I keep in my purse.  Not sure I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had bad teeth,so I need something to clear it everyday,then I found it ...&lt;br /&gt;although it is smaller,&lt;br /&gt;it is better than my Expectation,</li>
    <li> Works as well as my full size sonic brush. I love this TB. Comes in great colors.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item! It was purchased for a vacation and upon receiving it, the item does not work. I tried the battery it came with as well as my own battery from home. What a waste of time. Amazaon won&#x27;t send out a new item without receiving the old item that does not work. Item will be returned, instead of replaced due to the time frame of my vacation plans.</li>
    <li> I purchased a number of these as gifts and everyone who received them loved them. That is what anyone giving a gift wants. Right?</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was a great gift for a teenager,  she loves it.  she mentioned how great it will be to take to summer camp this year.</li>
    <li> I used it on a 2 week trip to Spain. As we were traveling a lot I appreciated that the cap was vented. I am wondering if I can purchase new brush heads and will have to look into that. I would recommend it as it is a good size for traveling, didn&#x27;t need to be plugged in and compact and easy to put in a travel case.</li>
