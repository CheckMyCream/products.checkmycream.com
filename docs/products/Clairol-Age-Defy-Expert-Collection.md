<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Generally I&#x27;m leery of box color, but I&#x27;m starting a new job and am really self conscious about a giant patch of grays right around my face. I tried this in the medium blonde color. I didn&#x27;t use the pre-treatment thing, because any time I&#x27;ve ever used a color that has it, my hair just refuses to take the color. Within five minutes I saw my hair turn ashy, the way it would turn when I was a natural dark blonde with wet hair. Good, excellent, it seems to be working. It totally took out the brassy orange crap that the sun had faded my hair into, and my grays are nowhere to be found. Thanks for this, it&#x27;s a lifesaver when you&#x27;re in a pinch!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this and get rid of the gray hair!&lt;br /&gt;I found it super easy to use and all the items in the box were clearly labeled. (The gloves were a bit small for my big hands but with some work I got them on)&lt;br /&gt;It was very quick and easy to do. It took me 45 minutes from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;When I was done every last gray hair was covered. I used the #5 Medium Brown, I found it to be more of a dark brown then a medium brown and will use light brown next time. Other then the shade being dark it came out great.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Although when I relieved mine with the dye a but spilled, it still worked! I don&#x27;t have any grey hairs, but it did cover up the faded purple that I was having. I would totally recommend this product! I don&#x27;t know about purchasing online because it might spill like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my product for free as a sample test, but all my opinions are my own honest opinions.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard advocate of using salon quality professional hair dyes. Usually it is the only thing that will cover my stubborn grays. I&#x27;m almost always hesitant to use boxed dyes because I have never had much luck. I usually would always end up with spotty coverage that never lasted long. I decided to give Clairol Expert Collection Age Defy a shot since I have gotten sick of hunting down my previous dyes at professional supply stores or dishing out big bucks to have it done at a salon. I am soooo thankful to have tried this and boy was I pleasantly surprised. To begin with there is a Pantene ProV Age Defy Smoothing Pre-Treatment that reallllly makes a difference. You apply it to all of your hair while avoiding the roots. Then you have your usual dye treatment that you mix in a squirt bottle. My ONLY issue with this product is that I felt the dye was a bit &amp;#34;soupy&amp;#34;. It was a really runny consistency and it made it hard to keep it from running down onto my skin.I would really like to see this product revised and maybe brought to a creamy consistency that will stay on my scalp. Overall GREAT gray coverage. I really feel like the pre-treatment made a difference in the texture of my hair, it was super smooth and shiny once I washed, used the ProV Color Seal Conditioning Therapy and blow-dried my hair. My hair has never looked this good AND it has never been this CHEAP! I LOVE IT. You got it right Clairol! *This product was provided to me free for testing, all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> My hair looks the same.  I still have grays! I&#x27;m only 36, there isn&#x27;t much age to defy. :(</li>
    <li> I love it! The color is darker than I normally have but I think it looks fantastic! And I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments! And it was super easy to do! I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised, easy to work with. Hair feels so soft after use.</li>
    <li> Great product - my hair has a uniform color and a great deal of shine.  I also liked the scent, which is often overpowering for home hair color.</li>
    <li> This covered all gray well, the color was even and rich. I prefer this over all other brands.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. It was easy to use and I loved the color</li>
    <li> I have used Clairol products before but this was the first time I tried the Age Defy Experts Collections.  I loved it.  It was easy to use, covered all my gray and is a great color.  It really made my hair soft and silky after use.  The extra step really makes a difference.  A week later and my hair is still soft and silky.  Will definitely use this product again!  I received the product free to test and review it.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try the hair color as part of a sampling campaign. The color was darker than my regular color shade that I prefer - but I must admit that I like the rich chocolate brown - it covers all gray and leaves hair evenly colored and natural looking.  I really like the pre treatment and the conditioning therapy product...and I truly liked that the color did not drip all over and that it rinsed out easily - the results are awesome and leave hair in great condition! I tested the product for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample of clairol age defy color, from influenster. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I expect a good product from clairol and this did not disappoint. The product was easy to use and provided excellent gray coverage. In addition my hair felt softer than it has in a long time. My hair was so shiny, even my husband noticed! I like the color, though it is a little darker than I had expected and that is the only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> It made my hair soft and got rid of my grey hair, will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I was chosen as a sample group to try this product and I must say I am thoroughly impressed. I have not used a boxed color on my hair before to cover the grays and be happy with it. Will definitely be buying this one in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy M. (Am using my husband&#x27;s acct. to post this)</li>
    <li> I received the Clairol Expert Age Defy Medium Brown Hair Colors for free.   I did not pay for it.  I was asked to review the product.  I really enjoyed using the hair color.  I liked the precondition treatment.  It felt wonderful when I applied it to my hair.  It made applying the hair color easy.  I expected a strong odor but it smelled wonderful.  It washed out really easy and the conditioner provided for after rinsing out the hair color was wonderful.  There is more conditioner to use when I wash my hair the next few times.  My hair feels so soft and smells wonderful.  I would use the product again and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> It was one of the best hair color products I have ever used. It made my hair so soft and fluffy. I would recommend this product to my friends. Most hair colors have a bad smell, but this product was really not bad at all. It covered the gray really well. I was very impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> I never use store-bought hair color. I color at home using ION products, just like some salons use. I was chosen to try this from a sampling program and thought what can I lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ease of use of this product was a bit different as you have to put some kind of gel on prior to the actual color. Other than that, it&#x27;s just as easy as any other product. The smell was nice, didn&#x27;t burn the eyes. The color itself was nice initially, I find after a week it&#x27;s kind of bland already, no shine left. What I do not like about this is my hair has felt very heavy ever since I used it. The day of washing, it&#x27;s perfect. The next day, very heavy and appears as though it&#x27;s been several days since washing. My hair has never done that before. I will stick to coloring with ION products.</li>
    <li> I received this dye as part of a sampling program.  I loved how soft and shiny it made my hair - it looked in much better condition afterward, when usually I need a few days and the application of a deep conditioner before my hair recovers.  Also did a very good job covering my grays.  I don&#x27;t have a lot, but what I do have are stubborn.  However, the color turned out much much darker where I used the pretreatment application.  My roots are a gorgeous brown, but my ends are a dull black.  I&#x27;m hoping it fades because this color is a deal-breaker.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It did exactly what it said it would and covered all my grays even at my roots.  It was super easy to apply and actually made my hair feel healthier and softer.</li>
    <li> Love this and have stocked up! I have used shade 5 Medium Brown on my naturally dark brown hair, it&#x27;s a great match. My hair has a glossy shine to it. The gray coverage stays all month. I am not &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; on top any more. Hair feels soft and healthy for weeks not just after I have colored. This one is a winner.</li>
    <li> I liked the color that it gave me but it didn&#x27;t cover all of my gray. I would probably use it Asian though.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!  The color is rich full of complementary tones.  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I used this and the color is as great as day 1 and still as soft!  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair doesn&#x27;t seem as shiny.....not any  more!  This will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the look of this product.  It covered my gray and made my hair soft and shiny.  The vibrant color was evenly spread over my shoulder length hair.  Using the pre-treatment helped reduce the frizz.  I really like this product, and will definitely use it again.    This product was sent to me as a complimentary product to test and review.  I was not paid for this review.</li>
    <li> I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review. I was excited to receive my box so I used the product this evening. It has left my hair soft, manageable and covered the gray totally. *note that I had minimum gray at the root area*  However its gone now. Make sure if this is the first time that you use it, read all instructions carefully because the first step is new and I almost missed it, thinking it was like other home colors. This is a must try.. Have fun, life&#x27;s more fun with color.. :)  This product was tested by me no cost, but all opinions are my own..</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of the med. brown and it gave my hair great coverage. I had few grays but it covered them very well. It gave my hair nice shine and the conditioner made my hair soft. I like this product!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; This color was very easy to use. I liked the color and how it left my hair feeling healthy and smooth. The smell of the color was pleasant as well. Not the usual chemical smell. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color.  Great gray coverage, and it seems to last longer than other types I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Easy to use and love that the gloves that were included were not cheap . Mixing the color was very simple and there was ample product for my extremely long hair. It gave great coverage to my grays and left my hair feeling silky and smooth. VERY pleased and will definitely be purchasing this in the future. A great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Just got this in my voxbox for free. I will definitely be purchasing this dye. It was easy to use and my hair looks and feels great. I have used other products that have dried out my hair and made it frizzy. This Clair of Age Defying color is a must have.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; Dear Ladies&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to thanks Clairol for this free product and it was so easy to use and I would definitely recommend this product to all my girlfriends with grey hairs as it covers them all up.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have small stubborn grays around my hairline that even dyes that claim to have 100% gray coverage don&#x27;t cover...but this one does! My hair has been getting a lot drier/breaking more since I turned 40 and this made my hair so much softer and smoother! The color looks great and natural and was easy to apply even for someone as bad at using hair color as me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product to cover stubborn grays!  I am starting to get grays around my hairline that are very coarse.  This product made my hair feel very soft and it was very easy to use and apply to my hair.  The only thing I will do differently next time is use a lighter color.  I thought for a medium brown it was a little too dark.  I tried this product as part of a sample, at no cost, but the opinion of the product is my own.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for about 25 years and I have always had problems with my hair drying out. This product did not do that! I love it! The instructions were easy. The gloves in the kit were the nice professional gloves, not the plastic ones that rip. The product itself was not super smelly. It made my hair smooth and shiny and it is not dry! I tested this product at no cost and all opinions are my own. But I will be buying this product in the future!</li>
    <li> I got this box from Influenster.  I am pretty surprised and happy that this got rid of my greys.  There are not many products that do, but as soon as I got out of the shower, that was the first thing I checked for, and no more grey! Very pleased :)  Thanks Influenster and Clairol!</li>
    <li> Love the color, leave the hair  shiny and softly,  will be perfect if it has a price more affordable.</li>
    <li> I tested this product and it was pretty good. My hair is very soft but it is not as easy as the products that use the foam dye. If they were to turn this product into a foam dye than I think they would have a winner. It was covered my grey very nicely.</li>
    <li> I received Clairol Age defy as a sample to review - I love the coverage of my gray and the ease of use. I love the way my hair feels so silky soft. Clairol Age Defy is my choice of hair color from now on!</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it had great coverage of grays and left hair feeling silky and healthy.I was able to try this product for fre but would definitely purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I expected a color close to medium golden brown, but was surprised when it turned out dark brown.  It did cover up the gray hair though.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Great color that covered my gray easily.  Left my hair soft and shiny!  Will definitely be using this brand again!</li>
    <li> I received this color free from Influenster and it was very easy to use, covered the minimal grey they I am starting to get. It was a beautiful brown once done.</li>
    <li> I really love how shiny and soft this makes my hair feel. I hadn&#x27;t used hair coloring in awhile because I&#x27;ve had disappointments from other companies, but no disappointment here! It was so easy to use and is a great brown color. I received it as a sample, and I&#x27;m glad I did because it really worked well. It had great color and silky shiny hair after.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  I&#x27;ve always been afraid to color my hair, it&#x27;s thin and not very long.  I received AgeDefy from Influenster for free and decided to give it a try, mostly because the color was so close to mine own natural color.  Wow!  My hair has never had such a shine without the use of oils, my hair did get slightly lighter but the big difference was the shine.  My hair is always either dull and dry looking or shiny but greasy looking, well now I have a healthy bouncy shiny head of beautiful brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Though I received this product free for testing the review and results are true and my own.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many hair color brands, but I always come back to Clairol. They are consistent in the quality of all their products. The Clairol Expert Age Defy formula for hair color is another fine product in their line. They have partnered with Pantene Pro-V to improve the texture and feel of the hair after the coloring. After your patch test, you apply a Smoothing Pre-treatment to your dry hair, focusing on the ends, then you apply the actual color. Using the pre-treatment is what I think made the color turn out so beautiful. There was an evident tonality, with even shine and color. The color is rich and gorgeous. My hair looked and felt great. There was absolutely no sign of any grey hair, The best part to me was that my hair was so soft and smooth. In Louisiana there is often 100% humidity, causing hair to frizz. After applying this color, there was little to no frizz. I can definitely recommend this product for permanent color that makes the hair look rejuvenated, healthy, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to use and review, however I only recommend a product if I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I used it on a friends hair and she loves it.  It covers the gray very well and does not have a harsh smell.  I liked that it has a pretreatment for gray hair, it helps the color to grab on the stubborn gray hair and hold.  The conditioner that comes with the kit is very nice and a big size that will last your for a while.  This is a nice color if you want to cover grays and you use a permanent color.</li>
    <li> Great product and great value. It has lasting power</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample to try and was very pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. I have only had my hair colored twice before and had never done it by myself, so was a little hesitant. The instructions were very clear and the product was very easy to apply. I am also extremely odor sensitive, so was afraid of this aspect since the other times I had my hair colored I had a severe headache for days afterwards. This product had very little chemical odor and I had no negative effects. It does a very good job covering the gray totally and left my hair feeling healthy and very soft. The only negative thing I could find about the product at all is that the medium brown is much darker than I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I used Clairol Expert Collection Age Defy Hair Color kit in medium brown to help cover my gray strands. This product worked beautifully, my hair color is vibrant and all gray strands covered. This product was simple to use. Everything you need is included. thirty five minutes to shiny, soft and manageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was super thrilled to try this at home.  Saving lots of money by not having to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> I used to use Clairol Hydrience and loved it but they stopped producing it. So I usually used Loreal Excellence which worked ok but my hair grows fast and I guess I was looking for a miracle to not have to do it every 3 weeks for the gray roots. Well, this didn&#x27;t even cover the gray fully and I left it on for 45 minutes. Why call it AgeDefy when it won&#x27;t even cover the gray. Waste of money and time doing it. Now I&#x27;m trying to wait a full 3 weeks at least but it sucks seeing all the gray!</li>
    <li> Really good color and it holds well</li>
    <li> I received this amazing product to try out for VoxBox and am amazed at the gray coverage I got from a single use.  This product not only covered the gray but also softened the wiry feel of my gray hair.  Normally my daughter helps me apply my hair color products, however, this was easy enough for me to apply by myself.  The coverage lasted much longer than any other I have used. This is definitely my go to color now!!</li>
    <li> I got this from Influence and was chosen to try this product for free. It works great! Beautiful color and looks great! It is very professional looking.</li>
    <li> This has been the only color that was able to completely cover my previously bleached hair.  My hair feels wonderful after using this product.  I did not have gray hair so I can not speak on that, but my natural color is back!</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say I was not impressed at all with the Clairol Expert Age Defy Hair Color I tried.  I did not feel it gave me the soft, conditioning I normally get with other home hair colors and it did not cover my gray hair as much as I have gotten from previous home hair colorings....Just was not what I expected from Clairol and not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite haircolor as of now. It covers the grey very well, and lasts longer than the other name brands. I had switched over exclusively to this one and recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be superior to other similar products.  It did not have an obnoxious smell, steps were easy to follow and it left my hair natural looking and shiny.</li>
    <li> I received this kit as a trial on bzz agent.  It worked beautifully on my hair.  It left my hair extremely soft and the color was perfect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair color.  Chose Medium Golden Brown and it is so natural, didnt EVER smell like chemicals and is just so perfect no one knows what&#x27;s different just that something is different.  If I could I would shout out to the ladies all over the world to use this product because it is the best.  Love, love, love it.  Oh by the way I got it free from bzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. I was pleased with the natural looking results and the way that this hair dye didn&#x27;t damage my hair. It comes with a special pre-dye conditioning treatment that prepares your hair to absorb the color and reduce damage. My hair felt silky after the treatment.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from Influenstr and I can say in the heart of winter, it was a clear mood booster. I&#x27;d stopped coloring my hair as it&#x27;s mostly white and gray and very difficult to color. My daughter helped me, to ensure I got coverage in areas that were hard to reach and might be overlooked. I also would have chosen a lighter shade as I&#x27;m an older woman and was fearful the color (very close to my original coloring) would be too harsh and fake-looking. The serum felt good which was a first and we remarked on it&#x27;s unusual nature. Because I chose to have help I can&#x27;t speak to ease of putting it on, though it seemed no more difficult than when I did it and we had a pleasant time together. Rinsing it out was easy and a bit tingly, which again in the middle of a blizzard was kinda fun. When dried, the coverage was great, and my hair felt wonderful. I hadn&#x27;t realized how much better I felt about myself, and took the rare photos (before and after) and posted to my Facebook personal page for all my friends and fans to see. I waited a day (and it&#x27;s actually two) to write the review because I wanted to see how it wore. Often within days the color will fade or disappear. The color has not faded, but I do have about a quarter inch of roots showing. Brazen white ones. Perhaps a touch up for inbetween. I don&#x27;t know if the color \\&quot;wore off\\&quot; or it actually encouraged my tresses to sprout and be more luscious again. But that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s four stars. I do like they provided more conditioner, perhaps a touch up between colorings would be nice- or a kit. But I would recommend this for my friends, my hair feels good, and the color looks good and mostly natural (as natural as a 57 year old woman can be with dark hair!)</li>
    <li> This product had great gray coverage. I love the tones and will be using it again. I received a free sample and look forward to purchasing it for my next coloring.</li>
    <li> Great product. Covered my greys and gave me a even color.</li>
    <li> Update: had my hair cut recently and my stylist asked what I&#x27;m using for color. She said she could see  highlights and the color is so rich it looks like a chocolate bar. I use #5, Medium Brown. Beautiful color!  I&#x27;ve been using Garnier Nutrisse for many years but thought I&#x27;d try this Age Defy. As a woman of a certain age I sometimes wonder if the term Age Defy is just a marketing ploy. Wrong! This hair color is really great! My color looks natural, it has the body it used to have, and it feels so soft! They have found a secret here as this color is SO much better than what I&#x27;ve been using. I signed up for the Amazon subscription so I&#x27;ll be getting it at a great price every month. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I used this dye last night, Dark Brown, and feel like I&#x27;ve finally found a product that I will stick with and keep on using! I have to admit that I try lots of different dyes trying to find the one. I actually do not prefer Clairol Nice n Easy because it just didn&#x27;t do the trick with covering my gray. That being said I LOVE this color and how it looks and feels. It&#x27;s only been a day but I&#x27;m already to stock up on it and stick with it. I&#x27;ll update if anything goes crazy bus so far so good. Love It!!</li>
    <li> I got this product to try free from buzz agent. I received the color darkest brown. I used it and love it! My grays are gone all of them! My hair is soft and shiny silky and smooth! The color is a great match to my hair. The product smells good its not to strong or stinky like other dyes. I will buy this monthly and i recomend this to anyone who has grays any age if you have a few or a bunch. It really does work on even stubborn grays.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with dye in the past making my hair too dark and not adequately covering the roots. After drying my hair color was almost identical to the box color and my roots were completely covered. Note that I have my own special application - I do not drench my hair in dye for the last 5 minutes after the roots have processed. Once the roots are finished I get in the shower, wet my hair slightly and massage the existing color. Next I poor extra color from the bottle into the palm of my hand and massage it throught.  I leave the diluted product in for 5 minutes and rinse.  I do this with all brands. After washing and conditioning with the tube in the box this dye left my hair feeling kind of strange. It was thicker which I liked but it could have been softer.  I will definately use this brand again but I will experiment with another conditioner. I did not care for the one included in the box and I knocked a star off for that.</li>
    <li> Gray Solution is becoming more difficult to find so I am guessing that it is being discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a similar pretreatment so I thought that maybe Gray Solution was just being rebranded. This doesn&#x27;t cover grays nearly as well as Gray Solution.  It also isn&#x27;t the same color wise. With Gray Solution, I was using two shades lighter than my natural shade. It was as if the hair took the dye too well. With the Age defy, the same shade, light brown was too red and didn&#x27;t cover. I just dyed a second time with medium ash brown. I might have to go another round with dark brown but now it looks halfway decent at least. I will wait a few days to check fading and the color.</li>
    <li> When I used this product, I was surprised at how dark it was. I waited a while to review it because I wanted to give it time to see if it would fade or turn brassy as other products have done. It has faded a bit - but only JUST ENOUGH. At first it was too dark, but it has settled into a nice color that has received many compliments! Even better, my grays are covered just as well as the rest, and they have remained covered for the 5 weeks since I first applied the product.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, my hair felt soft and amazing, but I will say that it has felt a little more coarse since using this product. It still appears healthy (in fact, to my surprise I DID look younger after use!), but it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it did before. This is generally true with any hair color, though. If you are looking for an affordable color with reliable gray coverage, this is a great one to try!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for a fair review.</li>
    <li> I received this hair coloring complimentary from Clairol to try and I am so glad I did.  I have unruly, curly, frizzy, dry, dull hair which is at least 60 percent gray. I used Age Defy and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair!  It is soft and smooth with no gray, the color is rich, and my hair is shiny!  It looks like it did 20 years ago!  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I like the packaging colors, the sturdy gloves, and the instructions were clear. The pre-color treatment was new and different although I would have appreciated more information about what it is and its purpose. I mixed the dye and like the scent- not too strong like some others. I left it on 5-10 minutes more than the recommended time amount because of some of the reviews about it not covering grays effectively. It stayed in place and did not drip at all. I liked the orangey color of the formula so I could easily see if I was missing and spots on my dark hair. I had good results on coverage with no grays visible afterwards so I would definitely use this again. I received this from Influenster at no charge to review.</li>
    <li> Really loved this complimentary  product. I usually get my hair done at the salon but this made my hair feel great &amp; did really well covering my grays.</li>
    <li> I received my hair color from Influenster. I was excited to give the hair color a try. My first opinion was the fact that the directions were clear, simple and extremely easy to follow, especially the fact that each piece in the box was lettered and/or numbered. However, I am not at all pleased with the end result. My hair has only one tone, no color dimension at all. It is really a drab brown and can&#x27;t wait till it washes ouy.</li>
    <li> I received the Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection 5 Medium Brown to try from Influenster. As I get older, gray hairs on the side by ears has been increasing. In the past with other brands, I would dye it and only those hairs on the side would not be colored. With this product, there was more gray coverage. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  The smell is great love the pre conditioner.  My hair is so soft and all my grey is gone.  This is my new hair color!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cover my gray as well as I expected.I think the pre-treatment was too thick and hinders the color development.Perhaps I used too much.I will try this color again and give it another chance.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used Clairol&#x27;s Color Blend Foam and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;This week I tried a free sample from Clairol of their new line of Clairol Age Defy hair coloring and must say that I am not disappointed in my transition from my previous product to this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The pretreatment (put on dry hair) smelled lovely.&lt;br /&gt;2. The applicator bottle made it so easy to apply color directly to my roots, without drips.&lt;br /&gt;3. The kit contained contained an entire tube of Color Seal Conditioning Therapy (conditioner) to use following my next several shampoos to keep hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;4. The entire process time was 25 minutes and did a terrific job of covering grey (3/4&amp;#34;) roots, matching my previous light brown color seamlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this new product to anyone who wants to cover stubborn greys with a drip-free application!</li>
    <li> I received this free to try and review as a bzzagent. I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray hair yet, but I don&#x27;t want any at all, so I want to cover whatever gray I get right away. I have used other hair color in the past and I always love my hair&#x27;s softness after the initial dye &amp; then it is usually gone soon. I have to say that my hair still looks &amp; feels great weeks later. I love the pre-treatment conditioner and it has a pleasant scent. I really like this product, but I am not fond of the metal foil packaging tube used. Other than that, I am very pleased. I am loving my hair! The color, softness, and beauty lasts!</li>
    <li> Clairol Expert Age Defy home hair coloring kit works THE BEST of any that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clairol has done it right !  You start with a pre-color conditioner that readies your hair for coloring.. It left my hair feeling as good as a deep conditioning treatment.  The color in the tube is very thick- be careful as it does take some force to squeeze it into  the developer. The blend is somewhat thin- make sure you have a towel on your shoulders and  something on your sink to catch drips. The \\&quot;color-lock\\&quot; moisturizer at the end is the perfect cap- your hair smells great, and feels silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that they color was true to the box, All of my grey was covered completely- even the stubborn ones at the temple area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 weeks later- I have shampooed 4 times, used hair styling products and my gray is still covered, my hair still feels soft, silky and the color had not faded at all. I was fortunate to try this product free through BzzAgent- but I will be sticking with it because it works great !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy with this purchase  &#x3D; it really works !!</li>
    <li> I tried it, wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it.  but WOW!  awesome color, exactly what I was looking for.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try for free. I was a little nervous because I have never used this particular kind before. There were several things that I really liked about this hair color: 1) the pre-color serum made my hair really soft,  2) the gloves were better than most and fit well, 3) the color was warm and rich-looking, 4) my hair looks younger! It covered well and the color on the box was very close to the color my hair ended up being. All in all, a great product that I would recommend and use again.</li>
    <li> I have brown hair with some gray at the temples that is very resistant to color.  I was so hopeful that this product would take care of all the gray.  The instructions are easy to follow and not that different from so many home products. It did not cover all of my gray. It did cover most of it.  Why some was not colored I don&#x27;t know.  The non-colored gray was covered with the product as long as the other gray.  And the medium brown came out darker than I like. However that could just be that my hair took the color really well.  I did not leave the color on longer than specified in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did make the gray hair smooth versus the wiry it is naturally.  And my hair is shiny.</li>
    <li> I have very dark brown hair with a LOT of grays around the temples that just don&#x27;t seem to go away when I color.  This product has been the best, by far, at covering my grays without being too harsh on my hair.</li>
    <li> Best self coloring system I have ever used.  Covers grey, easy to use, no harsh smell!</li>
    <li> I used Light Brown #6, while it blends in beautifully with my hair it only successfully covered about 50% of my grays/whites - and I followed the directions exactly! I will have to try with yet another permanent hair dye of a different company next weekend to get my stubborn whites *hopefully* completely covered.&lt;br /&gt;I will say one good thing - this product does keep hair soft and minimizes damage.</li>
    <li> Boy I couldn&#x27;t believe how my hair felt after I used the Age Defying color by Clairol. Amazing. My hair was soft even before it dried. Then after my hair was not only extremely soft and silky but the shine was tremendous. I love this producy and will continue to recommend it and use it every time.. Thank you</li>
    <li> I use Nice and Easy hair dye all the time and always use this shade. Found the Age Defy Expert hairdye to be absolutely useless. A waste of money and a waste of 45 minutes of my time. My hair is shiny and silky but still has the same grey hairs i had when I started especially around the crown. A hairdye is useless if it doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do ie cover grey hair.</li>
    <li> This product covered my gray hair better than any previous product has and it&#x27;s lasting really well. I suspect that it is the pre-treatment that allows it to work so well. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I tried this hair color last week and I just love it.  I received it free to try and evaluate.  I was very impressed with this product.  There is a pretreatment to use first and then apply hair color.  This is the first product I have used that did not drip or run.  There is a conditioner included which smells amazing.  This product covered my stubborn greys at the hairline and did not leave my hair corse or brittle.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a L&#x27;Oreal Preference or Excellence user for over 20 years. I was noticing this past year that the color (5 - Medium Brown) wasn&#x27;t holding as long. A couple of washes and the color was really fading, especially at the new growth. I decided to try this Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection in the same 5-Medium Brown. I&#x27;ve just done my second coloring (I have fast growing hair and have to color every 3 weeks) and thought I&#x27;d share my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - excellent color match to my existing L&#x27;Oreal 5-Medium Brown. No discernible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - amazing gray coverage. I&#x27;m a natural medium blonde and am getting some silver growth. This covered both blonde and silver equally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - color was much less messy than L&#x27;Oreal. It stayed put and didn&#x27;t drip easily. Rather thick in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - leaves my hair feeling amazingly soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 - WARNING! This color is potent! With L&#x27;Oreal I never had staining on my skin around my hairline. The little bit that was there, it was easily removed with soap/water. Not so with Clairol! Be very careful, especially if you have fair skin (like I do). The first time I colored my hair, I had a devil of a time attempting to remove the color around my hairline. It took about 4 days for it to finally fade/wash out. The second time I colored, I smeared a very thin layer of Vaseline around my hairline and that did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 - I know you&#x27;re not supposed to use this on your eyebrows (according to the instructions), but I&#x27;m a blond and blond eyebrows with dark hair look ridiculous. Therefore, I apply this also to my eyebrows. I noticed that even my eyebrows have stayed darker longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 - I mentioned to a friend that I had switched from L&#x27;Oreal Preference to Clairol Age Defy, and she said she was experiencing the very same thing with L&#x27;Oreal that I noticed -- the color didn&#x27;t seem to be staying true as long. So, it wasn&#x27;t just me thinking that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using this Clairol hair color in lieu of L&#x27;Oreal. Never thought I&#x27;d switch brands, but Clairol has come out with a superior product and I&#x27;m sold.r color in lieu of L&#x27;Oreal. Never thought I&#x27;d switch brands, but Clairol has come out with a superior product and I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I will never change back to my old hair dye that I thought I loved but once I tried this it was absolutely amazing. It covered all my stubborn grey plus colored all my hair evenly it even made my hair silky soft, which I have very frizzy hair anyways. I would recommend to any one who has stubborn grey hairs and wants a natural shiny look. 😊</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions of Medium Ash Brown and after the final blow dry and straighten my hair indeed was looking fab and feeling soft and &#x27;young again&#x27; as I&#x27;d hoped it would (I&#x27;m 39 and have longish dark hair) ...I hoped even more for 100% grey coverage on my dark hair however was quite disappointed, a lot of my grey hair isn&#x27;t visible when my long hair is loose but there is a LOT of greys in my thick hair and a lot of those simply had not even been touched by the dye. I am wondering if it might be due to me not applying it as well as I could have?  To be fair other dye makes touting the 100% coverage failed me before so maybe my method is flawed or my greys too thick??&lt;br /&gt;I love the colour, I liked the pre-application cream and how thick and non messy the dye cream was and my hair really has come out lovely shiny and soft so I&#x27;m going to buy another pack tomorrow and apply it more carefully to catch the rest of the greys. Normally I use a product called Root Touch Up which is really good at getting all my greys and keeping them hidden until root growth appears but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look conditioned and nice like this one has, hence I am in two minds about this dye.</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair with different brands for years,this was first time I felt like I had a reaction to a hair dye,would never buy again but the color was great...</li>
    <li> Horrible stuff - turned my scalp and hair orange.  Used the medium blond.  And did not defy frizz, etc. etc</li>
    <li> My hair is soft and shiny.  Gray coverage good.  The medium brown color is natural looking.  I will be waiting to see how long it will last.  At this point, day 2, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> 8/23 - What a waste.  I normally do Dark brown in at home hair colors (have used diff brands).  Wanted to try something a tad lighter and with gray coverage, so I bought this - Medium brown - 5.    My hair is soft &amp; shiny, but the color is dark.  Too dark.  Darker than Clairol Root Touch Up Dark Brown which I normally buy.  Same company but colors are completely off.    Will have to see how this holds up with washing, but am not happy with the color.  Same company, but different color descriptions and am totally frustrated.  Won&#x27;t buy this again simply because of the color mis-cue.    8/24 - A day later and I&#x27;ve had a chance to check my roots - yep, still gray.  Not the coverage they promote.  Hair still soft and shiny, but when the color is not as advertised, the purchase is a bust.  Not only did I not get lighter as I had desired, but now I&#x27;ve got a color darker than my norm.  Embarassing.    Will stick with Clairol Root Touch Up for color - at least it is as advertised color wise.  This Clairol product is not worth the extra few bucks when the color is so off.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m only in my late 30&#x27;s and I gray on the sides and on top pretty bad. When I use this stuff, it blends the color to the rest of my head, it doesn&#x27;t turn my gray to a lighter brown like most other color systems. This really does color those &amp;#34;very stubborn&amp;#34; grays!!!!  I would recommend this product to anyone that has those really stubborn grays!</li>
    <li> Very very disappointed. I am a 50 years old. I am half Japanese and I have fine hair. It did not cover my grays. It left my fair dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I really like this package.  It comes with a pretreatment creme to help activate the color.  It also has a large, reclosable tube of conditioner.  (Of course it also has the reagent bottles and the handy-dandy non-latex gloves.  With once a week uses, the tube will easily last 4-6 weeks between colors.  I&#x27;ve colored my hair for many years, and I&#x27;m not getting any younger, so I decided to buy the &amp;#34;Age-Defy&amp;#34; formula.  I honestly don&#x27;t think my hair looks any younger, but it certainly has a rich color and is soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells like ammonia but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle like it usually does after I color it.  It takes quite a while to activate.  The directions say to do a &amp;#34;strand test&amp;#34; or to leave it in for 35 minutes.  Let&#x27;s face it, nobody does the strand test.  You can plan on the coloring process taking about an hour from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this product is that Miss Clairol and I have a general disagreement on what should be considered &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; brown.  It&#x27;s quite a bit darker than I expected- definitely darker than the box.  It looks nice, but I shifted to to light brown on subsequent applications.  Also, the coverage isn&#x27;t that great, I have rather long hair and I probably should have opted for two packages for first time application.  One is good for touch-up applications.</li>
    <li> First of all I am a BzzAgent, and I received the product free to sample and review. so I was really looking forward to this product.  I received the medium brown color. I was expecting to get way better results with the new pre application part before actually applying the color.  My grays could just really be stubborn. I have never really had complete gray coverage with any brand.  Some of the grays got colored but were more just tinted so you could still tell which ones were gray because they were much lighter than the rest of my hair color.  For overall color coverage it did get good results.  I just didn&#x27;t think it did great for my gray coverage!  I would probably still purchase the product again, just to see if I still get the same result.  The overall color lasted a good two weeks before I started to notice my gray more!!  If you don&#x27;t have any grays or very few, then you should definitely try this product.  I just have too many grays to be covered!  Oh and would have liked a bigger tube of the pre cream,  I needed a little more to really get it saturated.  #GotItFree #iamaBzzAgent #Clairol</li>
    <li> I got a free sample today to test of Clairol Age Defy 5 Medium Brown. Love this product! I  Colored my roots and to the middle of my head. I really like the way my hair came out. Looks  ombre! It covered the white hair that I do have on the middle top of my hair. Didn&#x27;t have much white hair but it did the job.I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> I usually require 2 boxes b/c I have long hair - but this one box did the trick and had great coverage even for the grays!!! I will def be buying this again :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product, especially the pre-treatment serum that you apply to dry hair before coloring. The instructions on the pre-treatment were a little confusing, but all other instructions were clear and easy to follow. The color had to process a full 35 minutes, which is a little longer than I&#x27;m used to, but an extra few minutes are definitely worth it if the color lasts longer as advertised. I love how shiny and smooth my hair is afterward, and the color has remained very natural looking through 3 shampoos so far with complete gray coverage.  I also like the extra conditioning treatment included, with enough to last several weeks for after shampoo treatments. Influenster provided me this complimentary box for testing and review.  Now after several weeks my color still looks fresh and shiny. I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It covered all my gray in one application.  It did not have the horrible smell like most hair dyes.  It was easy to use and my hair felt and looked great.  Will definitely be buying this from now on.  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I have tried many at home dyes over the past 20 years and have recently transitioned to the grey coverage products....I must say that this one deserves the name &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34;....my hair is soft, shiny, bouncy, grey covered, and the color is rich and vibrant a week later! The price is right too. I checked it here and at the store. Please note, however, that I tried this as an complimentary sample product. The opinion stated though is all mine and I will now be purchasing the product on my own! :)</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure of the purpose of the gel that you had to apply first.  the smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as other hair colors but it still was a little strong to me.  i loved the way my hair felt after rinsing and conditioning with the pantene pro v conditioner.  the color was a little darker than i had anticipated but  overall i was pleased with my experience.</li>
    <li> I received my Age Defy hair color and used it. I love the color and it really covered all my grays!! It didn&#x27;t smell like your typical hair color. It was more like a cream and went on easily and didn&#x27;t drip. Now lets see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product complimentary to test and review from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I was tired of running to the salon and forking out so much money to color my hair every couple of months, so I received a free sample and decided to try it out (all opinions are my own). This product did a great job of covering my old color which had grown out since summer. It really freshened up the hue without making it look obvious. I had a bad experience at the last salon and was left with a blue tint to my highlights. I tried covering it with color shampoo, but that couldn&#x27;t even take care of it. The Age Defy in medium brown did the trick. I&#x27;ll be anxious to see how it lasts and if the nasty blue returns, but for now it&#x27;s done a great job. My hair feels soft and bouncy. Since I have very fine hair, it&#x27;s nice to have a little volume. Also, the product was super easy to use. I was a little nervous beforehand, but followed the directions and it was simple. I will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> Just started to get some greys now that I am approaching 40 and thought I would give it a try.  Received as a promotion from  influenster and glad I did.  Left my hair feeling nice and soft.  Can&#x27;t say yet on how long the color will last since mine usually fades pretty fast but I will update my review in a couple of weeks.  Next time I may try a lighter shade for the summer!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Clairol Expert Age Defy Hair color for review. I have gray hair around my face and top of head and it completely covered the pesky gray. The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and not brittle. It looks as good as when I get it done in the salon.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I am not a fan of most boxed colors, but I really like this.</li>
    <li> I would like to say I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes ,but will be giving my honest opinion. First I will say I have long ,thick,coarse hair with moderate grey. I loved this clairol age defy hair color !!! It turned my dry coarse hair into silk...got rid of all my greys and even made them soft ,now that&#x27;s saying something LOL . It really did make my hair look and feel like it did in my 20&#x27;s I am now 46 !! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with mature hair,I give this 5 stars because it covers grey,makes hair soft and shiny and is easy to use,it also smells nice,no strong odor like some have. Give it a try ...you will be glad you did !! I will be using this from here on out !!!</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that it did not have the same horrible smell as other products.  My hair feels better than it ever has after coloring. The age defying step took no time.  I colored my hair between jobs one morning, it was that easy.  I have short hair with gray near the temples. So I started my color there.  It was thick and didn&#x27;t drip. Any that got on my skin wiped off easily. The only trouble was getting all of the product out of the tube, there has to be an easier way! I really liked the conditioner. A very generous amount! With short hair, I should have enough to condition every time I shampoo(about 3 times a week). All of my gray is covered and the color does not look flat or harsh.</li>
    <li> *I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review.*&lt;br /&gt;I have had the hardest time finding a haircolor that colors those pesky grays and is uniform in color. I had lightened my hair due to the gray(actually white!) hair that I have. This product has an awesome pre-treatment that you apply before the hair color, that I think helped to coat my hair and give it even coverage. It had a pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t knock you out or smell the house up and the after treatment makes your hair feel like silk!! I would definitely suggest this to any of my friends or family - just an fyi, if you have longer, thicker hair, invest in more than one box!! &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good for: Made My Hair Feel Soft, Tones &amp; Highlights, Natural-looking Color, Gray Coverage</li>
    <li> I got this product free to review from Influenster. I would recommend this product. It&#x27;s probably not a color I would have chosen for myself, but it is a nice color. My hair naturally has a lot of variation in color from blonde to medium brown. I like that there is still a variation even with great coverage. I would have given a 5 star rating if there was more product. It was barely enough to cover my long (about 3 inches above waist) hair. If I used this again, I would buy 2 boxes.</li>
    <li> I did receive the AgeDefy for free and was super excited I was picked to try it.  I was a little concerned when I saw that the color was going to be a medium brown as my hair is naturally a little lighter than that and I light to color my hair or do highlights that are medium to dark blonde, but I was willing to give it a try.  I loved that the hair color not only came with an after color conditioner like many hair color kits (by the way it smells amazing), but that it also came with a smoothing pre-treatment, something I have never seen or used before.  I have minimal grey hair, but the grey I have is coarse and wiry and that can get really annoying as it is in the front of my hairline.  I loved the way the pre-treatment made my hair silky soft and the hair color itself went on easily.  I also liked that the hair color did not have an strong odor as other hair dyes I have used in the past.  I was impressed with the coverage and the beautiful color I achieved with the product.  I also really liked the post color conditioner that I will be using once a week now that my hair has been colored.  My hair is soft and silky looking and the color reflects light beautifully.  All of my grey is gone and I no longer have little grey hair sticking up along the crown of my head.  I would definitely buy this product in the future, but I would go with a lighter color as that is what I am accustomed to.  Overall, I am highly satisfied with the Clairol Expert AgeDefy and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved my hair color. I have mild graying hair and this provided excellent coverage. I think it&#x27;s definitely one of the better hair colors that I have ever used. I like that it was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t take too long to do.The color matched with my natural hair color very well and I can definitely say I am pleased with the result.  I think that it left my hair feeling softer and silkier. I have issues with hair color damaging and drying out my hair, and this product did not do that at all. I was lucky to receive this product through a sampling program and would recommend this product for future usage.</li>
    <li> I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed this product. The smoothing gel step was a little confusing as the directions on the bottle and the directions on the package insert contradicted each other but after getting through that part, everything went very smooth. I especially enjoyed that everything smelled so good, especially the conditioner at the end. After it was completed, my hair felt very soft and had a nice shine to it and all the gray was nicely covered. Definitely a product a will continue to use!!</li>
    <li> This product turned out a lot darker than anticipated, but it is very natural-looking with rich tones to it. It also leaves hair feeling super soft and flowing. I also like how the color stays and does not fade away quickly. Would definitely recommend for those wanting to go darker or keep their natural brunette tones looking vibrant and healthy.</li>
    <li> This brand by far has provided the longest and best color coverage for my hair. It also covered the gray hair VERY well. I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune at a salon AND it lasted for a long time. I would def buy this again. My hair also looked better and healthier after using this product!</li>
    <li> i received this product as a complimentary test and didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but it completely impressed me.  my hair was left feeling soft, shiny, and thicker than before.  it was very easy to apply as the directions were very clear and concise.  the product was not messy at all; there was no need to burn off the top few layers of my forehead when all was said and done.  :)  the best part was that it completely covered my grey; something i have struggled with with every box solution i&#x27;ve ever used.  in addition, the smell was not overwhelming, like you typically find in any box hair color.  i highly recommend this product and will continue to use this to save some money at the salon!</li>
    <li> I usually go to the salon when I need to color my hair and then every time I need to cover my grays. It&#x27;s convenient but very expensive. So when I received this complimentary box of Clairol Expert Collection AgeDefy Medium Brown I&#x27;ve decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it was an interesting experience. I followed the instructions to make sure I did everything right. Thank you Clairol for labeling the ingredients with the numbers. For the home coloring novices like me it was extremely helpful to make sure I&#x27;m mixing the ingredients in the correct order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a patch test first, then applied the Smoothing Pre-treatment (1) to dry hair. The mixing of the color was super easy. I emptied Color Creme tube content (2a) into the Activating Creme bottle (2b), shook it well and applied to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little surprised by the amount of time I had to leave the hair color on. 35 minutes? I expected the time to be 15 min. or so. Oh well, if you want good results you need to follow the instructions to the tee. So I did. I rinsed my hair with warm water and applied the Pantene Pro-V Color-Seal Conditioning Therapy (3), left on for 2 minutes and rinsed thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the results: All my gray hair was covered, the hair color was a little darker that I usually wear but I actually liked it a lot. The hair felt soft and looked shiny. The whole process of coloring hair at home went smoothly and was quite easy to do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Clairol AgeDefy Expert Collection Hair Color to anyone who wants to save money on the salon treatments and get great results at home. I know I did!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for testing purposes but all opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. It was easy to apply. Smell was not horriable. I got great grey coverage. My hair felt wonderful after coloring. It was shiney,bouncy, manageable and fabulous!! I tested this product at no cost,opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage!  I received this from a sampling campaign.  It covered my grays and is reasonably priced.  My hair is soft and manageable.  I would use this product again.</li>
    <li> I have some gray hairs and this product has excellent coverage.  Matches my original hair color perfect.  I will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Influenster to test and review. My natural color is dark ash blond, and has been professionally colored and highlighted for about 15 years, every six weeks. I have minimal gray, but it&#x27;s very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I performed the strand test, using a 1/4&amp;#34; strand which had gray, highlight and base color. After 15 minutes, I checked the results. The gray was gone, the base color matched the box, and the highlight had turned a pretty caramel color (not greenish, like I had anticipated). I decided that 15 minutes would be my limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read pulled the pre-treatment out and read the instructions on the packet. It stated to apply to dry hair all over, from root to tip. Hmmm. I then reread the overall instructions from the box, which stated to apply the pre-treatment to ends only, avoiding the root area. I have attached a picture of both below so you can see the discrepancy. I decided to avoid the root area, and applied the pre-treatment. There was only enough for the ends anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, but I also have a lot of it. Tons. It&#x27;s shoulder length. Once I mixed the color, I contemplated going out and buying a second box, as there seemed not nearly enough to do the job. But, since the pre-treatment was already on, going out wasn&#x27;t an option. I applied the color as well as possible, trying to get even coverage with the small amount I had. By the time this was accomplished and the bottle was empty, my allotted 15 minutes were up. I gave the color five more minutes, then rinsed. After rinsing, I applied the conditioner included (which is supposed to last four weeks with a once-weekly application). I used 2/3 of the tube right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was a pretty medium brown which matched the box, no visible grays and pretty &amp; shining caramel highlights throughout. However, I imagine that most people who buy this product expect full coverage, which may be accomplished by leaving the color on the entire recommended time of 35 minutes. But, it was difficult to evenly cover all of my hair with what was provided in one box, so if you have a lot of hair, you may want to spring for two boxes. Also, the discrepancy in the pre-treatment instructions was frustrating; I would hope the manufacturer would remedy this in order to make it clear. All in all, I am very pleased with the results and very happy I tried this! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great coverage of entire head including all my grey.  I usually need 2 boxes even with my short hair but this covered with one box.  It smelled a lot better than the others I have used int he past and it left my hair so soft and manageable I was surprised.</li>
    <li> I just colored my hair last night with Clairol Age Defy Medium Brown. It was a simple process, the color was thick enough that it didn&#x27;t splash at all!  (I usually get the color everywhere).  Once I was done I noticed that my grays were covered and my hair was shiny and soft.  I like the color but think I might try the golden brown once the weather warms up a bit!  Definitely will refer my friends and family to this product!  I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I used Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection 5 medium brown &amp; before I used it my grey roots were showing. After using this product my roots blended in with the rest of my hair that it looked natural! It took 5-10 years off &amp; that&#x27;s great when you get to be my age. Love this product so I look forward to using it again.</li>
    <li> I tinted on 60% gray, yet I&#x27;ve been tinting my hair for 25 years, This tint covers gray and the pre-treatment almost felt like a lift to open the cuticle to accept tint on gray. (yes, I was once a cosmetologist) it came out of the bottle orange and quickly darkened.  I should have done just the roots then pulled through as I do normally, because this color grabbed at the ends, making them super dark.  But i hadn&#x27;t had problems with Clairol tints and this was a disappointment.  the red in Auburn should be copper red, not violet, or burgundy.  I won&#x27;t be using it again, yet my hair is in great condition and very shiny. always a plus.  its a true medium shade on the roots and they didn&#x27;t look bright, which grays often do.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to try this permanent color, but my grays are showing and the semi-permanent just doesn&#x27;t cover them too well. I got the box to try from bzzagent and got dark brown...the pre-treatment was an extra step but i followed the the whole proceduure my natural color is black but i like the dark brown as when i color the, black now ... black colors look too fake am glad i chose dark brown it matched perfectly to my  Now close to natural dark brown color and I love it. My hair is so soft, looks natural, is shiny, covered the grays, doesn&#x27;t have any of the dreaded red tones and brassiness I usually get from a box. I&#x27;ll definitely use this again. My naturally darker hair came out to matching the resulting shade on the back of the box for  &amp;#34;darkbrown hair&amp;#34;. Love this !!!!</li>
    <li> The Clairol Age Defy at home color system is easy to use and produces great results! I had grays and grown out highlights to cover and it covered beautifully. I love the end result - other at home kits often leave my dark or medium brown with red tones (not intended) and this didn&#x27;t. It just left me with beautiful shiny brown locks!! Love the pre-treatment and the conditioner to keep the color long lasting. It wasn&#x27;t harsh and didn&#x27;t irriatate my eyes like other kits have done. I would definitely recommend this for the novice or the at home color expert!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My hair was soft &amp; the color was perfect! It has also stayed vibrant longer.</li>
    <li> Other than it colored my hair a little darker than usual, it was very easy to use and covered the gray well. Definitely does not look natural on my head though and people know that my hair is dyed. But that is only because the shade is dark for me.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a sample and was very happy on how it colored my hair! Loved the pretreatment made my hair very soft and natural looking! I have alot of stubborn grays and the color covered them nicely! I would recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I really liked it. Covered the gray and made me look younger.</li>
    <li> After years of dying my dark blonde hair, lighter and lighter to avoid showing the gray roots in 2 weeks. I decided to try Clairol Age Defy hair color in a medium brown color. The pre-treatment really helped with a even color and super soft hair. The real test came 2 weeks later, when I would normally start pretending the grays were highlights.  I saw no gray, nor any lightening of the root area where I normally see my grays. I am hopeful that this will be the product that can keep those grays covered so that I can enjoy shiny brown hair!</li>
    <li> I received this from influenstor as a free product to try. It covered very well. It was very easy to use. The color looks natural and it has a shine to it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I was afraid of the dark color at first, but I love everything about it now.&lt;br /&gt;Grey coverage was wonderful and I loved the shine it gave my hair. It really did Age Defy!&lt;br /&gt;It is time for me to color again and I&#x27;m not sure about going back to a lighter color. If I do, I will miss&lt;br /&gt;the shine and color of this hair color. I was given this product to try and review.</li>
    <li> Best at home hair color on the market. The pre-color treatment package is the key. Color is beautiful &amp; hair is left soft &amp; smooth. Don&#x27;t skip the pre treatment package &amp; make sure you work it all over. It&#x27;s also important to deep condition at least once a month if you color your hair regularly no matter what product you use.</li>
    <li> I rarely write poor reviews, but this product worked very poorly for me. Apparently, there is some variation in how well it covers hair for different users. I have about 50% gray hair which I&#x27;ve colored at home and in the salon for the last 10 years or more. I don&#x27;t consider my hair extremely difficult to color and have never had a professional colorist say it was worse than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to touch up my roots as I couldn&#x27;t get to the salon for the next couple weeks. The gel pre-treatment was confusing as I couldn&#x27;t really get it to cover all of my hair, and I have a short hair cut right now! Anyway, the dye itself was pretty standard to apply. After I rinsed and dried my hair, I noticed it was darker on the sides of my head, but I&#x27;ve had that happen before and didn&#x27;t think much of it. The texture of my hair was really nice-- that was the best part! Sadly, I took a shower and only rinsed my hair with water and about 50% of the color disappeard from my gray roots. After a second shower, rinse only, almost all the color was gone! I was amazed... even semi-permanent dye lasts longer than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this product works for some people, but just wanted to share my experience as Amazon.com is one of the few places you can find reviews for every day products like this. I won&#x27;t buy it again, but if I did, I think I&#x27;d put the gel pre-treatment on the sides and ends of my hair and not put any on the top as that&#x27;s where the color seemed to just rinse away. I think that gel keeps the color from grabbing on to the hair or something!</li>
    <li> I love this product I love Pantene expert so when they came out with this color I was all over it.  Leaves hair beautifully soft.</li>
    <li> First off, the smell of this is so much better than the average box of color. It&#x27;s light and a lot less irritating to the skin and the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pre-color stuff is a lot like hair gel. Just make sure that you don&#x27;t dump all of it on your scalp and allow for more for the ends and middle of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out really, really dark, like black-brown. It stained the skin on my forehead and neck. I would say not to do this right before a major event, maybe a day or two before, and if your hair is normally a lighter color, you&#x27;ll certainly look &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; than you usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update to let you know how it wears, if it fades, etc.</li>
    <li> Covers my resistant gray better that anything else I have used.  Leaves hair nicely textured.</li>
    <li> So I started this process just like any other hair color I use every other month or so.  I have a lot of experience dying my own hair and usually use a dark brown color.  I received my package in the mail and I did appreciate the .packaging and it&#x27;s clear claim for handling dryness and covering grays.  I opened the box and found all products clearly labeled and a pair of great gloves; those who dye know the importance of this!  I started with the agedefy pre treatment.  It&#x27;s the consistency and smell of hair styling gel, and went on easy.  I have very long hair and there was plenty of product.  I then mixed the activating creme and the color creme.  I have to say that the color creme tube was difficult in managing to get all the product out.  I usually use a liquid form of coloring agent.  Once it was all mixed together I applied the product; again, plenty for my long hair.  I covered my grays heavily as usual just to make sure they were saturated well, waited the 25 minutes of time and rinsed.  Of course, those who know the process know not to use shampoo for a few days which I followed.  I dried my hair to see the results and had a completely different color at my roots!  See pic below.  I then noticed that some of my grays had not covered, and they were the ones that were most saturated with the dye.  I waited two days, washed my hair and all my grays are now visible!  The only good thing about this product is that my hair is very soft and silky, but I&#x27;m disappointed in my results, especially since this product claims to really cover well!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for about three straight years now. Needless to say, my hair is slightly dry and damaged. I also constantly battle a sprinkling of grays throughout my hair. I like my current color, but it does not cover my grays as well as I would like. So, when BzzAgent offered me the chance to try new Clairol AgeDefy hair color in Medium Golden Brown (5G) I jumped. The first thing that was different was the &amp;#34;AgeDefy Smoothing Pretreatment.&amp;#34; I like that there was something that was supposed to protect my hair before I even got started coloring it. The actual coloring process was easy and pleasant. The cream was luxurious and the smell was nice. I especially liked the &amp;#34;Pantene Colorseal Conditioning Therapy.&amp;#34; I like anything that will condition my hair without weighing it down. After blow drying my hair, I instantly felt that my hair was softer. As I scrutinized it in the mirror (as I tend to do with my hair), I was instantly in love with the color. This brown is rich and deep, and not boring like some other browns out of a box. It is also not only softer, but very shiny. Also, no grays! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone battling stubborn grays and who wants to regain some of the luster of healthier hair. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome!  Leaves your hair VERY soft, shiny and healthy looking. #5 is an Ash Brown which is the exact color of my natural hair, so this color is true and a very rich brown. Not dull at all.  It covers my gray and stays on for about 8-10 weeks. My natural hair is past shoulder length and has white hairs coming through mostly on the sides and underneath, so I use this to blend my gray with my natural brown. It works perfect. No need to go to a Salon.  I also love that the box contains a whole tube of conditioner that you use after your shampoo to keep that silky soft feel in your hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this hair color today and I am in love with it! I don&#x27;t have grey all-over but I do have stubborn grey hair hairs near the front of my face and this dye was awesome! I used the medium brown color and my hair is now soft and shiny, it looks younger as the product states. First, you start with a pre-treatment that smells wonderful and protects your hair from any damage. Then you mix the developer with the dye which also smells great. The dye is drip-free which is a good thing for home coloring purposes (lessens damage to clothes, walls, carpet, etc.). Overall, the product is great and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> When it comes to finding the right brown hair color with age defy I finally did.  Others have left my hair with too much red in it and it drove me crazy.  I have no problems with this kit, it covers my grays, and it last even longer than the normal six weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for a long time.  I love going to the salon, but  it&#x27;s expensive and this time around I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews first, figured Clairol had their staff write a few of them (the five star reviews)  and then a disgruntled employee wrote the one star, it might not be true, but those were my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good product -- left my hair shiny and free of those miserable gray hairs. The Medium Golden Brown is just that -- no brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side benefit:  I didn&#x27;t find it at all messy and everything smell delicious.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Im BzzAgent member and im on a Buzzcampaign for CLAIROL AGE DEFYING HAIR COLOR.&lt;br /&gt; I received the product to try for free.. I love how CLAIROL AGE DEFYING HAIR COLOR&lt;br /&gt; covered all my gray I was very happy with that.made my hair so soft and shiny I felt 10 years younger, I would definitely  use  CLAIROL AGE DEFYING HAIR COLOR again. there&#x27;s nothing I dislike about  CLAIROL AGE DEFYING HAIR COLOR.</li>
    <li> I have been getting my hair done professionally for 3 years with dark blond and highlights to help blend the grey roots that would appear after 3 weeks.  I&#x27;m naturally a dark brown/black haired person, so it was a major step to go blondish.  I went to the medium auburn with this Age defying Clairol Expert color last night.  At first, I thought, oh no, it didn&#x27;t cover but made the grey red.  Not so!! Once it dried, my hair was georgeous!!!!  I LOVE IT!!!  No grey AT ALL!!  No reddish tone where the grey is, but a beautiful rich color all over.  I probably left it on longer than 25 minutes, because my hair is long.  So, the roots had the treatment on much longer.  I&#x27;m slow at getting all that hair covered.  I&#x27;m impressed!  I will be using the color crayon for in-between colors as my roots come quickly and the Root Touch-up as well as needed.  I am one happy customer. Thanks Clairol!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair color. Covers gray and leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I have used cheap non name brand hair color before. It&#x27;s definitely worth paying an extra dollar or two for this! It lasts much longer and looks great!</li>
    <li> YUck Used the medium blonde it looked orange in the bottle, fried my hair and yep it went orange. tried second bottle next day incase it was my error nope. orange hair, had to go buy a bog standard brown dye, so now I am stuck with a nice muddy brown shade that i hate.&lt;br /&gt;Clairol cos your worth it, (clairol cos you bin it more like it!) it&#x27;s just awful my hair is super dry now, the pantene did not help made my head itchy and my skin is sore now. I can&#x27;t put moisturiser on my face because where the dye touched some of my face it burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is dangerous it&#x27;s over priced to at £8.00 a box I bought2 and I am so cross at Clairol because I lost my money and had to buy naother dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their response was I didn&#x27;t use the product correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ummm hello my hair was platinum.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on platinum lightest blonde and it should go dark blonde not orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good old Clairol blame the customer...no refund ...just ignored!</li>
    <li> Very good product! Available in many stores. Easy to use, good gray coverage. I got this for free but will be using it in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have dark down hair and it lifted my hair just a bit.  I would recommend you buying a bleach or booster if you have darker hair. I didn&#x27;t receive the color I was hoping for but I love the way that it made my hair feel.  Nice and soft.  You just have to take care of it so that it does not damage your hair.... After all it is a chemical.</li>
    <li> I received a box of Clairol Age Defy Medium Brown color as part of sampling program. When I opened the Smoothing Pre-Treatment it&#x27;s smelled amazing. The color creme and activiating creme mixed together had light orange color. It applies very well. It rinses well. After my hair dries I could feel the softness of my hair.</li>
    <li> Received this product from Influenster and was hesitant thinking it would be too dark.  Ended up loving the color and the shine it gave my hair.  Covered the gray very well too.  Would definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> This hair color made my hair so soft and the gray coverage was perfect. I would definitely purchase this product again. I received complements from my hair dresser about how well it covered my grays. I am impressed at how long the color has stayed. The conditioner included by Pantene keeps your hair very soft. I received this box for review from Influenster for free to test. i am hooked. I am excited to try the other colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only colored my hair once before - many years ago. I&#x27;m a natural blonde, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older it&#x27;s got darker with a looooooot of gray! I was given this clairol Age Defy to sample, and I went with a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; brown (seems like dark brown to me, but that&#x27;s just a personal observation). Surprise! I love it! It got my frizzled hair under control, completely covered the gray and looks natural (which is important to me - fake hair often looks like fake hair), and made my hair feel soft and silky again. I feel like I&#x27;m going to want to try some other colors when this grows out... maybe a vibrant red? YES! Thanks Clairol!  (see my before &amp; after pics on my blog: brain-soup (dot) blogspot (dot) com  **I received the product to test at no cost, but my opinions ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> The color turned out beautifully but there wasn&#x27;t enough of the product to cover the whole head. Two boxes would be required for long hair but really only 1/4 of the second bottle would be needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  as easy as to apply and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Have great results.&lt;br /&gt;Make me look pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Love the color results.&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Works for me.</li>
    <li> Received this as a freebie to test. I was a bit apprehensive as I have not colored my hair, but this was easy to use and the results are beautiful! My hair is soft and shiny. Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> Just colored my hair with this product. I can not say enough good things about it. I thought it would look just awful to be honest because I&#x27;ve never colored myself before. I always went to a professional. And I always went lighter than my natural color. Well today I tried this, and I love my hair! It was also a  lot easier than I thought it would be, It didn&#x27;t stink, with more than enough in the bottle for my middle of the back length.The after color conditioner smells awesome.  I will absolutely use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;***I received a free sample for the purpose of review but opinions are entirely my own***</li>
    <li> The worst hair color I&#x27;ve used by far. I will not be buying this again, turned my hair completely black.</li>
    <li> This brand is amazing the rich color is even with natural highlights, The grey is gone. The frizz is gone too. This one did not hurt my scalp and I look ten years younger.I will buy this again</li>
    <li> This product was exceptionally easy to use and totally covered my gray.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I was a bit scared to try this...what if I didn&#x27;t like it???? But alas, I need not have worried!  Product is easy to use and all my grey went away!!!!</li>
    <li> My mother in law used this and her hair turned out great!  It was also very soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I received a voxbox as part of a sampling program with free Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection 5 Medium Brown. I can say I had a good experience with this hair color.  It was an easy 3 step process that was not hard at all.  The kit came complete with gloves, smoothing pre-treatment, color tube and activator and the whole process only took 30 minutes. I had a couple of gray hairs throughout my hair and this hair color covered them completely.  The dye was not messy and  runny as some other hair color dyes I have used and I liked that alot. Also, there was no strong odor that can take your breath away when using some hair dyes.  I would recommend this product to others for it gave me an even total coverage and my few gray hairs are gone, I&#x27;m Happy :)  My hair color looks natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> I received Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection as part of a sampling program. I decided that I would use this product before Valentine&#x27;s Day, so that my hair would look its best for a romantic night out.  I have dyed my hair many times, so the applying of the hair dye was within my expectations, no surprises.  I finished washing out the excess dye, and applied the deep conditioner. I love putting deep conditioner on my hair, as it always makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.  I was very pleased with how this conditioner worked as well. So soft.  The next day, I woke and looked in the mirror, and...WOW, I loved how my hair looked. The hair looked as if it was infused with the color, not just “covered&amp;#34;, I couldn&#x27;t even find a grey strand of hair (and I looked for a while).  The coloration, itself is amazing. The brown was such a “true” color.  It doesn&#x27;t look like a dye job, it looks like very healthy hair. Not only am I very pleased with this product, but my husband loves it. It exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Like most women out there when a new product comes out I try it hoping it will be better than what I am already using, unfortunately this product does not cover stubborn gray hair. I have brown hair with grays at the roots and hairline, I do not believe how quickly this color disappeared. I colored my hair maybe a week ago and it looks like I need to color again. I will stick with my other brand and been tried and true for a long time now. I don&#x27;t think I will be trying any of these new products coming out and wasting anymore money. If you have stubborn grays stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time.  It was so easy.  The best part is there is no horrible after smell.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product!</li>
    <li> I love the full coverage that it gave my hair. It looks and feels so healthy and natural. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a professional look without paying the price for it. Thankful that I was able to try this product free, thanks to Influenster.</li>
    <li> Got this complementary and I was hesitant at first to use because I usually go to salon to get hair colored.. I was amazed at the ease of use!  It also covered my greys and I had a soft shiny finish!  It&#x27;s a bit darker then what I&#x27;m used to but that&#x27;s okay since it&#x27;s wintertime.</li>
    <li> Loved it! No harsh smell. Covered great!</li>
    <li> Was a little darker than I would have liked but I really did like the results.</li>
    <li> worked great at covering gray, pretty color and left my hair feeling so soft</li>
    <li> First I would like to say that most hair colors that I buy in a drug store don&#x27;t cover my gray but I was very surprised when I tried Clairol age defy.&lt;br /&gt;It covered a lot of my gray and my hair is super soft. It was also so easy to use and not messy .  So I&#x27;m very happy that I was given a free box to try. I made sure my friends and family try Clairol age defy.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using clairol. Loved the ease of the application.  The color came out great and has lasted a long time.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love how Clairol Expert covered all my gray hair. The ageDefy brand is great. I got the medium brown to try and it left my hair feeling soft and silky not frizzed out. The process was really easy to do myself. It&#x27;s been weeks now and my color hasn&#x27;t faded and I still see no gray hair. Great product for people with gray hair.  I was provided this product to try for nothing and my opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Clairol!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give a &amp;#34;0.&amp;#34; It really amazes me that Clairol discontinued the best boxed color for gray coverage ever made by any brand that I&#x27;ve ever tried (Gray Solutions) only to create what I consider the WORST of any boxed color I&#x27;ve ever tried! I used it twice just to make sure I didn&#x27;t do something wrong the first time. I just get some gray on top and by the temples, and immediately after both times that I colored, all the gray was still there in those areas! It is the worst. I&#x27;m still running around town trying to find Gray Solutions in Light Natural Brown. It was the best; I preferred it to salon color and it was definitely an affordable solution! I don&#x27;t like this conditioner with Age Defy as much as the old Clairol conditioner in the blue tube either.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try for Free from Influenster. I love this product! The color turned out beautifully natural looking and rich. It completely covered the gray and the color was even from root to tip.I followed the instructions given with the product and was very pleased with the results. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the color and the texture the hair feels like when done. Would repurchase would recommend I was sent this to me but my opinion is my own. I like the color selection as well. If I want to go lighter I can. I might try the lighter colors next in this line in the summer. I&#x27;m naturally a dark haired girl but I&#x27;m willing to see how the lighter color looks</li>
    <li> Love the product it looks great in my hair, it was also very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I love the color! My roots are getting quite grey, but this covered them very well! It&#x27;s easy to apply and the color is rich, shiny, and beautiful. I received this at no cost to test, but I absolutely love it and will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I received a free box of this hair color to sample and I was blown away at how great it worked for me!  I have a very stubborn area of gray hair and rarely can home hair color even tint it, never mind cover it but Age Defy did just that!  It also left my hair soft and feeling healthy.  I love the step 3 conditioning treatment too.  All instructions were easy to follow and I am really happy with my results,  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This was the first time doing this on my own, normally I have assistance from one of my daughters.  When I got the package, it seemed easy enough that I applied it on my own.  I put on the gloves that came included, applied the pre-treatment serum, plenty available for my long hair, mixed the concoction of dye and applied to my hair.  Easy enough, no harm, no foul. I must say that there wasn&#x27;t the usual smell of &#x27;fumes&#x27; that one is accustomed to when coloring your own hair. There was a faint smell, but not the usual &#x27;gag&#x27; factor.  I awaited the suggested time limit and then proceeded to rinse my hair. After applying the conditioner and allowing my hair to dry... I must say I am quite pleased with the end result. I have the shine I&#x27;ve been searching for, and a color that I am in love with. Overall experience is a B+  I received this product free to test, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was sent Clairol Age defy hair color to try out and review by Influenster.  I had some grey roots or silver highlights as I like to call them. The Clairol Age defy covered the grey but what I like most is my hair feels so soft and smells great. I like the scent of their product. It did not take long to do and simple instructions made it easy to do. So far I am loving this product and would purchase in future.</li>
    <li> I received a box of Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection in Medium Brown free from Influenster, to try at home and review. A week and a half after dyeing my hair, here are my impressions . . .  The instructions that came with the product are well-written, and better than average gloves (ones that actually fit and don&#x27;t allow any liquid to seep in!) are included. The Smoothing Pre-treatment was interesting, feeling like hair gel that doesn&#x27;t get sticky, though I don&#x27;t actually understand its purpose. The hair dye itself didn&#x27;t smell half bad and there was enough product to cover every strand of my long hair. I left the dye on for the maximum amount of time, in order to give it the best chance of completely coloring the grey strands, and followed up with the Pro-V Colorseal conditioner as per the instructions. The color I used was a bit darker than my natural hair color, but looked fine if you didn&#x27;t know the nuances of my hair.  After the third day/second washing of my hair, some of the grey was beginning to peak through. After nine days/seven washings, even more grey is showing. Thankfully, my hair is still soft and doesn&#x27;t feel as though I dyed it, so no harm no foul there!  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase or even bother to use this again, though, because the results were so short-lived; however, if someone wants very temporary, 100% grey coverage that won&#x27;t make your hair feel like straw, Clairol Age Defy might be just the product for you!</li>
    <li> I went from being a blonde with much wonder and questioning my decision, but now that I have done it, I love, love, love it!! My hair looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time and I LOVE it! My hair has never been so soft and smooth. The color coverage is amazing! Such a beautiful color, so natural!</li>
    <li> Love the color! The color looks so natural. My hair is so soft and silky!</li>
    <li> pros:  no strong smell, rich creamy formula that was easy to apply, hair is very soft, covered my grays well&lt;br /&gt;cons:  I used medium brown and it turned out more of a dark brown.  I didn&#x27;t use ash tone, because I never do, but there is defintely a red tone, which I don&#x27;t like,  I tried to be careful and use vaseline around my hairline, but still ended up with some spots which are hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use this again.  I&#x27;ll have to see if the color fades some and how long it covers gray....</li>
    <li> While I prefer foam type color when I do it myself, this product was pretty easy to use.  The box I received to try was darker than what I normally use but I have received several positive comments on the color.  My hair felt very soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made my hair look very natural. It covered the gray. It also made my hair very soft. I will be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I used this product because I was hoping that it would provide excellent grey coverage.  It starts with a 3 step process, which can be a little confusing to someone that is used to home coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one:  Is a smoothing pretreatment.  It is a clear gel and is supposed to smooth the hair follicles so it can accept the coloring better.  The directions say to concentrate on your hairs ends and to keep away from the roots of your air.  For me most of my grey is near the roots, so it was a little confusing to me.  I put some on my very stubborn grey anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: is the regular coloring that an body that has used Clairol before knows how to use.  The color in te bottle after mixing was a blonde color and gets very dark on your hair as the process works.  I have been told by a professional stylist that if you are going to use the &amp;#34;coloring in a box&amp;#34; to put the color on your greys first and wait 15 minutes before you do the rest of your hair.  I have done this for years and it seems to work so that the grey hairs get a more time to process the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the coloring on for a total of 45 minutes, making sure to get all of my stubborn greys covered completely in the coloring mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 45 minutes I rinsed and conditioned my hair according to the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of coloring your hair at home is just as easy as ever!  The results were about what I expected and the color is really natural looking and my hair felt very soft.  I really do love the color!  The only downside was that all of my grey was not covered.  So the question is:  Is it just my hair or is it the product?  I am not really sure, it did cover 90% of my grey.  But as a few people can relate nothing looks worse than just getting your hair colored and having those few strands that stick out like a sore thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would gave it 4 stars as my hair is very soft and the color looks very natural.  I really do love the shade and the convenience of doing it at home.  I did receive this product at no charge to test and review, but all opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection 5 Medium Brown..It made my hair very soft and shiny with less grays!! My co-workers were amazed with this as well and went out and purchased their own boxes.  I have definetly found my new hair color thank to the Clairol Brand.  I will never go back to my original hair coloring kit again because I know I will not receive the same quality of care like I did with Clairol! Thank you so very much for this amazing hair color!!</li>
    <li> Best gray coverage I&#x27;ve found so far. But the Medium Brown is very dark - more like dark brown.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I will definitely buy this product again. Easy to follow directions, and my hair has never felt softer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair color after trying a lot of other brands.  I was hoping to find a color that didn&#x27;t fade so fast.  Since my hair has turned black after dying it, I am hoping that this color fades extremely fast!  I tried washing it to get it to fade (literally 10 times in the past 2 days), but no such luck.  I hate the color on me and I&#x27;m embarrassed sitting here at my desk feeling like everyone is saying, &amp;#34;What the heck did she do to her hair&amp;#34;?  Seriously, they&#x27;re doing double takes. On the plus side, it did cover all the grey and left my hair very smooth and soft.  Since I&#x27;m not happy about the color turning black I&#x27;m only giving it a 1 star.</li>
    <li> I left this color for an hour to make sure cover my gray hairs but not one gray hair was covered. Very disappointed.... If anyone knows which brand covers gray well, please let me know. Waist time and money to use this brand.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample in a program to try.I will be honest I was hesitant at first,but I am so glad I went through with it.My hair is a light brown and this shade is a darker medium brown.So simple to do I did not need any help from my husband.Instructions were easy to follow.My hair is so soft and shiny now.It covered all  the gray,I am 55 so I had some gray hair.I also liked the fact that my house did not stink from chemicals from the hair dye.It has a pleasant odor,I cannot smell it on my hair,usually you can smell dyes for a day or two,that was a pleasant surprise.all in all Clairol has made me a very happy woman.</li>
    <li> This product has 3 easy to follow steps. The kit comes with a pretreat moisturizer, color tube and activator and gloves and conditioning rinse. The color process and prep was only about 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Clairol Age Defy 5 Medium Brown. The color was darker than what I was expecting but I know in a few days it will fade after a few washings. I guess next time I can take it off sooner.  I also had a few greys that did not take the color but for the most part the grey coverage was pretty good. I would defiantly use this product again and recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This product was provided free of charge for testing and review purposes. All comments here are my personal experiences with this product.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Have always been afraid of overdoing my hair, so when I had to start using something to cover the gray, I stuck with what I knew. This is the first time I used something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the medium brown 5 from the Clairol Age Defy Expert Collection. It is a product that I received complimentary for review, but would never recommend anything I did not support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clairol product provides a pre-conditioner to use before coloring. It is very easy to use with explicit directions, but i was concerned with there being enough for complete coverage. Extremely easy to mix and the thicker cream feels much better to use. My hair is shoulder length and fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it, so I was still concerned about having enough. There is some odor, but very little so it&#x27;s completely unoffensive and my eyes did NOT burn as they usually do in coloring. I also have somewhat sensitive skin causing my scalp to itch quite a bit for the few days after coloring, but no problem this time. Maybe that&#x27;s due to the cream, but another reason to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important, the color is consistent and natural looking. Always a good thing! And even after a week or so following the coloring, my hair is still smooth and soft. Not too much build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely use again and recommend!! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have always gone a little lighter because i am so gray, but this color covered all of the gray .  I am very pleased with the results!!</li>
    <li> Loved this product great color!</li>
    <li> I really liked it! Was everything I expected it to be and more. I really like the idea it included Pantene. Great for fixing damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product especially for the overall gray coverage!  It really exceeded my expectations!  This will now be my choice for,color!,  I received it free also through a free sampling program!!</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary box of this coloring product for testing.  I was hesitant to color my hair by myself and found that it was easy to use and looks great. It covered the gray and looks evenly colored and shiny.  I will definitely use this product again in the future</li>
    <li> I just had a chance to try this shade today.  It did a great job of covering all of my grays.  My hair feels soft and has nice variations of shade.  I did receive this box of dye free to try from Influentser, but have used AgeDefy and will use it again.</li>
