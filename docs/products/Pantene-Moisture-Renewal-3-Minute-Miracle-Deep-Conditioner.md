      <li>In use, this has a luxurious, slippery feel and a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too flowery for the whole family to use.</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo for a couple of weeks and while I think it feels better in my hand (thicker and creamier), it hasn&#x27;t seem to make a huge amount of difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>so it is smooth and healthy.</li>

      <li>Though this one has richer texture and strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>It also leaves my hair in fine looking condition, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great shampoo for daily use. Lasts a long time and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> works well for my hair</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Makes my hair shiny.  No buildup.  I always get compliments at the salon that my hair is very healthy.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Pantene product always one of my  favorite, my hair feel  great after using this.It does what it claim, reduce the frizz.  Very well price product,</li>
    <li> Great quality and great shipping even during snowmegeddeon!!! 🅰➕➕➕➕➕➕</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene for years but now I&#x27;m going to have to find a new shampoo because of the scent change. It used to smell fresh and now it smells sickeningly sweet and like cocoa butter.  I threw out a huge bottle I bought from Amazon thinking maybe there was something wrong with the batch, but another one purchased at Walgreens smelled the same.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for herself. She loves it...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this fine product but it came smashed.</li>
    <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat and I even received a coupon.</li>
    <li> Have a subscription for this item. Love that it&#x27;s at my door every 2 months and is a really wonderful shampoo!</li>
    <li> My new favorite shampoo!</li>
    <li> I love how Pantene smoothes and straightens my hair. The smell is great too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo product does exactly what is should, my hair is clean and my flowing mane has the volume of Fabio&#x27;s first book cover</li>
    <li> This is always the one brand I come back to. Great quality, with wonderful results. Larger bottle than you find in the stores. Very moisturizing, not heavy on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> very dsudsy.  good shampoo. good value</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps my hair moist and mostly tangle free, not to mention clean.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Pantene shampoo! I was using Paul Mitchell and some other high-end brands for a really long time and for the most part they made my hair look dull and lifeless.  I have long, thick hair and Pantene just brings it to life.  Plus it smells great all day! :)  I highly recommend this shampoo and I probably won&#x27;t use another brand.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to find a moisturizing shampoo left me with a dry scalp.  Pantene products have always performed well for me and while is does seem to help moisturize the hair a bit, the dry scalp was an unwelcome surprise.</li>
    <li> I love this product and having it delivered when I need it is great!</li>
    <li> Love it as low price.</li>
    <li> I normally love Pantene Moisture Renewal, but my last order seemed &amp;#34;watered down.&amp;#34; This last set of shampoo and conditioner wasn&#x27;t anything like what I&#x27;ve purchased in the store. I don&#x27;t think I got what I paid for. I recently bought the same product at Target and it was as great as I remembered. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo but not quite as good as the hype. I still get tangles and was really hoping this would eliminate them, it didn&#x27;t but it helped. The more I use this shampoo, the more I like it. It definitely leaves my hair looking fuller and thicker than other shampoos that I have tried recently. Overall, this is one of the best shampoos I have used.</li>
    <li> dont care for the smell...kinda like apples</li>
    <li> Truly did help renew moisture back to my hair so it is smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> I usually love Pantene products, but this one my family is not so fond of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the pros, it smells nice, lathers well, rinses well and has a thick and smooth texture.  It also leaves my hair in fine looking condition, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cons, When I&#x27;m washing my hair it feels like it&#x27;s been stripped of its natural oils and therefore my hair gets a bit tangled and caught in my fingers (ironic, considering it&#x27;s moisture renewal).  Secondly, my spouse said when too much is used it makes the scalp itch afterward, but by using less shampoo than normal, while still getting a decent lather, that problem has gone away.  I have not experienced any inching though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have thick and wavy hair that is about 6 inches long.  Additionally, I&#x27;m using Pantene&#x27;s complemental conditioner alongside the shampoo and that eliminates the dried out feeling the shampoo produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... on its own, I&#x27;m not so thrilled with it, but with the conditioner they work together well.</li>
    <li> I give this shampoo two stars for making my hair soft and manageable. But at the cost of terrible hair loss! I used the shampoo for almost a month and I realized the amount of hair loss I was experiencing was like never before!! In to the pile it goes, maybe I&#x27;ll wash my toliet with it... Stop using it if you notice unusual hair loss! Pantene is known for that, I know it now... Growing is much slower than losing!! Take care of your hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, that is frequently oily near my scalp and bone-dry and splitting at the ends.  This shampoo is great in combination with the daily moisture conditioner.  I do find it leaves my hair a little less than extremely clean whereas other Pantene shampoos do a better job and my hair gets oily the next day.  It is MUCH better than the generic &amp;#34;compare to Pantene!&amp;#34; products I have tried, and I generally prefer generics.  I find the generics make my hair less oily, but they don&#x27;t clean as well and they leave my hair much drier and cause split ends and breakage.  It&#x27;s probably much better for shorter hair, and I have to admit I have no complaints when my hair is closer to shoulder length, but when your hair is down your back, you want a little more from your shampoo.</li>
    <li> Been using it for almost a year. Not bad i like it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> I always use Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo, it&#x27;s my favorite brand and at this low price how can you go wrong.</li>
    <li> We have 3 girls with long hair so hair care products are always a big deal.  Our middle-schooler who has mid-back length, super dense wavy hair gave this four stars.  The matching conditioner got 5 stars.  I noticed that it had a neutral, almost fruity fragrance which dissipated quickly when her hair was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s on a swim team so spends a lot of time in chlorinated water.  This shampoo helps with the &amp;#34;Brittle&amp;#34; feeling when coming out of the pool.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels and smells after using this shampoo. Damage from heat, sun, and summer fun disappeared after only one use of the shampoo and conditioner.Shampoo and conditioner have a lovely light scent.  My daughter with naturally curly hair loves it too.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo on my oily hair and my wife&#x27;s dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agree that the product makes our hair feel as clean as any other shampoo we&#x27;ve used. Neither of us thought it was appreciably better or worse than the typical Suave value product we routinely purchase.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is terrific. A little bit goes such a long way, and my hair feels so clean after rinsing. It&#x27;s best when coupled with conditioner but so gentle that it&#x27;s not always necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to switch off between this shampoo and Pantene Cleansing Conditioner, especially if I shower twice in a day.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of Pantene products over the years.  I have had issues with some of them due to the amount of alcohol in the ingredients.  This variety still has alcohol but it really did make my hair smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It squeezes out of the bottle in a nice creamy texture much like a lotion instead of a shampoo.  It glides through your hair nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t suds up as much as other shampoos.  This is probably due to a reduction in sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair frizzes at just the word from the meteorologist that it going to be humid and this keeps my hair nice and frizz free even after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to work a little bit harder at rinsing it out than with some other shampoos but that is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying the companion conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a very decent conditioner.  I also got the Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner so that I could give it an accurate review as a combination.  They leave the hair feeling silky, full, but not bogged down like a lot of other conditioners.  It also smells very good.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Choosing a Pantene shampoo is always a challenge because each offers qualities you want for your hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture renewal!&lt;br /&gt;Volume!&lt;br /&gt;Heat Shield Thermal Prep!&lt;br /&gt;Damage Detox!&lt;br /&gt;Color Preserve!&lt;br /&gt;Nature Fusion!&lt;br /&gt;Smoothing!&lt;br /&gt;Everlasting Ends!&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Lengths!&lt;br /&gt;Classic Daily Care!&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, of course, want ALL these properties for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you delve into the Pantene conditioners, the options are even more overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than buy all ~100 types and stirring them into a fine blend, I went with the Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo.  I am a crash test dummy as far as scents go, and worried that something not stamped with HYPO-ALLERGENIC would have me itching.  But the scent, if there is one, is subtle, and it did not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is almost mousse-like in texture, so not only does a little go a long way, but it feels like the shampoo is enveloping each strand of hair to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses out well and, while it does not leave my baby fine hair tangle free, it leaves it at a point where a small blop of conditioner will unsnarl it.  My hair feels clean.  Is it packed with moisture?  Has the shampoo undone the damage of 100 blow-dryings?  Hard to tell.  But it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, then you get your conditioner options.  Beautiful Length, Damage Detox, Ice Shine Luminous...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin?</li>
    <li> I alternate between this shampoo and some more expensive low lather shampoos.  This is a really economical and nice option- a hefty bottle that lasts forever even with my very long hair, and the product itself works well. Scent is pleasant but not overbearing.  I find that it does not dry or strip my hair, but I can&#x27;t say that I notice a significant improvement in hair texture without the use of conditioner.  (I have the sense, though, that most of these kinds of paired product lines rely heavily on the conditioner to deliver repair/moisturizing results?)  When used with conditioner my colored 46 year old hair is noticeably less &amp;#34;straw-like&amp;#34; and more flexible/moves like younger hair.  I can attest to the fact that this is a safe bet for non-fine, straight, somewhat frizzy/textured Caucasian hair (including lots of colored gray).  I tend to wash my hair every other day, and this shampoo keeps hair looking clean/not greasy while providing reasonable moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but is a good affordable option I find pleasant to use.  In addition I always use a good conditioner to augment this shampoo and help prevent breakage from brushing and styling.  My favorite conditioner for dry middle-aged hair is L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage Erasing Balm.</li>
    <li> Pantene is a name that I trust when it comes to shampoo.  This shampoo touts itself as being able to repair the damage of 100 blow dries.  It did leave my hair nice and silky after use.  It also smells nice.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pantene daily moisture renewal shampoo is easily brought to a thick lather that made my hair soft and clean. The fragrance was just right, not to strong or too mild. I used this with the conditioner and it resulted in my long thick coarse hair looking shiny feeling silky and smelling great.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and it goes in a bunch of different directions (thanks, cowlicks), so I normally use volumizing shampoos/conditioners, but this seems to have a comparable effect in terms of giving the hair volume, and it&#x27;s actually made the hair subtly healthier-looking as well. It&#x27;s not a pronounced effect, but it&#x27;s noticeable- enough so that I&#x27;ll probably keep using moisture-renewal stuff instead of volumizing stuff from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well and smells great, too. My only potentially negative observation is that it seems to take a bit longer to rinse out than other shampoos, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for healthier and more manageable hair. This will probably be my regular shampoo going forward.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine - too fine for a daily shampooing.  I thought maybe the \\&quot;Daily Moisture\\&quot; would work for me that frequently but it just leaves my hair flyaway-dry.  It&#x27;s a quality shampoo and I like it, but I can&#x27;t use it more often than usual.  Maybe different conditioners will make a difference?  The smell is nice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a creamy look and feel and leaves the air fairly tangle-free even before you use cream rinse. This is a large bottle and will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I have always used cheap shampoo on my hair - I have thick hair and typically purchase the store brand because I don&#x27;t like to spend money on shampoo. I have used this shampoo for a couple of weeks and while I think it feels better in my hand (thicker and creamier), it hasn&#x27;t seem to make a huge amount of difference in my hair. Granted, I only have the shampoo, not the accompanying conditioner, but I don&#x27;t find anything outstanding about this product that would make me order it over a cheaper shampoo.</li>
    <li> good shampoo.great for hair.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly standard shampoo: the main ingredients are water and petroleum byproducts, so you get a good lather and reliable cleaning power. In use, this has a luxurious, slippery feel and a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too flowery for the whole family to use. You can use it daily without damaging your hair, and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to see less summer frizziness, but my hair has not shown any changes after a month of use. I had healthy hair to begin with, so that may not be a fair test. It is a pleasant shampoo, as good as many pricier options, and the flip-top bottle is convenient. If you&#x27;re looking for a good basic shampoo for your family, this is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Great reliable shampoo, never makes my hair feel rough.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells fantastic and works great. The bottle is huge. It will last for quite some time. The formula is thick, spreads through hair easily, and lathers well. The scent is wonderful, kinda fruity and kind of grassy, and smells very much like watermelon. I have thick, dry, wavy hair, and this left my hair clean and soft. I would definitely seek out the matching conditioner, as I&#x27;m pleased with what this does for my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good! It soften ny hairs and nourishment them ! Smell&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Pros:  The hair is more manageable and less frizzy in the dry Texas sun.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s pricey, and seemed to be no different in performance from other Pantene conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on the hair, unlike some of the cheaper conditioners.</li>
    <li> I like the scent which smells like perfume not fruity. I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula but it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as it used to but still leaves my hair dry and unruly.</li>
    <li> It has a strawberry smell but no where on the packaging does it set that expectation.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want my hair smelling like strawberries. LOL</li>
    <li> This smells sooooo good. I want get a body spray with the same scent. Refreshing!</li>
    <li> Nice to never run out of Shampoo.  With three kids in the house it use to seem that we always were running out.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and lathers well. Good price</li>
    <li> I got this on sale for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t use this specific one.&lt;br /&gt;I used the other Pantine shampoo (purple or pink) it smells so good!</li>
    <li> After trying this shampoo on a whim I fell in love with it. I have long, thick, wavy hair and this does wonders. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It&#x27;s very soft to touch, shiny and manageable. I still enjoy only having to wash my hair every 3 days and my hair still smells great and looks clean on day 3.</li>
    <li> It works the way it always has but I found something at Traders that I really like better</li>
    <li> im glad they brought this back. its the best shampoo to use. so if youre looking for a great shampoo at a great price then this is it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t noticeably make my hair soft. I have normal Pantene that I got from Costco and compared the ingredients but everything is same! Though this one has richer texture and strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love pantene, but it usually smells really perfumy for my taste.  This one is no exception, but while it&#x27;s strong smelling out the bottle, it&#x27;s not that bad when rinsed. It does seem to moisture enough to where I can skip the conditioner, and I like that. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down like some.</li>
    <li> Works well on my full but thin hair. Easily gets out styling products.</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo I have ever used go back for this one time and time again.  Leave hair detangled and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This actually does seem to build hair body and make it more lustrous.  Pleasant smell without being overpowering.  Would receommend.</li>
    <li> My biggest concern when purchasing any shampoo that is labeled as “moisture renewal” or “moisturizing” is whether or not it can cut through the grime.  My hair type is very much normal.  It’s not overly dry, but also isn’t oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this shampoo for the first time after mowing on a 90 degree day, figuring that would be a perfect test.  After washing and applying conditioner to the ends of my hair, everything felt very clean.  It did a great job removing the sweat and debris.  Unfortunately, the next morning, I used it for the second time and, again, applied conditioner (the same conditioner I’ve been using for months) to the ends.  I knew very quickly that there was a problem.  My hair felt kind of heavy and gummy all day.  It appears that the shampoo does well on sweat and debris, but doesn’t do very well actually cutting through the normal oil buildup from the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, it lathered up better than most I’ve used.  That was great.  It rinsed easily too.  For someone who has issues with dry hair or a dry scalp, this is probably a great option.  For someone with normal hair, it appears to not be quite strong enough when it comes to cutting through the oil.  I only dinged it one star simply because I think it would work well on a different hair type.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo with the matching conditioner...as well as with other conditioners.  I think it&#x27;s very nice, since it isn&#x27;t drying, but also isn&#x27;t too conditioning for a shampoo, so it doesn&#x27;t wright down my fine hair.  The smell is &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; enough that I don&#x27;t think it interferes with other scents I&#x27;m wearing on the same day.  I do not find that it leaves buildup in my hair, and it has a nice amount of lather.  I don&#x27;t need to &amp;#34;rinse and repeat&amp;#34; -- just one wash is enough.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is pretty big, incidentally, and will last you a long time...especially since you only need a small amount of it to really lather up even long hair like mine.  I probably use three bottles of conditioner for ones bottle of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells fantastic and works great.  The bottle is huge- it will last for quite some time.  The formula is thick, spreads through hair easily, and lathers well.  The scent is wonderful- it&#x27;s kind of fruity and kind of grassy, and smells very much like watermelon.  I have very thick, dry, wavy hair, and this left my hair clean and soft.  I would definitely seek out the matching conditioner, as I&#x27;m pleased with what this does for my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time after dying my hair with some pretty harsh chemicals. Probably not the best idea since it&#x27;s not specifically for colored hair. However it worked great! My hair is soft and shiny not course and dry like it usually is after dying. I&#x27;m very impressed with this one. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, my hair just smells clean.</li>
    <li> I am far from a shampoo expert, but I do wash my hair everyday, so I probably have something to say. After a week, I am a big fan of this shampoo. It is a good value at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way. Some shampoos dry my head out and make it very itchy. My last shampoo did that. Already in a week, I have noticed a mild decrease in scalp dryness and itchiness. I&#x27;m not 100% sure it&#x27;s the shampoo, but I can&#x27;t think of what else it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, for an inexpensive, simple but effective shampoo, I give Pantene 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Now THIS, I love! My hair is chronically dry and I can really see a difference with this shampoo. I like the scent which is nice, but not overpowering. My hair stays soft for days with this product. I&#x27;m eager to get the conditioner and try it too!</li>
    <li> I love Pantene products, and this Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo is no exception!  My son has dry hair that is coarse and unmanageable.  After using this Pantene product, we can see changes just after a week.  We are very pleased with the product, and we will definitely continue purchasing it in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with the conditioner, but both my husband and my hairdresser have been favorably impressed.</li>
    <li> my hair is significantly cleaner than before</li>
    <li> Pantene is always good to my hair i love it ty</li>
    <li> An excellent shampoo at a great value.  I have not experienced any hair loss since using it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seemed to do a good job cleansing my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice that it looked any shiner or healthier than previously. I will continue to use it because it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair (which some shampoos can do). All in all, it&#x27;s a good value</li>
    <li> I really like Pantene&#x27;s Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo.  Every time I use a new shampoo, I sort of cringe because my scalp is so sensitive that even using shampoos that have nothing in their ingredients that I&#x27;m allergic to, will make my scalp itch like crazy for days.  But I decided to give this one a try and it&#x27;s great!  No itchy scalp and due to it&#x27;s moisture renewal claim, no dry scalp either.  And on top of that, my hair smells fabulous.  Yes I know, shampoo is not supposed to be about the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Shampoo is shampoo,&amp;#34; is what most guys say.  I say try this one for a week and you will see a difference.  My wife noticed that my hair is softer, which is definitely a good thing.  She spends a lot of time with her hands in it.  I have been having itching problems with many of the higher end shampoos, but this one has yet to make my scalp and neck itch like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, stop just buying whatever is cheap and branch out a little.  If you have a wife, girlfriend, or would like to have one, spend a little more for a real difference in results.</li>
    <li> The Pantene brand, though a mass-market product in availability and price, competes with boutique specialty haircare brands.  Apparently it is not just a marketing slant as, generally, Pantene is one of the most respected names in haircare based on performance.  Few toiletries are more personal than ones involving hair, thus people tend to be highly critical and uniquely polarized in whatever opinion they hold.  That said, I can only give a few of my own observations.  The things I like about the Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo include the viscosity/feel, the highly pleasant smell, the generous size as reviewed here (25.4 oz.), and the overall performance.  I&#x27;d say this formula really is truth in product naming as it is definitely a shampoo that does aid in cleaning with noticeable moisture retention.  In other words, though not an aggressive astringent type hair cleaning solution it works well for dry to normal hair leaving the scalp feeling quite clean and not causing hair to tangle or frizz.  In fact, you may be able to skip conditioning if your scalp/hair type is normal.  That may well save time as well as expense depending on the individual user&#x27;s preferences and needs.  I believe for many with dry to normal hair this formulation will be more than satisfactory, even hard to beat.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to shampoo for my hair. My hair is not super super curly, but it&#x27;s more than a loose curl or wavy hair, so I am always looking to manage frizz. This helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Just what you would expect from Pantene.  The price was good when applying the coupon.  You won&#x27;t find it anywhere else for about $2.</li>
    <li> Pantene changed their scent.  I went to Target and smelled them all.  No notification of the change.  I have 5 huge bottles now that I hate the smell of.  Pantene used to smell wonderful.  No longer.  Now it smells acidic and acrid.  At first I thought maybe I had my bottles too long and it deteriorated.  Not so.  THEY CHANGED THE SCENT AND IT&#x27;S AWFUL.</li>
