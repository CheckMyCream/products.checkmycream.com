      <li>I love the colors they have.</li>
      <li>For the most part, this set is the &#x27;glittery&#x27; style, so</li>
      <li>I have been having to change my nail color every day because I love these colors so much.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>2 coats is a must with most shades</li>
      <li>really love the metallic ones :)</li>
      <li>The girls were so pleased with their gift.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more products.</li>
      <li>Def recommend everyone purchase this and have fun with your polish!!</li>
      <li>The quality isn&#x27;t superb, but much better than what I expected for about $1/bottle.</li>
      <li>I would really recommend getting these if you like bright pops of color</li>
      <li>And all full sizes!</li>
      <li>An endless array of choices and excellent quality!!</li>
      <li>You get so many colors for such a great price.</li>
      <li>chip or break easy</li>
      <li>It is full size and you won&#x27;t be able to find full size nail polish for a dollar !</li>
      <li>but that is true for most brands.</li>
      <li>the colors are so nice and pretty</li>
      <li>Ihave bought alot of shany cosmetics products and i am just so impressed with them they never let me down!</li>
      <li>When this arrived, it had a HUGE odor to it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an OPI girl, but I thought I&#x27;d take a chance on some cheap and cheerful stuff on a whim.</li>
      <li>looked cheap.</li>
      <li>Nothing really light.  </li>
      <li>And at the same time, you are getting a great variety in colors to pick from.</li>
      <li>I can tell you this much: you don&#x27;t need both, but it&#x27;s nice to have them.  </li>
      <li>Such a great price for this Nail polish set.</li>
      <li>and that is really cheap.</li>
      <li>These polishes are worth the price!</li>
      <li>These polishes are worth the price!</li>
      <li>You get a lot of nail polishes for not very much  money, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s getting 24 polishes full size for about 1 dollar each!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to air the box out for four days before touching it again - and it still had a very \\&quot;paint-thinner\\&quot; like smell.  </li>
      <li>Lots of glitter colors (is glitter very popular suddenly?), lots of colors that are alike, but kind of different.  </li>
      <li>I found the metallic colors to be amazing (work great with even one coat only), plain colors to be ok</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and stays on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m glad I picked up this set, though probably won&#x27;t exclusively use the solid colors without a glitter coat on top of it.</li>
      <li>They do go on smoothly, I will give you that, and the colors are, in fact, pretty rad.</li>
      <li>Polish dries fast but chips easy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Dark, rich and bright would be how I would describe them.  </li>
      <li>This set would be great for people to whom sophistication is not particularly important and who just want to have sparkly nails on the cheap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Colors for day, colors for night, fun colors, work colors...</li>
      <li>Still totally worth it.</li>
      <li>My favorite color is the light blue.</li>
      <li>great product just what I was looking for, arrived intact no broken bottles I will be buying the other sets</li>
      <li>The pearls are beautiful, especially no.44, which is currently my favourite nail polish in the universe.</li>
      <li>It would cost much more to get all this polish at our local stores.</li>
      <li>A Very Versatile Set!</li>
      <li>You get 24 polishes and so many colors for a very low price making in just over one dollar a piece where else can you get a deal like that?</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable for the quality of the product and the shipping was lightning fast.  </li>
      <li>They dont chip and are so vibrant!</li>
      <li>it really doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it started chipping off the next day.</li>
      <li>No broken bottles, in fact it was delivered in three boxes and bible wrapped.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Haha</li>
      <li>However, the packaging was great, nothing was broken and all arrived in the promised time-frame.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When this arrived, it had a HUGE odor to it.  I had to air the box out for four days before touching it again - and it still had a very \\&quot;paint-thinner\\&quot; like smell.  Peee-yewwww!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since solid colors are most vulnerable to streaking, I tried one of them out first - the mint color.  I applied two coats and noticed that some of them did have some streaking as well as a few bubbles.  For the most part, this set is the &#x27;glittery&#x27; style, so its not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m glad I picked up this set, though probably won&#x27;t exclusively use the solid colors without a glitter coat on top of it.</li>
    <li> I was unable to use these products as they were old and dried up. Very dissatisfied and disappointed at the quality I paid for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an OPI girl, but I thought I&#x27;d take a chance on some cheap and cheerful stuff on a whim. Well, you get what you pay for. This set would be great for people to whom sophistication is not particularly important and who just want to have sparkly nails on the cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application varies wildly from color to color, but even with an OPI base coat and Seche Vite topcoat, most of them --a few cremes excluded-- looked cheap. Would probably be fun for teenage nail art, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for all you nail polish lovers out there. You get 24 polishes and so many colors for a very low price making in just over one dollar a piece where else can you get a deal like that? No where ! Think of all the color combinations you could do and funky designs you could make.</li>
    <li> The colors in this set are great! I&#x27;m glad I bought this! The only problem is that some of the bottles had dried up polish sticking to the sides. Nothing major, but still, i don&#x27;t know why it was like that. I personally didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal, but something to consider.</li>
    <li> I painted my nails several times and each time the day after I painted my nails the color started to chip off.</li>
    <li> When I received my nail polishes one bottle was dried out and couldn&#x27;t use it I had to throw it away. Polish dries fast but chips easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday and she loves it!  All the colors are great.  It would cost much more to get all this polish at our local stores.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying 24 colors for the price is awesome! These colors go on so nice and smooth. My favorite color is the light blue. It reminds me of those old fashioned 50s cars!</li>
    <li> People should know that this is a really great deal!&lt;br /&gt;The colors are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I really love the metallic ones :)</li>
    <li> I am so hooked on shany Cosmetics; this is the only brand of cosmetics that I purchase. I have just about every product from shany cosmetics. And the quality is superb. I highly recommend them to everyone, trust me you would not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> compared to nail polish i bought this polish beats all it goes on smooth and even unlike other polishes that goes one thick and uneven this polish is great for nail techs</li>
    <li> I am in love! 24 full sizes polishes for $25!!! The colors are beautiful too and fast drying. And it applies very smooth, no bubbles! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 Shany cosmetics packages of 24-25 nail polishes and they never disappoint!!! They make my nails stronger and longer while making them look amazing!! I have had people ask me what I use to make my nails look so amazing and all I need is those incredible 2 words, Shany Cosmetics!!! Best product ever buy it it&#x27;s amazing!!!!:D</li>
    <li> I have all theses colors to choose from and it always seems every week I&#x27;m changing my nails so it works out great !</li>
    <li> Nail Polish Party! Haha :) This set of nail polishes comes with a vareity of colors to choose from, dark, light, green, etc. These polishes are worth the price! They are amazing and easy to use! :)</li>
    <li> A Very Versatile Set! I love the glitters and metallic polishes, adds to the variety! This set is a godsend for the budget savvy Diva! The polishes dry quickly and are long lasting! Great for the nail fashion addict!</li>
    <li> These Nail Polishes Are Very Nice There Are Neon, Dark, Metalic And Glitery Nail Colors And The Colors Change According To The Lighting I put On The green And It Went On Dark Hunter Green But When I went Outside The Green Changed to A Limon-Lime Green Which was Even Nicer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Shany Cosmetics makeup pallets, but I have to say I&#x27;m incredibly confused about the high ratings on the nail polish. I&#x27;ve had them now for several months, and I kept trying, I really did. They do go on smoothly, I will give you that, and the colors are, in fact, pretty rad. That is it, though. They take FOREVER to dry, I&#x27;m talking over an hour. Once they are finally dry, they not only begin to peel off immediately (saves on polish-remover costs? Pro?) but they actually rub off. I understand that I am hard on nail polish, I use my hands for hard labor and even with the highest quality polish I require many a touch up, but these were so terrible that painting my nails wasn&#x27;t a cute activity but a stressful chore. Based on other reviews maybe I got a bad batch that didn&#x27;t have a key setting-agent or something. However, the packaging was great, nothing was broken and all arrived in the promised time-frame. I&#x27;ll buy from Shany again, just not the nail polish.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors, lots of variety.  There are also a lot of glitter polishes included which I like. Dries quickly and stays on. GREAT price! Very happy.  2 coats is a must with most shades but that is true for most brands.</li>
    <li> these are great colors! and the price is pretty darn awesome the colors are so nice and pretty I would really recommend getting these if you like bright pops of color</li>
    <li> This set is beautiful. An endless array of choices and excellent quality!! Def recommend everyone purchase this and have fun with your polish!!</li>
    <li> It has a variety of colors. For $25 you get 24 nail polishes which is like $1 for 1 and that is really cheap. It is full size and you won&#x27;t be able to find full size nail polish for a dollar !</li>
    <li> Such a great price for this Nail polish set. And at the same time, you are getting a great variety in colors to pick from.</li>
    <li> I have been having to change my nail color every day because I love these colors so much.&lt;br /&gt;They do chip sooner than more expensive nail polish but not enough that it bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend them for sure. You do have to double coat with some of the colors, Just so you know.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of nail polishes for not very much  money, and it&#x27;s great. I love the colors they have. You can do so many designs with them and still not run out of ideas for more.</li>
    <li> Nail Polish Party! Haha :) This set of nail polishes comes with a vareity of colors to choose from, dark, light, green, etc. These polishes are worth the price! They are amazing and easy to use! :)</li>
    <li> This set of 24 full size nail polishes are great for a nail tech, friends, family or even yourself.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are beautiful, fun and great long lasting polish.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t chip or break easy and it&#x27;s getting 24 polishes full size for about 1 dollar each!&lt;br /&gt;Unbelieveable deal! Great for parties, gifts and just because :-)&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more for friends and co-workers!!</li>
    <li> I hate writing reviews but for Shany cosmetics  nail lquer set ....i just have to say the colors are amazing love the variety! Ihave bought alot of shany cosmetics products and i am just so impressed with them they never let me down! So far i tried 6 of their nail polishes and i am just loving them.Thank you Shany cosmetics and Amazon! Great service!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these as Christmas gifts for my granddaughters.  The colors were beautiful with lots of sparkle and variety.  The girls were so pleased with their gift.  The price was very reasonable for the quality of the product and the shipping was lightning fast.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> These nail polishes are great! They dont chip and are so vibrant! You get so many colors for such a great price. They dry in seconds and go on evenly!  I am glad I found what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Colors for day, colors for night, fun colors, work colors... everything you need in one kit! Long wearing formula and chip resistant.</li>
    <li> Though I do not have this set of nail polishes, I would definately get them if I wanted to have multi-colored nails, which were metallic, and attractive, and cool in color.  The different colors mean that the user can get a stylus and create different designs on her nails, which people, and she will admire for a long time.  Also, these polishes look like they last a long time, which means, that they are great deal for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Nice colours, and really good price. Dried rather quickly too. Have it on for two days now, no complains. And all full sizes!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. No broken bottles, in fact it was delivered in three boxes and bible wrapped. The quality of the polish is very good with a lustrous finish. I will be buying more products.</li>
    <li> I bought this set and the other one they have and then I promptly proceeded to arrange them together and mix the colors up.  I can tell you this much: you don&#x27;t need both, but it&#x27;s nice to have them.  Lots of glitter colors (is glitter very popular suddenly?), lots of colors that are alike, but kind of different.  A lot of dark colors.  Nothing really light.  Dark, rich and bright would be how I would describe them.  Still totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this it really doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it started chipping off the next day.</li>
    <li> My initial impression about this particular line was that there were many creative colours, not just your regular, everyday red, pink and brown. The pearls are beautiful, especially no.44, which is currently my favourite nail polish in the universe. The polish goes on great with or without a base coat. Great price for the quality and quantity!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this great colors great product just what I was looking for, arrived intact no broken bottles I will be buying the other sets</li>
    <li> I found this set to be a really good value for the money. The quality isn&#x27;t superb, but much better than what I expected for about $1/bottle. I found the metallic colors to be amazing (work great with even one coat only), plain colors to be ok (needs 2-3 coats, and good collection of colors), and sparkly ones rather disappointing (not many sparkles, and the polish seems to be rather not liquid enough, hard to apply).</li>
