<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are very nice brushes.  Very soft, and easy to take care of.  These are very well made.</li>
    <li> Let me say at first I was a little hesitant to get these brushes. I don&#x27;t know why maybe cause they were different colors I automatically assumed they prolly would be crappy quality. Then my friend ordered a set and told me that she loved the brand Xtava and that they have high quality things. So of course I had to check them out cause I was drawn to the pretty colors and I&#x27;m a makeup fanatic and who doesn&#x27;t love makeup brushes, right?! I recieved these in the mail packaged in a shiny snake skin like holder and all the brushes came packaged in plastic which was nice. These brushes are not only gorgeous they are amazing quality. I really mean this when I say they are very soft and not scratchy to my face. I love that there is so many eye brushes in this set. I needed a lot of these type of brushes cause they are hard to find. I have had a chance to try most of them and loved everyone so far. Great price too for how many brushes u get!!! These brushes would also look so cute displayed on a vanity due to the vibrant beautiful colors. I really love these brushes. I do wish IT in included one more face brush possibly a smaller blush brush. But other than that it&#x27;s perfect. I Did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. These opinions are 100 percent my own and I will always be 100 percent honest with all my reviews.</li>
    <li> Brushes were bent with brissles falling out constantly. Very displeased</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday morning and my sister had asked me to do her make up. I decided to try the brushes to do her make up. I was happily surprised because I had read some bad reviews that the bristles where weak and that they fall apart. So I opened them up and I started to purposely pull on the bristles to see how easy they would come off. Nothing so I proceeded to do my sisters make up. I used the flat fan brush and the powder brush. The fan brush i used it for bronzer and i really liked the contour that it did. The large powder brush i used it for finishing powder and one little bristle did come off but i think it was because i used it to hard. Over all the brushes look of good quality but i will continue to use them and see how good they perform. Also the only bad thing I got and i think its not the companies fault but the packaging company is that my box where the brushes come in was really smashed.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are so nice. They are soft and comfortable to use with a wide variety.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set of brushes. The case is also pretty. There are lots of sizes and the color codes are helpful. I did receive a special price to review them but I would certainly buy them again or give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for myself but my daughter &amp;#34;claimed&amp;#34; them! They are great quality and love this set contains every brush i (she) will ever need! Will be ordering another set for myself.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They are super soft and have no fall out. They hold make up really well, too. They remind me of the Sonia Kashuk brushes but nicer. Great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> first off I love the colors. They are so cute! I&#x27;m not a big makeup person, but I feel like a professional with these brushes.  They are soft and good quality. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wow do I love this brush set.  The brushes are absolutely gorgeous and makes putting on makeup fun.  The brushes are great quality and I feel assured that they will last for a long time.  The bristles are very secure and when I used them I didn&#x27;t notice any escaping the handle.  It even comes in a nice rolled up carrying case.  The only thing I wish it had was the name/use for each brush actually printed on the side of the brush.  The only place I saw that there was an actual description for each brush was on the box itself.  That doesn&#x27;t do me any good unless I want to keep my brush set in the box to store it.</li>
    <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. I feel like a real makeup artist with this product. The hairs from the brushes do not fall out like most brushes. Great great product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! They are very durable and apply makeup evenly. I have already recommended them to a lot of family and friends. They are soft and fantastic! You need these brushes!</li>
    <li> I got these earlier than expected. They are definitely high quality brushes, with soft bristles. I love the colors(so does my toddler).&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the discount price and a great set of brushes!</li>
    <li> omgggg these brushes are amazing, gorgeous color!! and feel so smooth and great quality</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They are great quality. Aside from the loving the color variety it is very convenient to identify what brush I need instead of have to sift through the same color.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I swear it was a quick rushes delivery it took no time. When I use liquid foundation or powder it smooths on great. My eyeshadow is the same way I love these I would buy them as a gift for woman.</li>
    <li> IÂ´m in LOVE with these adorable brushes. high quality ...Xtava 15 pcs makeup set is fantastic. I love the brigth colors</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes. I like the bright colors and they are very soft brushes.</li>
    <li> Beautiful set, thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Love these so much! Super cute and great quality!</li>
    <li> I love this! There&#x27;s a brush in this kit for everything! Theyre so soft and don&#x27;t fall out on your face like other brushes do! They also come in a very nice carrier! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I needed a few new makeup brushes and decided to buy this really complete kit since it had what I needed and a lot more.  The brushes are very nice and each one is a different color.  They run the gamut from large to small and there are eyebrow and eyelash brushes too.  The bristles are very nice and they apply the makeup really well too. Very pleased - very nice set.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this order. It&#x27;s been a while since I replaced some of my brushes and I wanted to get a good quality set. There are 15 different brushes in this Xtava set, ranging from foundation and powder brushes, eye shadow brushes, lip brush, and brow brushes. When attempting a certain look it&#x27;s important to use the brushes meant for it, and this set has it all. Working in the salon industry, I&#x27;ve come across many different makeup tools and Xtava is definitely a great quality! The vibrant colors make them more fun to use, and the clutch carrying case is a nice bonus! The interior has flaps to cover the bristles too so my brushes will last a long time. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are my own.</li>
    <li> These are the most incredible makeup brushes! They are extremely good quality without the fancy price tag. So far the bristles haven&#x27;t come out,,... Which is a huge plus!!  the colors are super vibrant as well!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I washed them the day they arrived.  I always wash my new makeup brushes before I use them.  Applying foundation with the foundation brush was good, my makeup didn&#x27;t appear cake-like. The different eye shadow brushes worked awesome and I was able to use many different techniques. The bright colors of the brushes are bonus and are great to look at and the travel case is perfect! I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give these a try.</li>
    <li> Not only are these brushes vibrant, bright colors, they&#x27;re also super soft! I used this entire set to do my face makeup and have to say i&#x27;m pretty impressed. This set definitely has a few brushes I know i&#x27;ll be using quite a lot.  I do suggest you wash these brushes prior to use to reduce the shedding and clean off any manufacturing particles. The color did NOT bleed on my brushes when I cleaned them so they&#x27;re dyed pretty well! Overall, this brush set is A+ Product provided at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Overall I feel like this brush set is a great deal. I love how colorful it is! I would say these brushes are of average quality, which is fair for the $40 price tag. The fan brush sheds a little, but otherwise the brushes have stayed intact well. The outside of the box has a picture of all the brushes and their names (see my photo for example), but I wish it said the name or purpose of each brush on the handles. The roll up case is perfect for traveling or just keeping all the brushes organized at home. This would be a great startup kit for a teenager, too. Again, this isn&#x27;t the same quality as my high-end brushes,Â  but the set is great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review -</li>
    <li> I LOVE MAKEUP, so I am a huge snob when it comes to makeup brushes. These are by far, the most gorgeous and vibrant brushes I have ever had the pleasure of owning. They come with 15 different pieces, and this is the first set of brushes where I actually use every single brush. They are super soft and hold up really well after washing them. The pictures do not do them enough justice. They are synthetic brushes which means they&#x27;re not going to start falling out after just one or two washes. I reviewed these at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I LOVE these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic. Its like painting on my eye shadow which means less wasted powder.  The only brush that wasn&#x27;t a 5 star was the flat yellow one, the bristles started coming off when I used it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! Wide variety of useful tools and stylish carrying case!</li>
    <li> It looks like the individual brushes may be of better quality than this set.  They shed and get worse when you wash them.  The are pretty but I would stay away!!!</li>
    <li> i love these brushes so much I am a huge fan of color but thats not the only reason i love them the are dense the shadow brushes really pack on the shadow well and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> So soft and work perfectly for contouring</li>
    <li> Got them, love them, want more.</li>
    <li> Great assortment! Powder brush wasn&#x27;t as expected but everything else is great and true colors to the picture!</li>
    <li> I love the colors! So far so good with these brush&#x27;s! I really like them.</li>
    <li> Love these! The colors are so fun and brushes are good quality</li>
</ol>
