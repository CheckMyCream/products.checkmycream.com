### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Though not inexpensive, probably the BEST toothbrush heads</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably one of the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned, so when given the option to try the Intercare brushes, I had to jump on it.  </li>
      <li>All my checkups using the Sonicare system have been excellent.</li>
      <li>Twice a day my teeth and gums get a wonderful cleaning with this brush head.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve started using this, and I am terribly impressed!</li>
      <li>you are reading this, you already KNOW how great the product is!</li>
      <li>This is probably the best brush head I have ever used on any of the 3-5 models of Sonicare brushes I have</li>
      <li>These Intercare replacement brush heads work best of all for me.</li>
      <li>Excellent toothbrush and would purchase another if anything happened to mine.</li>
      <li>Great price, arrived on time, and fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>The Intercare brush heads are a great addition to an already good product!</li>
      <li>you follow the directions for using the Sonicare, you can expect to be happy with the outcome, but the type of brush head can make an added difference.  </li>
      <li>These nice compact heads with their longer/shorter bristles on your Sonicare combined with flossing will keep your mouth and your dentist very happy.</li>
      <li>and it does a great job.  </li>
      <li>An exceptional head for my toothbrush, and the replacement head I will be using in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results this way and haven&#x27;t had the bleeding gum issue since.</li>
      <li>These brushes access more of the area between teeth which makes it a good product for those of us (like me) lazier about flossing (still a good idea to use floss but for those occasions when you don&#x27;t...).  </li>
      <li>They are made in Germany and it shows top quality in every way!</li>
      <li>They fit into place easily and have functioned with my Flexcare brush perfectly.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t prove it with a controlled study, or even a good explanation, but my gums feel better already.</li>
      <li>I feel they are superior to most competitors out there.</li>
      <li>The new Sonicare &amp;#34;Intercare&amp;#34; is also a great brush head--it also seems to do a great job with its deeper bristles.</li>
      <li>These heads fit perfectly and really do the job.  </li>
      <li>They are compact to get in the tighter areas of my mouth, and have heard from my dentist that my teeth have not looked better.  </li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>SO much better than the diamond toothbrush head replacements.</li>
      <li>What more can one ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>dentist said the Sonicare line was one of the best product lines on the market, and not only does he suggest them to patients, he has one himself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush because of</li>
      <li>I love that system and used for them for well over a decade.  </li>
      <li>My Dentist is always pleased after inspecting my teeth after a cleaning.</li>
      <li>They are contoured, supposedly to get between the teeth and do a better job of cleaning.  </li>
      <li>so make sure you check which are appropriate before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The head fits to the unit with a bit of stretch/resistance, and I&#x27;m hoping that means a better seal.  </li>
      <li>In time that passes, and each new head, whilst great, is never quite the</li>
      <li>I really loved the super clean feel I got with these brush heads.  </li>
      <li>I like the diamond-shaped brush heads better than these, the original style, but they&#x27;re still much, much better than brushing with a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; tooth</li>
      <li>Overall, very good for interdental cleaning.</li>
      <li>On top of that, I&#x27;ve got a whiter smile!</li>
      <li>My Dental Hygienist once told me my teeth were so clean I didn&#x27;t need a cleaning, the Dentist wasn&#x27;t too pleased hearing this comment so it hasn&#x27;t been repeated.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these brush heads for good dental health.</li>
      <li>This new head comes with a lot of hype about how good it is for one&#x27;s gums.</li>
      <li>But, even with diligent flossing, it&#x27;s important to get the areas between teeth</li>
      <li>Fortunately, that doesn&#x27;t happen with these heads.  </li>
      <li>and I am pain free.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable to use, even with all the bristles sticking out.  </li>
      <li>fix that I&#x27;ve relied on the compact brush heads that are available for Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>new head, however, was better than my memory of the 1st time!</li>
      <li>In their favor, the longer tufts do seem to get between teeth better than the previous two heads available for the Sonicare Flex system, and I&#x27;m sure many will love these.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel really clean</li>
      <li>Both my teeth and gums have gotten consistently clean bills of health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The longer bristles do make it easier to get between the teeth and provide a deeper clean.</li>
      <li>Yes, this type is easier to remove, easier to clean, but it&#x27;s also easier to snap and fall off while brushing.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find Intercare replacement heads for Sonicare - as promised and at a great price too!  </li>
      <li>I had forgotten how this had been true every time I&#x27;ve replaced the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I take such good care of my teeth</li>
      <li>The replacement brush heads are better than most standalone toothbrushes and last over six months without losing their ability to clean your teeth.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I was going to like this smaller head, as compared to the standard sonicare brush head, but these compact heads are great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I always feel like Sonicare brush heads are too soft, and so I was very happy to find out that these brush heads were quite firm and did seem to clean in between teeth well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also compatible with most Flexcare-pattern toothbrush handles and pulls on and off easily, so that &gt;1 people can use the same toothbrush.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the 30% premium.</li>
      <li>The scenario is two people sharing the same Sonicare, but they prefer to use their own brush head and therefore remove the head in order to swap it.  </li>
      <li>Sonicare system does use special brushes, and offer an outstanding  \\&quot;just back from the dentist for a cleaning\\&quot; feel and effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t explain it, but they feel better in general.</li>
      <li>I have two teeth that only look truly clean after I get a professional cleaning, and they are finally looking good!</li>
      <li>Yeah, okay, as clean as a human mouth can be, which isn&#x27;t so much, but you know...</li>
      <li>I have to say it doesn&#x27;t feel as good as brushing my teeth with either a standard or a sensitive head.</li>
      <li>Yeah, okay, as clean as a human mouth can be, which isn&#x27;t so much, but you know...</li>
      <li>+, FlexCare Platinum, Easy Clean, HealthyWhite and DiamondClean).&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the cost.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s easy to remedy with a sharpie or a dab of colored nail polish to clearly mark the otherwise identical heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive teeth, increase the brush time gradually and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>Cost seems a little high but to me its worth it keeping my teeth in the best possible condition.</li>
      <li>The four stars are for the expense of these replacement brushes and if&lt;br /&gt;you are consistent about using floss these brushes would be overkill.</li>
      <li>For the first 15 years, I was a fan of the Oral-B Braun electric toothbrushes with a rotary head.  </li>
      <li>Are they that much superior to be worth the extra cost is a question only you can answer.</li>
      <li>I personally like but don&#x27;t love the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>At first I was tempted to dismiss this as just another gimmick.  </li>
      <li>However, a tuft of bristles on one of the heads fell off the first time it was used.  </li>
      <li>then it&#x27;s a bigger savings (up to 15% more).  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I have, and now see oral hygiene as one of my most mission-critical daily chores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Of the replaceable brush heads, or maybe a different unit, in the search to find a more hygienic experience.)  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, i wasn&#x27;t sure if the Intercare brush head would make a difference over the Standard ProResults brush heads I have been using.</li>
      <li>they help get in between the teeth better than the regular heads?</li>
      <li>My teeth felt nowhere near as clean as they did with the intercare brush head on the sonicare.</li>
      <li>in all, it is a good brush design  for the variety, but we&#x27;ll probably go back to the regular design after these wear out.</li>
      <li>I really love my sonicare and couldn&#x27;t get along with out for long!  </li>
      <li>It stays tougher longer whereas the diamond gets soft really quick.</li>
      <li>My previous one didn&#x27;t have the kind of bristle which indicates it is worn out, and I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out it was.</li>
      <li>Mostly they seem to work just the same way that the previous brushes did, but the shape does seem like it should also be getting between my teeth a bit better.</li>
      <li>You have nothing to lose since they are certainly no worse</li>
      <li>On principle, I am very pro-generic and adverse to the idea of \\&quot;Give away the razor (or whatever) and make a bundle on</li>
      <li>Heads get in rotation as well, from gentle to floss brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are times when generic products match the fit, form, and quality of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Thorough, powerful, not damaging to my gums, and leaving me feeling like I just had a professional cleaning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve typically used and have been happy with the Standard ProResults brush heads, but I&#x27;ve often felt that the areas between my teeth weren&#x27;t getting enough reach to get clean.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really loved the super clean feel I got with these brush heads.  My teeth definitely felt like they had just been super polished.  Unfortunately I have sensitive gums and after a few days of use, my gums started to get a little raw and bleed.  I swapped back to my sensitive brush heads and the problem was solved.  I now brush with this brush head once or twice a week when I feel like my teeth need a more thorough cleaning and then swap out to my sensitive brush heads for regular brushing.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results this way and haven&#x27;t had the bleeding gum issue since.</li>
    <li> I recently had been diagnosed with the beginning stages of gum disease.  I switched to one of the Sonicare toothbrushes with these heads  and it has done wonders for my teeth and gums.  This was verified through my dentist.  Twice a day my teeth and gums get a wonderful cleaning with this brush head.  Three months ago I had bleeding gums and pain to now, no more bleeding gums and I am pain free.  I highly recommend these brush heads for good dental health.</li>
    <li> I already have Philips Sonicare Flexcare and Flexcare Premium brushes, and this brush head has an interesting new design, somewhat different than the standard Flexcare brushes in bristle shape. It&#x27;s a little stiffer and seems to reach more deeply between teeth than the standard brush. It&#x27;s also compatible with most Flexcare-pattern toothbrush handles and pulls on and off easily, so that &gt;1 people can use the same toothbrush. Also, the bristles will fade with use and you&#x27;ll know when to order a new set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to have any way of distinguishing one from another (the standard brush ships with slip-on rubber elastic bands of different colors). The bases are all the same white conical shape, but perhaps you may want to dot them with an indelible marker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a stimulating design, both for your gums and teeth and as a new variant on the Flexcare brush. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I personally like but don&#x27;t love the [[ASIN:B00CUG26ZE Philips Sonicare HX9002/64 Intercare Standard Replacement Brush Heads, 2-pack]] because they are stiffer than I like.  In their favor, the longer tufts do seem to get between teeth better than the previous two heads available for the Sonicare Flex system, and I&#x27;m sure many will love these.  Since I am a flosser, I find that I don&#x27;t really need a harder bristle to get between the teeth and they do sometimes bother  my sensitive gums.  I also have not found that my teeth are any cleaner than they were a couple weeks ago when I stated using this type of brush head on the Philips Sonicare HX6733/90 HealthyWhite 3 Mode Platinum Edition Rechargeable Toothbrush 2-Pack Bundle (2 Power Toothbrushes, 2 DiamondClean Brush Heads, 1 UV Sanitizer with Integrated Charger, 1 Travel charger, 2 Travel cases) which I purchased elsewhere.  I really don&#x27;t understand why this style of Sonicare brush heads are as expensive as they are, particularly since there is far less to the brush head than the previous Sonicare system which resembles the [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White]].  I love that system and used for them for well over a decade.  Yes, this type is easier to remove, easier to clean, but it&#x27;s also easier to snap and fall off while brushing.  That doesn&#x27;t help with the review for this particular brush head, just something I thought I&#x27;d mention for those who still haven&#x27;t tried an electric toothbrush but are investigating the brush heads for future reference.</li>
    <li> I have used several different Sonicare toothbrushes over ten years, and they have always performed well. The Intercare brush heads are a great addition to an already good product! I could feel the difference as soon as I replaced the regular brush head... the Intercare has a firmer feel, but does not bother my gums at all. The longer bristles do make it easier to get between the teeth and provide a deeper clean. Just remember not to press too hard with the brush... move around your mouth one tooth at a time, and let the Sonicare do the work!</li>
    <li> After having used the intercare brush head for about a week, I went on a trip and left my Sonicare toothbrush behind. I had to make do with a standard toothbrush. What a difference! My teeth felt nowhere near as clean as they did with the intercare brush head on the sonicare. Now, I know some of that is attributable to the sonicare itself, but there&#x27;s little downside to these brushheads. That said, I do not have complicated dental work, though I did have to have gum surgery a while ago. These brushheads cannot replace flossing, but they do seem to get in a bit deeper than the standard brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  In the past, I&#x27;ve used one of their cheaper ones and recently I upgraded to the HX6972.  It&#x27;s probably one of the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned, so when given the option to try the Intercare brushes, I had to jump on it.  My biggest complaint about these brush heads is the fact that they are smaller than the ones that come with the toothbrush or other replacement heads I&#x27;ve seen.  They are contoured, supposedly to get between the teeth and do a better job of cleaning.  I&#x27;ve been using them for over a month and I have noticed that they&#x27;ve improved my gum health more and it does feel like the plaque between my teeth is significantly less than with a standard brush.  I probably won&#x27;t know the extent until I go in for my next dental visit, but I really like these replacement heads.  The only complaint I can levy against them is that they were smaller than I was expecting.  Overall, very good for interdental cleaning.</li>
    <li> The similarly graduated brush heads for Oral-B were what I used previous to getting my (current) Sonicare Flex platinum.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to flat, one-length bristles after seeing what this kind of brush can do, getting into crevices at the back of the mouth, etc.  The price is one that has me forever chasing after sales and promotional offers, but I remain somewhat wary of generic brands, based on personal experience with the fit of brush head to base, and occasionally with the durability of the bristles.  On principle, I am very pro-generic and adverse to the idea of \\&quot;Give away the razor (or whatever) and make a bundle on blades\\&quot;.  I use refilled/non-OEM toner without remorse.  But you know, these are my TEETH.  Ever lose one?  Have to wear a partial, or go the implant route?  I have, and now see oral hygiene as one of my most mission-critical daily chores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping to find that I prefer this to the old E-series on my last Sonicare.  The head fits to the unit with a bit of stretch/resistance, and I&#x27;m hoping that means a better seal.  The worst thing about any of these electric heads are their propensity for seepage, resulting in a nasty petri-dish style experiment.  In. Your.  Toothbrush.  Not pretty.  The cynical side of me says they haven&#x27;t fixed that in all these years of production because it sells more units.  (Of the replaceable brush heads, or maybe a different unit, in the search to find a more hygienic experience.)  But there are hacks, including the [[ASIN:B001S2PLNK The Sonic Seal for E-Series Sonicare Replacement Heads, 3 Count (Blue, Pink, Frost)]], or just the cut off finger of a glove, with just a teensy (teensy!) snip off the tip to allow you to force it over the brush head, and down to the neck of the base, covering the area where brush head meets unit.  Recommended.  (Either, though I go the glove route.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a teensy head.  I will tend to brush before changing, because I can dribble a bit.  (Not something I do with all the brush heads out there.)  But that part is definitely a small price to pay for a really clean mouth.  Yeah, okay, as clean as a human mouth can be, which isn&#x27;t so much, but you know...I do with all the brush heads out there.)  But that part is definitely a small price to pay for a really clean mouth.  Yeah, okay, as clean as a human mouth can be, which isn&#x27;t so much, but you know...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush for 20 years.  For the first 15 years, I was a fan of the Oral-B Braun electric toothbrushes with a rotary head.  I really liked the cleaning power and the reach/accessibility that the small, round brush gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Oral-B lost its competitive advantage some time ago.  My teeth and gums feel cleaner with Sonicare.  I really like the battery life yet lightness of the handle.  The brush is even quieter...  The only issue I&#x27;ve ever had with the brushes is that I don&#x27;t have quite as much accessibility to the back of my mouth as I had with the Oral-B Braun brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix that I&#x27;ve relied on the compact brush heads that are available for Sonicare.  This new brush head is the same size as the full size brush head, but has bristles at different heights.  At first I was tempted to dismiss this as just another gimmick.  I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;diamond head\\&quot; brushes and found them to be only marginally better than the regular brush heads; they seem to last a little longer.  But these are different: this brush head gives me the size of a regular brush with the reach/access of a smaller brush head - I can finally get back behind my rear-most teeth because of the shorter bristles.  My teeth feel really clean now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would definitely buy these again, as long as the price is similar to the regular/compact brush heads.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are really an improvement over the other version I&#x27;d been using for the last 10 years or so - the [[ASIN:B0085RZLQS Philips Sonicare HX7023/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads, 3 Pack, Frustration Free Packaging]], but the price is way too high. If they become available through Subscribe &amp; Save, and the cost comes down to around $10 each, then I&#x27;d be a buyer, but at $13+ each, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the 30% premium.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a brush that fits out handles that my daughter could use with her braces. It is gentle and has long enough bristles to get around the wires and not disturb the brackets.</li>
    <li> The Intercare replacement brush heads differ from the Sonicare Standard brush heads (like the ProResults) in that they have several rows of longer bristles, which can help get the spaces between your teeth cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Sonicare Flexcare+ and have used one for several years now with terrific results.  Both my teeth and gums have gotten consistently clean bills of health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the directions for using the Sonicare, you can expect to be happy with the outcome, but the type of brush head can make an added difference.  I&#x27;ve typically used and have been happy with the Standard ProResults brush heads, but I&#x27;ve often felt that the areas between my teeth weren&#x27;t getting enough reach to get clean.  This is likely more common with adults as they get older than with younger, healthier teeth and gums, since the areas between the teeth can be a bit taller.  But, even with diligent flossing, it&#x27;s important to get the areas between teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, i wasn&#x27;t sure if the Intercare brush head would make a difference over the Standard ProResults brush heads I have been using. I was pleasantly surprised.  The few rows of longer bristles seemed too little to make a difference, but short of a professional opinion, I do think I can feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are the same size as the Standard brush heads, rather than the smaller compact heads.  Although some people may like the compact heads to reach toward the back teeth, I tend to like the larger standard brush heads and find little difference in how they reach the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need the extra reach, give these Intercare brush heads a try.  You have nothing to lose since they are certainly no worse then the other Sonicare brush heads available.</li>
    <li> I normally use the compact pro results brush head, but after giving these a try, I might just switch.  They are wider, but they still give you the ability to get each tooth, unlike some other wider brush heads.  I&#x27;ve found that with some wide brush heads, you can&#x27;t close your mouth around the wand effectively and toothpaste goo runs down to your hand.  Fortunately, that doesn&#x27;t happen with these heads.  They are firm and feel good on the teeth and gums, without being too fat or wide.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am currently using[[ASIN:B00CUG2582 Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] which is a great product albeit a bit expensive. These replacement brush heads are the same that come standard with the unit but will fit other Sonicare units as well. Be careful though, some of the older, cheaper Sonicare units will use a completely different type of brush so make sure you check which are appropriate before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about these is they are small enough to reach the back teeth, the bush head is designed in a way to work on plaque from different angles, and the bristles begin to fade in color alerting you it&#x27;s time to change heads. What I don&#x27;t like is the cost. Currently at $26.95 it becomes questionable, just like the Flexcare Platinum itself, on whether it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the results and the durability of both the electric toothbrush unit and the replacement heads. I feel they are superior to most competitors out there. Are they that much superior to be worth the extra cost is a question only you can answer. Personally I&#x27;m not sure they are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Phillips Sonicare for several years.  These heads fit perfectly and really do the job.  My teeth feel as clean as if I&#x27;d just left the dentist office.  All my checkups using the Sonicare system have been excellent.</li>
    <li> There are times when generic products match the fit, form, and quality of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34;. Generic brush heads are NOT an example of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with these Phillips brand replacements, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I like the diamond-shaped brush heads better than these, the original style, but they&#x27;re still much, much better than brushing with a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the colored bristles that let you know when to replace too.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare for about 3 years. In this instance, since we received a 2 pack to review, I gave one each to my husband and daughter to try. Here is what they said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband: When we first got our Sonicares, your felt like you had just left the dentist after every brushing. In time that passes, and each new head, whilst great, is never quite the same.&lt;br /&gt;This new head, however, was better than my memory of the 1st time! Thorough, powerful, not damaging to my gums, and leaving me feeling like I just had a professional cleaning.An exceptional head for my toothbrush, and the replacement head I will be using in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter: I&#x27;m normally use a sensitive toothbrush head but this worked really well. Its a little compact head &amp; is a nice scrub not to soft or too hard. It hasn&#x27;t hurt my gums either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly doing an intensive study of my teeth now vs when I was using my previous Sonicare brush heads (which were just the standard ones that come with the flexcare), but I feel like my teeth are getting cleaner than they were. The shape and size of this brush head also seems to make it a little easier to maneuver it into the tighter spaces in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing at all has gone wrong with the brush heads. They fit into place easily and have functioned with my Flexcare brush perfectly. Mostly they seem to work just the same way that the previous brushes did, but the shape does seem like it should also be getting between my teeth a bit better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a problem lately with Sonicare heads where the head breaks when attempting to remove it from the toothbrush base.  The scenario is two people sharing the same Sonicare, but they prefer to use their own brush head and therefore remove the head in order to swap it.  The brush head breaks at its base rather than coming off the toothbrush.  This is an expensive problem!  I&#x27;ve now had this happen to 3 different heads :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush head quality problems plus quality problems on my expensive high end Sonicare model have me questioning the quality of Sonicare products.</li>
    <li> Hard to find Intercare replacement heads for Sonicare - as promised and at a great price too!  Highly recommended for sonicare users.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They are compact to get in the tighter areas of my mouth, and have heard from my dentist that my teeth have not looked better.  I thought the yellow part would be a bit firmer, but they just reach a bit deeper between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for 5 years or so and it&#x27;s really made a difference for my teeth and gums. I usually use the compact head as it helps me to reach my back teeth. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this head as it&#x27;s standard size and very different then the ones I&#x27;ve used previously, but I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth do seem even cleaner then with the regular head and it&#x27;s comfortable to use, even with all the bristles sticking out.  I like that you can use it with a number of different Sonicare toothbrushes (FlexCare, FlexCare +, FlexCare Platinum, Easy Clean, HealthyWhite and DiamondClean).&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the cost. Where  you normally get three heads for this price, you only get two of these, and I&#x27;m not sure why... Other then that, it really does make a difference on my teeth and is recommended.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I was going to like this smaller head, as compared to the standard sonicare brush head, but these compact heads are great.  The 3 rows longer bristles actually do get in between teeth and feel like they are massaging my teeth and gums.  I really love my sonicare and couldn&#x27;t get along with out for long!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how expensive it is just for a two-pack of brush heads.  But thankfully Amazon has some of the cheapest prices around and if they will add these to the \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; category then it&#x27;s a bigger savings (up to 15% more).  I&#x27;m still waiting on that - I get the standard replacement heads that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up - if you don&#x27;t already have a Sonicare - get one.  Floss your teeth and then brush using your Sonicare with one of these heads.  These nice compact heads with their longer/shorter bristles on your Sonicare combined with flossing will keep your mouth and your dentist very happy.</li>
    <li> The regular heads we&#x27;ve used with the Sonicares we have have longer bristles at the top of the brush which help to reach in between the teeth and the backs of the last molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This head has an interesting design where the bristle groups alternate between short and long throughout the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do they help get in between the teeth better than the regular heads? I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the design seems to make for a sturdier brush head and I&#x27;ve found that the head doesn&#x27;t wear out as fast as the regular versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the bristle groups alternate in height, it&#x27;s harder for the head to reach behind the molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a good brush design  for the variety, but we&#x27;ll probably go back to the regular design after these wear out.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush system for over a year now and I am very pleased with its performance. The replacement brush heads are better than most standalone toothbrushes and last over six months without losing their ability to clean your teeth. I would highly recommend this system and the replacement brush heads.</li>
    <li> Great price, arrived on time, and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> This brush head came out recently--in response to the Oral B &amp;#34;Deep Sweep&amp;#34;--I think.  Anyway, I use both Sonicare and Oral B electric toothbrushes and like both.  The &amp;#34;deep sweep&amp;#34; brush head is the only one I use with the Oral B and it does a great job.  The new Sonicare &amp;#34;Intercare&amp;#34; is also a great brush head--it also seems to do a great job with its deeper bristles. I have used other Sonicare brushes and like all of them, but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> SO much better than the diamond toothbrush head replacements. It stays tougher longer whereas the diamond gets soft really quick.</li>
    <li> Though not inexpensive, probably the BEST toothbrush heads I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare system does use special brushes, and offer an outstanding  \\&quot;just back from the dentist for a cleaning\\&quot; feel and effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said the Sonicare line was one of the best product lines on the market, and not only does he suggest them to patients, he has one himself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this, you already KNOW how great the product is! At times I have seen Amazon offer promotions, so the price may go up or down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smile ON!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of these particular replacement heads.  I have been using the ProResults brush heads and decided to try to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; my experience.  These left my teeth feeling less clean and my gum/teeth in pain after use. I used it three times and am now going back to the tried and true (and less expensive!) ProResults.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush because of it&#x27;s ease to use and effectiveness for those of us that are lazier about brushing.  These brushes access more of the area between teeth which makes it a good product for those of us (like me) lazier about flossing (still a good idea to use floss but for those occasions when you don&#x27;t...).  The four stars are for the expense of these replacement brushes and if&lt;br /&gt;you are consistent about using floss these brushes would be overkill.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush and would purchase another if anything happened to mine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I really want to rave about this product completely.  I always feel like Sonicare brush heads are too soft, and so I was very happy to find out that these brush heads were quite firm and did seem to clean in between teeth well.  However, a tuft of bristles on one of the heads fell off the first time it was used.  It was probably a minor design flaw, and I haven&#x27;t had the same problem with the other one.  That may cost this product a star, but if that was a fluke happening, then I have no doubt that you&#x27;ll like these brush heads if you&#x27;re looking for a firmer Sonicare experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Sonic technology Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes for many years now and must say they keep improving the technology, from the handheld base to the brush heads. These Intercare replacement brush heads work best of all for me. The extra reach of the inside longer three tufts of specially designed bristles really get between my teeth and also clean along and under the gum line without being painful. My mouth always feels fresh and clean long after using my Sonicare toothbrush but adding these new Intercare brush heads improves to the final job. Time will tell how long the bristles stay firm but so far they feel firmer than the other brush heads. They are made in Germany and it shows top quality in every way! Cost seems a little high but to me its worth it keeping my teeth in the best possible condition. My Dentist is always pleased after inspecting my teeth after a cleaning. My Dental Hygienist once told me my teeth were so clean I didn&#x27;t need a cleaning, the Dentist wasn&#x27;t too pleased hearing this comment so it hasn&#x27;t been repeated.</li>
    <li> I have a sonic and rotary type electric toothbrush, I feel that what one misses, the other catches. Heads get in rotation as well, from gentle to floss brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite. Staggered and slightly stiff bristles get into every nook and crannie. If you have sensitive teeth, increase the brush time gradually and you&#x27;ll be fine. At first, I had to be careful to keep the head angled down on the top teeth, up on the bottom...there was a slight irritation before getting used to it, but only for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel slick, clean, and fresh.</li>
    <li> I had just replaced the head on my Philips Sonicare. My previous one didn&#x27;t have the kind of bristle which indicates it is worn out, and I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out it was. So, I got my usual, the \\&quot;ultra soft\\&quot; heads [[ASIN:B0086VIA0M Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive, 3 Brush Heads]]. In spite of their being so soft, my gums were bleeding a little bit every time I brushed my teeth. I had forgotten how this had been true every time I&#x27;ve replaced the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I got this new Intercare head, saw how much harder the bristles are, and how there&#x27;s these bristles that jut out and whatnot, I was skeptical that I&#x27;d find it comfortable, or that my sensitive gums could take it. First off, the way it felt was a surprise, and a week later, I haven&#x27;t quite gotten used to it. I have to say it doesn&#x27;t feel as good as brushing my teeth with either a standard or a sensitive head. It&#x27;s a bit of a bumpy, noisy ride! You may be wondering, why on earth, then, has this reviewer given the product five stars?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve started using this, and I am terribly impressed! My teeth are whiter than I&#x27;ve ever seen them! I have two teeth that only look truly clean after I get a professional cleaning, and they are finally looking good! I take such good care of my teeth that it&#x27;s been disheartening spending two minutes twice a day with an electric toothbrush and have them not look clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker is that my gums are not bleeding. I can&#x27;t explain it, but they feel better in general. This new head comes with a lot of hype about how good it is for one&#x27;s gums. I can&#x27;t prove it with a controlled study, or even a good explanation, but my gums feel better already. On top of that, I&#x27;ve got a whiter smile! What more can one ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the old price? Nonetheless: five stars!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best brush head I have ever used on any of the 3-5 models of Sonicare brushes I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just put a new brush on my Sonicare when this one arrived, so I&#x27;m not comparing it to a ragged old one...this new Intercare brush gives an exceptional feeling of clean, especially in hard to reach places. And awful as it is to mention it, there are more of those as I age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that I had some sensitivity during the first week while I was adjusting to the new brush. It seems to have resolved, but if it returns, I could use a calmer setting, or alternate with Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> My family has been using Sonicare brushes for at least 4 years and they&#x27;ve definitely made a difference for us: less &#x27;scraping&#x27; time during a cleaning and no cavities for my kids (so far). (They use the Sonicare for Kids system.)  We&#x27;ve been using the standard Pro Results brush heads and these InterCare brush heads are definitely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternating long/short bristles are stiffer and denser than the standard brush heads which results in a smoother feel after brushing.  Because the brush head is stiff, you don&#x27;t want to press hard on your teeth and gums; just let the Sonicare system do the work.  (I tend to lean toward the shorter Go Care time or the sensitive setting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snap on brush heads work on several different types of Sonicare brushes and there are 2 brush heads in a package.  The only problem we&#x27;ve had here is that the brush heads don&#x27;t allow you to attach the colored rings that identify whose brush head is whose if you share a Sonicare. That&#x27;s easy to remedy with a sharpie or a dab of colored nail polish to clearly mark the otherwise identical heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes--there is an expense with the Sonicare system, but our improved dental health has saved us in the long run.</li>
