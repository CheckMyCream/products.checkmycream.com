      <li>Liked it</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>I have bought the cheaper plastic ones and the bristles start to break and curl very easy.</li>
      <li>yet I figured an exchange for just the defective one would be suitable.</li>
      <li>Cleans great and also is easy to wash off the soap once my hands are clean.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 and am glad I did.</li>
      <li>This one is softer on the skin, while feeling like it is doing a better job of cleaning all around the nail.</li>
      <li>I love this nail brush.</li>
      <li>Top of the line for a nail brush.</li>
      <li>and I totally love them.  </li>
      <li>The wood is great; durable, easy to hold, and actually looks nice!</li>
      <li>The new ones received were in great shape and after weekly use, they continue to prove their value.</li>

      <li>The bristles move much better than the cheap plastic ones at dime stores.</li>
      <li>I ordered this little gem and was focused mostly on finding the best quality from a well established company, i.e a non-Chinese product.</li>
      <li>I love this brush and bought two more right after I got these two.  </li>
      <li>Although beautiful and sturdy, upon opening the package one of the nail brushes was found to be defective, as its wooden frame is splitting apart.</li>
      <li>works and feels fine.  </li>
      <li>Spend the extra money and get a quality brush from a reputable German company that KNOWS how to make an excellent hand brush.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Simple and good quality, but does not hold up in the shower</li>
      <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness and they are comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far they are okay.</li>
      <li>The difference between natural bristles and the cheap synthetic ones is surprisingly significant.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them!!</li>
      <li>It helped to soak them in bleach the first time this happened.  </li>
      <li>Great nice and stiff but not too harsh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned to make sure they are kept in a dry place.  </li>
      <li>This brush is built to last, fits well in large hands and the bristles have right amount of stiffness needed to clean my hands.</li>
      <li>These brushes are very well made.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant about spending this much on a hand brush.</li>
      <li>This item is very well constructed.</li>
      <li>nicely made and the bristles are perfect,&lt;br /&gt;natural, not to stiff,</li>
      <li>Although these brushes appeared to be very nice when new, they began to show black (mold, I presume) in the wood and bristles within weeks and now one is also starting to split.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>WELL MADE and WELL DESIGNED brush high  </li>
      <li>The other one is fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The curved bristles are extremely stiff, and the longer ones softer, so you should be able to get all the gunk out from beneath your fingernails.</li>
      <li>The size of the block is large enough to get a good grip and the stiffness of bristles, along with the angled position, helps to get tough dirt from under your nails.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about spending more on these brushes, but they are definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for a nice&lt;br /&gt;nail brush, and this one is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>So far this still looks brand new.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I think the wood may be susceptible to early splitting.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t leave them in water and try to shake as much water off them as possible with each use.</li>
      <li>however I&#x27;ve had many wooden nail brushes in the past and mold was never a problem.  </li>
      <li>So, a little fussy, but still worth every cent.</li>
      <li>Very firm bristles that clean well.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d already returned them and received a 2nd set direct from Amazon.</li>

<li> Though I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;m willing to give them another go</li>
<li> It&#x27;s splitting from the base of the larger bristles, up and &amp; into the smaller set of bristles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Appears to be first-rate top-quality product.  works and feels fine.  Hope they last fourty years like my last one.</li>
    <li> I love this nail brush. The difference between natural bristles and the cheap synthetic ones is surprisingly significant. This one is softer on the skin, while feeling like it is doing a better job of cleaning all around the nail. The wood is great; durable, easy to hold, and actually looks nice! I was skeptical about spending more on these brushes, but they are definitely worth the money! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very firm bristles that clean well. Exceptional quality.  I have dry cuticles and dirt and rough skin tend to accumulate under my nails. Nothing cleans as well as these do.</li>
    <li> Great nice and stiff but not too harsh. I bought 2 and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I ordered this little gem and was focused mostly on finding the best quality from a well established company, i.e a non-Chinese product. I was not disappointed. This is a very nice brush! It fits my hands perfectly and the stiffness of the bristles was exactly what I wanted. Spend the extra money and get a quality brush from a reputable German company that KNOWS how to make an excellent hand brush. I love this brush and bought two more right after I got these two.  Remember that this product comes in a TWO brush pack. Excellent Christmas stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very well made.  The bristles are firm and do the job.  The nail brush side is angled so that it makes it easier to get under your nails.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Top of the line for a nail brush.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good hand and nail brush made in the states, but you know that story.  This brush is built to last, fits well in large hands and the bristles have right amount of stiffness needed to clean my hands.</li>
    <li> Although these brushes appeared to be very nice when new, they began to show black (mold, I presume) in the wood and bristles within weeks and now one is also starting to split. I don&#x27;t leave them in water and try to shake as much water off them as possible with each use. I even tried a chlorox solution to see if I could get rid of the black in the wood and bristles, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help. Considering the price, I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Expensive but very effective with soap for cleaning after getting my hands dirty.</li>
    <li> These are the nicest nail brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. The size of the block is large enough to get a good grip and the stiffness of bristles, along with the angled position, helps to get tough dirt from under your nails. The only added recommendation I would make is to treat the wood initially with an oil such as one used to treat outdoor wooden furniture. Otherwise, I think the wood may be susceptible to early splitting. A+++++.</li>
    <li> WELL MADE and WELL DESIGNED brush high  quality great bristle density really cleans your nails the angle brushes are just rightly placed and the main brush is also great for cleaning your hands all in all a quality product Should last for years Liked it so well I bought the foot brush and 2 long handle back brushes A quality item in every respect!!!</li>
    <li> This item is very well constructed. I was hesitant about spending this much on a hand brush. After using it for a month I am very happy with the product. I have bought the cheaper plastic ones and the bristles start to break and curl very easy. So far this still looks brand new. Cleans great and also is easy to wash off the soap once my hands are clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for a nice&lt;br /&gt;nail brush, and this one is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Very nicely made and the bristles are perfect,&lt;br /&gt;natural, not to stiff, not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;Should last me out!</li>
    <li> After years of unsatisfactory drugstore fingernail brushes, I decided to bite the bullet and get these pricier ones. I got two of them - one for upstairs, one for down - and I totally love them.  The bristles are just the right stiffness and they are comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one drawback and that is the wood tends to go black, as with mold, if they&#x27;re left sitting in a damp soapdish.  I&#x27;ve learned to make sure they are kept in a dry place.  It helped to soak them in bleach the first time this happened.  So, a little fussy, but still worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Simple and good quality, but does not hold up in the shower—the wood began to crack and then shortly thereafter it began to mold. Not a big deal (and maybe obvious to other people), but as long as you don&#x27;t plan on getting it very wet you&#x27;ll be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved bristles are extremely stiff, and the longer ones softer, so you should be able to get all the gunk out from beneath your fingernails.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I received these brushes as the bristles are great and the angle of them cleans well.  One week later however my brush was covered in green mold!  The bristles did not have any mold but every surface of the wood had molded.  I do live in an area that is cold and wet so it takes a long time for things to dry out however I&#x27;ve had many wooden nail brushes in the past and mold was never a problem.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item as a two-pack. Although beautiful and sturdy, upon opening the package one of the nail brushes was found to be defective, as its wooden frame is splitting apart. It&#x27;s splitting from the base of the larger bristles, up and &amp; into the smaller set of bristles. The other one is fine.  If I were to keep the defective one as is, it will eventually fall apart with actual use. Due to where the split is the upper bristles will fall out and prove to be useless. Though I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;m willing to give them another go and considering I&#x27;ve not used either yet I figured an exchange for just the defective one would be suitable. Unfortunately exchange is not available on this item so I have to return both then repurchase. What a pain and total waste of shipping and time, on all accounts. Arrghh!!!  My 2-star rating is based on the fact that the wood is split without having been used nor subjected to soap, water, environmental stresses, etc. Add to that, there&#x27;s no alternative for an exchange just for the single defective product and the chance I&#x27;m taking on yet another set having one or both defective.  I&#x27;ll update as my circumstances warrant.  UPDATE (March 9, 2015) - Should&#x27;ve updated sooner. The vendor offered to exchange them at no cost to me but I&#x27;d already returned them and received a 2nd set direct from Amazon. Kudos to the vendor for their concern and offer. The new ones received were in great shape and after weekly use, they continue to prove their value. We especially appreciate the shorter-bristle side for use under the fingernails.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Dad who works with lots of grease in his machine shop.  He gets lots on his hands and under his finger nails.  These work perfectly for him, and are pleasantly designed to look nice in the bathroom, as well.  Good workmanship &#x3D; the bristles are holding well in the wood.  And a pack of two allows him to keep one in the bathroom by his shop, one in the bathroom by his bedroom.</li>
    <li> I was greatly impressed with the quality of the brush. Bristles are plenty stiff and seem like they will last.</li>
    <li> I just got these in themail and I just started using the brush. So far they are okay. They appear to be of good quality and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Well made</li>
    <li> Functional and attractive.  Who knew a nail brush would be so nice looking?  I don&#x27;t need to hide it any more!</li>
    <li> Nice looking bursh with excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the Back brush. Great quality would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are well made.  The bristles move much better than the cheap plastic ones at dime stores.</li>
    <li> great product, great service</li>
    <li> Great brushes, and the bristles are perfect.  Highly recommend them!!</li>
