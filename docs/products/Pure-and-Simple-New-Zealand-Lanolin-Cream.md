      <li>We love this cream....</li>
      <li>She immediately asked me to order two more.</li>

      <li>This product has a strong fragrance for something that is supposed to be ok for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Love the soft texture and light clean scent.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to rub in, with a soft hand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and really softens my skin.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My 80 year old wife found it to be magical.  </li>
      <li>Everything very positive.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and is exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Nice for daughters flawless skin but not mine.. not enough moisture for my super dry skin... need something stronger but will buy again for little one.</li>
      <li>When I first tried this, the smell put me off.  </li>
      <li>In NZ we use lanolin for a few things even good for babies bums very soothing or as a face cream.  </li>
      <li>Rather expensive, but very good.</li>
      <li>It takes just a dab to cover your whole face.</li>
      <li>, she is very tender to the touch</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>thick, rich, light scent...perfect.</li>
      <li>Have gotten this and a similar product by this company several times because they work better than any widely available commercial products for very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Maybe, it is because that I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>There is nothing pure or simple about this product.</li>
      <li>Arrived in a classy box with natural packing materials; each of the two jars were wrapped in signature tissue.</li>
      <li>My 3 year old son calls it the squishy cream</li>
      <li>(Even if you are sensitive to perfumes.)</li>
      <li>Use as a face creme and though I have sensitive skin, no problems.</li>
      <li>I offered it to my neighbor, and she said it smells like old folks.  </li>
      <li>For the first time going to the dry air of Colorado did not bother me.</li>
      <li>My husband uses daily to repair dry skin, it absorbs quickly and no girly smell.</li>
      <li>but there is no other choice either.  </li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the description carefully, this product was not what I was expecting--which was pure lanolin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I can use it on my feet since they&#x27;re far enough away from my nose!!</li>
      <li>its works wonderfully on dry skin and we also rub it on our drum heads (congas) and it makes them like (almost) new again.</li>
      <li>OK as a finishing cream, but NOT appropriate for heavy duty treatment for dried/cracked body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smooth texture, light fragrance, not oily. Keeps skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used after bathing or before going to bed at night. Highly recommended. Delivered promptly</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is exactly as advertised.  Good quality and pleasant smell.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> There is nothing pure or simple about this product. It is 99 and 44/100ths per cent manufactured chemicals and it is scented. I tried some before going to a get-together and one person had to leave the room because the odor caused a reaction and gave her a headache. I was distraught! AND they wouldn&#x27;t take it back. I won&#x27;t buy this again and may never buy from Koru Naturals either, if they won&#x27;t tell the truth about the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Five million sheep can&#x27;t be wrong.  I use it on my feet, which tend to get dry and cracked.  I put it on every night.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great service from this buyer - would definitely buy again, and/or recommend to others.</li>
    <li> We love this cream....its works wonderfully on dry skin and we also rub it on our drum heads (congas) and it makes them like (almost) new again.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product for relieving the itch from an allergic rash. I have tried many. It has a very mild, pleasant smell. (Even if you are sensitive to perfumes.)

    <li> It is a very good product , as described and works well,on dry chapped skin ..  I wish the jars were a bit larger as it goes away quickly when family members and neighbors help themselves ..</li>
    <li> I had used this product once before and was very satisfied with it and I was excited to be able to find it on amazon</li>
    <li> When I first tried this, the smell put me off.  Then my husband said that it smelled like a nursing home.  I offered it to my neighbor, and she said it smells like old folks.  Hmmmmm.  Maybe they need to adjust the scent??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually felt pretty good on my skin, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the odor.</li>
    <li> We have found that this lanolin cream work wonders.  My husband uses daily to repair dry skin, it absorbs quickly and no girly smell.</li>
    <li> very good for my skin help to keep it soft and I husband love it to I used it on my hands and feet good product&lt;br /&gt;and I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> FEELS SO GOOD ON SORE HANDS.  I AM ALLERGIC TO PETROLIUM PRODUCTS AND THEY ARE IN LOTIONS</li>
    <li> It helped to reduce the dry skin on my face. The product is as good as reflected in the advertisement.</li>
    <li> Nice for daughters flawless skin but not mine.. not enough moisture for my super dry skin... need something stronger but will buy again for little one.</li>
    <li> All lanolin products are not equal. I am using this cream on dry, cracked skin on my hands. It doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> For the first time going to the dry air of Colorado did not bother me. My feet were smooth withouth cracks.</li>
    <li> No household should be without this!</li>
    <li> Use it every time I go to the barn to take care of my horse... this has been a very cold winter here in southern vermont w/ sub-zero temps many a night.  Love the soft texture and light clean scent.  Rich w/out being too thick- absorbs easily and gives lots of protection against the elements.</li>
    <li> This product works well on really dry skin.  I frequently help an older lady of ninety three and this cream is wonderful, she is very tender to the touch and it&#x27;s very easy to rub in, with a soft hand. In NZ we use lanolin for a few things even good for babies bums very soothing or as a face cream.  Always buy a good product as I am sure this is.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Have gotten this and a similar product by this company several times because they work better than any widely available commercial products for very dry skin.  Rather expensive, but very good.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t meet my &#x27;lanolin&#x27; expectations. After 3-4 weeks of use, at least twice daily, the results were no different than ANY cheaper lotion that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for those we want something lighter than pure lanolin.  I highly recommend it.  Fairly priced too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and soothes my face of harsh creams without burning.  This is by far my most favorite cream, no chemical added and I do not break out when using it.  It is not vegan, a big concern for me but there is no other choice either.  The vendor also was prompt and courteous, I hope they keep up their job of providing this wonderful product.  Try it to erase those crows feet with tenderness.</li>
    <li> It is way too smelly. Too sweet and smell stays with you. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Maybe, it is because that I have very sensitive skin. After I apply it on my face, I have allergic reaction. It has a kind of strong aromatic smell and I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
    <li> Works wonders in my dry, elevated climate.  Not a greasy feel.  Slight fragrance.  I would highly recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and arrived in good condition. Shipping was free when I bought a double order. It takes just a dab to cover your whole face. The cream is non greasy but immediately softens the skin. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really a delightful product! Not only does it feel good, it smells GREAT!! I actually bought it for leather treatment, but it does some terrific stuff for your skin!</li>
    <li> Excellent for hands and face.  Good smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for keeping in moisture. The scent is very, very mild and I love it, too. Best price for a very pure product!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I immediately began using it.</li>
    <li> Reordered this. Lasts a long time. Use as a face creme and though I have sensitive skin, no problems. Light, mild scent.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! The skin on my face is so much softer and the few zits I always seemed to have are gone.  I had no idea it had antibacterial, antimicrobial properties when i bought it. I have switched to this for my face cream forever.  My 3 year old son calls it the squishy cream and we use it on his chapped lips because it heals like neosporin and does not burn at all.</li>
    <li> Lanolin is a great moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this cream.  It was disappointing, and has not been relegated to the bottom drawer awaiting its final fate!</li>
    <li> This product has a strong fragrance for something that is supposed to be ok for sensitive skin. I had to wash my face after I applied the cream because the grandma perfume smell was giving me a headache. (No offense to grandmas.)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I can use it on my feet since they&#x27;re far enough away from my nose!!</li>
    <li> My 80 year old wife found it to be magical.  It is odor free, and works wonders on her skin.  She immediately asked me to order two more.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Everything very positive. On my third jar!</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the description carefully, this product was not what I was expecting--which was pure lanolin. (The goopy, greasy kind!) Instead, it is a more cosmetically elegant cream with a perfumey scent. OK as a finishing cream, but NOT appropriate for heavy duty treatment for dried/cracked body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must note that the packaging was OUTSTANDING. Arrived in a classy box with natural packing materials; each of the two jars were wrapped in signature tissue. The out-of-box experience was divine.</li>
    <li> It seems to be impossible to find lanolin cream in a retail store.  But I went to Amazon and found this lovely product.  I love it.  It&#x27;s light and really softens my skin.</li>
    <li> make my own hand creams and lip glosses,, and this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent product also recommended by my Doctor</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Came to my door within days. Love it...thick, rich, light scent...perfect.</li>
