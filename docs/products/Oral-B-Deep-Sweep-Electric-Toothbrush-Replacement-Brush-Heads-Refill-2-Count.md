      <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with this brush head, that I had to write a review for this ASAP right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I wish they would put more (and also softer) moving bristles on the head though.</li>
      <li>If feels much more like a manual toothbrush with the benefits of the electric toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>does not do much more than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>this is a great brush head option - I really like how these longer bristles can get up under gumline and between teeth.</li>
      <li>but this is much better.</li>
      <li>Because the bristles move in every direction it&#x27;s covering more area.</li>
      <li>GREAT NEW TOOL FOR MY BRAUN BRUSH .</li>
      <li>Great product for the price, delivery was early.</li>
      <li>Also good price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>WORKS REALLY GREAT FOR BACK TEETH .</li>
      <li>Fit my Oral-B and for the price?  </li>
      <li>Also because of this motion they get more in between your teeth which is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>My dental hygienists has never seen my teeth so clean...</li>
      <li>And after my last cleaning, my dentist remarked how clean my teeth were and in what good shape my gums were,</li>
      <li>My teeth feel super clean, as if I just visited the hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Ones that didn&#x27;t pass the full testing for quality?</li>
      <li>but there are a lot of &amp;#34;fakes&amp;#34; floating around or, perhaps ones the company felt weren&#x27;t good enough to package for retail.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this brush head because it was the biggest and it looks most like a normal toothbrush to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a dental hygienist, I wanted to try this new product to be able to recommend it or not.</li>
      <li>My gums also seemed more sensitive since using this one.</li>
      <li>However, when I want a real deep clean, no brush is better than this one.</li>
      <li>I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrush for more than 20 years on several models.</li>
      <li>I love  all the Oral-B product and all their various toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>, it says on this very page, &amp;#34;Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Complaints - the price is pretty high!</li>
      <li>The head is pointed so its so easily reaches the back</li>
      <li>Its large</li>
      <li>Oral B has several types of brushes to fit every need.  </li>
      <li>I really like my Oral B Toothbrush</li>
      <li>so I guess it&#x27;s really working well.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I really like the way it makes my teeth feel.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel much cleaner and this is my new brush head of choice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did order some more and will update in six months or less.</li>
      <li>The round ones work better</li>
      <li>you turn it on it moves back and forth at a pretty fast rate.  </li>
      <li>Just splattered more than the round heads.</li>
      <li>I bought this just to try something new.  </li>
      <li>This product seems to work so much better than the other smaller replacement toothbrush heads!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the round floss action head which was always ok, but I felt it was too hard on my gums, but didn&#x27;t clean the gum-line well without really angling and finagling the brush head in your mouth.</li>
      <li>I like this head much better than all of those typical (four of five different types that I have tried) circular heads for my Precision 5000.</li>
      <li>so it feels like a regular tooth brush, but it doesn&#x27;t feel large in your mouth.</li>
      <li>I THINK THE BRAUN BRAUSH IS GENIUS BECAUSE IT OFFERS  </li>
      <li>I prefer the floss action version.</li>
      <li>I had been using the Floss Action head.  </li>
      <li>I had the original round head whitening one</li>
      <li>also the head always seem either too small or too large for certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Their typical circular oscillating heads do not give me the clean feeling like other brands that I have also used.</li>

    <li> this is a great brush head option - I really like how these longer bristles can get up under gumline and between teeth.</li>
    <li> another tool in my arsenal</li>
    <li> I really like my Oral B Toothbrush but I hated how small the brush head was that came with it (the circular round one).

My teeth feel much cleaner and this is my new brush head of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints - the price is pretty high! Also if its wet and you turn it on it can spray everywhere.  Until I got used to it my bathroom mirror was a mess!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush and attachment ever made.. don&#x27;t waste your time with anything sonic care makes. I owed one for 10 years, and when the battery died I went to the Oral B.. My dental hygienists has never seen my teeth so clean...</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Works as it should</li>
    <li> Just had my 6 month check up.  I&#x27;m a smoker and the hygienist couldn&#x27;t believe the less amount of staining on my teeth.  I alternate use with the flossed brush head.</li>
    <li> Oral B has several types of brushes to fit every need.  I have a variety of them and rotate them as required.</li>
    <li> The round ones work better</li>
    <li> The replacement brush is one of the best buy you can make.how it design it leave that clan fill in you mouth,a good buy.</li>
    <li> the up down motion of the bristles is new to me.  I was always told by my dentist to brush my teeth that way but does anyone besides people on tv brush their teeth that way.  Well, this does it for you.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> GREAT NEW TOOL FOR MY BRAUN BRUSH . WORKS REALLY GREAT FOR BACK TEETH . I THINK THE BRAUN BRAUSH IS GENIUS BECAUSE IT OFFERS  SUCH AN ARRAY OF INTERCHANGABLE BRUSHES  TO CHOOSE FROM  FOR EACH NEED THAT ARISES</li>
    <li> Oral-B&#x27;s best brush head for these variety of electric toothbrushes.  These crush the standard round shaped models, as these leave you some stationary bristles to brush with manually while using the automated portion of the bristles.  Best of both worlds.  Also these brush heads tend to last longer and remain firm longer than the rotary model heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I do not acknowledge the other varieties, as they appear very niche to me - and not a real all around brush head.</li>
    <li> I prefer small-head brushes. However, when I want a real deep clean, no brush is better than this one.</li>
    <li> As a dental hygienist, I wanted to try this new product to be able to recommend it or not. I think it&#x27;s great! I think it does a great job at removing the plaque at the gumline and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a sonic toothbrush...it feels like an oral B!  Even though the head is larger, I still can maneuver it in my small mouth.</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement for the Oral-B at a good price. I did order some more and will update in six months or less.</li>
    <li> These are the only replacement heads I use for going on three years now. My teeth feel a lot cleaner than they ever did with a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Just splattered more than the round heads. I prefer the floss action version. My gums also seemed more sensitive since using this one.</li>
    <li> I love  all the Oral-B product and all their various toothbrushes.  Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had and teeth are cleanest ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this brush head, that I had to write a review for this ASAP right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the oral b electronic toothbrush for 10+ years, and I can&#x27;t believe they didn&#x27;t invent this toothbrush head early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the round floss action head which was always ok, but I felt it was too hard on my gums, but didn&#x27;t clean the gum-line well without really angling and finagling the brush head in your mouth. also the head always seem either too small or too large for certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush head solves ALL those problems. Its large so it feels like a regular tooth brush, but it doesn&#x27;t feel large in your mouth. The head is pointed so its so easily reaches the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweeping motion so it gets the gum-line with ease, and the bristles don&#x27;t hurt your gum-line. My teeth feel super clean, as if I just visited the hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m so ecstatic over a toothbrush, but I am.</li>
    <li> does not do much more than a manual toothbrush.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work so much better than the other smaller replacement toothbrush heads!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrush for more than 20 years on several models. Always wondered why they did not make the sweeping type brush head. Their typical circular oscillating heads do not give me the clean feeling like other brands that I have also used. Finally they did. I like this head much better than all of those typical (four of five different types that I have tried) circular heads for my Precision 5000. I wish they would put more (and also softer) moving bristles on the head though. Not sure what they were thinking putting &amp;#34;static&amp;#34; bristles on electric toothbrush heads. One star off for that.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, delivery was early. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this just to try something new.  I had been using the Floss Action head.  I really like the way it makes my teeth feel.  And after my last cleaning, my dentist remarked how clean my teeth were and in what good shape my gums were, so I guess it&#x27;s really working well.</li>
    <li> I had the original round head whitening one and it was good but this is much better. Because the bristles move in every direction it&#x27;s covering more area. Also because of this motion they get more in between your teeth which is exactly what I needed. The round one felt like it was polishing my teeth which wasn&#x27;t bad just not as effective. Also good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Fit my Oral-B and for the price?  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that these are the real Oral B Deep Sweep head. Or is it possible that they are seconds? Ones that didn&#x27;t pass the full testing for quality? This is just one head. Not 3, or 5 as they usually come but one, for $9.07. I see a few people as well that are complaining about how flimsy they seem yet the legitimate heads aren&#x27;t flimsy at all. And the packaging seems unlike what I have purchased before.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it says on this very page, &amp;#34;Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be careful purchasing these. I think some of the reviews are meant for the 3 or 5 pack Oral B Deep Sweep heads but there are a lot of &amp;#34;fakes&amp;#34; floating around or, perhaps ones the company felt weren&#x27;t good enough to package for retail.</li>
