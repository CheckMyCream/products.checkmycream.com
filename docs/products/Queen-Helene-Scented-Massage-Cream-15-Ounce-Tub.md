      <li>I love using it</li>
      <li>Love the smell and how it feels on my skin - not to greasy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a skin cream rather than a massage cream in texture and usability.</li>
      <li>It works as a massage cream, but it&#x27;s not as silky as most.</li>
      <li>It is cruelty free and made in the USA!  </li>

      <li>I have a skin clinic and love using it on dry skin but do add a little oil to it so it can glide on easily.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to give it only 3 stars, but it only worth it.</li>
      <li>It is very creamy, but once you massage it in, your skin is left looking and feeling</li>
      <li>I prefer creams that rub into the skin and live it feeling soft, I don&#x27;t like to have a residue left on my skin.  </li>
      <li>this one is NOT easy to clean, if you accidently touch some on you hair, it nightmare to wash out.</li>
      <li>but after little bit massage it getting smooth and thin, little oily but easy use water to wash ,its one have to use towel or cotton pad to clean.</li>
      <li>but my skin is so dry it soaks it up very well.  </li>

<li> Lasts for a long time and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  </li>
<li> I look forward to using this product for a long time to come.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick but very creamy and soaks into the skin.  </li>
<li> Had been using the kind they tell you to use but found it to be very expensive cream and didn&#x27;t work half as well as this almond cream.</li>
<li> Smell is little odd but to me that doesn&#x27;t matter because it gives my skin a perlour like facial</li>
<li> I also found that my skin stayed slick for a long time.  </li>
<li> but you have to use a little to massage your face.</li>
<li> If you like the shimmery, slick feeling of oil on your skin than this product is for you.  </li>
<li> I use to use anther one, was thick too,</li>
<li> I massaged this on my face and now my skin is no longer itchy and uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> I use this as a cold cream.  </li>
<li> with a dollar store cold cream</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So silky soft and has a wonderful scent</li>
    <li> When my massage lady  moved away. I came to Amazon to find the cream she used as it is the only cream that keeps my skin from flaking.  It&#x27;s thick but very creamy and soaks into the skin.  Lasts for a long time and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  Wonderful</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting.  I made the mistake of not washing it off and I got a&lt;br /&gt;rash over the treated areas.  I thought it was a leave on moisturizer.  It probably&lt;br /&gt;works as it was intended</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t want to give it only 3 stars, but it only worth it. this one is NOT easy to clean, if you accidently touch some on you hair, it nightmare to wash out. I use to use anther one, was thick too, but after little bit massage it getting smooth and thin, little oily but easy use water to wash ,its one have to use towel or cotton pad to clean. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This smells so good &amp; feels better. The biggest thing it&#x27;s not like the perfume kind that drys the skin and you can taste because it gets in your system. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I use this as a cold cream.  I love the scent!  It is cruelty free and made in the USA!  If you have issues with Pond&#x27;s, try this product.  I purchased this at Sally Beauty - 15 oz for $5.49!  Queen Helene has another one labelled as a cleansing cream - but I don&#x27;t like the jasmine scent.  I looked up this product on the Sally Beauty website and under the \\&quot;usage tips\\&quot; tab it says this can be used as an all-purpose cleansing cream!  I ran out and purchased some and I love it!  I had been experimenting (foolishly!) with a dollar store cold cream and it made my skin burn and turn red - never again!  I massaged this on my face and now my skin is no longer itchy and uncomfortable.  Thank you Queen Helene!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Mineral Oil, water, beeswax, paraffin, sodium borate, stearyl alcohol, fragrance, FD&amp;C yellow #5 &amp; #6, FD&amp;C red #40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would take out the coloring additives because I don&#x27;t understand why you need them, but other than that, amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells very nice like almond but you have to use a little to massage your face. I have a skin clinic and love using it on dry skin but do add a little oil to it so it can glide on easily. I love using it so it is good for the price</li>
    <li> If you like the shimmery, slick feeling of oil on your skin than this product is for you.  It is very creamy, but once you massage it in, your skin is left looking and feeling like you rubbed oil on it.  I also found that my skin stayed slick for a long time.  I prefer creams that rub into the skin and live it feeling soft, I don&#x27;t like to have a residue left on my skin.  It does moisturize well, but just wasn&#x27;t for me.  One positive about it....it smells great!</li>
    <li> Great massage cream. Has a reasonable smell.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on scars created by surgeries. Had been using the kind they tell you to use but found it to be very expensive cream and didn&#x27;t work half as well as this almond cream. Like the nice scent too, not over powering.</li>
    <li> really nice, but I am not a fan of the fragrance. a little strong for my taste, however, it works wonderfully and comes off easily, which is most important to me.</li>
    <li> scent could be better</li>
    <li> I love this massage cream, its great to use. The scent is very light. When it comes time to replace the jar I&#x27;ll buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best massage creams I regularly use at a most reasonable price.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much fragrance, and I love almond so I was looking forward to the almond smell. It works as a massage cream, but it&#x27;s not as silky as most. It tends to be quickly absorbed by my skin, which requires my massage therapist to keep using more and more to finish my massage. It&#x27;s more like a skin cream rather than a massage cream in texture and usability. It&#x27;s fine, I just won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it feels on my skin - not to greasy</li>
    <li> I was leary to use this product because of the price but when it arrived I was glad I took the chance.  It smells wonderful and moisturizes my hand and feet very well.  It says massage cream but my skin is so dry it soaks it up very well.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smell is little odd but to me that doesn&#x27;t matter because it gives my skin a perlour like facial</li>
    <li> After surgery on my arm, I needed a massage cream to assist in my rehab. This was a perfect fit for me. I look forward to using this product for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Good. such a nice price!!! but the feeling is so good!</li>
    <li> Creamy and smells good too.</li>
