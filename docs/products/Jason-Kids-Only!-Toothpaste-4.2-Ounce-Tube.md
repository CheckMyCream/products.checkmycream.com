      <li>My kids love this toothpaste and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride chemicals.</li>
      <li>Although we&#x27;re not yet sure which ingredient was causing the problem, calendula is in the ragweed family, and has been known to cause allergies.  </li>
      <li>The texture is also different--it&#x27;s more of a gel than a paste, so</li>
      <li>Switched to this product and the girls love it.  </li>
      <li>This product is more of a gel instead of a paste and the orange flavor has been a hit with our kiddos.</li>
      <li>my 3.5yrs girl love it</li>
      <li>my kids love this flavor.</li>
      <li>it was safe....</li>
      <li>My kids love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Kids love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>But my kids love it.</li>
      <li>It is natural, safe, and still does a great job.</li>
      <li>Kids love the flavor and flouride free, what we wanted</li>
      <li>I purchased the orange flavor and my daughter says it makes her mouth feel nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>They love the flavor still a little minty to it but great for the kiddos- love that it has no flouride!</li>
      <li>My kdis don&#x27;t like the strong flavor.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with the taste of this product, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Appears to work just fine - I tasted it, it tastes like oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best toothpaste that I could find for my one and a half year-old.</li>
      <li>This is fine for kids but also a good product for people with sensitive tongues.</li>
      <li>Kids weren&#x27;t a huge fan.</li>
      <li>there is no evidence that it is either safe nor useful in dental/internal applications.</li>
      <li>Flouride FREE</li>
      <li>Kinda pricey in stores; better value through Amazon subscription, where cost gets much more reasonable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Would love to see Amazon consistently include ingredients lists.  </li>
      <li>The kids didn&#x27;t love the taste of this toothpaste and we thought it smelled funny.  </li>
      <li>A friend asked me to buy, I see the price is very cheap, and the pattern is very cartoon, hope the children will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>If you can get the plaque and bacteria off of your teeth, it probably doesn&#x27;t matter what you clean them with</li>
      <li>I love that it is all natural but please make it taste better.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste works very well and both of my children love the taste.</li>
      <li>I recieved the product yesterday and my 4 year old really liked it.</li>
      <li>Which is good enough for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Initially the flavor is good</li>
      <li>Yes, the advertising says &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s true.  </li>
      <li>While we have enjoyed Jason products and like the company&#x27;s philophies watch out for an allergic reaction, especially in sensitive kids.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad price for the money as well.  </li>
      <li>I use other JASON products (shampoo, etc) and am happy with them.</li>
      <li>Select safe, gentle and effective ingredients&amp;#34;, yet when I received the product, there were numerous causes for concern.</li>
      <li>Our favorite toothpaste we&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
      <li>Sea Fresh toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and that it won&#x27;t harm him even if he eats it twice a day.</li>
      <li>I switched him to my Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh toothpaste to which he has had no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it makes brushing teeth fun for them.</li>
      <li>This tube went right in the garbage</li>
      <li>I tried it, because I was surprised at the strong reaction.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as tasty as Burt&#x27;s Bees was &amp; has a slight baking soda flavor to it, but it&#x27;s still good</li>
      <li>I dismissed my son&#x27;s complaints at first, and then tried it myself.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know exactly).</li>
      <li>The Cosmetics Ingredient Review Board advises that it should not be used at more than a 5% concentration, and should only be used in wash-off products.</li>
      <li>There are several types of glycerine - some safe and some not.</li>
      <li>We love Jason Kids Only Toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My daughter is very picky about toothpaste, and this passed her test!</li>
      <li>and I will not be purchasing it unless JASON can convince me that this product is completely safe for my kids and all ingredients are absolutely necessary.</li>
      <li>Finally, and most concerning is that this is absolutely the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever seen that includes a poison control warning &amp;#34;Keep out of the reach of children under 6 years of age.</li>
      <li>But, this flavor isn&#x27;t good enough for them to eat, so they actually brush their teeth instead of snacking on it</li>
      <li>It is pretty much like washing your mouth out with citricy soap.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it is free from a lot of the poisons they usually load into kid&#x27;s toothpastes.</li>
      <li>Easy to get your kids to brush twice daily with this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My 4 yo wants baby toothpaste, because it&#x27;s ....</li>
      <li>and I really like it for them.</li>
      <li>my 2 yo wants his sister&#x27;s toothpaste, but he eats it.</li>
      <li>The flavor is not like a fresh orange, it felt like chewing old orange peels.</li>
      <li>My kids really didn&#x27;t care for this flavor.</li>
      <li>--regular old soap would probably get the job done, but this tastes much better than that and does have xylitol in it, which is supposed to help prevent cavities.</li>
      <li>When I purchase a supposedly safe and natural product for my children, I fully expect that it does not contain the potential to harm them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My kids just thought this flavor was ok, it is a bit sour for their personal taste. They are getting used to it, but we probably will not get it again.</li>
    <li> Initially the flavor is good but the after taste is gross and a little &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;.  Not sure whether we will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great taste my kids love it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it has no fluoride</li>
    <li> Good tasting toothpaste the kids will like and want to use.  Not a bad price for the money as well.  It has a nice orange taste.</li>
    <li> One little tube lasted us almost a year! My daughter loved it. When we finally switched over to &amp;#34;big girl&amp;#34; toothpaste she asked for the old kind back.</li>
    <li> My son loves oranges, but he didn&#x27;t care for this flavor.</li>
    <li> My kids thought it tasted gross wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My kids love the flavor. I was worried that maybe the natural toothpaste might not clean my children&#x27;s teeth as well as regular toothpaste but when I took them in for their cleaning at the dentist he told me their teeth look great. I&#x27;ve been using JASON toothpaste for my kids for two years now and I really like it for them.</li>
    <li> Kids love this toothpaste. It is great for babies and tastes okay. Easy to get your kids to brush twice daily with this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I use other JASON products (shampoo, etc) and am happy with them. Purchased this based partly on JASON&#x27;s code which includes &amp;#34;1. Select safe, gentle and effective ingredients&amp;#34;, yet when I received the product, there were numerous causes for concern. The ingredients list includes glycerine as it&#x27;s main ingredient. Glycerine is a very broad term to describe hundreds of varieties of triglyceride-stem compounds. There are several types of glycerine - some safe and some not. Which type is this - plant derived glycerol, or maybe a cheaper animal-based, or even synthetic glycol?  Second, the toothpaste contains caprylic/capric triglycerides. Why? While not harmful for external use (it is a skin softening agent derived from coconut often used in lotions) there is no evidence that it is either safe nor useful in dental/internal applications. Third, the second to last ingredient is &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34;! Why would you add alcohol to a kids&#x27; toothpaste? Finally, and most concerning is that this is absolutely the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever seen that includes a poison control warning &amp;#34;Keep out of the reach of children under 6 years of age. If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact poison control center immediately.&amp;#34; and instructions that you should consult a dentist or physician for children under 2. Even Crest doesn&#x27;t contain these warnings, and I know full well that that commercial chemically-based toothpaste shouldn&#x27;t be swallowed. That leads me to believe that perhaps this toothpaste is even more dangerous.  When I purchase a supposedly safe and natural product for my children, I fully expect that it does not contain the potential to harm them. This tube went right in the garbage and I will not be purchasing it unless JASON can convince me that this product is completely safe for my kids and all ingredients are absolutely necessary.</li>
    <li> Fluoride free kids toothpaste comes in a variety of flavors, but this is the only one my 4 year old son likes. Which is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appears to work just fine - I tasted it, it tastes like oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a repurchase.</li>
    <li> How nice to have another option of real good quality, flavor and all&lt;br /&gt;under one cap of paste.  Everyone, old and young like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(still in search of lady above:  Your little brat is too spoiled)</li>
    <li> We really liked this product and the fact that it was without artificial colors and gluten, sulfate, saccharin and fluoride free.  However, we realized that my son was allergic to it and it was causing daily wheezing.  Although we&#x27;re not yet sure which ingredient was causing the problem, calendula is in the ragweed family, and has been known to cause allergies.  While we have enjoyed Jason products and like the company&#x27;s philophies watch out for an allergic reaction, especially in sensitive kids.  I switched him to my Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh toothpaste to which he has had no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see Amazon consistently include ingredients lists.  In lieu of that, here is an ingredient list from Vitacost:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Kids Only toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Glycerin, aqua (purified water), silica, xylitol, xanthan gum, panthenol, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, calendula officinalis flower extract, calcium carbonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, natural flavor * certified organic vegetable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Sea Fresh toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Calcium carbonate, aqua (purified water), vegetable glycerin, sodium cocoyl glutamate, mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil, carrageenan, aphanizomenon flos aquae (blue green algae), aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf gel, bambusa arundinacea (bamboo) stem powder, carum petroselinum (parsley) extract, perilla ocymoides (perilla) seed extract, sodium bicarbonate, silica, stevioside, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste my very choosy child will use without a struggle...</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s less abrasive than typical toothpastes and more natural to be more sensitive for kids. As an adult, I don&#x27;t prefer it myself. But my kids love it. They like the taste.</li>
    <li> My three year old loves this toothpaste. She still isn&#x27;t spitting out toothpaste as well as she should be so we opted to continue with the no fluoride toothpaste for now. She calls this her Mr. Krabs toothpaste. She likes the flavor where other non-fluoride toothpastes she wouldn&#x27;t touch because of the flavor.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product yesterday and my 4 year old really liked it. I havent tried it yet but will be doing so as I hate mint, so orange seems pretty good.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a flouride free toothpaste w/ nothing artificial. Unfortunately, the flavor is terrible. I dismissed my son&#x27;s complaints at first, and then tried it myself. Yuck. We chucked it.</li>
    <li> My daughter will not use any other toothpaste beside this. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a safer toothpaste for my two-year-old daughter and this is just what I was searching for. I purchased the orange flavor and my daughter says it makes her mouth feel nice and fresh. The tube is a decent size and I&#x27;ve had no issues squeezing the toothpaste out. I will be purchasing this toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> my kids love this flavor. it makes brushing teeth fun for them.</li>
    <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste that I could find for my one and a half year-old. It&#x27;s so hard to find fluoride free at the store and with natural ingredients. My daughters a big fan of oranges and this is a plus that it taste like orange.</li>
    <li> Kids loved, cap closes all wonky though</li>
    <li> Switched to this product and the girls love it.  Will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> They love the flavor still a little minty to it but great for the kiddos- love that it has no flouride!</li>
    <li> The orange taste worked out better for my kids than strawberry, both my kids love it and they feel as if they have grown up a lot!</li>
    <li> Tasted weird. Kids weren&#x27;t a huge fan.</li>
    <li> My son loves it! Great taste and I will continue to use this brand... No chemicals, No fluoride, no junk</li>
    <li> My son loved the taste of it and was not scared to brush his teeth anymore once i introduced this him.</li>
    <li> My kdis don&#x27;t like the strong flavor.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this toothpaste did not have fluoride - I didn&#x27;t know such a thing existed.  If you don&#x27;t want fluoride (which I disagree with) you don&#x27;t need toothpaste.  This is a pointless product that acts as a flavor delivery system and you are spitting money down the sink.  Won&#x27;t help prevent tooth decay!</li>
    <li> Does not contain the detergent Sodium Laural Sulfide (Sulfate?) which I believe to be unhealthy and a contributor to canker sores. Does not contain fluoride (controversial, I know) which has been shown to decrease IQ scores in children. Tastes good.</li>
    <li> Contains Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate has the same initials as sodium lauryl sulfate, and the same risks.&lt;br /&gt;Under certain conditions, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate can break down and form carcinogenic nitrosamines. The Cosmetics Ingredient Review Board advises that it should not be used at more than a 5% concentration, and should only be used in wash-off products. Can be a contact allergen.</li>
    <li> Kids love the flavor and flouride free, what we wanted</li>
    <li> Our toddler loves this toothpaste! Doesn&#x27;t leave big white stains, and is preferred to chemical laden alternatives. I heartily recommend!</li>
    <li> The kids didn&#x27;t love the taste of this toothpaste and we thought it smelled funny.  It wasn&#x27;t our preference.</li>
    <li> Es la mejor pasta de dientes para mi bebe de 2 aÃ±os, le gusta el sabor y eso me ayuda en la dura tarea de cepillar sus dientitos varias veces al dia.</li>
    <li> Kids don&#x27;t like the taste at all!</li>
    <li> I ordered this toothpaste because I am sensitive to SLS, and I suspect my kids are as well. This stuff is fantastic! Our regular toothpaste (Colgate) doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as clean. My kids love it. I wish it had fluoride in it, but we&#x27;ll get ours via vitamins. The taste is lightly orange, and a little strange at first if you&#x27;re used to a lifetime of mint...</li>
    <li> My kids love this tooth paste and I love that it is free from a lot of the poisons they usually load into kid&#x27;s toothpastes.</li>
    <li> The babies don&#x27;t like the flavor.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. My kids like the taste, and I like that I don&#x27;t have extra ingredients in them.</li>
    <li> Here was my dilemma - my 2 yo wants his sister&#x27;s toothpaste, but he eats it. My 4 yo wants baby toothpaste, because it&#x27;s .... well, I have no idea why.&lt;br /&gt;This seems like the best of both worlds. It is natural, safe, and still does a great job. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an orange flavored toothpaste without any mint flavor at all. Loved Burt&#x27;s Bees orange kids toothpaste but it was recently discontinued &amp; I was on the hunt for another one. This fits the bill. A natural orange flavor (not terribly sweet, mostly citrus flavor)with no mint flavoring at all. It&#x27;s not quite as tasty as Burt&#x27;s Bees was &amp; has a slight baking soda flavor to it, but it&#x27;s still good &amp; I will be using it regularly.</li>
    <li> We were looking to replace Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s orange flavored toothpaste.  My daughter is very picky about toothpaste, and this passed her test!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with the taste of this product, but it&#x27;s not bad. It&#x27;s a mild orange flavor that&#x27;s got a little bit of a funky undertone but leaves little to no aftertaste once I rinse. I prefer the strawberry flavor,personally. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know whether or not it&#x27;s actually preventing cavities, but my teeth are feeling pretty clean and I think that&#x27;s really the bigger part of the battle. If you can get the plaque and bacteria off of your teeth, it probably doesn&#x27;t matter what you clean them with--regular old soap would probably get the job done, but this tastes much better than that and does have xylitol in it, which is supposed to help prevent cavities. Give it a try if you&#x27;re curious.</li>
    <li> Our daughter loves the taste of this toothpaste and we love the kid-friendly ingredients and good rating on the Cosmetics Database. Our favorite toothpaste we&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch from our old toothpaste to one without SLS, but my kids just don&#x27;t like the taste of this. The texture is also different--it&#x27;s more of a gel than a paste, so it doesn&#x27;t cling to the toothbrush quite as well, and I think that bothers them a bit as well.</li>
    <li> My son gagged and threw up the minute he tried it. I tried it, because I was surprised at the strong reaction. It was gooey and very coarse like with a really strong nasty orange and seaweed taste. I too, gagged. The flavor is not like a fresh orange, it felt like chewing old orange peels. Gross entirely! I am throwing this out, it was a pure waste of money! Buy something fresher tasting with better texture... don&#x27;t gross out your kids, or they will hate to brush their teeth ever again.</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey in stores; better value through Amazon subscription, where cost gets much more reasonable.  Be careful about other non-fluoride additives (e.g. sugar alcohols), if you&#x27;re a purist.  I&#x27;m not entirely thrilled about some of the ingredients in this toothpaste for kids (or even for adults, for that matter), but it&#x27;s challenging to find a decent non-fluoridated, non-sugared toothpaste that kids will use.</li>
    <li> We have tried different children&#x27;s toothpaste, and are cautious about what chemicals etc enter our body. This product is more of a gel instead of a paste and the orange flavor has been a hit with our kiddos.</li>
    <li> and surfactant, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, in an &amp;#34;all natural, kids only&amp;#34; toothpaste?  Yes, the advertising says &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s true.  But they just picked a different chemical surfactant and foaming agent instead.  Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate is not supposed to be used in &amp;#34;leave-on&amp;#34; cosmetic products, but they are using it in toothpaste??  For shame.  I wish I had read an ingredients list before I bought this product.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that I bought this for my granddaughter because I thought I could blindly trust the Jason brand and its claims.  Too bad I was wrong.  Next time I&#x27;ll do my homework first.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A friend asked me to buy, I see the price is very cheap, and the pattern is very cartoon, hope the children will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> A friend uses this brand and my kid loves the flavor.  It foams a little so I get him excited to see the white foam like mommy and daddy.</li>
    <li> Nice flavor and not too strong for a toddler. Flouride FREE which was a must when I was looking for a toothpaste for my little one.</li>
    <li> We love Jason Kids Only Toothpaste. No complaints from kids about &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; toothpaste and no mom worries about gluten exposure</li>
    <li> Kids love it and its organic - win win!</li>
    <li> My 4 kids didn&#x27;t like the taste of this.  One said it tasted like pine trees.  My toddler preferred my minty powder toothpaste over this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to a new flavor of toothgel to try with my 18 month old, but it&#x27;s not recommended for children under 2 years old. We haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it looks like it will do the job.</li>
    <li> my kids are picky about toothpaste and so am I. This toothpaste works very well and both of my children love the taste.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste for my grandson and he cried when I put it in his mouth! I tasted it and I almost cried! I love that it is all natural but please make it taste better.</li>
    <li> My son likes the taste.  He says &amp;#34;YUM&amp;#34; while he brushes his teeth.  Anything that makes brushing teeth more appealing for a kid gets my vote!</li>
    <li> Our kid loves the taste of this, so much that he sucks it off his toothbrush before finish (or even starting? don&#x27;t know exactly). I love that it&#x27;s all natural and that it won&#x27;t harm him even if he eats it twice a day.</li>
    <li> My daughter hated this toothpaste, she spit it out right when she put it in her mouth,  Thats what she said.</li>
    <li> This company has used their business and chemistry degrees to make a product that contains a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product scam to lure customers in a buy into their business. This product contains sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, similar to the sulfates they claim to not use in their ingredients. This ingredient reacts with nitrates to create  carcinogens in humans.  Nitrates are in meat preservatives....leafy vegetables contain high levels of nitrates.  Please don&#x27;t buy into this.  Also, I purchased this thinking it was safe.... it also tastes like crap</li>
    <li> Personally, I think this toothpaste is fine, but unfortunately my children dislike the taste and refuse to brush with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my kids eat toothpaste.  But, this flavor isn&#x27;t good enough for them to eat, so they actually brush their teeth instead of snacking on it</li>
    <li> My kids hated the taste of this paste!</li>
    <li> Why oh why do you put alcohol in a children&#x27;s toothpaste?  It isn&#x27;t in the adults one.  Again, I will not give my children a product containing alcohol, especially a toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I like the idea. The cost excludes the common man. If it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride shouldn&#x27;t be a lower cost?</li>
    <li> My 7 y/o doesn&#x27;t like the taste. ðŸ‘ŽOtherwise would be a good product</li>
    <li> My kiddo won&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride chemicals. We will buy more of this product!</li>
    <li> My 8 yrs old loves this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great my 3.5yrs girl love it</li>
    <li> My kids really didn&#x27;t care for this flavor.</li>
    <li> This is fine for kids but also a good product for people with sensitive tongues.</li>
    <li> Terrible product....... Don&#x27;t waste your money trying this product.  It is pretty much like washing your mouth out with citricy soap.  It was a total flop, and ended up in the trash in our house.</li>
    <li> The kids weren&#x27;t to keen on the flavor. We ended up going with a little pricier Jack &amp; Jill.</li>
    <li> My kids loved burt&#x27;s bees orange wow - i tried this to replace that but they didn&#x27;t like it.  sorry jason!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kids and they will not use it. Although it smells wonderful, they say it tastes awful. Guess I&#x27;ll go back to Toms. That I know they love.</li>
    <li> We have used many Jason products safely and have become a fan. However, there is something with these new formulas for kids&#x27; toothpaste that is going the wrong path. We have noticed allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are: Glycerin, aqua (purified water), silica, xylitol, xanthan gum, panthenol, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, calendula officinalis flower extract, calcium carbonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, natural flavor * certified organic vegetable source. It seems that we might be allergic to sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, which is used in lieu of sodium lauryl sulfate as a replacement surfactant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For future orders we shall cross off this toothpaste in our shopping list.</li>
