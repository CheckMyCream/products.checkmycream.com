      <li>Not sticky, but very moisturizing.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite lotion, and I&#x27;m branching out to try the other scents.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a smooth cream.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry feet and hands and for massaging legs and feet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>n couldn&#x27;t find it available at her fav shopping center any longer thanx</li>
      <li>I have dry skin, and usually use Aveeno (the best there is, without a prescription, hands down)</li>
      <li>This leaves your skin very soft.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t remember it having that old lady flowery,  talc powdery smell</li>

<li> This leaves your skin very soft.</li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t remember it having that old lady flowery,  talc powdery smell</li>
<li> Not the worst I&#x27;ve tried but definitely not the best option for a hand or body lotion for those with dry skin.</li>
<li> I have tried lotions that are for sensitive skin, and that are less likely to sting, but on me, it stings and irritates.</li>
<li> Not only takes care of the dry skin, but also smells terrific.</li>
<li> I have been using the Tree Hut Almond &amp; Honey lotion for a long time.</li>
<li> but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my legs if I was going to wear long pants.</li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> I have very dry skin all year and this lotion works wonders.  </li>
<li> It is getting harder &amp; harder to find it in the stores.</li>
<li> I sometimes have to reapply the Jergens I use when the air is especially dry (in winter, humidity 25% or less) but not this.</li>
<li> As for the product it was 100% quality, I didn&#x27;t give it more stars because it smelled bad!  </li>
<li> my mom loves this product I got it for her as a little gift since she ran out</li>
<li> I have terrible skin dry and flacky, but this cream has cleared up most of the dryness.  </li>
<li> Have no idea whether it is moisturizing - could not get past the smell when I applied it to my hands.  </li>
<li> Not sure what happened.</li>
<li> I have bought this brand and scent in the past</li>
<li> It is thick and moisturizes well.</li>
<li> Sounds silly but it feels like your pants are sticking to your legs.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s really hard to find a smell that doesn&#x27;t make me want to vomit!!!</li>
<li> The smell is too bad my husband let me throw this one because of its smell</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <li> I was very pleased with  this product the last time i bought it. however, it is not as rich and fragrant as before.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it has a light almond/honey smell, and best of all is paraben free! It is thick and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion. This is my second purchase. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great body lotion. The smell is really good you will want to put it all over your body, specially if you have are in a relationship with someone.</li>
    <li> Great feel, SO good smell not bad for the price and American made. Will order again</li>
    <li> It feels and smells good as well. It seems to have a very soothing effect on my skin and after a shower I feel like I am putting on the finishing touches.</li>
    <li> This leaves your skin very soft. It&#x27;s great to use during the winter. Love the rich honey shea butter smell.</li>
    <li> In general I love the quality of the product: it&#x27;s rich, thick, smells nice, and is a good moisturizer. I can even still smell the fragrance on the clothes after we take them off but I prefer the coconut lime one instead</li>
    <li> Have no idea whether it is moisturizing - could not get past the smell when I applied it to my hands.  And the odor persists!  Apparently much heavier on the honey than the almond and not nice at all :P</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product.  It smells nothing like Almond Honey.  If anything, it smells like Cherry cough medicine (feedback from multiple people!).  If you want your hands to smell like cherry medicine, go for it.  Otherwise, i would avoid</li>
    <li> I am so excited to get this, I use the Sugar Scubs and love LOVE LOVE the smell of it, so wonderful, and I&#x27;m pregnant so it&#x27;s really hard to find a smell that doesn&#x27;t make me want to vomit!!! Great stuff love it all!!! Thanks so much....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase n my mom loves this product I got it for her as a little gift since she ran out n couldn&#x27;t find it available at her fav shopping center any longer thanx</li>
    <li> The lotion from The Tree Hut is so far the best lotion for moisturizing I have used.  I have terrible skin dry and flacky, but this cream has cleared up most of the dryness.  Amazon.com has delivered again</li>
    <li> The smell is intoxicating! We have extremely hard water and my skin is very dry in the winter months-this soaks right in and my skin is so happy!  My kids keep trying to steel it!  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> The scent is very pleasant and the lotion is of a rich consistency.  I have dry skin and this helps with the dryness but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my legs if I was going to wear long pants. Sounds silly but it feels like your pants are sticking to your legs.</li>
    <li> The smell is too bad my husband let me throw this one because of its smell</li>
    <li> As for the product it was 100% quality, I didn&#x27;t give it more stars because it smelled bad!  I have bought this brand and scent in the past and I didn&#x27;t remember it having that old lady flowery,  talc powdery smell, it had smelled like almonds and Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Love this and so do my DIL&#x27;s.  Smells great and softens well.  Just a really nice lotion.</li>
    <li> The texture is ideal for weather is Singapore. Not sticky, but very moisturizing. Love the smell. Worth buy.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream to use for dry skin.  Not only takes care of the dry skin, but also smells terrific.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so nice! it is so rich and the scents are wonderful! The butters, shower gels, and lotions are great!</li>
    <li> I have used both the Almond &amp; Honey as well as the Coconut Lime - I love them both. I have very dry skin all year and this lotion works wonders.  I scent is really nice too - it is light and not too strong.  When I purchased I got two 9 oz lotions for about $10 which is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have to use lotion on my face, no matter what I wash with. I have tried lotions that are for sensitive skin, and that are less likely to sting, but on me, it stings and irritates. This lotion does not sting, and it moisturizes my face just enough! I sometimes have to reapply the Jergens I use when the air is especially dry (in winter, humidity 25% or less) but not this. The scent is pleasant and mild, unlike some cheaper lotions that are a little overpowering. This is my favorite lotion, and I&#x27;m branching out to try the other scents.</li>
    <li> Its smells really good and it&#x27;s a smooth cream.&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry feet and hands and for massaging legs and feet.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> I really like how soft this lotion leaves my skin, but the smell is really strong.  I can&#x27;t use it to go out, because of the smell. So I use it for bed time</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tree Hut Almond &amp; Honey lotion for a long time. It is getting harder &amp; harder to find it in the stores. You can imagine how excited I was to find it at Amazon.com. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and it is not greasy. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion.</li>
    <li> smells great and feels fantastic, so I used it up so fast. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of the lotion and I love the way it smells!  Very Good Product.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had bought the body wash version of this and I absolutely love it- smells great, just like sweet almonds. I figured the lotion would be just as good. It turns out it not quite the same scent. It&#x27;s a bit more \\&quot;perfume-y\\&quot; and seems to clash with the body wash version. Even my husband couldn&#x27;t tolerate it and complains if I wear it (not that he wouldn&#x27;t complain anyway). Not sure what happened. Maybe I got an off batch or something, but I would think twice before buying this. Still love the body wash though.</li>
    <li> This product seems to not penetrate my skin, it left an oil film on my hands (kept in my purse for a hand lotion). I have dry skin, and usually use Aveeno (the best there is, without a prescription, hands down) but sometimes I&#x27;d like to have something scented so I tried this. Not the worst I&#x27;ve tried but definitely not the best option for a hand or body lotion for those with dry skin.</li>
