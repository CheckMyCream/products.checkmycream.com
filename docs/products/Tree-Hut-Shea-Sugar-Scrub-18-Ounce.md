      <li>I love this body scrub!</li>
      <li>I like nice smelling scrubs for my showers.</li>
      <li>It also smells nice</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway the Pomegranate Acai was a very sweet smell and over all I loved it.</li>
      <li>I think the thing I liked most about this scrub over others, was that it stuck to your skin as you were scrubbing.</li>
      <li>I love the sugar scrub products that Tree Hut makes and this is incredibly effective to get smoother skin.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this brand.  </li>
      <li>love the tree hut stuff</li>
      <li>am also glad this one is a sugar scrub instead of a salt scrub.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Coconut Lime scent, but this one reminded me of the smells in my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing I love about this scrub is that it washes off without leaving residue (some scrubs leave oily residue).</li>
      <li>I did find the scent to be too strong.</li>
      <li>and I feel that it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
      <li>works well, and it is not a strong smell, which is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and makes your skin feel super soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>Great scrub, really makes your skin soft and hydrated after using.</li>
      <li>This scrub is amazing it leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like other brands, does a great job exfoliating.</li>
      <li>I have gotten great results with this product -- I mostly use it on my upper arms -- and will definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
      <li>I love it and make my body very soft</li>
      <li>However, this one sticks together pretty well and doesn&#x27;t require stirring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product and will definitely re-purchase.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, just silky smooth!</li>
      <li>Easy to use in shower daily.</li>
      <li>It does not feel too scratchy, but sure does get down to a fresh level of skin.</li>
      <li>The scrub is intense.</li>
      <li>I really like this scrub.</li>
      <li>Really helps you get a closer shave.</li>
      <li>But since, I&#x27;ve tried to be a little more gentle</li>
      <li>Use it on my hands and it makes them very soft!</li>
      <li>Even if I wanted a scent of this nature, it seemed a little too overwhelming / overpowering.</li>
      <li>I use scrubs primarily on my upper arms (don&#x27;t like the condition of my skin there, though it is improving with consistent use of scrubs), towards the end of my shower, after I&#x27;ve already shaved under my arms.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I turned red.</li>
      <li>I liked the smell, but expected it to only last in shower, not all day.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, it&#x27;s a bit too sweet.</li>
      <li>It left my skin soft, not greasy.</li>
      <li>I am a 29 year old male.</li>

    <li> Leaves skin soft. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub. One problem I have had with other body scrubs is that they tend to separate into abrasive (salt or sugar, generally) and oil and have to be stirred before use. However, this one sticks together pretty well and doesn&#x27;t require stirring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also glad this one is a sugar scrub instead of a salt scrub. I use scrubs primarily on my upper arms (don&#x27;t like the condition of my skin there, though it is improving with consistent use of scrubs), towards the end of my shower, after I&#x27;ve already shaved under my arms. But salt scrubs can irritate shaved underarms. Sugar scrubs don&#x27;t seem to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love about this scrub is that it washes off without leaving residue (some scrubs leave oily residue). It also smells nice and I feel that it&#x27;s pretty effective. I have gotten great results with this product -- I mostly use it on my upper arms -- and will definitely buy it again when I run out. (It&#x27;s a big tub. Used a couple of times a week, this should last you awhile.)</li>
    <li> This scrub is amazing it leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It exfoliates beautifully and I love the way that I smell afterwards!</li>
    <li> I love the sugar scrub products that Tree Hut makes and this is incredibly effective to get smoother skin. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, it&#x27;s a bit too sweet.</li>
    <li> Smell is off the charts. SOOOOO awesome. The scrub is intense. It&#x27;s quite abrasive. If you have sensitive skin, be careful. The first time I used it, I turned red. But since, I&#x27;ve tried to be a little more gentle and it&#x27;s been great. It is great to use before you shave too! Really helps you get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I love this body scrub! It softens skin and smells like jelly beans!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes your skin feel super soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> The scrub worked great. It left my skin soft, not greasy. Easy to use in shower daily. I did find the scent to be too strong. I liked the smell, but expected it to only last in shower, not all day. I would prefer to smell like perfume, not fruit all day. It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell just not my preference. It was a good quality product for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> SO LOVELY! Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like other brands, does a great job exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Made the skin on my eyes burn.</li>
    <li> I use it daily in the shower, takes care of dry rough skin. Smellso great</li>
    <li> Great appreciation gift</li>
    <li> Great scrub, really makes your skin soft and hydrated after using. I will definitely purchase again wish is was cheaper would be the only draw back.</li>
    <li> Great level of scrubbyness... You know what I mean. It does not feel too scratchy, but sure does get down to a fresh level of skin. I think the thing I liked most about this scrub over others, was that it stuck to your skin as you were scrubbing. Sometimes with other scrubs I feel like a lot of it ends up on the shower floor... Wasted scrub makes me sad...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the Pomegranate Acai was a very sweet smell and over all I loved it. I think I&#x27;ll try some of the other flavours when I&#x27;ve finished this one!</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the way my skin feels after using this scrub</li>
    <li> Excellent and very beautiful smell</li>
    <li> I looooovvvveeee this stuff!</li>
    <li> This will be a relatively short review for me. I am a 29 year old male. I like nice smelling scrubs for my showers. This was way to floral and &#x27;girly&#x27; for me. I absolutely love the Coconut Lime scent, but this one reminded me of the smells in my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom. Even if I wanted a scent of this nature, it seemed a little too overwhelming / overpowering. Even my wife wasn&#x27;t all that fond of it.</li>
    <li> works well, and it is not a strong smell, which is wonderful. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> love the tree hut stuff</li>
    <li> I love it and make my body very soft</li>
    <li> I love this product and will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Use it on my hands and it makes them very soft!</li>
    <li> Awesome smell, nice texture. A little soft for a scrub though</li>
    <li> Love this brand.  Any arm bumps will disappear!  Smells great too.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, just silky smooth!</li>
