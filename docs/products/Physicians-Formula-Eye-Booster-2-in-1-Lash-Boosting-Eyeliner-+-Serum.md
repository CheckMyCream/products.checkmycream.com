      <li>It is easy to apply even with my contact lenses in because it doesn&#x27;t require a great deal of pressure.  </li>

      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>I am so thrilled to have an eyeliner that I can put on and forget about.</li>
      <li>Acute Health Effects:  </li>

      <li>Also, the soft sturdy tip is perfect for even applying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very precise but looks like it&#x27;s flaking when smudged.</li>
      <li>this is now another tool for me to use:))</li>

      <li>While I have not noticed a difference in my eyelashes, I have enjoyed the appearance.</li>
      <li>It is so simple to use and works great!</li>
      <li>But still, I love this brand and will continue to purchase their products</li>
      <li>I figure it sure won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>and I like this product a lot more.</li>
      <li>I like the most about this eyeliner</li>
      <li>and it does help them grow as well. :)</li>
      <li>Better application and longer wear-ability.</li>
      <li>There are cheaper eyeliners out there that in my opinion would be better than this one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good eyeliner</li>
      <li>It gives just as fine and precise of a line, plus it has the added benefit of lash-boosting serum!</li>
      <li>I LOVE the fine point on this.</li>
      <li>Its a lovely opaque color that goes on really smooth and even.</li>
      <li>Easy to create wings with this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and lasts throughout the day.</li>
      <li>My lashes are thicker and fuller than ever and the applicator makes it relatively easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the easiest eye liner to use and easily washes off.</li>
      <li>It is sooo easy to put on.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to learn to make it more bold if you&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>This is my new most favorite eyeliner!</li>
      <li>but the eyeliner part is fine.</li>
      <li>I am having such great results from Rapid Lash</li>
      <li>Really smooth application, and</li>
      <li>and I am happy that is lasts the entire day.</li>
      <li>It goes on like a light gray and doesn&#x27;t stay well at all.</li>
      <li>This has made my lashes more naturally pretty.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>As with most Physicians formula it&#x27;s tricky to apply at first</li>
      <li>It goes on super smooth and even.</li>
      <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that this is the first eyeliner that I have been able to use with no problems for my sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very particular about my liquid eyeliner, and I&#x27;ve tried many on the market</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this for everyone who is looking for a good eyeliner.</li>
      <li>my absolute favorite eyeliner I have bought this about 4 times already</li>
      <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent too much money in an effort to find an eyeliner that really does not smear or fall off, and is easy to apply, and this product really is the best.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for about three years now and it is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>It had a very smooth applying action.</li>
      <li>VERY DRY AND WASN&#x27;T GOOD</li>
      <li>for the lash lengthening serum, well, I wasn&#x27;t sold on it making my lashes longer, but it was still worth it to me to for the eyeliner.</li>
      <li>You could easily go more glam or natural with this</li>
      <li>You can get the right amount of coverage just by the amount of pressure you apply the line with.  </li>
      <li>if it doesn&#x27;t work right away give it some time.</li>
      <li>This is also good for the tight lining technique when you are wanting a more natural look.</li>
      <li>At their best they are a clean and long-wearing way to define the eye that can be natural or dramatic.  </li>
      <li>That was enough for me, but now that I&#x27;m seeing longer lashes too, well, that is a huge bonus!</li>
      <li>does not irritate eyes when left on for many hours.</li>
      <li>However this is the first time I bought online</li>
      <li>For its modest price, this liner is easy to use and stays on very well with no irritation.  </li>
      <li>I know every person reacts to different products in their own unique ways, but this is a definite HG product for me.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise, I am finally able to wear eyeliner without my eyes tearing up and without the eyeliner becoming a mess.</li>
      <li>product for your eyes that is sold as new for full price should not arrive out of the box with no seal.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to those looking for fuller lashes and/or a good standard liquid liner.</li>
      <li>This liquid eyeliner has a very small, fine pointed brush applicator which is nice.</li>
      <li>It is more of a charcoal Grey.  </li>
      <li>I do wish it came in a larger variety of colors, however, I&#x27;m happy with Ultra Black for now.</li>
      <li>Within a couple of weeks I noticed I had really thickened by lash line, then I noticed those lashes were getting longer and fuller.</li>
      <li>It could be darker, but does apply very well.</li>
      <li>Once it sets, it stays on really well, even through a 14 hour day.</li>
      <li>I love the precision of the extremely fine-tipped brush applicator-</li>
      <li>Normally this product is five stars for me!</li>
      <li>a little dry but otherwise great eyeliner</li>
      <li>Luckily this is easy to find and the price tag is a fraction of the cost for other products that claim to do the exact same thing!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this in brown and am on second tube and just bought black. It goes on super smooth and even. It&#x27;s the easiest eye liner to use and easily washes off.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of applying this liquid eyeliner.  The brush is long and stays filled with liquid so it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of shaking.  It is easy to apply even with my contact lenses in because it doesn&#x27;t require a great deal of pressure.  That&#x27;s probably its best feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it dries, it stays on, but doesn&#x27;t withstand a lot of eye-rubbing.</li>
    <li> I bought this in an Ulta store about a year ago, on the recommendation of an esthetician.  I loved it, it applied easily and worked great.  This one came from Amazon and it seems to crumble and irritate my eyes.  I am disappointed in this, and I&#x27;m unsure why - either the source or the formula has changed.</li>
    <li> It seems to stay on really well and has not irratated my eyes however, not seen any difference so far any longer lashes.</li>
    <li> I love liquid liners.  At their best they are a clean and long-wearing way to define the eye that can be natural or dramatic.  Even when they are awkward to apply a damp q-tip at the ready can neaten things up.  But I don&#x27;t even worry about getting the q-tips out with this product. The brush is so thin and usable, and the liner flows so perfectly, it only takes me a few seconds to apply neat black lines, no need to go over the line again to make it solid. In the past my favorite liquid liner has actually been from NYC becuase the brush is so easy to control, now I have to say Physicians Formula is my go-to liquid liner.  I don&#x27;t know about the effectivness of the lash boosting serum in this product but,[[ASIN:B004HYRH06 Eye Booster 2-in-1 Lash Boosting Eyeliner Serum]] I figure it sure won&#x27;t hurt. I am having such great results from Rapid Lash I figure other lash boosting products might reinforce the results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this liner because people advised it may grow your lashes.  It has not grown my lashes, but the liner is jet black and ultra fine.  i do not like thick lines.  This is not a felt tip, but a very fine brush and its perfect.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my liquid eyeliner, and I&#x27;ve tried many on the market (I&#x27;ve worn it daily for the past 15 or so years).  I tend to have skin reactions (itchy, red, flaking skin on the eyelid) with certain brands (even hypoallergenic).  Thus far, this product has been great- no irritation yet! I love the precision of the extremely fine-tipped brush applicator- you can lay the liner just against your eyelashes and into the inner corner of your eye near the tear duct. The fluid comes out of the brush bristles- no dipping into a tube or other container of liner. the only potential negative is that I can&#x27;t do just one easy sweep across my lids as I&#x27;ve done before- the brush is so fine that I have to go slowly and add/build up for the thick line toward the outer edge of the eye. But, I&#x27;ll take that any day for the precision of the bristles! Best of all, this product wears well ALL DAY! No smudging or flaking!  This is my new most favorite eyeliner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good eyeliner but it hasn&#x27;t made a difference in my eyelashes</li>
    <li> VERY DRY AND WASN&#x27;T GOOD AT ALL!!!!</li>
    <li> Being a blonde, I&#x27;ve always struggled with having light eyelashes that are invisible without caking on mascara, but since I started using this every day about 2 weeks ago, my eyelashes are so thick and long they look like fake lashes. I use it with Almay&#x27;s \\&quot;Get up and Grow\\&quot; mascara, and I&#x27;m afraid that if I bat my eyelashes too fast, the hurricane force winds will alter the jet stream and throw the northern hemisphere into an ice age. For anyone looking to get long, thick beautiful eyelashes, I definitely recommend Physicians Formula Eye Booster Lash Boosting Eyeliner + Serum along with Almay&#x27;s One Coat Get Up and Grow Waterproof Mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004O3UE46 Almay One Coat Get Up and Grow Waterproof Mascara, Black Brown, 0.21 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Excellent. Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> For its modest price, this liner is easy to use and stays on very well with no irritation.  I still don&#x27;t know if my lashes are any thicker.</li>
    <li> This dried up after 5 uses within one week of receiving it. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> This is my go-to eyeliner! I like to keep my beauty routines simple and as chemical free as possible. Speaking only of the formula, it is fantastic and lasts me a long time. I LOVE the fine point on this. I prefer it above all other eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;At the time of purchase, the only color available was black. I really like my eyeliner to pop, so I always get ultra black. But since I was in need of eyeliner and didn&#x27;t feel like trying to hunt it down in-store, I opted for this one. Normally this product is five stars for me! But this color, specifically, was a little disappointing. It&#x27;s just a little light for my taste. But still, I love this brand and will continue to purchase their products</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner can make a really smooth thin or thick line. It feels like it&#x27;s good quality and well made. It seemed to fade to a lighter black throughout the day but overall this is the eyeliner I would reach for on my makeup desk.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that I waited over 2 months to write this review so that I would actually have some daily experience to write about. I have very sensitive eyes, was tired of wasting money on makeup that I couldn&#x27;t use, and had pretty much given up on eyeliner altogether.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I decided to try the Physician&#x27;s Formula eyeliner with Lash Boosting Serum. Much to my surprise, I am finally able to wear eyeliner without my eyes tearing up and without the eyeliner becoming a mess. It is sooo easy to put on. I use it daily now. It goes on well, and subtly wears off a bit throughout the day, which I don&#x27;t mind. It doesn&#x27;t wear off entirely, but it does lighten up. It does not smudge at all though. I am so thrilled to have an eyeliner that I can put on and forget about. No tearing, no excess blinking, etc.&lt;br /&gt;As for the lash lengthening serum, well, I wasn&#x27;t sold on it making my lashes longer, but it was still worth it to me to for the eyeliner. Then, just this past week, I started to notice that my lashes do look longer. I can see them curling upward at the tips. It took a couple of months, but they are actually longer after all.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Latisse in the past, which showed results much sooner, but it bothered my eyes and was very expensive - about $100. Considering that this eyeliner/booster is only a tenth of that, I&#x27;m just going to keep using Physicians Formula. Just today I went out and bought the clear serum alone so that I can used it at night if I want to.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that this is the first eyeliner that I have been able to use with no problems for my sensitive eyes. That was enough for me, but now that I&#x27;m seeing longer lashes too, well, that is a huge bonus!</li>
    <li> Its pretty easy to apply but its not so dark! It looks like grey instead!</li>
    <li> this item comes out of the box which was not clearly stated when my wife purchased this product! The item is not sealed and could have been used by anyone.  product for your eyes that is sold as new for full price should not arrive out of the box with no seal.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product since it came out and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s around.  It provides complete and total control.  You can get the right amount of coverage just by the amount of pressure you apply the line with.  I usually set it afterward with a tiny bit of light powdered shadow to give it a softer look and help it stay on longer.  If I forget to take it off, it&#x27;s still there in the morning (and not underneath my eyes).  It does run out eventually but I have found that if I place it in a cup with the cap down for about ten minutes it usually infuses the applicator and I can get a few more weeks out of it.</li>
    <li> excellent water proof eye liner. does not irritate eyes when left on for many hours. wish it came in gray and brown too.</li>
    <li> did not work at all seemed all dried  up</li>
    <li> This liquid eyeliner has a very small, fine pointed brush applicator which is nice. However,  the eyeliner that comes out is just not very pigmented at all. It is more of a charcoal Grey.  If you&#x27;re not looking for a very dark black eyeliner I would definitely recommend this. For me, it just didn&#x27;t do it completely.  There are cheaper eyeliners out there that in my opinion would be better than this one.</li>
    <li> This is yet another blogging recommendation and it was one of my best purchases yet! I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without using this liner. It now goes in my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; section in my makeup drawer, along with my foundation and mascara. Its a lovely opaque color that goes on really smooth and even. The brush tip is really easy to create thick or thin lines and is really great for wingtip and cat-eye (My favorite liner styles). Once it sets, it stays on really well, even through a 14 hour day. The best part, it really does grow thicker, longer lashes! Within a couple of weeks I noticed I had really thickened by lash line, then I noticed those lashes were getting longer and fuller. I know every person reacts to different products in their own unique ways, but this is a definite HG product for me. Would definitely recommend to those looking for fuller lashes and/or a good standard liquid liner. Luckily this is easy to find and the price tag is a fraction of the cost for other products that claim to do the exact same thing! Go get it!</li>
    <li> I have tried various liquid eyeliners and felt tip eyeliner. This is the best one for me. I have tried the black, very black and deep brown. I am very happy with all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most about this eyeliner is that it goes on very smoothly and as thin as I want it. It does not smudge or accidentally spread to other areas. Easy to create wings with this eyeliner. I only need to apply the eyeliner once a day. Stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any irritation. The eyeliner claims to have a serum that helps the eyelashes grow within 2 weeks with daily use. While I have not noticed a difference in my eyelashes, I have enjoyed the appearance.</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite eyeliner I have bought this about 4 times already</li>
    <li> Worst eyeliner ever. It was dried out and trying to get more product out, forget about it. It goes on like a light gray and doesn&#x27;t stay well at all. Terrible formula and terrible design. I ended up throwing it out. If I could give this 0 stars, I would have. Will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have been using this for about three years now and it is my new favorite. My lashes are thicker and fuller than ever and the applicator makes it relatively easy to apply. This is also good for the tight lining technique when you are wanting a more natural look. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because Physican Formula makes decent product and why not try 2 in 1 to save time right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. It says black but when I apply the liner, it is a gent/light grey color. Barely visible. The product brush seems quite dry so I applied several layers to get it to medium grey. After a few tests, I decided to email the seller AmericRX (twice) with questions and both times got the standard &#x27;We are only reseller, not responsible for the products. You should&#x27;ve Google search it before you buy&#x27;. I know you are a reseller but don&#x27;t you try the product before you sell? I am not asking you to take responsiblity, I am merely asking why this product is 1) so dry and 2) so light grey vs. black as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it does the 2in1as it says, I am uncertain because I don&#x27;t think there is enough serum to get me that far and certain not the color I purchased.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL, DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO.  KEEPS MY OL&#x27; GRANNY LASHES IN GREAT SHAPE.  I WOULD  RECOMMEND HIGHLY.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent too much money in an effort to find an eyeliner that really does not smear or fall off, and is easy to apply, and this product really is the best.  Also, the soft sturdy tip is perfect for even applying.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner liquid is dry and barely comes out. I purchased because I heard it was the holy grail of liquid eyeliners. I do not know if I got an outdated batch but seeing as it barely comes out, is a dark gray rather than black and very dry... I am sorely disappointed and feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! It is so simple to use and works great! I definitely recommend this for everyone who is looking for a good eyeliner. And it is great for the lashes too(:</li>
    <li> I have liquid pen-style eyeliners from SmashBox, Lancome, Tokidoki, Kat Von D, etc, and I find myself using this liner the most, even though it&#x27;s half the price. It gives just as fine and precise of a line, plus it has the added benefit of lash-boosting serum!</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old and I have noticed my eyelashes thinning as I age. i decided to try this product and after roughly 8 weeks I noticed a big difference. My lower lashes were practically nonexistent toward the outer corners, now they look great. My upper lashes are thicker also. I can actually feel my eyelashes again. I love going to the gym to stay in shape and slow the signs of aging. this is now another tool for me to use:)) I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great eyeliner for beginners (which I am), but unfortunately the color is not entirely solid.</li>
    <li> a little dry but otherwise great eyeliner</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is terrific because of the applicator and the fact that it stays on a long time; however, the color is sort of grayish and not black at all.  I think it comes in blacker color but not offered at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that the seller has not listed the product ingredients.  This is a requirement for product labeling but does not appear to be a requirement of Amazon.com for product listings.&lt;br /&gt;I went to Physicians Formula&#x27;s website and found a product listing for what I think is the same product.  It was listed under the name of \\&quot;Eye Booster 2-in-1 Lash Boosting Eyeliner + Serum\\&quot; in  black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product list:&lt;br /&gt;Water. Ethylhexyl Acrylate/Methyl Methacrylate Copolymer. Butylene Glycol. SD Alcohol 40. Beheneth-30. Ammonium Acrylates/Methyl Styrene/Styrene Copolymer. Glycerin. Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17. 1,2-Hexanediol. Acrylates/Octylacrylamide Copolymer. Caprylyl Glycol. Ethylhexylglycerin. Pentylene Glycol. Polyglyceryl-3 Disiloxane Dimethicone. Phenoxyethanol. Sodium Hydroxide. Disodium EDTA. Black 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemicals of concern:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butylene Glycol, the third ingredient in this product is a potential irritant to the skin, eyes and lungs according to EWG.org Skin Deep Database.  I looked into this further as the information on the database was limited and found the Material Data Safety Sheet for Butylene Glycol.  Keep in mind this is an industrial safety sheet for proper handling, but also consider this is a chemical you are placing in your eye every day.&lt;br /&gt;According to ScienceLab.com&#x27;s MSDS sheet it lists Butylene Glycol as:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Potential Acute Health Effects:  Hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of eye contact (irritant), of ingestion, of inhalation (lung irritant).\\&quot;  If this is considered an irritant why have it in a product used around the eyes and have it as the third ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised by this list given Physicians Formulas reputation as providing hypoallergenic products and disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said this, there are going to be people who do not react to these ingredients for a variety of reasons, however, if you do have sensitivities be sure to read the product lists and do your homework on the ingredients, especially if using around the eye area.n the ingredients, especially if using around the eye area.</li>
    <li> I was faithful using it every day.  Nothing happened.  Took a 2 month break and I started to use Latisse.  Very expensive, but it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for over a year and have not found anything comparable. It goes on wet and opaque; it is easy to wipe away mistakes before it dries - and it dries well. The fine brush is a perfect applicator as it is more flexible than felt tips and can better follow the line of the eye. I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough, truly.</li>
    <li> Really smooth application, and I am not losing my eyelashes anymore. I used Lorac, and other high end eyeliners and my lashes started to fall. I am using black on the top lid and brown on the lower lid and I am happy that is lasts the entire day. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well and stays on for the entire day. I don&#x27;t know about the lash-boosting effect, I haven&#x27;t seen it at all but the eyeliner part is fine. It could be darker, but does apply very well. Lasted me for about a month with daily use.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would&#x27;ve. The color was more light grey than black, which made me really disappointed. Would not recommend. Doesn&#x27;t even grow your lashes like it says it will. Want your lashes to grow? Use vitamin e oil. Or castor oil.</li>
    <li> As with most Physicians formula it&#x27;s tricky to apply at first but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s awesome! I&#x27;m on my second one had to re buy. I try to apply it between my lashes, right on the line since I usually use another eye liner over it. it&#x27;s easy to learn to make it more bold if you&#x27;d like. Sometimes it needs a little and maybe a tap of water when it starts to run low. I only us the other liner because I use purple and they don&#x27;t make this in purple. Now it took a couple of weeks to see my lashes growing but they are longer than when i started. if it doesn&#x27;t work right away give it some time. I use clear mascara because I hate the smudges.. This has made my lashes more naturally pretty. You could easily go more glam or natural with this and it does help them grow as well. :)</li>
    <li> I used to have so much trouble applying liquid eyeliner--that is, until I found this one!! This is SOOO easy to apply!! I am absolutely in LOVE with it!  It is so much easier to use than the other liquid liners. There is something so different with this felt-tip pen! You&#x27;re so much more in control. I do wish it came in a larger variety of colors, however, I&#x27;m happy with Ultra Black for now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at full price at a local CVS. The product was around $12. The long felt tip did not apply the advertised &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; liner. It was watery and unevenly pigmented. I attempted to use the product daily for about 2 weeks to no success, I even tried shaking it to mix the product AND pumping it on a clean napkin. I cannot speak to the lash boosting affects as I could not get the liner on properly. I would recommend this to anyone. I can however say this in the products defense I have oily skin and eyelids. The product isn&#x27;t frequently shopped at my local CVS and could have been old. I wouldn&#x27;t call this product crap, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! However this is the first time I bought online and it was a bit messy and leaking :( a lot was wasted but it has started working better.. Wish I could find it in stores again!</li>
    <li> I like it because of it being hyper genic......much better for my eyes.  It had a very smooth applying action.</li>
    <li> First, I did not purchase this product through Amazon, so I cannot speak to the lack of box, etc that has been stated by previous reviewers. That being said, this is a GREAT product! It is easy to apply and lasts throughout the day. There is some fade,  but not enough for me to complain about. It never smudges or flakes off. I had previously bought the PF felt tip 2-in-1 eyeliner and I like this product a lot more. Better application and longer wear-ability. In terms of the lash boosting, I am not sure about this particular product. I definitely noticed my lashes getting longer/fuller when I used the felt tip 2-in-1 eyeliner, so I imagine since this product has the same formula it will work too. I will definitely be using the product for a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very precise but looks like it&#x27;s flaking when smudged. Can&#x27;t say I noticed much with the lash boosting claim either, but I don&#x27;t use this frequently because of the flaking.</li>
