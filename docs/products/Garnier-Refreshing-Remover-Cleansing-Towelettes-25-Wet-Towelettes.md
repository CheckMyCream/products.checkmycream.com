      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>

      <li>any one knows of another cruelty free brand to try -- let me know!</li>
      <li>I love these wipes.  </li>
      <li>They thoroughly remove makeup and are refreshing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product works well to remove make-up but the bad seal on the packaging led to dry, unusable wipes.</li>
    <li> this is so easy to use after an evening out and tired just use one of the cloths to remove the day..and love it is that easy..Thank will order again</li>
    <li> I used to love the Ponds cloths until they started adding more scent and little speed bumps all over the things, so I&#x27;ve switched to the Garnier cloths, and they&#x27;re very good.  It cleans all the makeup off my skin and doesn&#x27;t over-dry or leave behind an oily residue.  My skin feels fresh and soft, ready for my night treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do well is anything more than a light mascara; you&#x27;ll need a separate eye makeup remover for that, as these are too gentle to really remove mascara properly.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, convenient but don&#x27;t expect deep cleansing.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup nicely - no major complaints.  Priced better on amazon than in stores.  Great to have on auto-ship.</li>
    <li> Good, wish they had more texture.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin even though I&#x27;m over 60, and this product removes all of my makeup and oil from my skin.  I use them at night, follow up with a warm washcloth over my face and use only warm water and a cloth in the morning.  I have been using them about two weeks and my pores look smaller and my face feels cleaner than ever.  I have tried all of the expensive lines of facial cleansers, and this one suits me better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the convenience of the product as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of wipes like this, and many of them sting my sensitive skin.  I actually started using these because my boyfriend accidentally bought them for me - &amp;#34;you use ones in a green package!&amp;#34; - all green packages are the same, right? ;) Now I always keep these on hand for trips, work, etc.  They&#x27;re gentle, and as long as I&#x27;m not scrubbing away at my stubborn eyeliner too vigorously, I can take off all my makeup without any irritation.</li>
    <li> I admit to going to bed when I&#x27;m tired and not always being diligent with taking the day&#x27;s residue off my face. Garnier towelettes have kept me on task for well over a year now, and are on my subscribe and save order.  They clean everything off without a fuss or a sting, and I can just toss them in the trash when done.  They smell nice, and don&#x27;t leave any stickiness behind.  All in all, they&#x27;ve been a superstar for me!</li>
    <li> I like these cleansing cloths. They have a nice scent like all Garnier products. They remove make up well (but I have used others that do a better job). I do feel like they  leave a bit of a film, so I do like to rinse my face off afterwards, but it is fine not to as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite towelettes.  It gets off most of the stubborn make up and leaves behind a clean, refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> These are great wipes for cleaning off make up in the evening!  I was having a hard time getting the make up off my wash cloths.  So this really helps with that!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a make-up wipe that completely removed all make-up from my face; and I&#x27;m not spackling on foundation in the mornings. So, if I&#x27;m lazy, this is it and I feel like I&#x27;ve done good enough, but most of the time this is step one and then I use my Clarisonic and a cleanser to really make sure my face is bare. They&#x27;re potentially no better and no worse than any other wipes I&#x27;ve used. But I&#x27;m not buying them on Amazon anymore; they&#x27;re usually cheaper at Target or Fred Meyer.</li>
    <li> I have tried other towelettes and they are either stinky or they sting my eyes. These are so gentle, they smell great and they take off all my makeup with just one towelette.</li>
    <li> I live in an extremely dry climate. In the winter (in the past) my skin was so dry I was globing on Vaseline every night, and even that didn&#x27;t help. Prescription creams, night masks . . . nothing could keep the dryness away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using these after my second son was born, mostly out of laziness. Then I noticed that my skin was no longer dry. Seriously, it&#x27;s like a skin miracle. I use one every night and only wash my face with water in the shower. A few weeks ago I ran out, and went about a week without them. Just in that week my skin got rashy and dry again. I bought some more, and within a few days my skin was restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE these!</li>
    <li> I use to use the neutrogena wipes and they were really oily and I felt a residue in my skin which was really annoying. With these wipes I fell no residue, it smells really nice and it does clean my face really well. It even makes my skin feel really soft! I will definitely repurchase once I run out of them, although I wish they sold the exact formula they use on these wipes in a bottle so I didn&#x27;t have to waste all of these cloths.</li>
    <li> product was falsely advertised as a 2-pack, however I only received one pack of the wipes, which, for the price, was not worth it</li>
    <li> I have tried both the Clean &amp; Clear and the Neutrogena oil-free makeup remover wipes, but I LOVE THESE. I can use these after a long, makeup-covered night out before I go to bed &amp; wake up with skin that still feels clean.  And I have VERY oily skin! The cloth is very soft and the scent is clean without being too perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for those with oily complexions!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes! I&#x27;m sensitive to strong odors and my skin easily breaks out, but these are wonderful.  They thoroughly remove makeup and are refreshing.  I use them every night.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes. I keep a pack at work and one in my gym bag. They are perfect for a little freshening up as well as removing makeup and dirt. I love the smell- it is crisp and clean without being overpowering or perfume-y</li>
    <li> these wipes are a favorite; they don&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your face, just fresh after taking off a day&#x27;s worth of makeup.  i still use a liquid cleanser/ exfoliater to get the last bit of makeup off b/c i don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; my face w/ the wipe itself.  but if it&#x27;s really late and i&#x27;m tired, i used the wipe alone before going to bed, it does the job, no makeup on the pillowcase or sheets.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased anything from Garnier that I didn&#x27;t really like. I absolutely LOVE these wipes for both their convenience and effectiveness. They quickly and easily removed my cosmetics at night, including my mascara and eye-liner (non-waterproof) without undue rubbing. They are refreshing and non-irritating. I am most happy that they save me from my own late-night exhaustion when I simply cannot devote the time to really washing my face. Perfect for this lazy woman with a good sense of guilt!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t need it as much as I thought, so too much.</li>
    <li> For years I was a devoted noxema user until they changed their formula and I started my search for a replacement.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens without finding any love, either the cloths were to rough, dried my face up, left so much oil on my face that I could feel the blemishes popping out or they required using 4-5 just to get the mascara off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now, the first time I used Garnier Nutri-Pure Detoxifying Wet Cleansing Towelettes I was amazed, one cloth and all the makeup came off including the mascara.  Amazing, of course I thought it was a fluke but the same thing happened the next day and the next.  What else can I say?  I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> Nice for removing makeup, not sticky.</li>
    <li> I find these skin cleanser tissues to be effective and more convenient for me than using liquid eye makeup remover--and then also washing my face with soap to remove sunblock.  They don&#x27;t sting the eyes, and splashing water on your face after using easily rinses off the remover that may be left on your face.</li>
    <li> I have been pretty pleased with these Garnier Towelettes; they don&#x27;t sting the eyes, are gentle and have a slight not heavy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they arrived a little bit dry making them somewhat less effective on mascara. So what I do is squirt on a little of my favorite makeup remover that I also get here on Amazon, [[ASIN:B000EGIQB0 Bioderma Crealine H2o Ultra-mild Non-rinse Face and Eyes Cleanser 250 ml]] .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of the towelette with the Bioderma is sensational--fast and easy complete removal of eye and face makeup, no rinsing required. For people who wrote that the towelettes were not wet enough or dried too fast I&#x27;d like to suggest that they try adding a little non-cream based makeup remover to the towelette so they don&#x27;t have to toss them. Works great.</li>
    <li> This Garnier Skincare Cleanser The Refreshing towels...removes make up really well and smells good, no allergic reactions or break outs.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is the best makeup remover I  have used.. plus it smells so good and fresh ...</li>
    <li> This is a cleansing cloth, and it works exactly as expected.  It dissolved my makeup and wiped it away cleanly.  The cloths smell fresh, but are not overwhelmingly scented.  They didn&#x27;t cause me to break out (always a plus) and didn&#x27;t leave my sensitive skin feeling itchy or red.  Overall a great buy!</li>
    <li> Oh so refreshing!  Really takes your makeup off easily and feels so clean afterwards.  I would probably purchase this item again. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but is not moist enough. I don&#x27;t want it to drip, but do want it to remove my makeup, including foundation. It seems to take a few passes to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover wipes I have tried so far.  And I&#x27;ve tried many.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes, very gentle, removes with minimal rubbing.</li>
    <li> I have pretty picky skin but these wipes do a great job of cleaning my face without making me breakout more</li>
    <li> Buyer beware--This is only a 10-Count package!!  Although I couldn&#x27;t specifically find the number of towlettes in the description, based on the price per count and the overall price, I assumed it was at least a 25-30 count pack-- not true!  Big rip-off, but probably too big of a hassle to return the item.</li>
    <li> so refreshing and clean :)</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a couple of months now and I love them.  Perfect for on-the-go use or whenever you&#x27;re feeling lazy late at night or early morning.  They smell great and remove makeup pretty well.  These wipes don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, just cool and refreshed.  Another plus is, they don&#x27;t burn your eyes when used around the eye area.  I definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> When they came they appeared to be very old&lt;br /&gt;the package had a price tag on them as if they&lt;br /&gt;had sat in a store for a very long time and when&lt;br /&gt;I opened them they where all dried out and unusable!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes.  I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate me at all.  Great at removing eye makeup.  I cut the sheets in half to double the product amount.  Recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I like using these on my face each night. They are soft and smell good. They also do a great job removing my rue make-up.</li>
    <li> As soon as I discovered these wipes I knew I&#x27;d never choose any other. They smell amazing. I have sensitive skin and they fragrance does not irritate my skin. They remove everything cleanly. I cut these into fours and store them in another bag and they last much longer. A whole sheet isn&#x27;t necessary for simply removing eye makeup like I do.</li>
    <li> Not helping with the occasional breakouts but I use it mostly for while I&#x27;m at work.  I don&#x27;t always have access to a sink and soap.  I work with animals so being able to wash up quickly goes a long way.</li>
    <li> What is love best about this towelette is its heavenly softness. But as well, it is an excellent eye makeup remover, doing a great job without excessive rubbing. It has a fresh non-perfumey fragrance and does not burn your eyes or leave a residue behind. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with these. I have very sensitive skin and most makeup removing wipes burn and irritate my skin. (especially the eye area) These are wonderful on the skin and do not irritate the skin. I will use these forever! Buy buy buy!!</li>
    <li> Love this product !!!!  This has got to be one of the best make-up remover towelettes on the market.  No heavy smell or stringent remover. Leaves my skin soft and refreshed and removes make-up easily. Recommend for sensitive skin. I use everyday.  Even use as a refreshing wipe after a long day in the sun.</li>
    <li> Love this product and need to purchase more!</li>
    <li> I purchased the garnier towelettes and I am pleased with my purchase. The wipes were durable but not too thick. The wipes were lightly scented and did not leave a oily residue. The wipes removed makeup well and left my skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> These are great for removing makeup! I use one sheet every 2 or 3 times I remove my makeup and they&#x27;re great. Very easy and quick. They have a very light, nice odor. They leave your skin feeling clean, not greasy. I&#x27;ll use nothing else. I signed up for them to be sent automatically so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several makeup removing cloths and this is my favorite so far.  It does not irritate my skin or eyes.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh, clean smell of these but more importantly, one cloth is enough to take off all my face and eye makeup.  I have sensitive skin, but these have proven to be very gentle and not caused any problems for me.</li>
    <li> these have a nice pineapple like scent and are wonderful at removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Great when traveling, but surprisingly dried out fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Great gentle makeup remover.  Love the soft clean scent and even though I was very sad that Garnier dropped it&#x27;s other foaming grape water cleanser, this turns out to be a much easier quicker makeup remover for me.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best wipes I&#x27;ve used. I used one at a friends house and fell in love. Now I can actually remove my makeup before bed without having to wash my face! They leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated but not greasy. I am usually sensitive to wipes: they&#x27;re either too drying, too rough, too stinky, and they always burn my eyes but never completely remove eye makeup. These do! I bought mine at Target though. You can get a much bigger package for about the same price.</li>
    <li> My wife has me purchase these with our monthly subscribe and save. It is a great deal with the that program. My wife says they work well with her nightly makeup removal and leave her skin clean and fresh. We will continue to purchase with the deal they are and how well they work.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean off excess eye liner and it works great. They smell nice and are gentle on your skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this are great. they do take makeup off easily and is not hard on the face. I would buy this again. I wish though that they have more than just 25 wipes in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier was my favorite and I&#x27;ve tried them all -- BUT I will not buy them anymore because THEY TEST ON ANIMALS, which I think is insane.  They do work the best, take off all eye make up and leave your skin refreshed.  Pity.  They need to be a more responsible company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy:  OK, but very pricey. This is the one I&#x27;ll continue to buy, as they DON&#x27;T TEST ON ANIMALS.  It cleans very well, not thrilled about the smell, but I can live with it.  Non-drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermologica:  Really small size and very $$.  Not impressed, though it is better than Olay ( tests on animals) and Comodynes (testing not reported).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comodynes:  I don&#x27;t know why people rated these so high -- they were horrible.  Very drying and I got the OAT type for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena:  My next favorites, after Garnier.  Made by Johnson and Johnson -- TEST ON ANIMALS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay:  Smells horrible, way to perfum-y.  Made me itch when it was supposed to be allergy free.  Also made my eyes burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any one knows of another cruelty free brand to try -- let me know!</li>
    <li> I trusted the other reviews of the Garnier Cleansing Towelettes and ordered them.  They&#x27;re truly great.  They leave my skin feeling moisturized but not oily, and they do a great job of removing my makeup and mascara (I don&#x27;t use waterproof, so can&#x27;t speak to their effectiveness in removing that kind of mascara).  I really wanted something for traveling, which this package will do easily - it reseals easily and effectively.  But I&#x27;m using them every day at home, too.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> the price per count appears to be incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;Just do the math before buying.&lt;br /&gt;Please correct me if I am wrong</li>
    <li> Garnier is known for testing products on animals. Please know this before you make your decision on which brand to buy.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with how good these wipes work. It is strong enough to remove even \\&quot;girls night out makeup\\&quot; without having to repeatedly rub your face until it turns all red. Somehow, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin either. The product that stays on your skin is moisturizing, so you can just go to bed if you are too tired to apply your night cream. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have to really rub to get my makeup off with these.  Takes twice as long as usual and still doesn&#x27;t get eyeliner off completely. Don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I trust for removing my makeup, whether for a party or for cosplay events and conventions.</li>
    <li> like this, it leave my face feeling nice and soft, and it works well removing makeup. Will definitely recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I had previously received this item through Subscribe &amp; Save. I used them as a bedtime facial cleansing wipe in place of face wash. They were not adequate at removing eye make up. The top of the packaging provides a reusable, clear sticky tab to dispense the cloths &amp; does well trapping moisture inside the packaging between uses. They are great for traveling, camping and music festivals. They are not perfumed and have a slight essential oil scent.</li>
    <li> These makeup remover towelettes are great.  They smell good and get your face really clean.  What I like about it is I wear a lot of mascara and this wipes it right away and does not sting my eyes and leaves you skin feeling so soft.  I love them!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these wipes at my local CVS after hearing a lot of good things about them from the make up gurus on YouTube. I was really disappointed in these as after a few days of use they caused my face to be really itchy and red and my whole face was covered in a light rash. The rash went away a few days after I stopped using them. The good thing about this product is it does remove make up well.</li>
    <li> THese dry out quickly.</li>
    <li> Love these! They even remove heavy eye makeup quickly and no tears!</li>
    <li> Did not remove makeup well. Neutrogena makeup remover is perfect</li>
    <li> These are the best skincare cleanser and makeup wipes I have tried. I have sensitive skin and cannot use all of the competing products out there. These are extremely moist, gentle on my skin--both the texture of the wipe and the cleanser--and extremely effective at removing makeup and oils. I find that they even remove some waterproof mascaras. Still, my favorite aspect of these wipes is the way my skin feels after using them. I feel clean and soft, with no sticky or oily residue. I have purchased these wipes twice now and will do so again.</li>
    <li> I usually use Aveeno products because I have sensitive skin, but I heard these remove makeup easier (which they do), so I decided to give them a try in sensitive skin. After three consecutive days of use, I ended up with 5 gaping wounds in my face from an allergic reaction to the product. That was a week ago and there are still HOLES in my face that are having an awful time trying to scab over. It&#x27;s ugly, red, and they are extremely sore. I feel like I have ulcers in my face. Do not buy this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was happy that it was so cheap. It didn&#x27;t break me out, it was very soft and it took off all of my makeup. I just wish is was more moist.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these, but they have been out of stock.  So truly refreshing.</li>
    <li> Th the product has an amazing quality. It gives a soft touch to my skin. It gently removes my make up and and wipes are well moisturize. Definitely number one choice for me.</li>
    <li> Just okay, not what I like it. I thought it will be more refreshing but it is just like the others. Nothing special about these</li>
    <li> These worked  good, but found a similar product at a much lower price at CVS.  I guess it is worth paying extra if you never get out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for 5+ years and glad that Amazon has them as part of Subscribe &amp; Save program. It works very well to remove mascara and eye shadow, and does a clean job of erasing foundation from your skin. It does leave a little oily residue, so I do rinse my face in cold water afterwards. Only negative (not going to deduct a start for this) is the packaging. Once half the towelettes are used, I have to make sure that the closing flap is tightly sealed so that it doesn&#x27;t dry out. I usually invert it so that the closing flap is faced down.</li>
    <li> These wipes work great! These are gentle on my skin, effective at removing makeup, and don&#x27;t leave a tacky residue like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I also am a full grown adult that still breaks out like a teenager, and these don&#x27;t cause my acne to flare up (finally!). I love these for travel, so these are my new go-to for taking on long flights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve had (which may be just my fault) was the bag ripping too much when I removed the original seal, so when I re-close it, it doesn&#x27;t quite fully seal. My wipes are still staying damp so no complaints here, just be careful when you open the package the first time.</li>
    <li> I bought these cleansing cloths locally because I like the Garnier hair care products and thought I&#x27;d give the facial products a try. I was very disappointed. The very first cloth from the package was much too dry and had a musty smell. The package did not seem to be damaged, so I believe this must be the normal appearance of the cloths. I won&#x27;t find out because I&#x27;m not buying it again. I never felt that my face was clean, so I always followed up with a set washcloth. I&#x27;m going back to L&#x27;Oreal and Olay.</li>
    <li> I feel like my face is really clean when I finish with them and it means I almost never skip washing my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d be lost without these. My skin is normal/dry and these have been fantastic and gentle. I&#x27;ve used them for several years now and can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough</li>
    <li> I have used many make-up removing wipes in the past. This isn&#x27;t one of the better ones... It does have a nice scent, but I had to use two wipes to remove all of my mascara each time I&#x27;ve used this product. Furthermore, it caused my sometimes sensitive eyes to have a negative reaction. They were crusted shut the next morning and swollen the entire next day. Unfortunately this just wasn&#x27;t the product for me.</li>
    <li> Though I think these face wipes are a little overpriced, they&#x27;re gentle, they don&#x27;t burn your eyes, and they remove pesky eye makeup in a flash. Cooling and light, they don&#x27;t leave a sticky residue either. I&#x27;d buy a case, if I were you. I like to leave a pack on my bedside table for those nights where I just can&#x27;t get myself to stand in front of the sink and splash water onto my face, then face wash, then eye makeup remover… sometimes it&#x27;s just too hard. These are also fabulous for freshening up on a camping trip, or swiping over your greasy skin after a day at the beach. The scent is innocuous enough that even boys can be convinced to use them.</li>
    <li> the best face care in the world wont  work if you dont use it and after a hard day I can barly get into bed let alone wash my face in a million steps but this is so easy I never fall asleep with my makeup on and that alone had made my skin glow!</li>
    <li> These wipes are fairly convenient for lazy day makeup removal. It takes a little bit more work or another product for removing more complicated makeup/mascaras but it can do a decent initial clean up at least. At first I found these slightly irritating around the eyes but after a while it didn&#x27;t bother me any longer.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, combination (oily/dry skin) which is hard to treat. I love these towelette&#x27;s, they are quick and easy and they don&#x27;t irritate my skin but are still able to clean it well and remove any oil or whatever got on my skin that day. You just have to watch and make sure you don&#x27;t get the top of the pack wet since it&#x27;s just a sticker between you and a dried out pack of towelette&#x27;s. I had this happen once before and am a lot more careful now. What I choose to do to avoid this is place them in a empty [[ASIN:B0000AN9KS Cottonelle Fresh Folded Moist Wipes Tub 42]] dispenser to keep them from drying out and worrying about the sticker giving out. Otherwise a must have cleaning tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/14/13:&lt;br /&gt;I found out something by accident, and liked it! When I ordered these it was in the middle of winter and in the low teens. The package wasn&#x27;t brought in till late so it was frozen. After I let it thaw out I went ahead and used one anyways even though it was cold. It felt fantastic! I now keep these in the fridge all the time and use them at night.</li>
    <li> Garnier - the product of genocide.  Garnier sent a &#x27;care package&#x27; to the women in the Israeli army so they could &#x27;pamper themselves&#x27; during times of war, presumable these wipes are used to wipe the blood of the slaughtered children of Palestine off their hands.  Boycott Garnier - supporters of mass murder and genocide.  I and my family and friends - pretty much everybody we know are now boycotting Garnier!  Shame on you all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. These makeup wipes are the only ones i&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t make me break out. I would reccommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the best facial wipe I&#x27;ve ever tried. I use nightly without fail. The green tea is so fresh and cooling. Just one removes all my make-up and has no trouble with getting ever bit of eye shadow and liner of any kind.</li>
    <li> I like to remove my makeup before working out at the gym, but who has time to actually wash their face?  I had been using the Neutrogena towelettes, and although they never caused me any breakouts, I thought they had a bit too much perfume and left a greasy feeling on my face and hands after use.  So, I went looking for another brand to try.  After reading other reviews, I decided to try these.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I think these clean better than the others and are thick enough that if I use one side for the initial cleaning, I can use the other side for a second pass.  After that, there is not much makeup, if any, left!  These have a nice, refreshing scent and do not leave an unpleasant residue on my face and hands after use.</li>
    <li> If you travel a lot, you know how &amp;#34;mucky&amp;#34; you can get on a plan. Great way to freshen up before a meeting if there&#x27;s no time for a hotel stop.</li>
    <li> What I love about these wipes is they are perfect for my sensitive skin and as a contact wearer it removes my make up without irritating my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands of face wipes and by far these are the best. Garnier products are my go to product.</li>
    <li> They are oil-free according to the label, yet they leave a slimy feeling on the skin.  Won&#x27;t be ordering them again.</li>
    <li> I have used more expensive brands, but the scent of this is really nice and the towels are moist enough to really clean off the makeup.</li>
    <li> These towelettes smell really good and I have not had any problems with my skin since I started using these. I have sensitive skin and I was looking for a cleansing towelette that I could use to remove my makeup, and so far they work very well.</li>
    <li> Love this product!,&lt;br /&gt;Use it every day.</li>
    <li> Works well. Smells good. They even take off eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I love these cleansing towelettes. They are truly refreshing and have a nice scent. I normally have a difficult time removing my mascara but with these towelettes my mascara came right off!</li>
    <li> I love this it is awesome.</li>
    <li> They do the job getting face clean and free of makeup</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on Amazon Reviews.  I must say - I am happily a convert!  I love this make up remover wipe.  Most wipes leave an oily residue on my face and it doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; afterwards.  This removes all the make-up, including stubborn eyeliner and mascara - and leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.  If you have dry skin - you may prefer an oilier wipe.  I have combination skin - and this is perfect for me.  Happy to have found this wipe!</li>
    <li> These towelettes do what they claim to do - they remove make-up; even waterproof mascara. If your face tends to be a little on the oily side, this product is not for you.  Sometimes after using them, I would need to wash my face as it felt like my face was not clean.</li>
    <li> I love these makeup remover wipes! Of all the different brands that I have tried, these do not burn my eyes and they are soft and gentle and don&#x27;t leave any redness on your face. I have not used any other brand since I have found these wipes almost 2 years ago. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I really like this as I save on water and I can take it anywhere to cleanse my face. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Takes the make up right off</li>
</ol>
