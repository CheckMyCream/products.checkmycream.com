    <li> I use this when I fly and also to help get wrinkles out of my clothes when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy, but it is refreshing to use, especially in a dry climate. I bought them as stocking stuffers for female family members. Most sellers charge an arm and a leg for this product. (I do NOT think it is worth $5 or more for a single small travel-size bottle.) I bought it from Mary&#x27;s-Market, however, which made it affordable, and came with excellent service.</li>
    <li> Bring it on hot summer!! :)</li>

    <li> Pure hydrating water in a convenient spray.&lt;br /&gt;Helps calm cranky babies when you are outside and can&#x27;t get indoors, or you are on an outside adventure. Most of the time it makes them laugh or at least distracted enough from their heat discomfort to allow the calming effects of the water spray to cool them.&lt;br /&gt;For skin health, Dermatologists recommend to hydrate the skin before your creams,etc.,so that the absoration rate is greater. Seems to work in that regard as well. This is a clean, natural toner after cleansing and the minerals are good for the skin.</li>
    <li> Got for a trip and did not use it all that much.  Now I keep on by my bed to cool down those hot flashes, lol!  Works great!</li>
    <li> It is good for dry skin</li>
    <li> Very convenient to hydrate the skin and refresh your face.  Perfect for carry-on for inflight use.</li>
    <li> Great for extended driving and you feel the idus coming on. Also anybody who&#x27;s flown internationally for 10-16 hours knows how dry an airplane gets and when you wake up your just dry and messed up. Spray this on your face and eyes and your awake and refreshed in no time!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from Rosacea for at least 6 years! People who have Rosacea can understand the feeling of heat on the face like it&#x27;s burning! I was always looking for something that can cool my face immediately without causing a mess. Yes, this is the ONE!</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what you get.  Nice to have but not for the price</li>
    <li> I always get these in the summer because it is hot here</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this mineral water facial spray. This size is great if you fly a lot as skin gets dehydrated during flights so a nice spray of this makes your skin feel and look great. Even sets makeup so you dont have to worry about any mess.</li>
