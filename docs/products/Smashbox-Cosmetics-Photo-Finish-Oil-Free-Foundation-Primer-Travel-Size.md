<li> IT was completely my fault that I did not realize how small this bottle was.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on here esp since I got this in my Ipsy along with 4 other beauty products for only $10.00</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, seems to create a smoothness and makes pores less noticeable.</li>
<li> so I bought the small bottle to hold me over.</li>
<li> I mean it was so small</li>
<li> Not thrilled with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
<li> (the tubing is very small for the price)</li>
<li> very small tube.</li>

    <li> I have a very oily t-zone and this helps a little. It doesn&#x27;t keep me totally oil free but it minimizes it for about 4 hours. I like that it&#x27;s oil free.&lt;br /&gt;This clear gel glides on and disappears into my skin perfectly. This one and benefit&#x27;s porefessional are my fav and that gal by Benefit.</li>
    <li> Wow the.25 is not travel size it&#x27;s actually sample sized and not supposed to be resold! Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on here esp since I got this in my Ipsy along with 4 other beauty products for only $10.00</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a cream primer and it was more like a gel.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t aware it was a travel size when I bought it, but it&#x27;s a great product...can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Makes foundation look beautiful and smooth!</li>
    <li> This is much smaller than originally thought.</li>
    <li> I have very, very oily skin. This made my face feel greasy, I found elf was better, the tube is small, I put up pictures to show, I had just gotten the ELF and tried it, it came in a bigger bottle and only got literally 2 uses!! This tube seems you will get more then 2 uses.</li>
    <li> This is a sample size not a travel size. Read the fine print. When a product reads not to be sold that is a sample.</li>
    <li> IT was completely my fault that I did not realize how small this bottle was. LOLOL.  I mean it was so small I think I lost it already.</li>
    <li> Months after I got this I am ordering more. It didn&#x27;t make me break out, which I was worried about because it did feel greasy on my hands but not on my face. It goes on and dries instantly like powder. I cant live without it.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;And very small tube. Thought it was gonna be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it that much personally.</li>
    <li> The first time I use the Smash box Photo Finish primer skin was flawless and smooth .. I use it again and didn&#x27;t receive the same results maybeI ddidn&#x27;t use the same makeup or may have been rushing... I expected a different look but I must say it does work well...&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again.. (the tubing is very small for the price) my gift was awesome with purchase..</li>
    <li> Gives your makeup a smooth flawless finish helps my makeup stay in place longer than it usually would with using this product. Will invest n larger size</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, seems to create a smoothness and makes pores less noticeable.</li>
    <li> What a disgrace. I am still unsure what everyone else is raving about. Smashbox Photo Finish primer did absolutely nothing for me. And it&#x27;s a real shame too because this was my first experience using a makeup primer of any sort and it actually turned me off from using makeup primers at all. I think that Smashbox needs to go back to the drawing board with this one.</li>
    <li> Love this product always have - wish it were not so expensive - so I bought the small bottle to hold me over.</li>
    <li> my skin feels so awesome after applying this product!! i love it and think it works great. i only use it when we are going out not every day as i work production in a warehouse so they don&#x27;t deserve this product lol</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this. I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> Product is fine but it&#x27;s a free sample size.  I paid way to much.</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a sample. It has a nice finish but if you have oily skin like me, it doesn&#x27;t hold up til the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great prep for foundation.</li>
