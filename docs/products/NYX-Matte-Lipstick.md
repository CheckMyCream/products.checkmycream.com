      <li>Amazing nude color</li>
      <li>NYX is becoming more popular so can also be purchased in Target, ULTA etc.</li>
      <li>The lipstick I ordered from you guys is not the color of NYX butter its more like NYX nude</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip color for daytime.</li>
      <li>I love NYX and this matte formula.</li>
      <li>( my top lip is darker)</li>
      <li>The product itself is just as I expected, perfect!</li>
      <li>However I do like mixing it with a light nude lipstick and the color is better for me.</li>
      <li>but make sure you have moisturized lips if you order matte or else it won&#x27;t be pretty !</li>
      <li>beautiful color, love it on my dark skin tone, sometimes us it without liner.</li>
      <li>Very creamy, nice matte finish.  </li>
      <li>and this is a light matte</li>
      <li>The color of the lipstick I received was significantly darker than that of the image online.</li>
      <li>Great color stays on forever and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips dry</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is a true nyx lipstick</li>
      <li>The perfect nude and it last a fairly long time before re-applying it.</li>
      <li>but it looks better with a clear gloss over it with a lip liner</li>
      <li>The price is right too.</li>
      <li>and it comes out to be quite dark for my fair complexion.</li>
      <li>The product stays on nicely but tends be be a bit dry feeling</li>
      <li>But this one is pretty creamy.  </li>
      <li>I will most likely stick to purchasing these in the store</li>
      <li>I was expecting Butter to be a pretty nude</li>
      <li>I put a l&#x27;oreal colour juice over it and it looks really pretty.  </li>
      <li>I am not a makeup person at all this is my first attempt</li>
      <li>This is a new favorite and will be used daily.  </li>
      <li>I made a review about it, And the seller actually contacted me and sent me a replacement of free.</li>
      <li>it is a matte color, but as all things you buy online you cant really see the real color.</li>
      <li>Very flattering for all skin types.</li>
      <li>Very brownish nude.</li>
      <li>But I will say that the color and texture  really made my lips kissable...</li>
      <li>This product is much darker than it appears online.</li>
      <li>I thought it was much lighter</li>
      <li>Need to mix it with some pink to make it look ok on me.</li>
      <li>Really gives the Kim K. look.  </li>
      <li>Color is much darker than picture showsðŸ‘Ž</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice matte lipstick but leaves your lips feeling a little dry.</li>
      <li>Then Audrey is a very pretty pink on me and I would reccomend for any skin tone.</li>
      <li>I saw a product review on youtube, I guess the outcome will depend on your lips natural shade.</li>

<li> so I just use a little clear gloss</li>
<li> so I could wear a pink lipstick and it wouldn&#x27;t turn purple on my upper lip</li>
<li> I was put off my the \\&quot;matte\\&quot; aspect since Ive have some dry cracked looks with mattes before.  </li>
<li> Very smooth consistency as well, doesn&#x27;t get caught up on dry bits too bad.</li>
<li> what I do is put a little  lipgloss  over it to get rid of the dry lips</li>
<li> it came in a dark brown color</li>
<li> , I understand I am dark skinned</li>
<li> but it was very dark nude (almost brown).</li>
<li> I thought it made me seem dead</li>
<li> I was not sure if it was through the post office or seller</li>
<li> I apply pink too soon after it just mixes into a weird color.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think that the color is exactly what I was looking for, but that was my bad, not the product!</li>
<li> so I tried this lipstick, at first I hated it</li>
<li> This is fake.</li>
<li> so I dont get a bad color again.</li>
<li> and this just looks terrible on me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it came in a dark brown color</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip color for daytime.The product stays on nicely but tends be be a bit dry feeling so I just use a little clear gloss or if I want to keep the matte finish, I just use some chap stick on top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for that nude pouty look.The price is right too.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOVE THIS LIP COLOR</li>
    <li> Color is much darker than picture showsðŸ‘Ž</li>
    <li> I know this is a matte lipstick but it looks better with a clear gloss over it with a lip liner</li>

    <li> Love the color, the texture and the price!</li>
    <li> This is fake. The lipstick I ordered from you guys is not the color of NYX butter its more like NYX nude</li>
    <li> The color is a bit darker than shown on the picture.  It&#x27;s a nice matte lipstick but leaves your lips feeling a little dry.</li>

    <li> Awesome nude color.  This is a new favorite and will be used daily.  Really gives the Kim K. look.  Very creamy, nice matte finish.  Very flattering for all skin types.</li>
    <li> This product is much darker than it appears online. Imagine rubbing feces on your lips and you&#x27;ve got the actual color.</li>
    <li> Update: When I initially purchased this item, it was damaged. I was not sure if it was through the post office or seller but it was melted. I made a review about it, And the seller actually contacted me and sent me a replacement of free. They went above and beyond my expectations. The product itself is just as I expected, perfect!</li>
    <li> The color of the lipstick I received was significantly darker than that of the image online.</li>
    <li> I was put off my the \\&quot;matte\\&quot; aspect since Ive have some dry cracked looks with mattes before.  But this one is pretty creamy.  I put a l&#x27;oreal colour juice over it and it looks really pretty.  I would def buy this again.</li>
    <li> I saw a product review on youtube, I guess the outcome will depend on your lips natural shade.</li>
    <li> I purchased the colors Butter and Audrey. I was expecting Butter to be a pretty nude but it was very dark nude (almost brown). I have olive skin tone but currently have a deep tan and this just looks terrible on me. However I do like mixing it with a light nude lipstick and the color is better for me. Then Audrey is a very pretty pink on me and I would reccomend for any skin tone. I love NYX and this matte formula. I will most likely stick to purchasing these in the store so I dont get a bad color again.</li>
    <li> It was so NOT this color!</li>
    <li> The perfect nude and it last a fairly long time before re-applying it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is a true nyx lipstick, I understand I am dark skinned and this is a light matte but, there is no pigmentation whatsoever. This made my lips look ashy.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous muted brown/taupe color. I adore it and it&#x27;s become a staple in my daily routine. Very smooth consistency as well, doesn&#x27;t get caught up on dry bits too bad.</li>
    <li> Shad is opaque and matte- on time deilvery. NYX is becoming more popular so can also be purchased in Target, ULTA etc.</li>
    <li> Great color stays on forever and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips dry</li>
    <li> so I tried this lipstick, at first I hated it but I guess I just wasn&#x27;t used to what it looks like on me. I thought it made me seem dead and I thought I needed darker matte color. But it wasn&#x27;t until I took pictures that I started to see what it was supposed to look like. Now I got this so I could wear a pink lipstick and it wouldn&#x27;t turn purple on my upper lip( my top lip is darker) but it I apply pink too soon after it just mixes into a weird color.  It had to be applied and worn for a while before you apply anything else. I am not a makeup person at all this is my first attempt but I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
    <li> Beautiful lipstick but make sure you have moisturized lips if you order matte or else it won&#x27;t be pretty !</li>
    <li> The color was darker/duller than I though.</li>
    <li> This is my Go to nude color. Even though it is a matte lipstick it is not drying goes on smooth and blends well!!</li>
    <li> Amazing nude color I love it so much I got a back up of a back up because it&#x27;s always out of stock here</li>
    <li> In the picture this looks like a pinky nude. It is not at all. Very brownish nude. Need to mix it with some pink to make it look ok on me.</li>
    <li> I loved the lipstick...  what I do is put a little  lipgloss  over it to get rid of the dry lips look. But I will say that the color and texture  really made my lips kissable...</li>
