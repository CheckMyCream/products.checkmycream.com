      <li>Love this elf eyeshadow pallet is cheap and amazing!</li>
      <li>I love my elf set, the colors are gorgeous, shimmery and fun, though the darker ones aren&#x27;t shimmery, which is nice.</li>
      <li>and it went on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>If you use your finger they apply color better on your lid but it gets everywhere.</li>
      <li>I love the colors in the set</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not glittery, they&#x27;re more shimmery, almost dewy looking.</li>
      <li>I love earth tones.</li>
      <li>I LOVE ELF PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>I love this palette.</li>
      <li>This is perfect as a daily staple.</li>
      <li>I love the colors..</li>
      <li>so I could make many eye shadow layers of color depending onwhat</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>They all have pretty good color pay off.</li>
      <li>and I tried it the first day I got it and loved it.</li>
      <li>The palette is a nice size &amp; feels pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>While they&#x27;re not the most pigmented, they work very nicely if you apply with a wet brush.</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors, but the color payoff kind of sucks.</li>
      <li>and I got a full refund for the eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>Love the colors, fast shipping</li>
      <li>It so full of color full of matte colors and the color are what it looks likes.</li>
      <li>Lid broke off pretty quickly though.</li>
      <li>I had read other reviews to wet the applicator before using and that works great, gives me a lot more pigmentation and dries pretty quickly as well</li>
      <li>They are very pigmented and very pretty.</li>
      <li>colors are nice, mirror is a nice addition, and the only pronlem I have had so far is getting enough pigment applied</li>
      <li>They are not highly pigmented, but the sparkle is nice.</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>I have to first scrape them before I dip my brush.</li>
      <li>Most definitely~</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with baked eyeshadow</li>
      <li>Love the different brown colors on my eyes</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter exactly what she wanted.</li>
      <li>The compact has a large mirror.</li>
      <li>Came in the mail really fast</li>
      <li>I really like this palette.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell the difference in the light shades, browns or blacks that are of similar hue.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really care too much</li>
      <li>I like how soft the brush is but the first time I used it the handle fell off</li>
      <li>This and Clinique are the only eye shadows I&#x27;ve been able to use in the last year or so.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to a person who is just learning to use make up or someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend the cash on high end make up</li>
      <li>Colors aren&#x27;t as dark on the lid as in the pan, and most of the colors are better off used wet than dry, but over all i think all the colors are really pretty on the eyes</li>
      <li>Great brand, you cannot go wrong.</li>
      <li>I will be picking up the different colored palettes in the future since these are nice and way cheaper than the similar sephora palettes.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really need a lot of expertise to apply it on and they are really pretty especially if you use it at night.</li>
      <li>I especially like the golden browns.</li>
      <li>Bought it because I wanted a new eyeshadow palette....</li>
      <li>but when you try and apply them-- even wet-- you barely get more than a sheer wash of color.</li>
      <li>They are shimmery and last the whole day.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s really cheap, fun and can be used everyday.</li>
      <li>They look fantastic wet and dry.</li>
      <li>It is a complete and utter disaster...</li>
      <li>Since they are baked eye shadows you have to wet your brush in order for them to really show up.</li>
      <li>Might be good for a teenager not looking for dramatic makeup or even everyday wear for an adult, but I was really hoping for more pigmentation. :(</li>

<li> you have to press hard for the colors to actually show up on the brush.  </li>
<li> but every thing has goten so expensive to return, I am going to give it to my 8 year old niece to play with and her friends.</li>
<li> The palette also came with the shadows broken in pieces, which made it harder to apply since the colors were all smudged on each other.</li>
<li> It looks subtle on me (I am a Filipino) and I like the glittery effect but not really like you are shouting for attention.</li>
<li> should have listen to other when they said you will receive it all broken in pieces&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My problem was that my palette arrived with two colors broken off, and they spread their powder over all of the other colors.</li>
<li> it is so hard in the palette, that you cannot get any on a  brush.  </li>
<li> spend my money to receive this seriously ?</li>

    <li> Nice colours! Applies nicely. Lid broke off pretty quickly though. Otherwise Grady deal for the$!!!  :)</li>

    <li> I like the colors in this palette. While they&#x27;re not the most pigmented, they work very nicely if you apply with a wet brush. My problem was that my palette arrived with two colors broken off, and they spread their powder over all of the other colors. I requested a replacement, and this time one color was broken. Thankfully, Amazon customer service is amazing and I got a full refund for the eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice I love earth tones. Just wise the tone was as strong on the skin and it went on very smoothly. For the price a very good deal.</li>
    <li> Really a great value. The compact has a large mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these palettes I have purchased recently. I really like it! They all have pretty good color pay off. The price is awesome and they blend well together. They look fantastic wet and dry.</li>
    <li> I love the colors.. but you need yo rub the brush real hard on the shadow to use it..</li>
    <li> These are my favorite pallets, they are an amazing price with awesome color selection.  I had read other reviews to wet the applicator before using and that works great, gives me a lot more pigmentation and dries pretty quickly as well</li>
    <li> Love this elf eyeshadow pallet is cheap and amazing! I would recommend this to a person who is just learning to use make up or someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend the cash on high end make up</li>
    <li> Busted !&lt;br /&gt;I should have listen to other when they said you will receive it all broken in pieces&lt;br /&gt;I spend my money to receive this seriously ?</li>

    <li> Bought this for my daughter exactly what she wanted. Thank you. Better then the $40 ones at the mall!</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette is gorgeous!!! It is lighter than I expected when applied with a dry brush, but when using a wet one, all I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;! The colors in the Texas palette are absolutely beautiful! This is my first experience with baked eyeshadow and I have to say that I love it! One of my colors was broken upon arrival, but that does not interfere with application. The palette is a nice size &amp; feels pretty sturdy. The mirror is as big as the entire lid. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty but the texture of the eyeshadow is hard like glitter. Doesn&#x27;t apply well.</li>
    <li> I like how soft the brush is but the first time I used it the handle fell off</li>
    <li> Store bought eyeshadow has started to cause me to break out.  I think it&#x27;s the formaldehyde equivalent ingredients in some.  This brand; however, does not cause a reaction.  This and Clinique are the only eye shadows I&#x27;ve been able to use in the last year or so.  If you have allergy issues try ELF - if you need something budget friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that there&#x27;s not a lot of color to the palettes.  I cannot tell the difference in the light shades, browns or blacks that are of similar hue.  They are not highly pigmented, but the sparkle is nice.</li>
    <li> This iis the worst makeup i have ever tried...it is so hard in the palette, that you cannot get any on a  brush.  You cannot get any on a sponge tip applicator or a Q-Tip and about the only way is with your finger and that is being careful not to completely break the color dot.... I thought the variety of colors would make a nice palette so I could make many eye shadow layers of color depending onwhat I was wearing and and what time of the day or night it was.  Well, nothing happened.  I cannot use the colors they do not com out of the palette , not even the shimmer ones.  It is a complete and utter disaster... I would have sent it back but every thing has goten so expensive to return, I am going to give it to my 8 year old niece to play with and her friends.</li>
    <li> Outstanding buy, the colors are wonderful. This is perfect as a daily staple. Great brand, you cannot go wrong. I had to buy 2.</li>
    <li> Love the different brown colors on my eyes</li>
    <li> Great color!  Very easy to apply and lasts all day.  I would purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best pallete i have. It so full of color full of matte colors and the color are what it looks likes. It PERFECT</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, but the color payoff kind of sucks. I have to first scrape them before I dip my brush. If you use your finger they apply color better on your lid but it gets everywhere. Lots of fallout as well. Sorry ELF. I honestly only bought it because it was the &amp;#34;Texas&amp;#34; palette lol</li>
    <li> I love this palette. Really nice and pigmented colors. Good variety and great value</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows are good. The picture is a bit deceptive.  I thought that they would be bigger.  The colors are great and apply relatively easily. The look great and wear well. For the price I  would purchase again.</li>
    <li> If you are a girl without a lot of experiences in putting on make-ups esp eye shadows, this is a perfect start up eye shadow for you. It doesn&#x27;t really need a lot of expertise to apply it on and they are really pretty especially if you use it at night. It looks subtle on me (I am a Filipino) and I like the glittery effect but not really like you are shouting for attention. It also has 10 colors to choose from. You have the option to mix and match the colors and use lighter shades for the day and darker for night outs. I only rated it 4 because it doesn&#x27;t have an eye brush or applicator which I initially thought was included. Other than that it&#x27;s really cheap, fun and can be used everyday. I would totally recommend it. ☺</li>
    <li> Thought it was bigger.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this at all. It sucked.</li>
    <li> I love the colors in the set but when you try and apply them-- even wet-- you barely get more than a sheer wash of color. Might be good for a teenager not looking for dramatic makeup or even everyday wear for an adult, but I was really hoping for more pigmentation. :(</li>
    <li> Love the colors, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good for kids. Low pigment.</li>
    <li> you have to press hard for the colors to actually show up on the brush.  I usually just use the lighter colors as a base and a different palette over it.</li>
    <li> Colours are lovely! Nice size. Nice price! Order again. Most definitely~</li>
    <li> I LOVE ELF PRODUCTS. This is the best pigmented make up to buy!!! I apply it dry and no primer is needed.</li>
    <li> others have posted the pigment/color doesn&#x27;t stay.  I use Urban Decay eye primer and my color/pigment stayed all day and night.  Never had to touch it up.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i receive this item broken and i am very sad and not satisfied</li>
    <li> Came in the mail really fast and I tried it the first day I got it and loved it. The colors are beautiful and lasted all day. A great pallet. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Bought it because I wanted a new eyeshadow palette.... colors are nice, mirror is a nice addition, and the only pronlem I have had so far is getting enough pigment applied</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t stay on. had to use allot of it for it to show.</li>
    <li> It is not as pigmented as I thought. The palette also came with the shadows broken in pieces, which made it harder to apply since the colors were all smudged on each other.</li>
    <li> I adore this eye shadow palette! Since they are baked eye shadows you have to wet your brush in order for them to really show up. They are very pigmented and very pretty. They are shimmery and last the whole day. I especially like the golden browns. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice colors but they are basically colored glitter. And they are VERY hard and don&#x27;t coat the brush well. There is a lot of fall out. It&#x27;s elf and it wasn&#x27;t expensive so I don&#x27;t really care too much that it&#x27;s not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well for Halloween but I wouldn&#x27;t not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love my elf set, the colors are gorgeous, shimmery and fun, though the darker ones aren&#x27;t shimmery, which is nice. I can compare this set to my Sephora Baked Moonshadow set, not QUITE as luxurious, but definitely close, close enough that for the price, I would choose this set.</li>
