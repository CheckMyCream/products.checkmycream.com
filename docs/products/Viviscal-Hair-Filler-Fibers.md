      <li>but after I fix my hair it looked really good</li>
      <li>Good product</li>
      <li>I selected the Light Brown because it looked like the perfect match for my hair.</li>
      <li>I do wear contacts, with reading glasses that I push up onto my head -- something else that probably won&#x27;t be a good mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love this product, very easy to use with great results!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>This works great at filling in those bald spots, better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

      <li>just kind of shake it on the grays or the bald spot...</li>
      <li>Camouflaged thinning areas on scalp nicely.</li>
      <li>It is not noticeable as it blends in with  your own hair.</li>
      <li>After I do that, I put hair spray on the area very lightly.</li>
      <li>It does make you look as if you have more hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, like so many women in their 60’s, my hair is gradually thinning.</li>
      <li>I have used top it and it stays in place better, and also Infusion i like better.</li>
      <li>rain should be ok.</li>

      <li>I am 100% satisfied with Amazon and its shipping.</li>
      <li>I am wonderfully satisfied.</li>
      <li>i feel way more confident with it</li>
      <li>Gargage  - Better off using your coffee grounds -</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>The result was amazing -- the light brown Viviscal went on smoothly and just made the scalp disappear!  </li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll work with it - maybe it&#x27;s supposed to look a bit like shadows or something...</li>
      <li>: I haven&#x27;t gotten any better</li>
      <li>This works better than  Toppik Hair Building Fibers.  </li>
      <li>VIVISCAL  is better, Fills in the thinning hair part.  </li>
      <li>I’m so glad to have found it.</li>
      <li>Love it  makes.</li>
      <li>This product has saved me from embarrassment as my hair is thinning on top and this powder does the trick in covering it up and is not noticeable</li>
      <li>It really works!!!!</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s a very straightforward guy, and he said he couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>This product is really cool and amazing...</li>
      <li>followed the directions and lightly sprinkled the fibers all over the top of my thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and works</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
      <li>This is NOT as easy to apply as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Another advantage is that it&#x27;s easy to shampoo out</li>
      <li>I find this product to be easy to use and was amazed  how it conformed to my hair color...</li>
      <li>I went in the bathroom to check, but it still looked fine to me.</li>
      <li>and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>I was pleased at just how well this product covered the area, and how quickly the problem disappeared.</li>
      <li>Price is great I have been using this product for over 2 months now and still have over 3/4 left.  </li>
      <li>The light brown is almost a reddish/auburn in the light.</li>
      <li>The Viviscal hair fibers do work and covers in the thinning areas nicely without much effort</li>
      <li>Just make sure you get the right color, or mix two.</li>
      <li>I was able to mix it and get the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly, and even though I color her a medium to dark brown, this color blended right in.</li>
      <li>Matched my hair perfectly and they are thick and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>But their charts are pretty accurate and that&#x27;s not a problem to do!</li>
      <li>I was excited when the Viviscal Hair Filler Fibers arrived.</li>
      <li>The hormonal hair thinning was greatly hastened by me developing a nervous habit of pulling out dry, gray hairs throughout the day.</li>
      <li>OK, I suppose if you have very thinning hair and will do anything to make it look thicker - then you might give this product 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>I have thinning hair on top and this really does give the effect of thicker hair.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I would say this is a good product</li>
      <li>it really helps camouflage the area and make it look better until I get a chance to color it again.</li>
      <li>Later, before I was ready to head out, I thought &amp;#34;hey -- that stuff looked so great</li>
      <li>(Luckily, my hair is quite plentiful elsewhere.)</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m adding a note to say it might take MORE than just a steady hand/application.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome product for those who has partial to major hair loss.</li>
      <li>A couple of spots showed, kind of like mascara clumps, but they brushed out easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>If you go too light, you have to use too much, and it just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>the right color shade.  </li>
      <li>Like it when I finally clean up all the &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; that gets all over everythng when you gently shake it on to the bald spots.</li>
      <li>My hair is very straight and fine, and, now that I&#x27;m &#x27;of a certain age,&#x27; there is more scalp showing at the part than there used to be, especially up toward the bangs.  </li>
      <li>It is darker than what I would normally envision as a light brown color.</li>
      <li>I had to mix this product in with a variety of other products until I could form the right quality to put on my head and most importantly, the right shade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good to cover the almost bold area, but this light brown color runs dark for a dark blond...</li>
      <li>It takes a bit of practice to get the best results but essentially, you just shake a few of the colored fibers over the spots you want to camouflage.</li>
      <li>For my needs, I expect one jar to easily last a minimum of three months, probably more, but</li>
      <li>I was finally going to be able to do something with my thinning hair - or so I thought.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Viviscal!</li>
      <li>first I didn&#x27;t grasp what he was talking about</li>
      <li>I have tried using a lot of other hair fiber fibers in the last year, and Viviscal has worked the best for so far, at first</li>
      <li>have been using this product for 3 years with very good results, and a little goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Viviscal is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, you only need to use a small amount and your hair looks very full and thick. I love it!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for those who has partial to major hair loss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good to cover the almost bold area, but this light brown color runs dark for a dark blond...</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of applying this product, it is a lot less messy.  I ordered the light brown, and it is very dark.  It does stay put though, and it really makes my hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> you have extremely thin hair it will look like dirt but if you cover it well enough it looks natural, takes practice to get good at it, and can be messy, i recommend not wearing the shirt you were going to wear or maybe use a towel. stays on through everything except water. rain should be ok. i feel way more confident with it so ill have to keep ordering it but the light brown is still fairly dark. wish they had a little lighter of one. i recommend it though</li>
    <li> Does well at hiding scalp.</li>
    <li> This works better than  Toppik Hair Building Fibers.  VIVISCAL  is better, Fills in the thinning hair part.  Last from hair wash to hair wash.  Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Get the right color shade.  Price is great I have been using this product for over 2 months now and still have over 3/4 left.  Do not have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> I recommend to all.IM USING TOGETHER WITH MY SISTER.i,M USING IT ONCE A WEEK.that S ENOUGH THE COLOUR IS PERFECT AND FIBBERS TOO. .</li>
    <li> These have been a lifesaver for me. I was really bummed about my thinning hair but the filler fibers give me that extra boost of confidence.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000CBVAQ0 Toppik Economy Dark Brown Hair Building Fibers, 0.97 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000QGKQXO Toppik Spray Applicator]]&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Toppik, but I thought I would try this. This was a terrible experience for me. It went everywhere and gave very poor coverage. Even though I used a ton of hairspray, it just disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to Toppik, yes, it gets everywhere too (if you use too much, but it brushes off), but at least it stays in my hair with just a little hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 3 years with very good results, and a little goes a long way. Just make sure you get the right color, or mix two. If you go too light, you have to use too much, and it just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
    <li> This works better than other simuliar products out there.  I need a temporary cover up for a bald spot due to coloring hair with a the wrong products, and this does the job!</li>
    <li> The Viviscal hair fibers do work and covers in the thinning areas nicely without much effort but I seem to waste a lot when applying - just as much fiber on my makeup table as on my hair.  It does seem to volumize my hair and makes it look fuller.  Unfortunately, some of the fiber transfers to my pillow while I sleep and leaves smudges but comes out in the wash.  Good product but a lot is wasted in the application.</li>
    <li> OK, I suppose if you have very thinning hair and will do anything to make it look thicker - then you might give this product 5 stars.  It does make you look as if you have more hair.  But, when I used it, I would bump my hand on my hair or bump clothing and it came off on my hand or clothing.  Ewwww.  But, if you are someone who just wants to go out, one night and make your hair look thicker from a distance of say 1 foot away - then this will work.</li>
    <li> It does help- I was a little sceptical about trying it, and also the fact that I NEED to! Nothing of course replaces actual hair! But- it does seem to give my hair a little depth in my thinning scalp. Also seems to stay put fairly well. I put a spray of hairspray on it after application and it seems to help. Wish it came in a few more colors though.</li>
    <li> I am getting thinning hair and didn&#x27;t know what to do about it. I sprinkle it on the bald spots and press it in and it works just fine. I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I was excited when the Viviscal Hair Filler Fibers arrived. I was finally going to be able to do something with my thinning hair - or so I thought. I selected the Light Brown because it looked like the perfect match for my hair. What arrived was a very dark brown color, even though it was marked Light Brown. Ok, I&#x27;ll work with it - maybe it&#x27;s supposed to look a bit like shadows or something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and lightly sprinkled the fibers all over the top of my thinning hair. It looked GREAT in the mirror. I was amazed at the change. As the day went on, I had forgotten about using it and was outside when hubby came home. He was talking to me and kept looking at me strangely. Finally he said, &amp;#34;Um, you&#x27;ve got a bunch of dirt all over your head. What on earth were you doing today?!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t grasp what he was talking about and then I remembered. I went in the bathroom to check, but it still looked fine to me. I decided to brush it out. Big mistake!! Now I had little rows of &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; all over my head. Hubby was laughing and having a great time with my &amp;#34;vanity&amp;#34; as he called it. I ended up washing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it another chance. I figured I had just done it incorrectly, so I had my adult daughter sprinkle it on for me. Even though she controlled it better than I probably did, it still had a terrible appearance in natural lighting. To say I was disappointed is a complete understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, Viviscal Hair Filler Fibers just doesn&#x27;t work for my outdoor active lifestyle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome at covering sparse areas.  You cannot detect it in your hair, it works like magic!  It does not come out until you wash it out.</li>
    <li> My part seems to be getting wider these days, but I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without this product!!</li>
    <li> I finally got to use this on one of my brunette clients. It worked perfectly, and even though I color her a medium to dark brown, this color blended right in. I&#x27;ll need to get the blonde next for my thin, fine haired clients. Easy to use, and works slightly better than other same type products I&#x27;ve used in the past. If you have thin, fine, or an early balding head of hair you should try this product...hold the bottle at an angle next to your scalp and lightly tap the bottle. Experiment with the amount of Viviscal you use; starting with less and adding more each time until you find the amount that works with your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for masking hair loss.  It just take a little practice to get it just right.  You can&#x27;t be too heavy handed.  Sprinkle a little in at a time.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> So thankful to have found this product.  I have thinning hair on top and this really does give the effect of thicker hair.  I use it daily!!</li>
    <li> Matched my hair perfectly and they are thick and easy to apply. If you have thinning hair I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> The hair filler did a very good job on covering the scalp area where the hair is the thinnest.  It definitely made my hair look a lot fuller.  i would recommend this product to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> this product help boost my confidence while I regrow my hair this is a miracle highly recommended</li>
    <li> Some of the best non-real hair fibers you can buy. However, the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;??? Really? It&#x27;s waaaaay too dark of a brown to be called &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; that was the most frustrating part. I had to mix this product in with a variety of other products until I could form the right quality to put on my head and most importantly, the right shade.</li>
    <li> I have a few thin areas in my hair thanks to menopause and a quick sprinkle of this makes it dissapear.  I have med to dark brown hair and this worked fine. It doesnt take much and has lasted a really long time.</li>
    <li> I have used top it and it stays in place better, and also Infusion i like better.</li>
    <li> Made hair appear fuller &amp; thicker.  Camouflaged thinning areas on scalp nicely. Not messy to use compared to spray versions.</li>
    <li> Because of a surgical scar, I have an area on my scalp that won’t grow hair. I was pleased at just how well this product covered the area, and how quickly the problem disappeared. Application is simple. There is a very fine perforated lid covering the jar of colored fibers that permits a small amount of product to be sprinkled out in as controlled a way as possible with this type of delivery system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a way that appeared perfectly natural to me, the area was completely filled-in and very little was necessary to accomplish the task. For my needs, I expect one jar to easily last a minimum of three months, probably more, but obviously that will vary with each individual usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium to darkish brown hair but the light brown shade I used was a perfect match. It is darker than what I would normally envision as a light brown color. I also sprinkled a small amount of the blonde product on top of the already covered area and found that by lightly layering the two colors it created variation and depth, with a final result that looked more natural. The entire process only took a minute, and in my case, less is more.  The product is a winner.</li>
    <li> I got this and blond to mix in and cover some medication related thinning. I need a very dark blond or light brown. It worked perfectly to mix the too. I was able to mix it and get the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly even though it was not too dark or too light, it was too red. The red in the light brown is pronounced enough that it gave a bright little halo effect. It certainly did not blend in at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the fibers do fill in thin spots, you will want to make sure it works for your hairstyle. If you have a pronounced part in your hair this may not work for you. It covers the part like paint. I cleaned it off the part with a q-tip but you could still the fibers too clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short, not very fine hair with no part- this will be great.</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair, this product makes it look thick again. The price was the best on Amazon. Even my hairdresser can&#x27;t believe how thick my hair looks when using this in the thinnest places.</li>
    <li> This works great at filling in those bald spots, better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. It is not noticeable as it blends in with  your own hair.</li>
    <li> These really work to help fill in the thinner spots and look natural. No one can tell I use them. Highly recommend to anyone that needs a little fill in on thin spots on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, very easy to use with great results! It truly made a difference in the thickness and appearance of my hair!</li>
    <li> I think this may help save my hair...my hair was a mess due to pre-menopause changes and stressful life events hitting all at once. The hormonal hair thinning was greatly hastened by me developing a nervous habit of pulling out dry, gray hairs throughout the day. If I hadn&#x27;t started out with very thick hair, I probably would&#x27;ve become bald.&lt;br /&gt;It was becoming hard to disguise the exposed parts of my scalp. I tried several things that add color, but not volume. This helps with both problems; for the first time in a few months, I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will recover some of my hair now that this is helping my confidence in addition to my appearance. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> It really works!!!! It last till you wash your hair.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Works great, does not fall out of hair, definitely covers thin hair, looks natural, and I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I have getting thin on top for a little while now and been trying everything on the market but nothing worked except this. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This product is really cool and amazing...I wanted to try it on those irritating gray roots that I get in between color and highlights at my salon!  It truly worked...it didn&#x27;t color them totally but it made them look less gray and gave me a few days to get to my salon.  I also truly wanted to see how well it worked on thinning hair...or that spot that some men get at the back of their heads...so I grabbed a passing man...dabbed it on the back of my husband&#x27;s head...and it was amazing!  He has another more expensive product that he bought at our salon for this purpose but it is truly a pain to use.  This product just needs to be tapped on...just kind of shake it on the grays or the bald spot...and they are covered quite naturally!  So...my experiment worked...I tried it on grays and I tried it on a thinning hair spot and it covered both problems superbly.  I would also make sure that you match your hair color correctly.  But their charts are pretty accurate and that&#x27;s not a problem to do!</li>
    <li> Viviscal Hair Fibers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product. I worked as a hairdresser for thirty years before retiring.  I wish I would have had access to a product like this way back then, for some of my older ladies who had the misfortune of living with thinning hair. Only women who have to deal with it, and their hairdressers, know how troublesome, challenging, and depressing it can be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, like so many women in their 60’s, my hair is gradually thinning. I have one side of my hair which is slightly more sparse than the other. (Luckily, my hair is quite plentiful elsewhere.) I found it quite easy to just shake a few of the fibers onto that area and tap them in. After I do that, I put hair spray on the area very lightly. Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really makes a difference. No scalp showing through. It makes the hair look much thicker. Another advantage is that it&#x27;s easy to shampoo out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t see how it could get any easier than this. Also, this product will last me a long time, as I only need a small amount each time. I’m so glad to have found it. Thanks, Viviscal!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I had surgery several months ago and my hair started falling out by the handfulls.  It was very thin on top.  I just sprinkle a small amount of the hair fibers on my thinning hair and you can&#x27;t see my scalp shinning through.  I plan to order it again.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried using a lot of other hair fiber fibers in the last year, and Viviscal has worked the best for so far, at first when I applied it I thought it would be too dark for my scalp - but after I fix my hair it looked really good and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is a big help! But the color is difficult to match to your own hair color. I use it towards the back part of my scalp because if you use it in the front it&#x27;s very visible. Also it&#x27;s a very good idea to use it before you apply your makeup because it will stick to your foundation.</li>
    <li> Gargage  - Better off using your coffee grounds -</li>
    <li> This is NOT as easy to apply as I had hoped. It ends up looking pretty fake on me. It doesn&#x27;t match exactly (tough to tell online what shade I really needed) and it doesn&#x27;t evenly distribute without some very steady hands. I suppose I&#x27;ll have to practice?? ***update: I haven&#x27;t gotten any better so I&#x27;m adding a note to say it might take MORE than just a steady hand/application. The combination of a slightly off-color and my level of hair thinness just doesn&#x27;t lend itself to a practical use of this product. I really can&#x27;t recommend it to others. Purchase with caution and an open mind- the pictures on the box are definitely not typical in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Like it when I finally clean up all the &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; that gets all over everythng when you gently shake it on to the bald spots.</li>
    <li> Great product. The light brown is almost a reddish/auburn in the light. I re-ordered the dark brown. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the dark brown (better color match).</li>
    <li> I put off trying this product for a long time, largely because I didn&#x27;t want to add something that turned out to be nasty after I&#x27;d gotten ready to go out.  This morning, I combed my hair but didn&#x27;t wash it and shook the product onto my part.  My hair is very straight and fine, and, now that I&#x27;m &#x27;of a certain age,&#x27; there is more scalp showing at the part than there used to be, especially up toward the bangs.  My hair color is a reddish-brown with blonde highlights.  The result was amazing -- the light brown Viviscal went on smoothly and just made the scalp disappear!  I couldn&#x27;t see the area closely no matter how I manipulated mirrors, so I asked my husband to take a close look and tell me whether it looked like I had something on my hair.  He&#x27;s a very straightforward guy, and he said he couldn&#x27;t.  I ran a brush through my hair, brushed at the area with my fingers, and the hair looked the same.  I really was stunned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I took a shower and washed my hair.  I used rinse-out conditioner but no product afterward, and I let my hair dry naturally.  Later, before I was ready to head out, I thought &amp;#34;hey -- that stuff looked so great, why not try it out and about!&amp;#34;  And therein lies the rub -- the stuff didn&#x27;t even begin to stay in my hair...  I dusted it on as before, but my scalp looked no different, and a tissue brushed across my nose and glasses showed plenty of brown dust.  A couple of spots showed, kind of like mascara clumps, but they brushed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem, and one that I think might have occurred either way, was that my eyes felt gritty... I just generally felt like I do when I sweep out a dusty garage or barn.  I do wear contacts, with reading glasses that I push up onto my head -- something else that probably won&#x27;t be a good mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was going to be up in front of people or be photographed, I think I would give this product a try.  However, for day-to-day life, it isn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying that I resent the before/after pictures that appear on this product page. They are not true before/after pictures because the hair has (obviously) been manipulated to aid in the appearance of fuller hair. Overall, I would say this is a good product and they did not have to resort to deceptive photos like that. A true before/after photo of a product should only have one variable that is changed. And of course, in this case, that variable would be the use of this product. That’s it.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this product really does work. It takes a bit of practice to get the best results but essentially, you just shake a few of the colored fibers over the spots you want to camouflage. That’s all there is to it. I really don’t have a big problem with thinning hair, but I color my hair and it looks like it’s thinning when the grays start showing. I shake this product over the areas that are visible, mainly in the part line and while it is not perfect (and is not a substitute for coloring my hair) it really helps camouflage the area and make it look better until I get a chance to color it again.</li>
    <li> The color I think should be blended with light and medium or medium and dark...One color does not work well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m eighty  yrs young and have a few hairless spots, this did the trick. Love it  makes. your hair look thicker</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works</li>
    <li> I find this product to be easy to use and was amazed  how it conformed to my hair color...I am wonderfully satisfied. I am 100% satisfied with Amazon and its shipping.</li>
    <li> I need to purchase the grey to tone down the color I bought and then will see. For me the light brown is to dark and it doesn&#x27;t blend well with the natural color. As soon as I can mix the two shades I can give a better review.</li>
    <li> The best of all its competitors.</li>
    <li> This is very good for covering up the scalp since I have very thin hair.  It doesn&#x27;t look orange like some cover ups do..</li>
    <li> This product has saved me from embarrassment as my hair is thinning on top and this powder does the trick in covering it up and is not noticeable</li>
    <li> The fibers stuck to my facial hair and generally made a mess.  I need the filler along my hairline.  It is impossible to get the fibers to adhere to that hair and not the fine hairs on the forehead.</li>
