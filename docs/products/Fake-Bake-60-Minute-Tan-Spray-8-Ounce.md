<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the best sunless tanners I&#x27;ve ever used. It looks great on, and I&#x27;m really pale, like grey-pale. Never had any problems with streaking unless I sweat or rub it soon after its gone on. After years and years of searching, I think I&#x27;ve found the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I would give this product less than 1 star if I could.  First of all, the bottle I received was expired...I learned this after I had already applied the product, which came out a very dark green color. I left it on for 3 hours and I didn&#x27;t see any change in the color of my skin (besides the weird green tint), so I applied another coat thinking I didn&#x27;t use enough the first time. My skin started burning within minutes of the second application, so I immediately washed it all off. There is no way this product is safe, especially with such the strong chemical (acetone-like) smell. Oh, and they wouldn&#x27;t let me send it back because it contains &amp;#34;hazardous materials&amp;#34; ... If that isn&#x27;t a red flag, I don&#x27;t know what is!!! Please do yourself a favor, and don&#x27;t waste your time or money buying this Fake Bake tanning spray.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I like the flawless by fake bake but this stuff gets you so much darker and quick! It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the flawless but I would def recommend it!</li>
    <li> First of all they sent me an expired product the tin is not golden bronze AT ALL it is GREEN!!! The smell is disgusting and even if you apply the product with the green tint on your body it won&#x27;t turn &amp;#34;golden bronze&amp;#34; it will stay green. Please do not make the same mistake I did and save your self money and a green colored body. I HATE THIS !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! super easy to apply, very little mess and it lasted a couple of days... it definitely doesn&#x27;t give you as dark of a tan as flawless but for 3 hours its pretty good!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning spray I have ever used.  No orange at all. Definitely try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner! I have used tons. The color is spot on for a tan, the smell is nice and it dries super fast. So that&#x27;s all good ...The best thing? Put it on and one, two or three hours later rinse it off and go about your business. I used mine this morning, ran errands w the kids and three hours later did a quick rinse and we all went to the pool. And my legs were a gorgeous  tan  without a spot missed....not lily white. And I did not smell like self tanner. Nor did it fall off of me while swimming. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt; Perfect color, dries quick rinse off well without soap...and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fast shipping too! Must buy!</li>
    <li> I was weary about trying another tanning product.  I am very pale and have tried a tanning bed and didnt get any darker.  I had a friend rub this all over me and then rinsed it off after 3hrs and i was darker! Then I woke up the following morning and I was even darker! Just make sure you apply lotion to you hands/finger, feet/toes, and ankle area, i just used vasaline lotion and it turned out great! I would deff recommend having a friend rub it on so it makes it even!  Will be purchasing this again! The only down fall is the mitt did start to leave fuzzies behind but I think I will be fine with just rubbing it on with a towel since I have help.</li>
    <li> I am constantly fake-tanning and this is so far the best product I have tried. I like their original product but this one is by far faster and a lot less messier. LOVE IT!! Can only recommend.</li>
    <li> Product is great. I sleep in it over night and wake up with a great color tone. Switched from the Fake Bake Flawless to this. I definitely recommend. My skin is extremely white and this gives me just enough color without going over board.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell or anything. The only funny thing is that on the label it says &amp;#34;not recommended for longer than 3 hours&amp;#34; ... Idk about you but when I go out or want to be tan for an event, it is usually longer than 3 hours! I tested it out wearing it all night, preparing for something weird, but it was fine. I wear it all day all the time and it doesn&#x27;t get weird dark or anything. Its a nice tan color and I like the glove that it comes with. I LOVE Fake Bake products, I would definitely recommend this brand. AVOID skin cancer, and get the bottle tan :)</li>
    <li> I have been through a few bottles of this already. I normally just sleep in it if I don&#x27;t feel like showering (you won&#x27;t wake up crazy colored don&#x27;t worry)...I have found it works best when you&#x27;ve been out of the shower and dried off for about an hour. But I always get compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and people say how they wish they had my skin tone. Ha!</li>
    <li> If u are already tan it doesn&#x27;t work! I did as suggested. I left it on for 3 hours. Still cannot tell. I have a mixed race olive skin type, but get a very light yellowish complexion in winter. I will say that it does smell similar to a really good product I used years ago, I think it&#x27;s a good product if ur paper-white already. I&#x27;m going to try it overnight and see again or possibly apply two layers, otherwise I&#x27;m buying &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; and saving this one for fall? Or might give it to my sister for prom-color.  I know I have to try a few products to find something that works for me. I&#x27;m giving up tanning beds, so even if I wasted money on this... It doesn&#x27;t stink and it goes on greenish. Here is to hoping the 2nd time is the charm?</li>
    <li> Product sprays out of bottle like a pump hairspray, so the liquid makes spreading the solution much easier.  Product  sprays out very dark, much like strong coffee, making it very easy to see areas you&#x27;ve covered versus those you have not.  It also came with gloves and a mitt for easy application.  This keeps hands from turning discolored as is the case with many other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  I love that you can apply it quickly and not have to worry about leaving it on forever before washing it off.  I&#x27;ve dirtied many sheets using sunless tanning products with bronzers!  This one can be applied later in the day and rinsed off between 1-3 hours after.  I prefer to leave mine on for the maximum 3 hour time limit as I am very fair-skinned.  Can be applied in a rush as well since it dries so quickly.  I even apply make-up over it (only powder...not foundation) and have had no problems with chemical reactions.  Great product!  I&#x27;d definitely purchase another bottle in the future!</li>
    <li> The tan develops pretty dark but when you first apply it the color guard makes your skin look greenish-blue, makes you look kinda sick. It gets the job done but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that this is a great product WHEN IT IS NOT EXPIRED. Apparently, it&#x27;s Amazon&#x27;s policy to sell expired items to it&#x27;s customers. I received this product and discovered upon opening that the liquid had turned green. I tried it anyway because I hated to waste my money by throwing it away. It was not effective at all. What little color I did get was streaky. I have used Fake Bake Flawless for years, so I&#x27;m very proficient at the application process. I bought the product from Amazon.com LLC. Not happy!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply. I like the fact that it dries quickly and does not rub off on my clothing while I am waiting for it to work. It has a good natural looking color. The only negative is, I wish it would last a little longer. Lasted about 5 days before starting to fade and wash off it. It also washed off in an uneven pattern. I will say that reapplying a layer helped.</li>
    <li> Did not feel like this product worked as well as the Flawless</li>
    <li> I have tried the normal fake bake, even darker fake bake and the 60 min. Let me tell you, the 60 is by far the best spray tan out of everything. It&#x27;s comparable to versa tan. The normal fake Bake is too orange of a color. Darker is also an orange color, a little bit better than the normal, but washes off the second you get in the shower no matter how long you leave it on for. This 60 minute fake bake is wonderful! It almost has a tan green hue to it to give you that real olive golden color when it sets. Not orange at all! The trick is to leave it on more than 60 minutes. I usually put it on at night go to sleep then wash it off in the morning. It turns out to be the perfect color and it stays much longer then the even darker usually about 4-5 days. I will never go back to messy lotions or spend 30 plus dollars on a spray tan. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Everyone tells me how great I look when I use it. I put it on at night and go to sleep, then wash off in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used this one time and i love the results! im light to med skin tone , neutral and this gave me a really nice bronze looking tan. i had it on for about four hrs. i also i have the origional fb flaw less and this is one is def better as far as color payoff goes. really like this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is it smells similar to the origional fb but its a little smellier but , you get to shower after an hr so its no biggie , still a great tanner</li>
    <li> I am African American and purchased this because I have gone for spray tan (don&#x27;t judge) and loved the bronze results  but hated the process (not being able to shower for hours, rubbing off on sheets and clothes). This product has none of that, easy to apply, can shower with in a hour and doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes. The color is warm and natural. No oompah loopah!</li>
    <li> Ive used many self tan products, I thought St. Tropez was my favorite since ive been using it for years now. I decided to try something new and boy am i glad i did. This is a great tanner!!! I actually dont wash it off after 3 hours I leave it on over night and the next day and it gives me the perfect color! I will def re-purchase!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend and it looks incredibly natural.  It is easy to use, does not stain clothing after it has been applied.  It definitely helped to even the tan I already had.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Fake Bake 60 is my favorite.  Quick, lasting color.  It has a Blue Green Base instead of orange and looks much better on my skin than most. I have dark blond hair and medium to fair skin.  Easy to apply with the mitt and does not streak.  You may notice a bluish green hue, right after application, but it does turn to a nice tan. Some areas work best if you pat it on, then smooth in, like the ankles and curves of the knees.</li>
    <li> Started using this product for the first time and I absolutely love it. I have that perfect golden bronze that I want and it does not leave me looking orange or streak like. I will definitely be using more of this product. And this seller shipped my product in a timely manner it arrived way before its due date and I&#x27;m very pleased A++</li>
    <li> Been a Fake Bake user for years (Airbrush, Flawless, and the purple box).I was skeptical about this product working any better than the original but I was proven wrong. While I don&#x27;t think you get the best tan by only leaving on for 1-3 hrs, it does develop quickly and continues to develop for up to 36 hrs which is the main difference from the original. I don&#x27;t use soap the first time after applying. I also leave it on for anywhere from 6-12 hrs bc I&#x27;m not super white and do tan well naturally. I&#x27;m def making the switch.</li>
    <li> ir works need to apply very carefully</li>
    <li> I have to apply this every few days to keep the tan up but its absolutely wonderful. It works pretty well even on my ghostly white skin. Only the tiniest bit orange but thats expected on such pale skin like mine. Just be sure to exfoliate well before applying and rub it in well when applying.</li>
    <li> turned green at first. I was nervous but it was the first coat. I left it on after two coats over night. much better results.</li>
    <li> When I was putting it on, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to come out right.  As I found the applicator mitt did not glide smoothly. So I only did my legs, just in case. After 2 1/2 hours I rinsed and to my surprise, the tan came out perfect and natural looking. I also find it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, compared to other tanning lotions. Very pleased. Only 4 stars, as I don&#x27;t really care for the mitt. Love it. Highly recommend. I am naturally pale (if it helps).</li>
    <li> Better then expected drawback color doesnt last as long as the lotion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different Fake Bake products &amp; I have to say that nothing beats the original in the purple bottle. I was drawn in by the promise of quick results, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed in the least. With the original, the color guide is just about the same color as the final result but not so with this. I found that I didn&#x27;t see the actual result until the following day (even though you&#x27;re supposed to wash it off with water within 1-3 hours). Plus, unlike other Fake Bake products, I found this to have that telltale sunless tanner smell that lingers on your body. Ick.</li>
    <li> Let me first off say that I am pale but i hate tanning in the sun on account im afraid of damage so i use sunless tanner. I have been using the Fake Bake spray (original) for months and months and love it very much. I saw this and thought i would give it a try. You get somewhat of a color but i would have to do three applications to get the color i get with one application of the regular stuff.  Not to mention the color guard is very very light so it makes it harder to make it not streaky or miss spots. I wanted to love it but ill be returning it and sticking to my favorite original fake bake</li>
    <li> If you have any type of blemishes on your face this products makes them very apparent. very very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fake Bake Flawless is Waaaaaaaayyyy better. The color is ok, but not instant. Fool proof application, there&#x27;s no color guide though. Lasts a LITTLE longer than the Flawless, but just isn&#x27;t an AMAZING WOW color. My forearms get dry &amp; it turns splotchy if I don&#x27;t apply thick lotion like twice daily there. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> did absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tanning lotions and sprays before, but this is hands down the best!  I never get streaks or turn orange, and it just takes one 3 hour application for me to have awesome color!  The mitt that it comes with is also phenomenal.  It makes it so easy to get an even, all over application.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Goes on gray. Develops longer than a couple of hours. I combine it with a little of the original and I sleep in it. In the morning I&#x27;m super dark. The tan lasts longer than applying each tanner individually.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE fake bake I have got the flawless the original and the 60 minutes my two favorites are the original and the 60 minute! I also love this because it has a green tint which you won&#x27;t look red after you wash off soo will buy again and again ;)</li>
    <li> Let me say, I am very fair.  I wanted some color, fast so I tried this.  Smell was pleasant at application, about 5 hours later you had that fake tan smell but you could cover it with lotion.  The result was even, it was easy to apply but turned me a strange color.  It just was not natural looking at all.  I&#x27;m going to try the product made for fair skin tones.</li>
    <li> At first I liked the product but after pulling out of the cabinet  (have had barely a year) it&#x27;s already gone bad and has turned green. :(</li>
    <li> Must have expired, it was green and smelly when I opened it.  Unlike other self-tan products.</li>
    <li> If you are very light skinned it may work better. On my skin you weren&#x27;t even able to tell I had done anything different. I kept it on my skin the entire time too. I had heard such great things about the brand Fake Bake but was super disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Fake Bake and I am very pleased with it and super glad I ordered. Ive worked in a Tanning Salon as a spray tanner and have tanned with different products for years and you can&#x27;t beat this for the price and ease of doing it at home yourself. Ive been using Tan Towels and St Tropez which I LOVE, but this is cheaper and in my experience just as easy to use. It gave me a beautiful bronze color that to get I would have to mix the other two. Im naturally alittle bit darker anyway but since moving to NJ I hate the color I get in the winter. This went on even and worked great on areas that don&#x27;t tend to get sun as often. Very pleased and I will definitely buy again. I noticed it does turn green after sitting but according to the company this is normal and it will still work the same.</li>
    <li> This is the best at home spray tan I&#x27;ve ever used!  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and works quickly.  I always get compliments on how nice my tan looks.  Most people are shocked that it comes from a bottle.  A bottle lasts a long time too. I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I was paying 60.00 a month for a tanning salon spray tan that only lasted a couple of days if it worked at all. I made seval trips a week to this salon. The odor was so bad that my husband made comments everytime I went to spray tan. Once a nail tech asked me if I just spray tanned because she could smell it. After researching and finding the reviews for fake bake, I decided to take a risk. When I used the product the first time, it was very apparent from the very first day that I had wasted alot of money on the local tanning salon. I found the reviews for this product very accurate. No odor, you can see within a few hours the results, and furthermore, it appears to withstand even after showering and a bath. I went today a cancelled my membership to the tanning salon.  I am one happy customer!!</li>
    <li> About me: pale Irish girl constantly in search of a tan minus the beds.  I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market.  I came across this product and it&#x27;s stellar reviews and thought it could be the next best thing.  Not the case. I tried this last night. Followed the directions and applied and waited...and waited.  I left it on overnight because after 3hrs (which was supposed to be the max for a \\&quot;bronze tan\\&quot;) I saw minimal results.  If you&#x27;re after a deep golden tan this is not it.  If you&#x27;re new to self tanning this product could be ok for \\&quot;baby steps\\&quot; but you will probably end up like me- left wanting more.  The smell is not too bad for a self tanner and the application is not too messy.  The mitt helps.  I gave 1 star for the kit and 1 star for the product.  I wish it produced a darker tan.</li>
    <li> Fake bake is a very easy product to use and it doesn&#x27;t leave blotchy spots. Although when I am sitting cross legged and my under knee starts to sweat a little bit, there is a funny smell due to the product.</li>
    <li> Fake Bake is always the way to go! You can see how different my arm is from the streak test. I actually fell asleep with this on, but I don&#x27;t recommend that because you won&#x27;t be able to monitor your tan. Seriously, get this though. It is ALL worth your money! I just recommend that you get the body polish and the dry oil with this to make sure you get the best Fake Bake tan!</li>
    <li> This product was very aggrivating! You have to put it on then wait up to 3 hours to wash it off. NO time for that!!! I will stick with my Loreal.</li>
    <li> product arrived quickly and i couldn&#x27;t wait to try because i&#x27;m a big fan of fake bake flawless. this product is a bit disappointing because there is very little color left after the first shower. will stick with flawless from this point forward. thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this latest offering from Fake Bake product because it dries quickly and processes faster that the others. You can put in on the morning if you want and once dry, it doesn&#x27;t realy come off on your clothes although I&#x27;d don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d tempt fate and wear white. However, they do say these types of products work better at night while your body is at rest. It has that slight tanning product odor, but not as strong as the lotion.  It gives a nice deeper color for those of us that arenot itysuper fair-skinnedto begin with. I also recommend their Darkest Intensity Gel</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner you can buy. I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners and this one is by far the best. I prefer this to St. Tropez. It is very easy to apply so even beginners could use it. I use it twice a week for upkeep. If you want it for a special occasion that&#x27;s fine too because when it does begin to fade it is very even so you don&#x27;t look spotty.</li>
    <li> So far, this is f****** amazing stuff! I followed the directions and some advice in the below comments. The main thing the directions lacked was a clear process for &amp;#34;rinsing off the guide color.&amp;#34; Apparently, you&#x27;re supposed to shower/rinse off an hour-3hours after application. I didn&#x27;t do that. I cut the end of the straw so it fit in the spray bottle, sprayed the tanner on the pink side of the mitt, and rubbed in circles (on my whole body) until the color looked good. I did not rinse. It dried within 2 mins, I put my clothes back on, and about 3 hours later I had this perfect golden tan. Took a shower the next day and had a little bit of brown wash off, but my tan was still there. There is literally no smell. I love it! Will update once I do my 2nd application.</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell too bad and great color. I don&#x27;t agree with other posters that it&#x27;s odor free, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like soy sauce like other tanners.</li>
    <li> This sunless tanning spray is one of the best I have ever used.  The smell is not overwhelming as most are and the color out of the bottle has a weird greenish-brown look, but goes on a very light tan.  The mitt is easy to use and washes well for the use of the bottle.  Once the bottle is finished, so is the mitt.  I have yet to have it transfer to my clothing or bedsheets yet.  Though I never put white on after I apply it.  I gave it 4 stars because it still has a faint odor even on day two, particularly when I workout, I can smell it coming through my pores.  Also, like any other self tanning solution, one color may work for some but not others.  I am pretty fair skinned and this color gives me a nice glow but I don&#x27;t look orange or too dark.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely LOVES IT.  This is the best tanner out there for a real reasonable price.  No streaking, Naturally looking tan.  Dark tan on the first application and it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on even you really have to be careful or you look like you have skin problems I really liked it at first  and it&#x27;s like my skin my skin started looking bad  maybe it&#x27;s just me</li>
    <li> Always loved their products. Never had trouble with it. I would repurchase this 10 times more! Plus it only takes 3 hours</li>
    <li> I have been using this over the original (because original is sold out in stores) I love this even more! it does what it says and dries quicker and lasts a long time. For a busy mom, that does NOT tan in the sun this is a winner!!</li>
    <li> I use this product once a week and have the best tan every time. It is just so easy and leaves no mess. 60 minutes is usually not enough time but if I do about 3 hours it is perfect.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! This product smells amazing and does not make me orange. I am very pale and typically hate using spray tanners at home. However, this was the first one I purchased that not only smells good but looks good too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very light skinned red-head and have been using Fake Bake products for years!  I was thrilled when the 60 min version came out because after all...don&#x27;t we want immediate results?!  You get them with the 60 min version!  Works and smells great- no funky DHA smell and you can throw your clothes on and be sun smooched for the day!</li>
    <li> Works great! Im very pale and it makes me look like I have been to Cancun! In 60 minutes looks great</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I didn&#x27;t believe that this could create a tan in one hour. I&#x27;m a loyal, long-time user of the Fake Bake tanning cream. That stuff stinks and took forever to develop. I would have to sleep in the nasty stuff overnight to achieve an adequate color for my super fair skin. My poor hubby suffered for many years. :) Well, not anymore, this stuff rocks! First of all, it smells a lot better. Secondly, it&#x27;s faster -- it really does work in an hour (but don&#x27;t go over 3 hours). I&#x27;ll admit, the first time I applied it, it wasn&#x27;t perfect, I missed some spots, but by the 2nd application I had a fabulous, dark and even natural-ish looking tan. I recommend applying this while standing in a dry shower/tub to catch all the spray. Would absolutely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This 60 min tan isn&#x27;t as good as the original. It has a funny smell and the color isn&#x27;t golden at all. I&#x27;d you want an amazing self tanner I would go with the regular over this one. I was disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it stains EVERYTHING if a drop gets on anything.  I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money that I spent.</li>
    <li> I have ordered many of fake bake self tanner and this one! Liquid inside gray green clearly something else is in this bottle! Do no buy you will be disappointed! Cant even return the item, so a wasted $20 + dollars...</li>
    <li> i use this and sunlab giese . both best products as far as self tanning goes. sun lab is a cream which u can use when ur skin is dry adn this is a spray u use with a cloth mitt.</li>
    <li> It does as promised.  It is fast, easy and goes on evenly.  Only problem is that I was highly allergic to it. Broke out into hives all over.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s taken me so long to write a review for my favorite product of ALL TIME. I&#x27;m very white. (Very) and my cousins make fun of me pretty often, because my aunt married a Mexican and their skin is ALWAYS tan, while I&#x27;m all pastey. So, i decided to look around and try to find the best, longest lasting, while also having great color, self tanner. And ladies and gentlemen, this is it. Don&#x27;t even hesitate. i order a new bottle like once every 4 or so months. The first couple times, it&#x27;s a learning experience, you&#x27;ll realize what not to do, etc. (Tip, if you lay down or take a nap with this on, wear socks, because I fell asleep and my bare foot was up against my bare leg and the sweat from my foot took off the product from my leg in a little foot print lol)&lt;br /&gt;  The smell is tropical and most people really like it. The color guard is kinda green/grey so you don&#x27;t really want to be seen for 3 hours while this is on, but i typically do this at night and do hmwk or clean during this time. After i shower it off, i go to bed and when i wake up, I&#x27;m golden and i love it. i get compliments 24/7. And the price is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS PERFECT. GET IT.</li>
    <li> Gets me tan and it lasts. Directions and packaging say to leave it on from 1-3 hours but in my experience to get the best color I put it on before bed and sleep in it. Rinse off in the morning to have a beautiful tan.</li>
    <li> The product I recieved was either fake or expired. It was a dark moss green color instead of the usual dark brown with a green hue. The bottle I recieved was also caved in on one side and the box it came in was also roughed up quite a bit but the seal did not look tampered with. It did not give me any color just left a green tint on my skin.</li>
    <li> It gives a nice even coverage the first time, but is not easy to reapply. It does not give the tan in 60 minutes, but it will continue to develop which is nice if you need to go somewhere. The product even when washed off will transfer. My bra has the tanner on it because it transferred and my skin has an extremely odd looking white like where my bra was, this was after 3 showers and a day. I would not buy it again especially in the summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Does not smell&lt;br /&gt;Not streaky&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to develop after applied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Transfers to clothes&lt;br /&gt;Easily sweats off&lt;br /&gt;Does not stay even&lt;br /&gt;Does not give you a tan in 60 minutes</li>
    <li> I love to be tan! But after years of the tanning bed and out in the sun I started to see dark spots on my face. I also do not want to get cancer. My hair stylist recommended fake bake so I tried and I am in love! It&#x27;s easy to use, no streaks like the other stuff and gives you a golden brown tan that&#x27;s more natural  looking without being orange. It lasts a few days so I just reapply every few days like lotion and leave on for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I seriously dont know whats up. But no matter how much I try to use it it does not darkens my skin.(( I even tried it 3 days in a row...and stil...</li>
    <li> This self tanner is wonderful! I have used others in the past ,and I&#x27;m definately sticking with this one.  not orange or fake looking just a real natural looking color. My husband even commented on how nice it looked compared to st. tropez I have used in the past. Very happy, and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best self tanner ever. It gives you a nice golden tan! (I recommend putting lotion on first though so it&#x27;ll go on smoothly &amp; streak free.)</li>
    <li> The color this product gives is very good. It goes on with an almost green tinge, but don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t be green! It developed fast and last a decent time. It smells very good when it first goes on, but it turns into that weird biscuit smell pretty quickly and the smell last through the shower even!</li>
    <li> an easy way to tan.  my hint is don&#x27;t rush...</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased Fake Bake 60 Minute Tan Spray on Amazon it was my first time using a fake bake product so I didn’t know what to expect. It was okay but nothing great like the reviews claimed; it didn’t work much better than those cheap drug store products however, it turns out that this product expires in about 10 months of breaking the seal which my bottle came with no seal and turned green within about 2 months of purchase. After reading several reviews I decided to give it another chance and purchased from another seller and now it works incredibly great. The first seller I purchased from was seller Super Duper Deals which was not good however, the seller who sent a fresh and sealed bottle was BEAUTY IT IS which was fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this all year last year and loved it so much I had to get more. I am very pale and glow it the sun, this product allows me to choose how dark I want to go and never leaves me orange. No streaks like I get when I go to a professional saloon and it lasts longer. I was also very impressed on how fast it was delivered. I will advise you to replace if you notice any green tinting. It tends to go bad after a few months.</li>
    <li> Looks extremely orange and rubs off easily !!!! Don&#x27;t purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this so much, beautiful color, dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t run off easily. The very best self-tanner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> reallly like this product, if you order it make sure you order it with the mitt for application, you get it on more evenly</li>
    <li> This barely darkened my skin at all and I left it on for 3 hours. I have fair skin so it is not because I&#x27;m already too dark. I was very disappointed considering the reviews I read.</li>
    <li> This is the best fake tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used plenty! No streaks, doesn&#x27;t just come off, and it&#x27;s so easy to use! Plus it looks so natural. It has a slight smell to it, but it smells a lot better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. I will be buying this product again. Dries fast, and even before you wash it off, it looks natural so you can run errands.</li>
    <li> It needs more than one application to look decent.  Their fake bake tanning lotion, on the other hand,  is off the charts fabulous.  Truly a deep golden bronze tan in one application and lasts for quite a few days.</li>
    <li> So this product seems to be pretty controversial as to how effectively it works. Personally, I hardly get tan from this product when I leave it on for only an hour, and sometimes not even two hours. I have fair, oily skin, so after applying the Fake Bake I look dirty and gray; however, once the tan starts to show, it looks more like a tan than gray dirt on yourself. This product may not work as nicely for me since my skin is oily and very fair. Luckily, the resulting tan is primarily brown instead of an orange. Instead of just leaving the product on for an hour or two, I just sleep in it. The tan gets fairly dark, but not to the extent that I look like my ethnicity has changed. I have also noticed that this tan stays on my skin much longer than Flawless, but this could just be due to my skin type. Flawless usually just stays on my skin for one to three days; this product has been somewhat present on my skin for almost two weeks. For me, Flawless did not stay on my skin for very long, but the results were nice temporarily. Application is also more difficult with this product since it has a faint gray trace rather than the instant tan; so it is possible to miss parts of your body and not realize it until the tan has developed. Overall, I think if Flawless doesn&#x27;t work as well for you or has the longevity you would like, 60 Minute Tan may be the better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out Fake Bake products for about a year, and this is the one I&#x27;ll stick with because it can double as a fair or a dark tan spray.  After using the Baiden mitten the night before, I put this stuff all over using the supplied mitten and rubber glove.  After an hour I wash my face, after 3 hours I shower the rest off, gently using a wash cloth to remove. Once I even re-applied to my legs for another hour, and really got a nice color.  This stuff never goes orange, and doesn&#x27;t streak. I have pale skin with olive undertones.</li>
    <li> I have used Fake Bake Flawless and loved it.  I thought this product would be comparable, if not better.  I was wrong.  This product has an awful smell and streaks an unusual color.  I am so disappointed and did not realize that I could not return it.  Steer clear and stick with original.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the fake bake darker..... Doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you orange or streaky. Looks great! I&#x27;ve used lots of sunless tanners, and this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> As all fake tan sprays, this should be applied with the better-than-average plush mitt that is supplied.  I applied it one night and left it on till the next morning.  As it wasn&#x27;t quite as dark as I wanted (I have light to medium olive skin), I took a shower and applied it again.  This was just right.  It may be too dark for people with very fair skin but would be worth a try as it works well and didn&#x27;t streak as so many others do.  The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that it wears off slowly and is making my legs look like they&#x27;re rusting.  It may have been the second coat that did this.  I&#x27;m exfoliating every day and will apply it again to see how it works with only the one coat. I do recommend it as I&#x27;ve used many fake an products and this one seems to work better than most of them.  Also, the lingering smell is minimal unlike others.</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate fake tanner!  It doesn&#x27;t make me orange and since I have used it, I have gotten lots of compliments!  They think it&#x27;s real!  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> at first i was not sure, but after giving it another try it is the ONLY self-tanner that has not turned me orange and gives a nice golden brown that can be built on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a super stark white person naturally. Most bronzers don&#x27;t work on me and leave me that disgusting orange. This actually looks quite natural. Just ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> this is the best fake tan of all fake tans...little to no odor. Only 60 minutes to brown! I love it!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite by this line sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and LOVED it but I ordered it again this year excited to use it and when it arrived it was green.  I returned it and was mailed a new one.  It was also green.  I went to Ulta and decide to buy it there.  It was green.  All three products were green.  I was so disappointed.  I had used this product for years and loved it.  I spent 100$ to buy three products that were green and turned by skin green.  I gave up, went to walgreens and bought Jergens.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Last year I used &amp;#34;Fake Bake Original&amp;#34; and loved that! Once my experience was great with the brand, after reading lots of reviews, I decided to try &amp;#34;Fake Bake 60 Minute Tan&amp;#34; because of the short time I needed to leave it on my body. That was the worst idea ever! It left an orange color on my skin and it is very dry! Even after you remove the product from your body, it keeps working and the orange color gets even more evident! The product came grayish/greenish and leaves a terrible smell in the skin, so I am not sure if the liquid is bad or if it doesn&#x27;t work well anyway. Bottom line is that I am very disappointed and I feel like I threw money into the trash!</li>
    <li> I tried using it as a spray w/the mitt but it&#x27;s just too blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I poured it into a jar of coconut oil &amp; kind of turned it into a lotion. Much more even application.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this was going to work.  It has a blue/green tint to it when it goes on.  I thought I was going to be blue but it turned out awesome.  I kept it on for an hour and rinsed off before bed. When I got up in the morning I had a pretty tan!</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner! I&#x27;ve gotten many complements on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used an entire bottle and back to buy my second. The only problem I have had with it is the color on my hands. After several applications, I&#x27;ve solved the problem. Instead of using the mitt that comes in the box, I use a makeup sponge. Spray the tanner on the sponge and lightly buff onto hands. The results are more natural. Also, make sure you shower and exfoliate before application and apply lotion lightly to knees, elbows and hands beforehand. Tan lasts about a week. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase...no more tanning beds for me!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the 8th and it was delivered today the 16th  so shipping was reasonable especially since it was free. I followed the directions and made sure to exfoliate before putting this on and i wore it 3 hours (the max time recommended) and it turned out Fantastic. I started out very pale (like paper pale) and now i have a nice glow. when applying fake bake it smells very tropical but after about an hour it starts to smell a little funky like after you&#x27;ve tanned in a bed for 20 minutes and you&#x27;re sweating but other than that Fake Bake really works i would recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Since I got prego my doctor advised not to get a spray tan so this works as a perfect replacement. Little fumes and I can still have a glow like I was oustide tanning by the pool.</li>
    <li> I love the color and coverage of fake bake products. Never disappointing! Great product for cost as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful the color did not look natural. Turned me orange!&lt;br /&gt;I have used fake bake products before the fake bake self tanner flawless is pretty good. The color is much better then the 60 min one.</li>
    <li> Product works very well! Like the color that the product produces and lasts for several days.  I do not wash off in 60 minutes as per directions.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best sunless ranners I&#x27;ve ever come across, if you&#x27;re looking for a brown based tan, even on pale skin, this is it!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a tanner that was easy to apply. I can only apply this to some of my body. To get a tan, I have to get must husband to apply the rest. He hates doing it. The color is brown and not orange. If you can get someone to apply it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid self tanner user. Fake Bake is one of the top brands I use. I was a little disappointed in this product as it rinses off easily with minimal color left.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned, it is hard for me to tan...but with fake bake...  After first application I looked perfect!!! Highly recommend, easy to put on, beautiful bronze color, pleasant smell.  Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Looks like the real thing! I got complimented for my tan a lot,best part was, I didn&#x27;t have to risk skin cancer to have it!</li>
    <li> This works amazing! SO fast!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear it for an hour and a half then I get a realistic tan that looks amazing! The only thing is this one hour fake bake doesnt last as long (the tan) as if you use the original fake bake that you have to wear for 8+hours....&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you need a quick and gorgeous tan this is the stuff!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Fake Bake Flawless for a couple years now and have loved it!! I wanted to give the newest member of Fake Bake a try and I was a little disappointed in it compared to the Flawless.  It just didn&#x27;t give me the tan that Flawless did.  It&#x27;s still an OK product, neat,  adn the smell is not too bad.  Fake Bake will always be my choice in self tanners, just not the 60 Minute.</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying the original Fake Bake spray. I loved the original, but this one just doesn&#x27;t quite match up. With the original, I could spray myself in the morning and go about my day, not worrying about smell or an odd color. The 60 Minute sprays on a muddy brown and has a stronger smell, and also takes a bit longer to dry. They last equally as long but the fact that I have to wait around to make sure I don&#x27;t stink and look like I bathed in a swamp is a big con. I&#x27;ll finish this bottle then go back to the original formula.</li>
    <li> Use a blending cream for  knees and elbows,etc for sure. This didnt do much the first 5 tries or so. After that though I have great success and very pleased. I exfoliate once a week,then apply once a day. It looks authentic to me as long as my ankles and feet areas dont give away that its fake with blotches when i apply it to quickly. So take it slow. Do not use any water for a while that can run down your arms or legs,cause that streaks it at first. Also when its faded it gets a smidge blotchy,but nothing that keeps me from using it and just exfoliate or shave to get it off quicker if needed. I also rinse the mitt everytime or it gets pieces that pill of and get on the legs.</li>
    <li> It was greenish and smelly in the bottle. Thought that might have had something to do with the quicker tan time. It went on my skin green and stayed that way. Horrible!!  I absolutely love the regular fake bake flawless and will keep using it. You can get way more of a tan leaving that on your skin for 60 min than this stuff. Yuck!!</li>
    <li> I went to ULTA looking for the new dark version. They didn&#x27;t have it or the flawless so I got this. I have ordered to Golden Goddess and will try that as well. I applied this and waited and waited. Egh. I reapplied as I hardly noticed any color. Not sure. Its okay. I little color. Certainly not the &amp;#34;I live at the beach tan I wanted&amp;#34; Just a light glow. Not impressed. I will update after I try the Goddess. I don&#x27;t think Its worth the money so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat familiar with this product from hearing about it at a dermatologists office. I really liked it at first. I can&#x27;t tan anymore so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. I also wasn&#x27;t expecting to go OUT on a job (Excavating business, manual labor &#x3D; SWEAT. That you cannot do and it was quite embarrassing when a homeowner who you look to for referring your business can see your tan drip right off of your body in streaks and spotting on old shaving scars. Good thing I have an awesome sense of humor and I didn&#x27;t return it screaming and demanding a refund. Just thought I&#x27;d let people know it&#x27;s all good...if you&#x27;re lazy, non menopausal, or just cold natured working indoors.</li>
    <li> I love fake n bake! But this product was such a disappointment! It does not give the same olive, natural tan the original and darker give. This was splotchy and yellow colored?? I don&#x27;t understand why they used a different color base here and why its not as smooth as the other products but I&#x27;m afraid to give it a second go because of terrible it looked the first time!</li>
    <li> 60 minutes to the bronZe tan without streaks. I suggest spraying an oil on before spraying especially on knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> doesnt give that orange look ....&lt;br /&gt;easy to use.  you can look up videos on youtube to see how others apply it.</li>
    <li> probably just my skin, but came out kid of striped on my legs and i put it on correctly. But the color was beautiful bronzed tan.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oréal spray tan works better and half the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super pale and this was quick easy and I&#x27;ve never had better at home result. It lasts and is easy to see how the product is being applied ......I also recommend watching the YouTube video from the manufacturer it gives in depth instructions on how to apply</li>
    <li> its perfect for me because i am SO pale! and it doesnt make you look orange, its easy to apply and since its only 60 mins you can see it develop! Love love this product.</li>
    <li> I love it, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad it, it doesn&#x27;t streak, it works fast, and it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange or get a rash. It&#x27;s pretty much the best self-tanning thingy I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> works great if you are trying to keep from going to the tanning bed but still want a great tan with out turning orange this is great</li>
    <li> I really love this tanning spray! It goes on very easy, doesn&#x27;t cake on like some other tanning lotions out there. The fact that it only takes an hour or so is amazing! I hated sleeping in my old lotions, it was such a hassle. I like that this is more of a liquid, it decreases the risk of streaking. The only time I&#x27;ve ever had any streaking is around the hands and fingers. I would say this tan lasts a couple of days. Though you can get a tan in the 60 minutes I usually leave it on for two, the package says you can leave on for up to three. The smell kind of reminds me of a coconut rum, much more pleasant than some others out there but definitely not odorless. My only complaint is the pink mitten you get with the spray. It&#x27;s a very nice soft mitt, applies the spray well, however it gets dirty fast. The mitt doesn&#x27;t outlast the bottle and I&#x27;ve washed it and dried it several times so it doesn&#x27;t leave behind old residue. It would be nice if it came with more than one.</li>
    <li> I was bummed that this product did not work for me as I swear by Fake Bake&#x27;s original sunless tanner. I saw so many reviews that everyone saw results in minutes and I didn&#x27;t even get any the next day! I even throw on two coats! I have fair to light skin and experience some razor-burn-like irritation once I put it on. I still couldn&#x27;t believe that there was no difference the next day! No one could tell that I even put it on! I have WAY better results with the original formula.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. The spray dries completely after you rub it in and you&#x27;re able to get dressed right away. I&#x27;ve left this color on overnight and not had any problems. Nice tan, not orange.</li>
    <li> This product is the most realistic tan you will ever get from a bottle--- from the girl who has tried countless products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake Flawless most of the time and I actually prefer this over that. I&#x27;m fair skinned and it did keep developing over time. Probably only need to do this 1-2 times a week depending on desired darkness. I like it!</li>
    <li> This gives a flawless, true tan.  Never orange. My favorite thing is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have that tell-tale Sunless tanner odor.  I apply this and am darker instantly, but I usually use it before bed then shower in the morning.  The color lasts for a week or two, and fades gradually/evenly.  Never blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;xx</li>
    <li> I expected a much darker tan. I&#x27;m fair skinned, about a NC20 in MAC Cosmetics, and could barely see a difference after an hour. I left it on 3 hours and still didn&#x27;t see a difference. It just didn&#x27;t develop. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face at all. It colored in every pore and every blackhead on my face making it look like a million jet black pores/black heads. I&#x27;ve tried Jergens and Suave sunless tanners and have gotten better results, and neither stained the pores on my face. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and dried quickly. The only good thing about this is that what little color that developed looked very, very natural. No fake orange color. I would recommend shaving the day before you apply this or waiting until after because there are a few spots on my legs that have the same black pores as my face. If you don&#x27;t mind showering, waiting 3 hours between applications, and repeating this might be for you. This seems like something you would have to set aside a whole day for. In the words of Sweet Brown, &amp;#34;Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great. Just make sure you have some bleach handy to get it off your counter in the bathroom cause it&#x27;s a fine mist that tends to somehow leave a fine layer around you</li>
    <li> The directions were confusing, the product is a nuisance to use......wait, then wipe off, exfoliate, don&#x27;t exfoliate etc.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am not using it correctly?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have the wonderful ability to not get a tan no matter what. Fake Bake gives me a great natural looking tan fast. Non streaking, no funny odors and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have been using flawless for about a year now, and just tried this. I have always felt like I could not get as dark as I wanted with flawless, but still loved it! Well, in steps 60! It makes me darker! I put it on at night and don&#x27;t take it off til I shower the next evening, and it gets me a nice dark color! I LOVE IT! I will be buying this instead of flawless. Plus, you get 2 more ounces than flawless! Now that is a deal!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I am very fair skinned but with this I get an even non-orange bronzed look that doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I does not smell like other products and works fast without leaving streaks or splotches.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I heard such good things about fake bake and looked up some reviews on youtube and decided to try it out. I LOVE IT. Better than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange. Its very natural looking. It also smells DELICIOUS, like a tropical tanning bed lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have the horrible after scent either. I will be ordering more in the future..Will also be trying out different products, as I was not dissapointed one bit with this item!</li>
    <li> im hooked. a little bit goes a long way. you must exfoliate, dry off then spray the mitt and in a circular motion apply to your body. I love it. a tan appears in about an hour leave it longer and its darker. rinse it off without rubbing it off. dont use soap. then I applied bath oil to my body.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Fake Bake spray, this is the first time I have purchased the 60 minute tan.  The color is just okay, it had a tinge of orange.</li>
    <li> I like the color it gives me and its really easy to apply...only problem is it only last for about 3 days at the most. It goes on smelling good but eventually turns into that nasty self tanner smell.</li>
    <li> Easy to use when used on freshly clean skin!  No streaking, smells like typical tanning lotions.  I put on at night and slept with it on.  It did get on my white sheets but it washed out with no bleach, just detergent.</li>
    <li> Well I ordered Fake Bake Flawless and the seller sent me this product (fake bake 60 minutes) and this product is HORRIBLE. I did everything the directions stated (shaved, exfoliated, etc.) and I still have no color after 3 applications in 2 days (the first time I left on for 3 hours, second time 3 hours, third time overnight). The product was sealed when I received and the color is a very dark black/dark green color. I can&#x27;t even really see the color guard when I apply it and I really loaded up on the liquid the third time. I would not recommend this product. I&#x27;m going to try and order the Fake bake Flawless again and hopefully I actually get the right product (ugh).</li>
    <li> Natural color, and easy to apply. Didnt notice a big difference with the original one though.</li>
    <li> A truly great tan! By a Biden mitt to properly exfoliate before using the Fake Bake and you will have a tan that lasts for days. I love this stuff!  I don&#x27;t have much time to get out in the sun (nor do I need the wrinkles!) so this is the perfect solution! Looks like my tan, not orange or fake.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use as directed for best results. Great for very pale skin tones. Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate really well beforehand.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good, need to leave on longer than an hour if you&#x27;re pasty though.</li>
    <li> Does a great job! Did not notice a smell, and gave me a nice bronze color.</li>
    <li> Great color and fast results. Doesn&#x27;t stain sheets even if you leave it on over night. Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad and wears of evenly. Tan lasts about a week and I like to put on some jergens to maintain the golden glow. Tan looks natural as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many self tanners over the years and this month alone I have tried several different ones. I am going on a two week vacation in June and am looking for the \\&quot;perfect tanner\\&quot; that has natural looking, long term color and isn&#x27;t so time consuming. When I came across this I jumped at the chance to try it. I hate sleeping in fake tanner because of the awful smell. I&#x27;ve tried several that claim to have no smell but they all do. The smell from the developing DHA is always there it just varies in strength of the smell. This tanner has the smell of coconut when you first put it on but a very subtle DHA smell creeps in if you leave it on for the full three hours but I did not mind it at all. It was very very subtle, nothing like the others I&#x27;ve used. That probably has a lot to do with the fact it&#x27;s only on your skin for 3 hours. I am an extremely pale red head. So pale that you can almost see through my skin. I used this for the full three hours on my entire body, including my face (follow the directions... Exfoliate first) then, rinsed in the shower, using no soap or a loofa. Just rubbed my body with my bare hands to get the color guide off, patted dry and wala, I was tan. Since I&#x27;m so pale I of course am not as tan as someone with actual natural pigment to their skin but I still have a nice tanned glow to my otherwise casper white skin. I retanned my legs after I rinsed since they are the whitest part of my body, the tanner has been on for the second time now for a little over an hour and I am even darker on my legs than I was just a couple hours ago. I love how this gets me just as dark a tan as one that I would have to apply then sleep in to get the full 6 to 8 hours in so it could develop. I will have to update this as far as the longevity and fade but as far as the color and fast developing time I give this stuff two thumbs up. This will definetly be with me on my vacation because I could squeeze one to three hours in to upkeep my tan. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the pump style bottle. The pump came to be broken, no matter how fast or hard I pumped no liquid came out. That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give to 5 stars. I just quickly turned the bottle over with the included mitt on to get a bit of the tanner on the mitt and it worked like a charm. So in conclusion, if you are pale and either don&#x27;t like to sleep in tanner or just don&#x27;t have the time this is the stuff to get!!! Happy tanning! :)</li>
    <li> I always use fake bake products and this one isnt worth buying. I was so disappointed. I thought it was going to be a miracle tanner. I was sadly disappointed and now have another product sitting on my shelf. Stick to the original fake bake.</li>
    <li> I am naturally quite pale, and want to limit my sun exposure for obvious reasons. I have been shelling out lots of cash for airbrush tanning appointments to get that golden glow, but have always ended up with an orange tint to my skin that screams, \\&quot;YES, I AM WEARING FAKE TANNER--OKAY!?!\\&quot; In preparation for my wedding, I wanted to find a product that looked totally natural...and I came across this gem. If you take time reading the directions before beginning the process, you should not have any issues with confusion as other reviewers have claimed. Though, I DID read them twice just to make sure I fully understood :). I showered and exfoliated first, then after putting on the gloves and mitt that were included, I began applying in circular motions. I did go better-safe-than-sorry and applied a minimum amount during round one. There is a color guide to limit over-application or streaking. You are able to leave this product on for 1-3 hours, and I went for the full three before showering.  I didn&#x27;t use soap, but just kind of rinsed off. The color is just fantastic! I have had people at work ask me where I went for vacation instead of getting the usual double-take to ensure that there isn&#x27;t an oompa loompa in the office. I can tell that this bottle is going to last me a long while, so good bye $35-55 airbrush appointments and hello home tanning convenience! I have never written a product review, but just had to recommend-- I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the orig. fake bake for about a year and it works great but application can be a hassle and it has that fake tanner smell and take over night I really work, just got the 60 min and its amazing! Smells like coconut tanning lotion but only ever so lightly and any smell was gone in 10mins or less (to be honest I would have liked it stick around l) no fake tanner smell! I left it on for the max 3 hrs (really longer as I forgot and wasn&#x27;t home) and got an amazing golden natural tan that I&#x27;m in love with! No steak app was sooooo easy and fast and no orange or off color at all!! I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
    <li> I did exactly like the instructions said but I still had a burnt orange tint and rusty on knees &amp; feet. Did not like the mitt, it would not stay in place on my hand. It kept rolling around and if I had taken off the gloves it would have gotten the color on my palms. Sent back.</li>
    <li> This product is a pain to apply &amp; dries way too fast to spread out. I didn&#x27;t see much if any tan after the 3hr wait time so its not worth the price &amp; time. I used to use a Fake Bake product in the past but they no longer carry it &amp; it was the darkest sunless tan I have yet to find in any other product. It seems every product I love gets discontinued. All in all I would not recommend this 60min Tan Spay &amp; would recommend Tanwise instead which you can purchase much cheaper at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. The seller of this product I would recommend &amp; its not their fault the product doesn&#x27;t provide results but I would advise them not to sell this.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking like I did that this would be a lot like Fake Bake Flawless, but with faster results, think again. I had a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t work as well when I could barely see it going on...the color guide is very light and even on my fair skin I could barely see where it was going. I left it on for over three hours and got almost no color at all. I&#x27;ve rinsed the regular Fake Bake Flawless off after four hours and had more color than this. Definitely not worth the money. If you like Fake Bake Flawless, stick with that.</li>
    <li> This stuff is by far the best self tanner I have ever tried, and I normally dont like them. I bought fake bake for face, and it worked so well, I decided to get it for the body too. It takes a lot of work to apply it, but for me so does driving 30 minutes to the tanning bed. I still tan at the tanning, but I am using this in conjunction with the bed because I live so far and it looks natural. I like the mitt, but this spray version is a little hard to rub in for me. because I am already so tan, it makes it a little difficult to see where I am putting it. I do not rinse it off after 60 minutes, again because I am so tan already. I just leave it on until I shower and it&#x27;s fine. I dont know how dark this would be on super pake skin, but I would for sure stick to 60 minutes at first. Works!</li>
    <li> Love it! Always a must have! The MIT it comes with is sort of a pain. It&#x27;s hard to keep on when trying to rub the spray in and the gloves wore out really quick. But other than that I had no streaks or discolor. Very nice even tan and not orange.</li>
    <li> I love fake bake 60!! Keeps me nice and tan year round. Easy to use, spray &amp; rub on. Not orange at all.</li>
    <li> Received this product yesterday.  I usually buy the Flawless Fake Bake (leave on 4-6 hours) and it&#x27;s always worked great, but I hate how long I have to leave it on so I was excited to see the 60 minute option.  Left this product on for 3 hours today and have seen zero results.  I&#x27;m a pale person, and started to worry from the beginning when I didn&#x27;t even see any color on myself when applying.  I did two layers and applied generously, left on for max time, and nothing.  So disappointed.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like this but I like Flawless better...Flawless is more of an instant almost temporary tan ...while the 60 minute tan is more of a true self tanner. It lasts a couple of days. I had to try it to see why you get 8 oz of this for less than 6 oz of Flawless...They both have their benefits but I do prefer the flawless</li>
    <li> Expired both times i ordered it.</li>
    <li> could not see any difference.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite self tanner product. My routine is to shower/exfoliate after dinner, and then rinse before bed (around 3 hours). I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but it seems to me that the color keeps developing overnight because I look darker in the morning. The great thing about it being a quick self tanner is that if you make a mistake, you can easily and quickly fix it in the morning. The only con is the self-tanner smell, but that can easily be covered with lotion. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin SO soft but has to be showered off after an hour</li>
    <li> i USE THIS ALMOST EVERYDAY ON MY FACE. mAKES ME LOOK NICE AND TAN IN THE WINTER. nICE BROWN COLOR NO STREAKS OR ORANGE. i USE ALL THE FAKE BAKE PRODUCTS AND WOULD BUY AND DO BUY OVER AND OVER.</li>
    <li> Dream come true for fair skinned people!  Try it, you won&#x27;t go back to other sunless tanners!  I leave it on for four hours before rinsing. Perfect color, no stink!!  I love the freedom of being able to get a tan in a couple of hours and then wash the product away. I hate having sunless Tanner on my skin for a whole day. Thank you fake bake!</li>
    <li> Works really well! Hadn&#x27;t used this kind of product before (only been to spraying salons) but pleasantly surprised so far.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better than what it is after reading the reviews. The tan on my upper body looks great, the tan on my legs however looks like a zebra. Extremely streaky. I left it on for only an hour the first time, showered and after I got out my legs had water marks/streaks all the way down. The tan was not very noticeable also. Same thing on the second day but I left it on for 1.5 hours. Streaks were way worse but tan was darker. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with it. I&#x27;ve never had this happen before so I know I&#x27;m doing it right. I exfoliated before, applied evenly using the mitt. The Fake Bake Original lotion works a lot better for me.</li>
    <li> After its dry its never comes out even. Some parts of my skin will be tan then others will still be white.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this since I like the &amp;#34;Flawless&amp;#34;, but you CAN&#x27;T TRUST THE REVIEWS!! Most are NOT AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASES, &amp; the ppl have NO PROFILES &amp; ONLY REVIEWED THIS PRODUCT ( &amp; maybe 1 more to look good!).  You can&#x27;t get an HONEST review anymore on products, companies plant fake 5 star ones &amp; rave &amp;#34;I LOVE IT&amp;#34; reviews... It&#x27;s sad- I use to rely on other ppl &amp; the experience they had with a product , now you can&#x27;t trust them- 90% fake, Bogus reviews.... That alone makes me question a product/seller &amp; WHY they need to plant so many fake reviews! The product is not good, or they had  low star ratings &amp; want it to look like many ppl bought &amp; LOVE this!!&lt;br /&gt;  I&amp;#34;LL KEEP ME MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!!</li>
    <li> This worked really well for my skin, the only problem is that when you shower if you use soap it washes away and you end up back at square one.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I will buy nothing but fake bake products from here on out I like the fake bake flawless better but there both amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this product and all the other Fake Bake products I&#x27;ve used.  This one leaves me a nice shade of brown in record time.  The only true difference I see between it and Fake Bake Flawless spray is that the color FBF leaves me allows me to go through my day wearing it.  The color guide in this one is a little grayish before it develops, then it looks brown.  I can wear it out, but it takes a bit.  The color is very realistic and the product is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get Versa Spa spray tans at a local tanning salon.  I like this product better.  Fake Bake saves me at least $60 a month!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I LOST MY FLAWLESS FAKE BAKE AND SAW THIS WAS NEW. I LIKED THE LAST STUFF SO WELL I WANTED TO TRY THIS. IT DOES WHAT ALL SELF TANNERS AT THE DRUG TYPE STORE DO. VERY DRYING AND KIND OF GAVE ME A FEELING LIKE I NEEDED TO EX-FOLIATE. I LIKE THE FLAWLESS MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually put this on and took a shower about 2.5 hours later. The tan was golden and just as deep as leaving the DARKER fake bake on over night. I will buy more of this. I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to stay on over night.</li>
    <li> The color of this product made my skin just look dirty &amp; it DID NOT get any darker than when I first applied it. Save your money and get the Fake Bake original  version.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with this! :( I love fake and bake products and have never been disapointed or let down until this. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad one by fluke or what. But it doesn&#x27;t work at all on me. I get nothing not even a hint of color. Literally you have no idea that I used anything!!</li>
    <li> it is black when you put it on and does not apply smoothly&lt;br /&gt;waste of money; who wants their skin to have a black tint while waiting on the product to dry&lt;br /&gt;not sure if it was bad but if it&#x27;s not they should let you know the color guide is black!</li>
    <li> As someone who was once tan for twenty years straight, I would call my self a bit of a tanning expert (addict:).  Even when I was still tanning at a salon, I would use the original Fake Bake.  So, when this 60 Minute version came out, I just had to try it.  It is awesome!  And, one bottle goes a long way.  This product comes with a sponge/velour mitt.  To use, you simply spray the mitt a couple of times, then rub it on your body.  It has a light color guide, so you can see where you have applied it and don&#x27;t miss spots.  The color guide is natural looking, so if you need to go to the grocery after putting it on, you could.  I generally shower and exfoliate prior to application.  Then, I apply the product and let it dry.  It dries very quickly.  A good amount of color does develop in one hour.  The first time I used it, I washed it off after one hour, then went to bed.  I have used other self-tanners that required the product to stay on a number of hours before showering.  The self-tanner would rub off on my bed sheets and would often produce stains that would not come out in the wash.  This 60 Minute version works quickly, allowing me to shower before bedtime, and my bed sheets are safe.  This product produces a very natural color.  The resulting tan is more even than the tan I get from the sun or tanning booths.  The color lasts about a week and wears off evenly.  My legs develop a nice dark color, and they do not tan well in a tanning bed.  One thing I would recommend is that you put a LIGHT coat of moisturizing lotion on areas of your body that have thick skin coverings.  (knees and elbows)  I even use this on my face.  It is so even that it eliminates the need for me to wear foundation when I am using Fake Bake.  If you want a safe way to keep a gorgeous tan all summer long (or fall, spring or winter), this product is for you!  Happy Tanning!</li>
    <li> This is my second summer using this stuff. I&#x27;m pale and most self tanners look orange and streak. Even when I do the professional ones. This product is insanely good. I use it primarily on my legs which never match my more tanned freckly arms and it is always perfect. I don&#x27;t even always exfoliate and it&#x27;s still is great. I haven&#x27;t had one mishap yet and it&#x27;s really quick to apply. The best is the one hour formula. Even a last minute beach or pool excursion is no problem with such a short wait time.</li>
    <li> Really please with the scent and ease of use. Works very well and color is natural without orange tones. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic color, fast development..will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Oh Fake Bake... One of the best self tanning brands on the market. I love majority of their products. I suggest ordering it from amazon and not the direct site though. I ordered a few items from fakebake.com and was given a call 3 days later saying they canceled my order because they thought it was a fraudulent order, and then wanted me to verify and place the order over the phone.. Ugh, it was a hassle. Great product, horrible company service haha! Just order it from Amazon and save yourself the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, I found, gives you a nice &#x27;glow&#x27; to use for a night or two.. but if you want a real fake tan that will stay longer than 1-2 showers, look for their more permanent products.</li>
    <li> I usually get good batches of this stuff but my last order was a little more &amp;#34;water downed&amp;#34; looking.  The tan was also different. .spotchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different tanning sprays/lotions, all different price ranges.  I can say this provides a subtle tan in 60 minutes.  I wish it were darker, but after 60 minutes, I apply another coat and the tan deepens somewhat.  I still prefer a darker tan.  It is very drying on the skin and it does have that smell that lasts a good 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again, but wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try another Fake Bake product.  The price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live with out,perfect color every time!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I just didn&#x27;t apply it right, but I followed all directions. Shaved and exfoliated before I applied it and I still ended up with splotchy areas. On my hands there were tan/orange/white spots between my fingers and on my knuckles. I feel like I wasted money because I&#x27;m not using this again. I&#x27;m trying to stay away from the tanning bed but this stuff is making me want to go back. Don&#x27;t buy unless you are a confident self tanner.</li>
    <li> I tried this product so many different times and it never worked! I applied it and showered a few hours afterwards, sometimes I waited an hour another time I tried it I waited 3 and there was no color. Very disapointed</li>
    <li> Many compliments, looks real, and not orange.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on its stellar reviews, but when I went to spray it on, all that came out of the bottle was black. I thought this might be what was supposed to happen, but no color developed on my skin at all....and I kept it on while I slept and nothing. Obviously I got a defective bottle. The moral of the story is DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> The whole point of me looking for a rapid self-tanner is because I HATE the feel of sticky self-tanners being on my skin and I have yet to find a self-tanner that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I was excited to try this self-tanner because I thought I would only have to leave it on for 3 hours to get a dark tan. Nope. I left it on for 3 hours, rinsed it off, woke up the next day, and was not any darker whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I didn&#x27;t want to waste a whole bottle of self-tanner, the next night I tried again, but this time applying two coats and keeping it on for 6 hours. This gave me a dark tan, but it completely defeats the purpose of a &amp;#34;rapid&amp;#34; self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will finish up the bottle because I like the ease of use and the color after 6-8 hours, but not sure about repurchasing, as I was looking for a rapid self-tanner.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best tanning line I have EVER used and I have tried them all! It is a natural looking tan - NOT ORANGE. I like that the color is instant (so you can see where it&#x27;s been applied), don&#x27;t have to use a lot, goes on evenly, fades gradually (not blotchy) and is reasonably priced. My advice is put on before bed and then shower in the morning. This washes off excess and leaves a beautiful bronze tone. I will use it forever! Have turned my friends and family members on to it too!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect tan but just remember to exfoliate you legs before you put it on.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s funny because I have bought other Fake Bake products before and had no problem.  I read the review about the color being green and that it expires when it is this color.  Well the liquid was green and my tan never developed.  I left it on for 3 plus hours and no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good News:&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they gave a refund, no questions asked.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a fast response from them, but they were very nice and resolved the issue.</li>
    <li> Used it once... for me it was ok...</li>
    <li> Al least it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Not fond of the &amp;#34;put it on and wait a few hours then rinse off. Who has time for such nonsense ? Finish got a bit blotchy after second applications a few days later. Like the other Fakebake product better...Flawless.</li>
    <li> It did not work out well,it turned my skin green.Very unhappy and disappointed. I was given a credit back on my card and I was pleased with that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fake tanning for over 10 years and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products including other Fake Bake products.  This one gave me the best natural-looking tan even on my feet and hands.  I shaved then exfoliated using the Fake Bake polish because the instructions warn you that any soap residue could impact your tan.  I laid the application glove on an old towel to catch overspray and sprayed some product on (if you&#x27;re careful you don&#x27;t even need the rubber gloves as you don&#x27;t need to soak the applicator glove clear thru - just cover the surface).  It goes on really fast.  Just took a few minutes to cover both arms and legs.  The instructions say to leave on 1 - 3 hours but no longer.  I&#x27;m not sure what happens if you leave it on too long, but I see other reviewers saying they left it on over night.  I left it on 3 hours and got a very light tan.  The instructions also say to wash it off with just water as soap on top can make your tan lighter too.  This morning the tan has deepened just a little.  No lines, no streaks, no orange knees or knuckles.  Edited to Add:  I decided to leave this on overnight this time, and it turned orange on me, and doesn&#x27;t look even.  Learned my lesson, I&#x27;ll rinse it off in 3 hours and be very very happy with my light natural-looking tan.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Love that I&#x27;m able to use during day and not look dirty at all.  No smell nothing great tan</li>
    <li> This product works well. I had to use it 2 nights to get the darkness I wanted, but still great product</li>
    <li> Ok people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review for anything before, but as someone with a -- to put it gently -- fair complexion, this product is a miracle worker. I am super hesitant to apply self tanner, because I really don&#x27;t want the whole &amp;#34;OMG did you get a spray tan?!&amp;#34;  thing from my friends. I wore the Fake Bake Flawless for prom a couple years ago, and while it looked like I had a nice golden glow in the pictures, looking down at my legs was like looking at a couple of streaky cheese curls. Not flattering. Let me walk you through my experience with this gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I opened the bottle and put in the spray thingy. That was easy enough. I put down a towel in front of a full body mirror, stripped (so scandalous), and put on the gloves and the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I sort-of-kind-of didn&#x27;t read the instructions right away, but I was lucky because I just got out of the shower and had exfoliated my skin. I think that&#x27;s pretty important when applying this product if you don&#x27;t want streaks or dark patches, because those pesky dead skin cells just mess everything up. Anyway! I sprayed the pink part of the mitt 4 times, then started at the bottom of my leg, grazed over my foot, and worked my way up from there. IMPORTANT: when you apply this product, it is GREEN. And I don&#x27;t mean green-tinted, I mean you&#x27;re going to worry if you&#x27;re going to come out of this little procedure looking like the grinch. Spoiler: you won&#x27;t. The green is just a color guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It says to leave it on for 60 minutes for &amp;#34;golden color&amp;#34; and to leave it on for 2 hours for &amp;#34;bronze&amp;#34; color. I started at ivory (white white white). In about 15 minutes, the green color was developing into a more olive tone. It looked nice, but I wanted a little bit more of a glow; I also knew that the color would subside a bit after my shower. At 30 minutes, I looked like I had been outside. I decided to shower at 60 minutes, when my skin had a healthy golden BUT NOT AT ALL ORANGE glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I used a gentle baby body wash to wash off the product without stripping off the color. I walked out of the shower looking like a million bucks... not to toot my own horn. The tan lasted for maybe 3 full days, but I believe for the whole week or so, I wasn&#x27;t as pale as I was before applying FB60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all my fellow fair ladies, I would scream it off of the mountain tops. This product is so worth every penny. You deserve this, you-Godess-you!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and results are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Works great and looks natural. I am olived skinned and it enhances my color. My roomate is ivory skinned and it looks good on her too. The only thing that is a negative is it dries out your skin so make sure u use a thick lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever loved an item so much that I felt the need to share that.  I have tried every artificial tanner on the market and didn&#x27;t like them for one reason or another.  This one is leaps and bounds above anything I have ever tried.  I love it.  The results are real and lasting.  Even when I shave the color doesn&#x27;t come off like many others and the color looks REAL!  Just be careful to do one area at a time because it comes out like black water and you need to rub that in right away because if the drips are not rubbed in right away they will leave a dark spot.  There is enough in one of these bottles to last a year.  AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!  I love that I don&#x27;t have to tan ever again!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all the negative reviews on here! When I saw that I had to write my own review to talk about how amazing this is! So, I am pale, and not just your normal pale...I&#x27;m talking i blind people in the summer time. But I love to give myself a little color, so I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try! I originally tried the fake bake flawless, it was a great product but it just didn&#x27;t last! This product lasts a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Looks COMPLETELY natural (even on pale skin!)&lt;br /&gt;2. No weird orange color!&lt;br /&gt;3. does not apply blotchy&lt;br /&gt;4. lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;5. Great for pale skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. has an odd odor</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and will definitely buy it from now on for years to come (they better keep making it). Prior to using this I was quite pale. When I was a teenager I used to tan (not burn) and become tan from just being outside for a short amount of time. I can now spend hours outside doing yard work and at a picnic and you&#x27;ll never see the slightest bit of color. I didn&#x27;t want to use tanning beds, so I purchased this product and hoped it would do the trick. It worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are to shower, shave, and exfoliate your skin prior to using. When you are ready to apply it, I would STRONGLY suggest that you put a towel on the floor underneath you as the little droplets will get onto the floor and it will save you from ruining any rugs or having to scrub the floors (as you cannot do anything that will make you sweat at all while this is on you). The directions say to spray it on the mit that is included. I started doing this, but felt that I was using more of the spray than I would if I would just spray it directly on my skin and use the mit to rub it in and around. Therefore, I then switched and started spraying it directly on my skin instead. You then rub in a circular motion all around and you can see where you have the lotion already, which is a great advantage. I also used it on my face and didn&#x27;t have any issues, although, I didn&#x27;t spray it directly on my face, obviously I used the mit for that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries very quickly and I was worried beforehand that I would need to stand around naked (semi-naked) for an hour or two before I could wash it off. Once you are finished rubbing it in wherever you want to be tan, you can put your clothes back on and not have any issues with it staining your clothes or rubbing off. You do need to make sure that you don&#x27;t do anything that will cause you to sweat as the directions say it will not soak in and will run off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the lotion on for slightly less than 2 hours and looked very nicely tan and not weirdly colored or orangey. I did go back the next day and put another coat on my legs (for about 45 minutes) as they are always really white and I thought they could use a second coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts for about a week, so if you would like to keep the same color you will need to reapply each week, or you can use it just for special occasions.and not weirdly colored or orangey.

    <li> This product is awesome and gets you super bronzed sun-free, but the only drawback is that it fades a bit blotchy.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it helps me get a nice tan with minimal sun exposure.  Definitely use the gloves as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE after using first bottle - THIS STUFF IS GREAT!  As long as you rub in, there are no streaks.  The color is perfect.  I did not have bake my skin this year and still had very nice color.</li>
