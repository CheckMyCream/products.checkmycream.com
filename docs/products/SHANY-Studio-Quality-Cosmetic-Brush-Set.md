      <li>On top of being a space saver in my already cluttered purse, the brushes in this set are of good quality.  </li>

      <li>Ok....  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to handle, soft, and pick up product brilliantly.</li>
      <li>The packaging is very pretty and the brushes are amazing on the skin.</li>
      <li>I love how it comes in a leather box to store them in so that they stay clean.</li>
      <li>After 1 month of use they show no signs of wear or shedding and have been easy to wash.</li>
      <li>They are super soft, beautiful packaging, no odor, they are well made.</li>
      <li>Love them, I will look for them in full size.</li>
      <li>The bristles are super soft and the handles are of good quality as well.</li>
      <li>The brush is nice and soft easy to use.</li>
      <li>The brushes are extremely soft and I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
      <li>Space saver and worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>Super soft brushes, come with a very cute case.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this set.  </li>
      <li>The face brushes are slightly smaller than I thought they would be, but nevertheless, it&#x27;s a good travel size set.</li>
      <li>This brush served the purpose perfectly, with the whole set costing less that than one over-priced brush.</li>
      <li>My case did not come with the smell that other reviewers have mentioned, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>Amazing low cost brush set without looking cheap.</li>
      <li>Overall, this was a decent purchase that I&#x27;m pretty happy with.</li>
      <li>This was a great purchase that I may be giving to a few friends for XMas.</li>
      <li>Add to the fact that the brush fibers are so smooth that they don&#x27;t really pick up powder eyeshadow</li>
      <li>Someone said that the box crushes the tops of her brushes, but I think she didn&#x27;t make sure the handles were in properly, this does not happen in mine at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are pretty much useless.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not too small, so they&#x27;re good for every day use as well as travel.</li>
      <li>The bristles are super soft.</li>
      <li>They are well made, and the bristles are gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s actually a faux leather box thats sent out in a cool cardboard box.</li>
      <li>Brushes are nice but carring case is too small for them.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying these brushes.</li>
      <li>The only real use I&#x27;ve found for this is it&#x27;s small enough to be a pretty good contouring brush, but it doesn&#x27;t blend very well</li>
      <li>I really like these brushes because they&#x27;re small and cute.</li>
      <li>The other reviews were accurate.</li>
      <li>Sized for travel, the brush handles are still long enough for easy every-day use.</li>
      <li>These are brushes are so cute and small.  </li>
      <li>All the brushes are soft.</li>
      <li>The hairs are really soft and they get the job done.</li>
      <li>Also soft and dense.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and dense and works well for blushes and powders.  </li>
      <li>The brushes are soft, and I like the petite handles - easier to store and convenient to travel with too.</li>
      <li>Soft, durable</li>
      <li>nice little travel brush kit, get tired of misplacing my regular sized brushes taking them on the go.</li>

<li> nice little travel brush kit, get tired of misplacing my regular sized brushes taking them on the go.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t often reach for this brush.&lt;br /&gt;The large and small shadow brushes and contour crease brush:  </li>

<li> There is also room in the box for a small foldable brow brush/lash comb.  </li>
<li> Mine came in a hard-sided case that protects the brushes but makes it difficult to pull out the smaller ones; I plan to transfer all into something else (when I figure out what).</li>
<li> bristles are too hard</li>
<li> These are very very small.</li>
<li> Are so so stiff that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.  </li>
<li> As of yet, I have not experienced any shedding or lose handles.  </li>
<li> Some reviewers noted that the case smelled bad, but that&#x27;s just a typical plastic smell that dissipates in a couple of days and doesn&#x27;t affect the brushes.</li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t get that weird leather smell</li>

    <li> nice little travel brush kit, get tired of misplacing my regular sized brushes taking them on the go. Don&#x27;t think this will replace regular sized brushes but works well enough for touch ups</li>
    <li> Ok....  I useally do not write too many reviews... BUT... these brushes are absolutely amazing.  Soft, durable and I didn&#x27;t get that weird leather smell some of the other posters are talking about. Definitely better that my Bobbi Brown set that was $$$$$$$$..... Best money spent ever on these.... LOVE THEM!!!</li>
    <li> These are very very small. I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger. However these are excellent brushes. I keep it for when I travel. They are super soft, beautiful packaging, no odor, they are well made. Love them, I will look for them in full size.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this set.  The box that the brushes come in is attractive, compact and protects the brushes quite well.  Someone said that the box crushes the tops of her brushes, but I think she didn&#x27;t make sure the handles were in properly, this does not happen in mine at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush by brush analysis:&lt;br /&gt;Blush:  This is a lovely brush!  It&#x27;s soft and dense and works well for blushes and powders.  With powders, you need to tap it off since it is a dense brush.  In a pinch, I&#x27;ve even used this to buff in liquid foundation and it was great for that.&lt;br /&gt;Stipple:  It&#x27;s a good stippling brush.  Also soft and dense.  I like using this with cream blushes.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; brush:  What?  Why would you ever use such a tiny, pointy brush for foundations?  I tried.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  The only real use I&#x27;ve found for this is it&#x27;s small enough to be a pretty good contouring brush, but it doesn&#x27;t blend very well (it&#x27;s so pointy that circular motions aren&#x27;t very smooth).  It&#x27;s also too dense and thus stiff to work for under eye concealer.  I don&#x27;t often reach for this brush.&lt;br /&gt;The large and small shadow brushes and contour crease brush:  Are so so stiff that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.  Add to the fact that the brush fibers are so smooth that they don&#x27;t really pick up powder eyeshadow well.  These are pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;Eyeliner brush:  This is great!  It works well for eyeliner, packing on shadow over eyeliner for a softer/smokier look and also for brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three eyeshadow brushes have been removed from my kit and replaced with ecotools travel brushes (which fit nicely in the box).  There is also room in the box for a small foldable brow brush/lash comb.  Overall, I would say to look for a different set, though I do continue to use mine (just not the eyeshadow brushes).</li>
    <li> Sister&#x27;s review: Love these mini brushes! The bristles are super soft. I love how it comes in a leather box to store them in so that they stay clean.</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes, come with a very cute case. Blend my make up beautifully. Only thing is that they are not regular sized brushes but bigger than travel ones.</li>
    <li> These are brushes are so cute and small.  They are perfect for a makeup bag.  Their quality is top of the line.  The handles are very smooth and well finished and the bristles are the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt on a makeup brush.  They apply make up so smoothly and perfectly that they feel like they are worth five times their price!  I definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Needing only a flat-topped and slanted brush, I bought the set for less than the cost of two separate brushes. Sized for travel, the brush handles are still long enough for easy every-day use. Mine came in a hard-sided case that protects the brushes but makes it difficult to pull out the smaller ones; I plan to transfer all into something else (when I figure out what). Some reviewers noted that the case smelled bad, but that&#x27;s just a typical plastic smell that dissipates in a couple of days and doesn&#x27;t affect the brushes. All the brushes are soft. The smaller ones have the advantage of being firm as well. Each is labeled--contouring eyeshadow brush, brow brush, buffed bronzer--but I don&#x27;t use them for the stated purposes. For instance, I have a mineral make-up that &amp;#34;required&amp;#34; a flat-topped brush. No way was I going to spend $20+ for something I might not continue to use. This brush served the purpose perfectly, with the whole set costing less that than one over-priced brush. The powder brush is the equivalent of a blush applicator. The contouring eyeshadow brush can be used as a concealer, and the concealer brush can be used for lipstick. The brushes are excellent quality and can be used for whatever purpose suits you.</li>
    <li> The other reviews were accurate. Good quality. Excellent for travel.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes because they&#x27;re small and cute. The hairs are really soft and they get the job done. I received the package today and did my mum&#x27;s makeup using almost all the brushes and they all work perfectly. I have no problem with these brushes at all. The case is labeled as cotton but it&#x27;s actually a faux leather box thats sent out in a cool cardboard box. There are some books with it that are informational and helpful.</li>
    <li> The brush is nice and soft easy to use. Not too big I love it!!</li>
    <li> Completely in love with the brushes. The packaging is very pretty and the brushes are amazing on the skin. I highly recommend buying these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love that these brushes are labeled. It keeps me from mixing them and using them for different cosmetics. I have never had any hairs shed, so the quality is great. They&#x27;re not too small, so they&#x27;re good for every day use as well as travel. The price is great. I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This brush set is great! Its compact and great quality. The brushes are extremely soft and I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic for applying foundation! They&#x27;re easy to handle, soft, and pick up product brilliantly. My only complaint regards the smaller eye shadow brushes, which can be a little stiff for my tastes. I haven&#x27;t yet washed these brushes, but I&#x27;m hoping that will help soften the smaller ones. The leather carrying pouch is incredibly convenient and stylish. Overall, this was a decent purchase that I&#x27;m pretty happy with.</li>
    <li> I just got these.  They are a great price for the quality!  I also love that the brushes and case are vegan.  The case could pass for leather and has an invisible magnetic closure.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this set.  Great for the price</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice but carring case is too small for them.  One of the brushes, the bristles came bended due to the pressure of the other brushes.</li>
    <li> These are incredibly fabulous! They arrived as per the scheduled delivery date, came excellently packaged, and are so compact and nice for traveling or day to day use. The brushes themselves maintain the Shany Cosmetics quality, and are just perfect. They are well made, and the bristles are gentle on the skin. I would definitely recommend them.</li>

After 1 month of use they show no signs of wear or shedding and have been easy to wash. My case did not come with the smell that other reviewers have mentioned, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price.Would buy from the same company again!</li>
    <li> bristles are too hard</li>
    <li> Space saver and worth every penny!  If you are like me, you already have a ton of stuff in your purse.  The last thing you need is a bulky beauty brush set that takes up a lot of space.  This is the answer.  On top of being a space saver in my already cluttered purse, the brushes in this set are of good quality.  As of yet, I have not experienced any shedding or lose handles.  This was a great purchase that I may be giving to a few friends for XMas.</li>
    <li> Good quality and compact, prefect for travel.</li>
    <li> This is Luis A&#x27;s wife: Amazing low cost brush set without looking cheap. Nice travel size and feel</li>
