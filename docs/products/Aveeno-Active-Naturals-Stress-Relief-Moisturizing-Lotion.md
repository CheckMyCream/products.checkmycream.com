      <li>I have always liked Aveeno stress relief.</li>
      <li>I kind of gag eventually.</li>
      <li>Best lotion on the market...&amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; lotions in the name brand stores have a high ph leaving your skin thirsting for more moisture with every application.  </li>
      <li>Light, lavender, good</li>
      <li>Both my husband and I love the scent.</li>
      <li>This has always been a favorite and still is.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion... the fragrance...</li>
      <li>The smell is lovely, and the texture isn&#x27;t sticky or oily.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice fragrance, lite but very soothing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way too strong, doesnt smell like lavender, and it lingers.</li>
      <li>It is a light, clean, slightly sweet, lavender fragrance that I find calming as well as my kids!</li>
      <li>I bought this at a big box box store and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>It goes on creamy and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the Aveeno Stress Relief lotion!!!</li>
      <li>Aveeno moisturizes completely your thirsty skin...and the &amp;#34;body moisture stress relief&amp;#34; does not disappoint... goes on smooth like silk!  </li>
      <li>I am a wee bit surprised that noone really mentions how incredibly overwhelming the scent is.</li>
      <li>But this is too too too much.</li>
      <li>The pump is very convenient for using every day.</li>
      <li>Do not get it confused with the Aveeno Calming lotion which has a similar aroma and is nice for travel since it come in a flip top tube</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Aveeno Stress Relief lotion.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to perfumes and sneeze with anything that has as strong aroma and this product is NOT strongly scented!</li>
      <li>I keep trying other kinds of lotion, but always seem to come back to Aveeno, because it works so well and is very reasonable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has always been a favorite and still is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about eight years now. I love it! The smell is lovely, and the texture isn&#x27;t sticky or oily.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno lotions! This value pack was the best! Great quality and price. Supper happy with my buy. Will buy again soon!</li>
    <li> Good product, good value.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Light, lavender, good</li>
    <li> Best there is at a good price also love the smell.</li>
    <li> Always use this product one of my favorites but difficult to find at times.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love the scent. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the feel of lotion, but he loves this. It goes on creamy and absorbs quickly. Our skin feels so great all day! We also use it for extra dry patches in the winter and it heals them up.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a big box box store and I loved it.  It does moisturized your skin for 24 hours.  Our water at the job is very harsh.  When I use this moisturizing lotion it helps.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to perfumes and sneeze with anything that has as strong aroma and this product is NOT strongly scented! It is a light, clean, slightly sweet, lavender fragrance that I find calming as well as my kids! My husband likes the aroma too. It leaves you skin moisturized and is great all over and on your feet. My kids begged for it when they got sunburned because it felt so good on their skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate.  The pump is very convenient for using every day. I highly recommend the Aveeno Stress Relief lotion. Do not get it confused with the Aveeno Calming lotion which has a similar aroma and is nice for travel since it come in a flip top tube but it isn&#x27;t the same. Highly recommend the Aveeno Stress Relief lotion!!!</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market...&amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; lotions in the name brand stores have a high ph leaving your skin thirsting for more moisture with every application.  Aveeno moisturizes completely your thirsty skin...and the &amp;#34;body moisture stress relief&amp;#34; does not disappoint... goes on smooth like silk!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This Moisture stress relief produce does not work for me. It has made my condition worse. I am attempting to cancel my subscription</li>
    <li> I am a wee bit surprised that noone really mentions how incredibly overwhelming the scent is. Now I&#x27;m the gal who likes scented products, candles, creams, diffusers, you name it. But this is too too too much. I kind of gag eventually. It&#x27;s way too strong, doesnt smell like lavender, and it lingers.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It feels wonderful and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion... the fragrance...the way it feels on my skin. I have always liked Aveeno stress relief.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell and after mosteriser</li>
    <li> Our family uses Aveeno products often.  When the weather is dry, these products help keep skin from cracking &amp; hurting</li>
    <li> I keep trying other kinds of lotion, but always seem to come back to Aveeno, because it works so well and is very reasonable. This is a very nice fragrance, lite but very soothing.</li>
    <li> This is the best Aveeno I think they make; just love the light, calming smell.</li>
