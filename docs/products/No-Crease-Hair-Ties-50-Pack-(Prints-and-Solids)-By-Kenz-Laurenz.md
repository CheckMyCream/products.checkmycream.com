<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like these hair ties. Having a huge pack of them hanging around is really awesome. I&#x27;ve got two girls and I use them myself...so having a bunch is nice. They actually double really nicely as an accessory for a nice outfit. Because there are so many colors to choose from, you can easily find a tie which coordinates perfectly with your outfit. If you&#x27;re like me, you mainly wear your hair down, but need to put it up here and there throughout the day...these are perfect because they look like an intentional part of your outfit instead of a gross hair tie around your wrist. I dress very nicely for work, so it&#x27;s nice to have a hair tie which adds to, instead of detracting from, an overall look. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five(I would have given 4.5 had that choice been available!) is because they crease up and kind of stretch out quite quickly. The good new is, they untie without too much trouble and can be ironed and tied tighter...but they do crease up after just a few times wearing them and my favorite ones (so, heavy rotation/wear) did stretch out. But really...buy them. They are awesome.</li>
    <li> Got them on time and they are adorable.</li>
    <li> So many beautiful colors!!</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for these - wore them for five minutes and gave up.  They work, but it was a passing fad.</li>
    <li> They were not the ones pictured - it is a random selection, still cute though.</li>
    <li> Nice mix of colors and patterns</li>
    <li> So comfortable to wear in your hair and on your wrist.  So many colors to choose from and the price is really right!  Also, does not wreak havoc on your hair like regular hair ties.</li>
    <li> My grandaughter loved them!!</li>
    <li> This picture is deceiving.  The color and pattern variety is not this diverse.  No more than 10 had patterns and the rest were a solid color.</li>
    <li> The person they were bought for loves them and wears them al the time.</li>
    <li> These are so cool! My daughter loves picking out new designs to match whatever outfit she&#x27;s wearing. They are nice and soft, and don&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like these a lot &amp; use them everyday. Haven&#x27;t had one break or fray yet and it&#x27;s been a few months. Some of them do not have very much elasticity and the colors fade if you get them wet. As far as the mix: I was hoping for more variety in solids or at least an even distribution of colors (I got 6 hot pinks and only 1 green).</li>
    <li> Split this pack up with my mom, sister and cousin. Great colors and awesome variety.</li>
    <li> I picked this listing specifically for the colors (a good portion being neutrals) depicted in the picture and the fact that the description said &amp;#34;prints and solids&amp;#34;. When the hair ties arrived there were at least 5 lace and ribbon ones that looked like they would be good for a 2 year old. They were neither print nor solid. Most of the solid colors were brightly colored not neutrals. And seeing as how these were suppose to be a gift for a high school senior, I was highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife for Christmas, because she hates how normal scrunchies and hair ties get tangled. According to her they are very comfortable to wear and easy to pull out, so I highly recommend these to any women who like to pull their hair back.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and such a great value!</li>
    <li> Fabulous mix of all different kinds and colors of hair ties.</li>
    <li> What a deal.  Received a vast amount of different colors and designs. Love these hair ties. I would order again</li>
    <li> Extremely misleading photo. Colors and designs not as pictured. There were a LOT of duplicate colors (the photo for the product does not show ANY duplicates). I received mostly solid colors, but the photo shows lots of fun prints. Size of the ties were shorter than most ties I&#x27;ve purchased -- not enough to go around three times, too loose for two twists. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The package had at least 50 (didn&#x27;t count) of different colored and patterned hair ties. This is a super cheap way to buy them in bulk. My daughter is a gymnast and is ALWAYS in need of a hair tie. I can buy this bag, put them in her gym bag and not have to buy another supply for months. I can&#x27;t believe the prices these little hair ties are sold for in stores. It&#x27;s literally ribbon!</li>
    <li> These hair ties definitely had an odor.  I ended up soaking them in warm water mixed with my favorite high-fragrance shampoo to try and get rid of the smell.  It helped, for the most part, but I could still tell the odor is there.  Over time, the smells have been fading.  The elasticity holds up pretty well, too.</li>
    <li> They work well. They don&#x27;t hold hair will during workouts but they do will for everyday activities. Variety of colors to go with every outfit.</li>
    <li> Love these things!  Great quality, and super cool patterns.</li>
    <li> They are fairly good, they are very tight at first you will need to stretch them out before really using them. For the price, it is worth it!</li>
    <li> These are alright - the main thing I like about them is that they double as bracelets. They kind of suck as hair holders if you have thick hair like I do. They are just not stretchy enough to be able to wrap enough times around a ponytail to really hold the hair. However, they are not terrible. I still use them. You just have to keep redoing your hair all day so it doesn&#x27;t fall out of the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note to people buying this set - you don&#x27;t actually get all the hair ties in the listing photo. They give you 50 random ones with a mix of solids and patterns. So if you&#x27;re excited about a certain one in the picture, don&#x27;t get your hopes up that you will get it. Just as an example, I got like 5 lace ones that definitely are not in that picture.</li>
    <li> There was a very strong chemically smell upon opening the package, so I let them sit out over night and it was still just as strong.  I even tried to wash a few, but it didn&#x27;t help.  I went back and read reviews and found others that mentioned this problem.  I have bought from this company before and the ties were just fine, so I feel mixed about ordering any more. I am returning these for sure.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, awesome price!  Love having these on hand!</li>
    <li> Although I am happy with the colors I received, I did not get all the colors that were posted in the picture. I got mostly solid colors. Also, I only counted 49 ties rather than the 50 that I paid for.</li>
    <li> Wanted it for me expected it to be longer. But now I&#x27;ll have to give it to my cousin twin girls</li>
    <li> Great deal!  I was worried these ties wouldn&#x27;t be elastic enough, but they&#x27;ve got plenty of stretch.  Some of the patterns are pretty homely, but there&#x27;s a good assortment, so it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these things. They match everything.</li>
    <li> OMG - No tangles and No Creases.  Best new hair product in years!  Great price and selection too.</li>
    <li> Great variety.  My daughter is happy with them so I&#x27;m a happy customer</li>
    <li> I hate having hair tie creases in my hair and when I heard about no crease hair ties I knew I had to buy some. Looking around randomly I found that the hair ties were expensive for only a few ties, so I checked on Amazon and saw that the Kenz Laurenz were reasonably priced for the amount. I splurged and got 50 ties but figured I can always give some away. So far no noticable crease marks in my hair and most of the colors were different. Got a couple of white and black hair ties doubles but that was it.</li>
    <li> love these ties for my hair</li>
    <li> As advertised. My mom is senetive to smell, not smelly when arrived.</li>
    <li> Stank of gasoline for a few weeks during airing out. Gets two stars for cute and functional</li>
    <li> Love these!  Great selection and variety. Would recommend them to everyone looking for hair bands that work well and look terrific.</li>
    <li> super cute and they work really well on my long curly hair</li>
    <li> All these varieties were needed</li>
    <li> Not at all impressed. Most of the colors are only on one side of the fabric, so you end up with diaper-white on your hair, not the pattern. I have a lot of hair and these will only go around dry hair twice and not tightly enough. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great, great buy. These usually cost an arm and a leg at a boutique. Great variety, no repeated colors/prints. Received them within less than a week of ordering. Might buy more even though I already have 50!! Make great gifts- college girls lovvve these.</li>
    <li> Lots of color variety. No two are the same. Lots of neon and prints, so definitely a good pack for teens. There was a strong odor to them upon delivery. My husband assures me it was petroleum from manufacturing. The scent faded once they were open to the air a few days. I have long thick hair. I can wrap these ties easily around my hair twice, but not three times. So the tie is too loose to wear in a pony any higher than the base of my neck. But they are cute and will be nice little somethings to send along with birthday cards.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re so cheap - because bulk maybe?  I had initially received these from an online sample subscription and I loved them.  They were on sale for $10 for 8 hair ties so I decided to look here and BAM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these are just as good as the $10/8 set and we get so much more with many colors and designs to choose!  The ones with designs look really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints at all...  Except maybe that they tend to get lost just as easily as regular hair ties... What the heck??</li>
    <li> The smell of these hair ties is TOXIC. they smell like they were doused in some kind of poisonous chemical. As soon as you open the plastic bag - the smell hits you hard.&lt;br /&gt;I tried soaking them in a bowl of water + Dawn overnight and they smell is STILL there.&lt;br /&gt;I am now going to send them back for a refund because they are TOXIC</li>
    <li> It does the job and hold my hair :) They are cute and look pretty when I wear them. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The quality on these bands is pretty good. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t notice a smell (thank God). The reason I&#x27;m lowering my rating on this item is there are a LOT of repeats, and some that aren&#x27;t repeated per se but are a near match with one shade of difference (medium brown vs. a slightly darker medium brown). Here&#x27;s my exact assortment:&lt;br /&gt;* 1 black lace&lt;br /&gt;* 1 white lace&lt;br /&gt;* 1 animal print&lt;br /&gt;* 1 black-and-white floral&lt;br /&gt;* 1 red-and-white chevron&lt;br /&gt;* 1 hot-pink-and-white chevron&lt;br /&gt;* 1 pastel blue-and-white chevron&lt;br /&gt;* 1 lavender-and-white chevron&lt;br /&gt;* 1 black-and-white chevron&lt;br /&gt;* 1 rainbow&lt;br /&gt;* 2 dark silver / gray&lt;br /&gt;* 1 medium silver / gray&lt;br /&gt;* 2 lime green&lt;br /&gt;* 1 neon green&lt;br /&gt;* 1 pastel blue&lt;br /&gt;* 1 sea-foam green&lt;br /&gt;* 2 electric blue&lt;br /&gt;* 2 navy blue&lt;br /&gt;* 1 medium pink&lt;br /&gt;* 1 light pink&lt;br /&gt;* 1 light coral (almost same shade as light pink)&lt;br /&gt;* 1 purple&lt;br /&gt;* 1 dark reddish brown / rust&lt;br /&gt;* 1 olive gold&lt;br /&gt;* 1 cream&lt;br /&gt;* 2 medium brown&lt;br /&gt;* 1 light medium brown&lt;br /&gt;* 2 orangish gold&lt;br /&gt;* 1 kelly green&lt;br /&gt;* 1 tangerine&lt;br /&gt;* 2 red&lt;br /&gt;* 2 white&lt;br /&gt;* 2 hot pink&lt;br /&gt;* 2 pale pink&lt;br /&gt;* 1 lavender&lt;br /&gt;* 2 pale lemon yellow&lt;br /&gt;* 1 turquoise&lt;br /&gt;* 2 neon yellow&lt;br /&gt;* 2 black</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think they would work at first. But now I love them no creases in my hair! Wow!!</li>
    <li> At the beauty supply store you often see these selling for three dollars each. Buying these in bulk is really a bargain and I don&#x27;t see any discernable difference with their more expensive counterparts.</li>
    <li> These sell at local shops in LA for $1.50 for ONE hair tie! What a great deal! And they don&#x27;t crease your hair. I wear them to the gym and my blowout is still in tact afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck. I ordered these as a takeaway gift for a bridal shower. When buying in the store these no crease hair ties can be expensive. These came in a zillion colors and were a big hit with the guests. I put them in a mason jar and let people choose their colors. They are thick and sturdy without being so tight that it hurts when you put them in a pony tail. They seem to retain their stretch as well. These would be great for a little girl as well since they come in so many colors, a lot which were pretty vibrant, and the price is right so if she loses them it is not the end of the world. Just an FYI; the colors you receive range from neon to mixed patterns.</li>
    <li> not as stretchy as others i&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Product exactly as descibed, love all the different colors/patterns.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price</li>
    <li> I got this pack of 50 to replace some of the ties I ordered from Kenz Laurenz last year. I loved them so much that I just had to come back and get more! I have straight, layered, medium-length Asian black hair and these cute ties secures it perfectly in place. I just have to tie it higher on my head otherwise it slips off (I&#x27;ve actually lost one of these ties before when I tied it too low on my head). I usually tie it around my ponytail 3 times and it holds great all day. They&#x27;re a lot gentler than other types of hair ties and don&#x27;t pull your hair out when you remove them. They also don&#x27;t leave that nasty crimp in the hair either. The hairties arrived way sooner than I expected and were exactly as the description said. Each of the 50 hair ties looks different and the colors are beautifully vibrant. Kenz Laurenz has A+ customer service too! They are very efficient with responding to any inquiries you have about their product. 5 stars well deserved!</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the first few times used by they do not withstand the test of time and by time I mean three weeks.</li>
    <li> Lots of variety and same quality. GREAT bargain</li>
    <li> Great price, quick shipping and no duplicates. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought for my child and her friends! Super happy with complete purchase! Great assortment &amp; pleased with mix of random colors :)</li>
    <li> Some of the hair ties are a little too small, but most of them are perfect!</li>
    <li> Pretty but they do not hold a ponytail in place over time.</li>
    <li> I guess they serve their purpose as a hair tie....I was looking for headbands for my 1year old and they were way too small....guess it was my fault for not reading description thoroughly</li>
    <li> Love each and every one of the hair ties. They gave me doubles of a few colors which I LOVED because I received 2 black ones.&lt;br /&gt;I also figured out why people are posting about them smelling bad. Get this: The moment I opened the package I smelled them to see what everyone was talking about. Nothing. If I had to describe the very faint smell I would say what the inside of a Nike/Famous Footwear/shoe store smelled like. However. My brother walked into my room when I opened them and pointed out a &amp;#34;weird smell&amp;#34; and I had him smell them up close and he said &amp;#34;yea that&#x27;s it. They smell bad.&amp;#34;  Then I had my 13 year old brother smell them and he said they didn&#x27;t smell like anything. I SERIOUSLY think that people just smell things differently from each other. I guess some people have sensitive nostrils in his aspect. Lol.</li>
    <li> My daughter got these &amp; she loves them! No one is alike. Even came with one pattern for each holidays,</li>
    <li> I was afraid these were going to be a total gimmicky letdown when I purchased them but I really love them!  I have super thick, fine straight hair that is really slippery.  A lot of hair bands just slide right out of my hair.  These stay in all day.  Other hair ties will crease my hair so when I take them out I look like some kind of mutant-headed hairy beast.  With these there is literally no crease, no matter how tight I have them holding my ponytail.  They&#x27;re also really cute, both in my hair or on my wrist.  I have been careful not to lose them but I will be purchasing them again if I ever start to run low!</li>
    <li> I found this to be a good variety for a fair price. Something great to have for everyday life. I cannot vouch for the no crease in style hair ties. Perhaps if you do not pull your hair back tightly that might be the case, but if you prefer your pony tail tightly wrangled please expect to find light to deep creaseing whether your hair is fine or coarse.</li>
    <li> I have a habit of wearing a tight ponytail. I was finding I got a headache from the ponytail being tight, but the typical elastic ties needed to be tight. These hold hair better and don&#x27;t cause pain. They also don&#x27;t pull out hair like the other ties. This is my second set and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> It did come out of the package smelling a bit plasticky, but easily fixed with a spray of perfume and a wash!</li>
    <li> Perfect price and lots of wonderful hair ties.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> A+++ product. Received all hair ties and a variety. No repeats in patterns or colors which was nice to have</li>
    <li> I ordered these about 3 months ago and I absolutely LOVE them!! They are super cute as wrist bands too! If you order these I can guarantee you will NOT be dissapointed. (Especially if you&#x27;re a mom who has to wear her hair up everyday to keep it away from tiny fingers!!(: )</li>
    <li> My daughters loved the variety and different colors and patterns of all of the hair ties.&lt;br /&gt;They can wear them as pony tail holders and as bracelets too!</li>
    <li> So many hair ties for such a great value! They work great! The lace ones were a little smaller than the rest so I just use them for half ponytail hairdos and also for braids.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved all the variety if colors n patterns n the style exactly what I&#x27;ve been wanting. Only problem I had was they seem to Frey on the ends more than I expected and others I&#x27;ve had and I had a portion if them in my bag that wouldn&#x27;t stretch out as much which was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to smells don&#x27;t buy these! The ties are nice looking but have a horrible &amp;#34;rubberlike&amp;#34; odor. Soaked them in water and soap and rinsed and dried but the smell is still there. It is quite an obnoxious odor. I will try soaking again and hopefully minimize the odor some. Had them in an open container in our large bathroom and they made the entire room smell. Certainly don&#x27;t want my hair smelling horrible!</li>
    <li> Love the selection and value of these hair ties. I wish I could pick a few more of certain colors- I will be checking with the seller!!</li>
    <li> This is a huge value. Right now you could buy 5 of these in any store for 3-5 times the price! In the bag they all have a plastic smell to them, but it wears off immediately. I love the variation of them and impressed by how well they have held up. These are the best priced and most stylish no crease hair ties I&#x27;ve seen yet.</li>
    <li> Fun colors and variety.  So far works as expected.  I have long, thick wavy hair and they are holding up.  Haven&#x27;t yet tried on straightened hair, so I&#x27;m not sure if they are truly crease-free.</li>
    <li> This company is amazing! They sent me wonderful hair ties. Except some we&#x27;re missing, but that&#x27;s okay because I emailed them and they let me choose the colors. The hair ties are great quality and great prices!</li>
    <li> I love all the colors that these come in! I can match them with any outfit</li>
    <li> daughter and granddaughter won&#x27;t wear anything else now</li>
    <li> Product has terrible chemical odor. Almost unwearable.</li>
    <li> mine dont stink :) phew....love them...seem to do the trick.</li>
    <li> The colors and patterns are so much fun! The ties can be used 2 or 3 times each. They do not stretch out as fast as many others of the same type I have used. I keep these at work for emergencies and they are perfect. I am ordering another pack for sure</li>
    <li> Love these they work great</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin hair, and regular ponytails ripped out clumps of my fine hair. These DO NOT! I&#x27;m so happy with this product. The colors are vibrant and there is so much variance to the designs. The no crease hair ties at retail store are expensive, from what I&#x27;ve seen about $4 for 4-6 bands. Much better value here! I just wish I had found them sooner...</li>
    <li> Love these things!!! I have long hair and work in a professional environment. These are great, because they do not leave a ring I my hair and can also be color coordinated.</li>
    <li> Good value for price.  Not many cute ones,  must are solid colors,  and a few barley stretch.</li>
    <li> I really like these kinds of hair ties and have purchased similar from Nordstrom, Sephora, Target. They are mid-range in quality. Fun colors and a good deal. However, they stretch after only a few uses (&amp;#60;6). Can be fixed by retying the knot holding the tie together--pain in the butt to do though, since once it&#x27;s stretched it&#x27;s hard to work the knot loose to retie.</li>
    <li> This is our second pack.  We love these!</li>
    <li> Small but useful. I&#x27;m using them on my 3.5 year olds hair right now. These are the smaller ones and more suitable for younger girls because of the design. I wouldn&#x27;t wear them to work or to secure a style. Although they are small, I can still use one to create a snug pony and my hair is very thick.</li>
    <li> Great price- colorful and when u need to throw some in your car- beach bag- overnight bag and when people borrow you will always have plenty.</li>
    <li> EDIT: I learned that if you soak these in warm water, they regain their elasticity! Cool, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hair ties are so cute! I got them in 3 days. (Really fast shipping!) I received 39 of them, oddly enough. I contacted the seller and they were nothing but kind- They even let me choose the missing colors. Okay, on to the ties:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is such a wonderful assortment. I got no duplicates, and a good mix of patterns and solids. The solid colors are cute and bright, but there are also some that can be worn for more sophisticated styles. (Plum, neutrals, white, black, gold, etc.) I got a few pastels, neons, and neutrals in the mix, which was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And the patterns? A good assortment. I got a rainbow tye dye, some I am ____(Positive attributes), a gradient, some chevrons(Zigzag stripes) of all different colors, even rainbow, some animal prints(Tiger, leopard) a lightning pattern(Just some lightning strikes on a yellow background), houndstooth, mustache, and my favorite: A neon pink LACE band. Cool, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ties really are creaseless. I put my hair in a ponytail and after a long day... No crease! Plus, they look cute as a bracelet. With 50 of them, there are so many options! I have one or two on my wrist at all times. One for decoration, and one for using in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found that they are stretching out, but I mainly use them on my wrist with the occasional ponytail or braid. They can wrap around my medium-thick hair two to three times. Two works fine, but three gives me a really sleek style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ties come(When you first receive the) loose, (As in, the knots are not super tight.) and this lets you tighten them to suit your hair. (Really simple to tighten. Grab the fabric on either side of the knot and simply pull.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are all the perfect length to comfortably go around your wrist- They don&#x27;t slide, and they don&#x27;t leave marks. There is one, though, that&#x27;s a tad longer than the others. It&#x27;s fine, though: I just wrap it in my hair one more time. These also work on all hairstyles. Even buns- just wrap it around the base of the bun for a super-cute look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: When you wash your hands or are dealing with water, slide the tie up your arm. They take a while to dry and you&#x27;ll be stuck with wet fabric on your arm for a few hours if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply, I love these ties. Super cute, functional, great colors, and easy hair styles. I would recommend these to girls of all ages. There are enough colors in the pack that everyone can find some to wear. I would buy these again when I run low! (I, um, lose them really fast.) Anyways, this is a great buy! &lt;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the no crease hair ties for a while now, and these are just as good as any. My only complaint is I ordered 50 and received 47.  The price is good for the quantity, but I&#x27;m less likely to order from kenz laurenz again because after reading other reviews, I&#x27;m not the only one who was shorted. It would be nice to actually receive what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties, great product!</li>
    <li> These have a real chemical smell to them but it goes away after a few times wearing them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get all 50 and they stunk. Other than that they are cool.</li>
    <li> Great! so many colors to match anything I wear.  I love them!</li>
    <li> I love these. They are affordable, fun, and perfect for the gym when the last thing I need is for my ponytail holder to snap or snag my hair.</li>
    <li> cute little bracelets.</li>
    <li> This product smells like rubber or insecticide, even after washing 2 times, yeck! I tried one anyway, but it made my hair smell. They  grab hair, not silky and stress free on hair, and I get a bend in my hair, not like other products like this that I have used that prevent the bend because it is silky.Works like a rubber band with slightly (very slightly) less hair pull, not like it should.</li>
    <li> Great buy and love the product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I would recommend these to anyone.  I love these rubberbands and want to buy more and am going too.  I don&#x27;t even even feel them in my hair.  These rubberbands are great!  I sleep with my hair in a ponytail everynight and never feel the rubberband.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It was a great variety of colors and patterns.  Only thing was that they smelled awful.  Once I let the package air out, they were fine.  I used them in party favor goody bags for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
    <li> These have a strong plastic like odor, once they are aired out they work great.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are exceptional!  I received 50 different colors and prints along with some motivational ones (I am grateful, I am love, etc.).  They last for a long time and have not ever left a crease/dent in my hair.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I was paying so much for these in the local shops. Now I have a color for anything I wear. They are comfortable and they never pull my hair or leave a creae.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Prompt shipping. My daughter loves. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic especially since each one is different.  I can find one to go with anything.  The patterns are fun and perfect for my whimsical side.</li>
    <li> not worth the money.  someone sat down, cut some pieces of cheap fabrics and is selling them off as hair ties</li>
    <li> Pros: Good variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: These smell awful. There is a very strong petrochemical smell as if they were stored in an exhaust pipe. I am leaving them scattered on the counter overnight in hopes they might air out.</li>
    <li> They are cute. I so wanted to wear these but for the most part they are too small for my long thick hair to wear in a pony tail. My sons love them as bracelets lol</li>
    <li> I like all the different colors. After using, they don&#x27;t seem to be quality, but still a pretty good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The first package of hair ties by Kenz were fabulous! These look different and I didn&#x27;t get these.</li>
    <li> Love Love LOVE these!!!!! I got them for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and they are soooo cute!!!! They smelled a little bit chemically, but after wearing for a couple hours, the smell disappeared. I love all the different colors and styles, will definitely be buying from this company again!!! I HIGHLY recommend these!!!!</li>
    <li> Some of mine came stapled together, a lot of repeat colors, and the one color I wanted I didn&#x27;t get. Pretty disappointed</li>
    <li> I love the variety if colors. No 2 are the same. My 6 year old twins have fun picking out their band every morning. We used to use the tiny flat elastic ones because I could cut them out of their hair instead if pulling like so many &amp;#34;gripping&amp;#34; hair ties. These just slide right out. And they hold pretty well for my daughters very thin hair. No more tears</li>
    <li> Love these ponytail holders! They&#x27;re the only ones I use!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> They smell like chemicals and the patterns aren&#x27;t that attractive.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchase these. Beautiful, great quality</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the variety and choices! And they don&#x27;t rip your hair from your head!!</li>
    <li> Great price and great quality. I used them to fill bachlorette gift bags.</li>
    <li> Love them! Best ponytail holders ever!</li>
    <li> They are awesome me and my girls loved them and such a good deal at a great price fast delivery . I would recommend  them too anyone</li>
    <li> Some colors shown in the picture were not included, however majority were just as pictured. They did have a slight odor but once I took them out of the plastic package, and stretched them out the odor disappeared. Good price!</li>
    <li> They are pretty, but they smell terrible, like moth balls. They are soaking, and still smell!!</li>
    <li> Great variety. Does not break my daughters hair off. I will order more in different colors. Thank you.</li>
    <li> They stunk like moth balls. Made&lt;br /&gt;My whole house smell I shampooed them washed them they still smelled waste of money I threw them away</li>
    <li> Much smaller (tiny) than expected.  Purchased as new, but when the arrived the packaging was open and there was hair intertwined in them.  Couldn&#x27;t give them as a gift so! So I threw them into the trash.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest mix of patterns but most of them were fine. Worth the price since my dog keeps eating them...</li>
    <li> Great product and nice variety</li>
    <li> I have ordered twice from this seller.  The product is excellent and doesn&#x27;t leave creases or knot your hair.  They give a good variety of colors and patterns.  They came quick and are packaged well.</li>
    <li> Such pretty colors and such fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Cute hair ties that hold up well and work! I can&#x27;t say that I have personally had the no crease experience.  My hair creases, but that is ok, I like the hair ties and I will be purchasing again when I lose all of the ones I have.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Product just as described.</li>
    <li> Shipping came in less than a week!&lt;br /&gt;I really love these hair ties because they don&#x27;t pull out 178273 hairs while taking it out, and they don&#x27;t crease! They come in many colors so you can always find a color to match your outfit if you&#x27;d like. I&#x27;ve had no problem with these and ar definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got these for granddaughters hair.  They love them! I definitely recommend them! They were a great value.. Came in pretty colors!</li>
    <li> Love these hairties.  They don&#x27;t leave creases in your hair and they come in fun colors and designs.  They fit around your wrist so that you always have one handy.</li>
    <li> Thanks again, great product &amp; worth it!!!</li>
    <li> My sister got me these for Christmas and I was super excited to have them. Unfortunately, as soon as I opened the package I was over taken by a horrible order.  These hair ties have a horrific plastic/chemical smell to them that seems to be impossible to remove.  I took the entire pack and soaked them in soapy water for several hours twice and tried to dry them but the order remains.  Really disappointing.  I would pass on these and pay a bit more for something that doesn&#x27;t smell toxic.</li>
    <li> They were thin satin type ribbons.  Pretty variety of colors/ patterns.</li>
    <li> Does the job, love all the crazy colors.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product! Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better!</li>
    <li> These smell horrible!  I agree with the other reviewers, I would never put these in my hair</li>
    <li> Not particularly cool. Colors are VERY bright. They look kind of odd. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using them right!</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties!  I use them in my daughter&#x27;s hair and for myself.  We have a lot of hair and these do the job!  They don&#x27;t slip out of place and don&#x27;t damage the hair.  Lots of colors and designs to choose from.  They can be expensive at the store, I find it much more economical to buy them in bulk.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors to chose now. I have  long thin hair and put it up when I&#x27;m too warm. I&#x27;ve stashed some in the car, my purse, by the computer, n the bathroom, and the bedroom. These hold well and do not pull out my hair. Ok, my pony tail is only about an inch thick, so it works. My granddaughter has a 2-3 inch pony, and these would not work for her. Oh, and as for no creases, that would depend on how tight you put it on.</li>
    <li> It still leaves creases when I wear it for a long time, so that was a bit disappointing. I also have very thick/smooth hair, so I always have to use 2 to keep my ponytail from slipping down. And after a few uses the fabric starts to stretch and lose its elasticity. The colors and fabric are very fun though! I actually like wearing them on my wrists.</li>
    <li> So many fun colors and textures. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I like these a lot! They are of good quality, there is a color for everything, and they hold my hair quite well!  I have super thick, silky hair so I was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t hold up but so far so good.  I get a lot of compliments on them too.</li>
    <li> Great variety, smell is so slight you can barely even smell it and when they are not all together you can&#x27;t smell anything on the individual ones at all</li>
    <li> It makes the best ponytails and keeps it up and doesn&#x27;t cause a crease in your hair when you take it off.</li>
    <li> in absolute love with these. i love all the different colors and patterns.  nice variety.  I may order another set.</li>
    <li> Loves these, don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair or leave big creases, wish this package had duplicates though. If you&#x27;re doing two or more brains or whatever and want matching ones order a couple sets!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. I loved it. So many of them. My daughter looses them all the time. Now i never run out of it.</li>
    <li> They are so cute on your wrist and with so many you can match them to all your outfits. I like them in my hair too cute and functional they hold your hair up and don&#x27;t slip out and I have medium hair( not too thick not too thin) love them and I see them lasting a really long time. They never snap like the other hair elastics.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are a big trend because they come in many colors and can be cute around your wrist too. I love them; I will not say that they are not &amp;#34;no crease&amp;#34;, they do leave a crease in my hair. But they are much more comfy than any other elastic hair tie. I love every single color and pattern and they have worked out great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ones do get stretched out more easily than other &amp;#34;no crease&amp;#34; hair ties I have used, but they still rock and are worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in these.  I had bought a couple of other Kenz Lorenz packs last year and was very pleased with them, however these are not of the same quality.  First of all these STINK terribly!  Secondly, they are nothing like pictured.  The packs I bought previously were true to the pictures shown in the listing. The photo used to sell these shows only 21 solid color ones and the majority of the ties were patterns, while the pack I received has 38 solid color ties.  I already have all the solid colors and bought these for the patterned ones of which there are very few.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t really matter though since they stink so badly, I can&#x27;t imagine wearing or giving them to anyone.  There doesn&#x27;t appear to be much consistency in the length of these ties and a couple of them arrived untied. I can&#x27;t believe the company is not aware of the smell or that they are not as pictured.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great with all kinds of variety!  Just thought it would be on a card or something similar to the picture, rather all the ribbons were dumped in a bag.  I bought it for birthday favors for my daughter&#x27;s party.  Had to &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; it up and group the ties, cut out card stock to display the ribbons so it resembled the picture.  Little more work on my part but it worked out fine.</li>
    <li> The hair ties are so cute and the 50 pack just made the whole package even exciting! I love all the different styles and colors along with the great quality</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this set, I was hoping to see at least some form of the same kind of ties on this posted picture because I was most looking forward to the black and white printed ties and animal print. I received 1 cheetah print tie and no black and white patterns. I received a gross amount of metallic brown and plain white. So so so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got all 50 and really like all the colors &amp; patterns.  I did get more duplicates than I was expecting and some of them were bigger than others making me have to wrap them around my hair several times.  Also, the bigger ones just don&#x27;t fit on your wrist as well.  I gave 4 stars because they weren&#x27;t all uniform in size, but other than that, they work great.</li>
    <li> I received all 50 +1 Great variety of colors &amp; patterns! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are great for little girls who constantly lose their hair ties.  They are very cute, adjustable, and can be worn on the wrist without cutting off circulation.</li>
    <li> The colors are great, but they smell HORRIBLE!  I have already soaked them in shampoo to wash them.  And, then I sprayed them with Febreze.  They still smell terrible!  I can smell them from 5 feet away.  Next I&#x27;ll try vinegar.  Here&#x27;s hopin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Love these! Great colors and very stretchy.</li>
    <li> I love these BUT the color bleeds and stained my hair and clothes in the rain. So far the pinks and oranges bled the most.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and awesome colors/patterns</li>
    <li> these smell really bad.</li>
    <li> Lots of hair ties for a reasonable price.  Perfectly stretchy and a lot of variety.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a GREAT deal i just LOVE them all Ty :)</li>
    <li> This is a nice collection of hair ties at a reasonable price. There is a slight odor to the ribbons, but it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice and stretchy. There was a large assortment of solids with 5 sets of doubles, if you like to do pigtails or double braids. I only got 6 prints in my pack, but I also got some lacey solids that are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who goes through hair ties quickly like to do.</li>
    <li> Hair ties with fun patterns. What more do you want?</li>
    <li> Received 51 hair ties and only 2 were the same color/pattern. Their lengths vary drastically, some seeming almost too short. The edges of the elastic aren&#x27;t finished so I would suggest taking a lighter to the ends to prevent fraying. As others have said they initially have a finny smell. Not great quality but not terrible. As I said I can&#x27;t really complain for the price.</li>
    <li> I loved the variety of hair ties that came in this package.</li>
    <li> Cute but do not hold hair well I have to use a elastic band under them, still a neat idea.</li>
    <li> Got for girlfriend, she loves them</li>
    <li> First off, they smell SO bad. Secondly, they are not what was pictured. I got a few chevron striped ones and a cheetah print and the rest were solids and a lot of the same color. They look and feel cheap too. Im sending them back</li>
    <li> these are great&lt;br /&gt;very gentle on the hair&lt;br /&gt;very pleased</li>
    <li> They have a strong &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell.  I have washed them 3 times and now they don&#x27;t smell as strongly, but I could not wear them straight out of the package at all, and 2 washes  - in the washing machine, not by hand -  wouldn&#x27;t do it.  It took a 3rd wash, and now they are acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;The colors I received do match what is pictured, and they arrived promptly,  so there&#x27;s that.  Now that I have washed them 3 times and the smell was cut down a lot, I will keep them.</li>
    <li> Fun and colorful.  My daughter uses them for her hair and for bracelets.  She also loves sharing them with her friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent array of colors, they do not pull out my hair, and if I have a ponytail in all day my head doesn&#x27;t hurt like it does with other bands. They do smell horrible- I doused them in perfume put them in a ziplock bag overnight and they still smelled. Even after a week of them airing out the smell is still there, but tolerable as they are not meant to be potpourri. If I wear them on my wrist I occasionally get a waft of them...</li>
