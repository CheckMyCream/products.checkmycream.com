    <li> excellent product quick release, clients love it. easy to control cl movements keep them from falling.  clients feel more secure when being  assisted to stand, sit down and walk.</li>
    <li> I ordered the plastic, quick-release buckle.  I received the metal buckle instead. I cannot use it.  A waste of money.</li>

    <li> Arrived on time and all is good</li>

    <li> The belt has been a savior on my back.  It is a great support when my mother is walking.  Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting another one for an extra one.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the selection we made, for my XXX size husband.  Comparing this belt, to the ones that were used previously in the hospital, same quality.  I like the color bands that identify ours, rather than the red, white and blue the technicians seem to prefer.</li>
    <li> The clasp is not black as shown, but rather a milky white color, but still works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great help transferring my daughter between toilet and standing also for car to wheelchair. My friend saw me pulling the back of her pants to help me get her stable she she was getting out of the car and she told me &amp;#34;quit giving her a wedgie and get her a bariatric belt! I did and this one works great.</li>
    <li> This belt with the quick release is so much easier to use than the old type.  I have purchased another one so that both my parents have one now.</li>
