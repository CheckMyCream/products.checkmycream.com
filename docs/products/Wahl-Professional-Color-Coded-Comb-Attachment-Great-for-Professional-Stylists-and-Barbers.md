      <li>But the picture shown on on there for the product could have been more accurate, I simply chose this one because I thought it was going to be the older and better model guards.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny in keeping guards organize.</li>
      <li>I did have a feeling I was going to get sent the model of the guards I didn&#x27;t like, only way I think to get a hold of the good old fashioned colored ones is to go to Walmart and buy their cheap Wahl home clipper that comes with the colored combs.</li>
      <li>These fit a little snug on my older model Wahl clippers but did the job great.</li>
      <li>, I always know which guide I&#x27;m picking up, and don&#x27;t have to rummage through a box to find the right one.</li>
      <li>The colored guides make it easier to select the right size.  </li>

    <li> got these to replace missing guards that my 2 year old lost after he got in to my deployment bag.  I can&#x27;t be more pleased with this set.</li>
    <li> This is a conveniently stored set of hair clips that are numbered, color coded, and depthified. I enjoy these. I cut my hair short on a regular basis, and these help it to be a smooth process.</li>
    <li> really like holder for combs easily numbered for identification quality of product seems good they work as advertised my grandchildren have no problem with combs against scalp thanks for quality at a price thats fair</li>
    <li> a must if you have the clipper.  fit it perfectly and keeps them together</li>
    <li> I had to do a little research to make sure that these clipper guides would fit my Wahl clippers, but because Wahl is very direct with their fitament I had no problem...and they were here as fast as always! FREE!!</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose and well made. Fits on most wahl clippers and the color coordination helps you keep your hair at the right length.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition! Very very very very happy! Good deal! Very good!!! Was actually surprised at how happy I am! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Nice stand with color-coded guards so you can quickly find the correct one and store it safely and neatly after use.  It does contain a &amp;#34;number 1&amp;#34; (1/8&amp;#34;), which is the one that was not included with my clippers.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> For every haircut that you will probably run into, these combs have you covered.. Ok maybe not every haircut, but you get it! I am a professional stylist that has used Wahl products consistently for well over a decade and can honestly say that I have never had a problem with the product/brand. Only with being over charged for them lol! Not on this purchase. Great buy. Great product and the organizer it comes with is pretty dandy too!</li>
    <li> love the fact I can have everything organized and color coded thanks</li>
    <li> 4.5 Stars.  You know what&#x27;d give it a perfect 5?  There are a few other Wahl cutting guides that I&#x27;ve seen that don&#x27;t come in this package--like the Right and Left tapers and a 1/2 length--which I didn&#x27;t even know about until someone showed me.  (That would give the lower end clipper models overlapping lengths)  But overall, I love this.  Great colored organizer.  Actually makes me want to keep buying Wahl clippers in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used  Wahl clipper for years to cut my boys&#x27; hair.  After fourteen years, the cutting guide that gets the most use finally broke at the little clip.  I found this replacement set online for a decent price.  My only disappointment is that I cannot buy just the one guide that is broken.  I really don&#x27;t need another entire set.  But what is a person to do?  I bought it so I could have the piece I needed.  Overall though, I love Wahl products.  They are a great quality and have done a great job for many years.&lt;br /&gt;The holder is something that did not come with my first set.  I can see it as being handy if you have room to store it.  I have always kept my guides in a bag and then had to sort and dig to find the guide I needed.  I still don&#x27;t use the organizer, but I can see where it could be very handy to have them all in sight and in order of size.</li>
    <li> These do the job for a great price.  As a military guy I cut my own hair every week.  These are exactly what I need to keep a clean look on the cheap.</li>
    <li> So conveniently color coated! Amazing!</li>
    <li> Who would think to organize combs in a rack?  Nobel prize to that person!  I have had a set of combs but lost the #5 comb, which is really necessary.  The rack prevents loss now! YEAH!!!</li>
    <li> Solid product as expected from Wahl.  Color coding helps with fast identification and the 2 bigger sizes make self hair-cutting way easier and faster.  Recommended!  Did not give 5 stars as I think they are still missing 1 more bigger size.</li>
    <li> Good price and keeps my table very well organized. The fact that they are different colors vs all black works well for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really need the color coding, but it is nice. These fit my Wahl clippers really well, and have made it easy to cut my husband and sons&#x27; hair. Our Wahl clipper didn&#x27;t come with a number 7 or 8, so we bought these to be able to not have such short hair cuts. Great add-on for the Wahl clippers - work well!</li>
    <li> great product thank you.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s and my sons&#x27; hair with a Wahl shaver and this 8-pack allows me a wide selection of cutting lengths.  I use a number 2 or 3 on my husband and a 7 and 8 on my sons&#x27; hair.  Great value for a great price.</li>
    <li> This organizer is so handy, makes selecting your desired guard so much easier, the only thing I would like to have seen added to it is a cover, it does not come with a cover. I did however make one using the plastic packaging it came in.. I would recommend this item to all Hairdressers!</li>
    <li> Was looking for sine longer guards for my Conair trimmer and these fit and worked perfectly! I have a feeling these work on a lot of standard trimmers.</li>
    <li> I have been a hairstylist for 23 years and for 23 years I have had the same color gray guards tossed in a basket that I have to dig through every single day to find the right size. I love the color coding and the little tray can sit right on my station to keep them organized. The quality seems to be the same quality that Wahl guards have always been. I see no difference like the other person that gave 3 stars did. Looking forward to taking them to work with me today.</li>
    <li> I use these daily. Its great</li>
    <li> The guides fit my professional Whal clippers perfectly. Very sturdy and the colors make it easy to find the size.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Delivered quick and correct. Will order more in the future. thanks.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to use when cutting hair as I was use to fumbling through my old ones that were all black and it was hard to see which size they where.  The plastic holder seems a bit cheap, but is holding up with normal use.</li>
    <li> Shipping and everything was on schedule, and that&#x27;s good. Just wansnt happy with the model of the guards. I don&#x27;t know why Wahl started making the more flimsy and weak guards. When they used to be sturdy and tougher. The ones that show the number in a hole form are so cheaper and poor quality made, as the ones that were solid numbered and labeled were made more sturdy and durable.  I&#x27;m happy as far as how the seller does ship in excellence. But the picture shown on on there for the product could have been more accurate, I simply chose this one because I thought it was going to be the older and better model guards. I did have a feeling I was going to get sent the model of the guards I didn&#x27;t like, only way I think to get a hold of the good old fashioned colored ones is to go to Walmart and buy their cheap Wahl home clipper that comes with the colored combs. Again, seller did a great job, and did what he had to do</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s compact and looks tidy on the shelf</li>
    <li> Good quality and they worked well with my Wahl Perfessional 785110.</li>
    <li> Description says &amp;#34;Fits all full-size Wahl clippers&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not fit Wahl Pro Lithium 8546 (full-sized Wahl clipper).</li>
    <li> DO NOT CUT WITHOUT IT.</li>
    <li> the reason I decided to get this set is the fact that I was tired of having my guards all over the place. this it a great set.</li>
    <li> These work great on my cordless Designer.  My son loves playing with the colored clips while I cut his hair, so it&#x27;s an added bonus that they help keep him still.</li>
    <li> Great Value for what it is.  Color coded so you remember, and the quality Wahl gives at about half the cost of the supposed beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> I love the fact these clipper guards are color coordinated! Not to mention, they come with a nifty little container. The container helps keep your guards organized. When I&#x27;m really busy, I can just look for the correct color to use on my clippers rather than squinting my eyes on the black guards trying to figure out which guard is which. No to be misunderstood, the black guards are numbered but it&#x27;s difficult to see the numbers and the storage container isn&#x27;t included. Obviously, making it harder to keep them organized .</li>
    <li> Does not fit Wahl 8081 trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is as described.</li>
    <li> Fits virtually any wahl clippers, guards are a little bit longer than typical standard sizes but creates no problem. Smooth running and convenient with case.</li>
    <li> awesome!!!! worked awesome it worked perfectly like it said it would I would highly recommend it  if this is something you need</li>
    <li> Love them use them for work...thanks&lt;br /&gt;I got item in time designated &amp; they are easier to see than the ones i have which are grey</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> This item would have been great if it had not arrived with a broken no. 2 guide. As soon as i opened it the no. 2 guide was broken and that just happened to be one of the two that I use. Other than that broken one, the rest were all in great shape and arrived on time. I ended up using super glue to put it back together and then it was good to go. I would have given it a 5 stars had it not been broken because they were exactly what I was looking for and expected.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home and these ensure an even look.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to go with my Wahl Seniors since I work at a Men&#x27;s hair shop. I love how the guards are color coded by number, it makes it easy to pick them out in the caddy/organizer! It cuts the time trying to look for a number 4 guard for example. Great quality too! And reasonable price! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Worth every penny in keeping guards organize.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love it! Thanks</li>
    <li> Item sent was not as pictured...the item sent were metal guards.</li>
    <li> perfect and exactly what i needed plus overnight shipping! was very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought a five star Wahl Clipper awhile back, and had been using the clipper guards that came with it, which were very thin. Now with these clipper guards, I&#x27;m able to choose the length of my hair and smooth out any of the rough edges. Suffice it to say I no longer even think of going to a barber anymore. At this price, it&#x27;s basically a hair cut anyways.</li>
    <li> I like the color coding and the tray system for holding the guides.  The plastic is very sturdy and much better than the cheap guides that come in the familiar home barber sets.</li>
    <li> I have found the number 1 cutting guide used already and broken I have pictures also it is because I live in Aruba far from there I have not send them back because it would have cost me more money that the cutting guides self cost, so for the next time I suggest you control your packages before sending them to there destination.</li>
    <li> Great guards I love them</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great quality.</li>
    <li> Seriously, why don&#x27;t all clipper companies give you something to keep your guides straight in? I love this thing, I always know which guide I&#x27;m picking up, and don&#x27;t have to rummage through a box to find the right one. Genius.</li>
    <li> My Marine son got these with his Walh clippers 2 Christmas&#x27; ago.  He needs a weekly cut and has saved tons of money with these and the clippers.  They are nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Perfect set for my clippers</li>
    <li> Get lots of compliments on this!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the individual Wahl cutting guides are organized. I gave my husband the perfect haircut, but the only issue is that it was a bit snug and made it a little difficult to quickly switch out combs. Otherwise, it is sold at a very reasonable price. They were very useful, as well as durable.</li>
    <li> great product makes life easy</li>
    <li> Bought this cause I broke my 3 guard and it was really annoying trying to work around it. These fit a little snug on my older model Wahl clippers but did the job great. The plastic feels a little sturdier than the ones that came with that I snapped like a twig. The included guard holder was a welcome surprise. No more hunting through the drawer to find the guard I need or looking at three pieces to before finding the correct one. Hold them in one place and has each slot labeled to its always where it should be.</li>
    <li> The guides are sturdy and the accompanying container makes it simple to store while in use and after. Overall i&#x27;m happy with the set.</li>
    <li> I love the holder.  The colored guides make it easier to select the right size.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Had a fellow barber that swore by these.Nice product easy to use and I bought 3 sets so I don&#x27;t have to sanitize all the time.Really cuts down on time</li>
    <li> Was missing the smallest guard.. The red one. Not a complete set</li>
    <li> So I bought these to cut my hair and beard only to find they fit full size Wahl. And naturally, mine is not full size. So now I have cutting guides at $15 and need to buy $80 clippers and hope it fits  Tail wagging the dog again. Create a need, then fill it</li>
    <li> Fantastic set for the wireless walmart Wahl we have!</li>
    <li> I bought these to go along with my Wahl Senior clippers and they fit perfectly. It&#x27;s nice to have an organizer with a wide range of guards to cut all types of hair. Also the color coding makes it so that I pretty much don&#x27;t even have to think twice as to what guard I picked up. I recommend this to anyone wanting to cut a wide range of hair to go along with their Wahl Seniors.</li>
    <li> nice blades. I like the colors</li>
    <li> Great buy! Good Quality</li>
    <li> Love and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> No frills.  I use these with my Wahl Balding Clippers and they do the job.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Just as expected! Great product.</li>
    <li> This quality set of guides fits perfectly on my Wahl electric clippers.  The case helps to keep them neat.  Color coding helps to keep from getting them mixed up.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Great packaging. Thank you</li>
    <li> A Good set of attachments with a convenient carrying organizer.  Mistakes are hard to make by picking the wrong length.</li>
    <li> We have a family Wahl clipper we purchased over 15 years ago. It came with a VHS instructional cassette. I purchased these and they fit perfectly and work great with the clippers. I was also very pleased with the delivery. We received them in about 3 business days Using regular shipping.</li>
    <li> Good price works exactly like they should</li>
    <li> The product description was accurate, I love that the guards are all color-coded, and everything the product said it should come with was included.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it came in the mail 8 days SOONER than I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Great set of guard gliders with the holder.  Colors help you recognize each clipper guard faster.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. The combs are solid and the organizer makes it easy to keep your combs clean and organized on your station or in your tool box.</li>
