### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Bought it through Amazon and their fulfillment is always perfect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is great (in my opinion).</li>
      <li>Definitely is a pleasant experience, he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pleasant aroma with good cleaning</li>
      <li>To me, moisturizing cream is good.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good way to try it out before you invest in a lot of bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells good and not all</li>
      <li>I would even use it just to make the bathroom smell good.</li>
      <li>This soap smells so good.</li>
      <li>Good soap.</li>
      <li>The price of this soap has increased significantly since it came out years ago, and I find that amazon has the best prices out there when buying in bulk</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this cleaning soap.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use and has been a good idea</li>
      <li>Amazing soap.</li>
      <li>This is actually a really nice soap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After he had used a couple bars, I started quizzing him on how he liked it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found women tend to prefer me when I smell nice</li>
      <li>My husband is a Dial gold bar kind of guy.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best bar soap I&#x27;ve found for the shower.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the best one of the major brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, the shape is nice, it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
      <li>It lathers up nice and luxuriously and works just fine for a girly shave.  </li>
      <li>I personally really love Dove products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more on the &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; side (to me).</li>
      <li>love the smell of this soap</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of Dove Men+Care products for years now and have always been pleased with their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Our family uses Dove Soaps most of the time.</li>
      <li>I honestly wish there was an even heavier scrubbing soap available</li>
      <li>The Dove formulation is more refined -- fewer grains</li>
      <li>I ordered this thinking my husband would use it mostly, but I have discovered I don&#x27;t need my lemongrass girly soap in addition, this &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; soap has grown on me.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>Both of us, one of each gender, liked the fragrance, texture and rich lather, which like most Dove products, contains moisturizing cream to prevent drying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice clean soap scent.</li>
      <li>Gets me clean, helps me smell nice.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted at a good price.</li>
      <li>Their “Clean Comfort” bar is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>What distinguishes this bar from others is the addition of purifying micro-grains that help clean the skin more thoroughly and also assist in sluffing-off</li>
      <li>Makes taking a shower a bit more exciting and rugged.</li>
      <li>It has a distinct perfume to it, masculine yes, but pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, I AM a fan of the &amp;#34;micro beads&amp;#34; and how well they clean.</li>
      <li>Leaves you feeling clean</li>
      <li>bar has a grit that works well to clean and refresh the skin.</li>
      <li>B00SS81M58 Dove Men+Care Bar, Clean Comfort 4 ounce, 8 Bar]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>If you like a mild scent and a clean feeling without having your skin stripped, you&#x27;ll want to give this a try.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light with more of a pleasant gender-less generic soap smell than anything inherently masculine.</li>
      <li>It seems to be the right soap for a man because it says so on the box.</li>
      <li>So right off the bat I had to get use to how fragranced this was.</li>
      <li>Most likely not unless I can buy it really cheap, but I will definitely continue to buy the women&#x27;s versions for sure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I like it better than standard Dove bar soap, and would recommend it to others - men or women.</li>
      <li>It smells up the bathroom when my hubby takes the first shower</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty subdued, which is something I appreciate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my husband&#x27;s hands, my hands, and our son&#x27;s hands are all shaped the same.</li>
      <li>Great smell and last forever compared to other dove soaps.</li>
      <li>I bought this for washing my face and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry like most soaps.</li>
      <li>My husband has dry skin, and he enjoys being able to bathe with a product that doesn&#x27;t strip his skin and make it itchy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it cleans &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34;, but the &amp;#34;purifying micro grains&amp;#34; are a feature that really lets you feel the soap.</li>
      <li>I really like the exfoliating granules and think it helps with ingrown hairs.  </li>
      <li>Also this kind has little gritty pieces in the soap that exfoliate the skin a little bit and basically just feel good when you are using it.</li>
      <li>I would select either of these over the “deep clean” bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>Deep Clean with purifying grains.</li>
      <li>neither of us felt any scraping or scratching from the granules – they feel more polished and should not cause even slight discomfort.</li>
      <li>This soap also has the “classic scent”. . .</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend you do a search on microbeads pollution.  </li>
      <li>I also like the “Extra Fresh”.  </li>
      <li>I normally pick up the women&#x27;s version, but this time around I picked up the men&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>:B00OMXW9HI Dove Men + Care Extra Fresh Body and Face Bar, 4 Ounce,10 Count]]</li>
      <li>Even though I typically use a scrubbing pad in the shower, it&#x27;s still nice to have the additional exfoliating agent in the actual soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once you&#x27;re out of the shower and towel down, it&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t conflict with after shave, etc.</li>
      <li>This little beads in the soap make the showering more interesting but other than that its a creamy product and again wont feel dry after using it.</li>
      <li>To tell you the truth I didn&#x27;t like the smell right away, but after the first few showers I got use to the smell.</li>
      <li>Even if they are “natural”. . .</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>On to the second shower which is mine, I like this soap because it is very moisturizing and although it has some specks for the &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; part, they don&#x27;t get in the way for my leg shaving.  </li>
      <li>A masculine scent, but not over powering or faint-making (read AXE....)</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, the only real difference between this soap and the standard Dove bar soap is the color change and the addition of a granular exfoliant.</li>
      <li>All of the ones that are more aggressive seem to be designer or small run options that are a lot more expensive.</li>
      <li>and they are not rough.</li>
      <li>added to them, as I usually use them on my face and the skin their is most reactive to added fragrance or other stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove makes other bar soap for men that I do really like. . .</li>
      <li>this soap does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>This bar soap cleanses the same as regular Dove bar soap, though I do like the exfoliating action of this soap, as I sometimes have paint on my skin that requires extra scrubbing to remove.</li>
      <li>My legs and my face were both over dried and I&#x27;ve had to use more moisturizer than usual on my body to compensate.</li>
      <li>I am also grateful that the scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin very long because I am scent sensitive and don&#x27;t need a lingering scent on my family or myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> This is a &amp;#34;subjective&amp;#34; review because I think it&#x27;s impossible to be objective about a soap except to say it has very small granules in it that you can feel ever so slightly</li>
<li> They are not a good thing for the environment.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing soap. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> Great smell and last forever compared to other dove soaps.</li>
    <li> I keep trying different soaps that Dove produces for Men and this one is &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34;.  Bought it through Amazon and their fulfillment is always perfect.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best bar soap I&#x27;ve found for the shower. The scent is fresh yet musky, and the grains in the soap help scrub tough skin while the moisturizer keeps it from drying out. The price of this soap has increased significantly since it came out years ago, and I find that amazon has the best prices out there when buying in bulk (can also get an extra 10% off w. a subscription!)</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about 9 months now and it&#x27;s the best one of the major brands I&#x27;ve used.  I really like the exfoliating granules and think it helps with ingrown hairs.  I honestly wish there was an even heavier scrubbing soap available but I haven&#x27;t found an affordable option yet.  All of the ones that are more aggressive seem to be designer or small run options that are a lot more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;subjective&amp;#34; review because I think it&#x27;s impossible to be objective about a soap except to say it has very small granules in it that you can feel ever so slightly and it does seem to run out a little quicker than other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The granules seem to give it a little edge in terms of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great (in my opinion). You don&#x27;t end up smelling like AXE. It&#x27;s more on the &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; side (to me). I tried a small pack and just ordered the big pack. That&#x27;s a good way to try it out before you invest in a lot of bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it cleans. Good soap.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is light with more of a pleasant gender-less generic soap smell than anything inherently masculine. What distinguishes this bar from others is the addition of purifying micro-grains that help clean the skin more thoroughly and also assist in sluffing-off dry/dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When both adults in residence tried the soap neither of us felt any scraping or scratching from the granules – they feel more polished and should not cause even slight discomfort. It isn’t as gritty as Lava soap – which contains pumice. The Dove formulation is more refined -- fewer grains and they are not rough. Both of us, one of each gender, liked the fragrance, texture and rich lather, which like most Dove products, contains moisturizing cream to prevent drying.</li>
    <li> The #1 reason I am not a fan of this product is not that it doesn’t work.. . but what it’s doing to the environment.  I HIGHLY recommend you do a search on microbeads pollution.  I have no idea what the “micro grains” in the Dove soap are made of.  In the list of ingredients, nothing pops-out.  Are they plastic?  Are they not?  Either way. . . . Even if they are “natural”. . . They are not a good thing for the environment.  This soap also has the “classic scent”. . . which means that it smells like “generic soap” which I am not fond of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove makes other bar soap for men that I do really like. . . but without the “micro grains”.  Their “Clean Comfort” bar is my favorite.  I also like the “Extra Fresh”.  They are both the same, just a different scent.  I would select either of these over the “deep clean” bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00SS81M58 Dove Men+Care Bar, Clean Comfort 4 ounce, 8 Bar]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00OMXW9HI Dove Men + Care Extra Fresh Body and Face Bar, 4 Ounce,10 Count]]</li>
    <li> Gets me clean, helps me smell nice. I&#x27;ve found women tend to prefer me when I smell nice so I will continue to purchase this soap.</li>
    <li> Does the job. I bought this for washing my face and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry like most soaps.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know this had the little grains in it. Makes taking a shower a bit more exciting and rugged. Moisturizing soap is one thing, but slight exfoliation? OH BOY!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Dove Men+Care products for years now and have always been pleased with their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, I AM a fan of the &amp;#34;micro beads&amp;#34; and how well they clean. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong, the smell isn&#x27;t terrible, it&#x27;s just not my favorite in the Dove lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the soap is labeled &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; and it definitely does what it says.</li>
    <li> Dove is the only soap my husband will use</li>
    <li> I like that this soap does not dry out my skin. Also this kind has little gritty pieces in the soap that exfoliate the skin a little bit and basically just feel good when you are using it.</li>
    <li> It seems to be the right soap for a man because it says so on the box. I don&#x27;t know if it cleans &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34;, but the &amp;#34;purifying micro grains&amp;#34; are a feature that really lets you feel the soap.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and has been a good idea</li>
    <li> This is actually a really nice soap. My husband has dry skin, and he enjoys being able to bathe with a product that doesn&#x27;t strip his skin and make it itchy. Definitely is a pleasant experience, he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the scent: yes, it&#x27;s there, but it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as its being made out to be (at least in the version my husband tested.) Once you&#x27;re out of the shower and towel down, it&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t conflict with after shave, etc. from other brands. A masculine scent, but not over powering or faint-making (read AXE....) If you hate scents of any kind, steer clear. If you like a mild scent and a clean feeling without having your skin stripped, you&#x27;ll want to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Wow. This soap smells so good. My son loves it and I sneak a wash every once in a while. I would even use it just to make the bathroom smell good.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this cleaning soap.  Pleasant aroma with good cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;The bar has a grit that works well to clean and refresh the skin.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this soap</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, the only real difference between this soap and the standard Dove bar soap is the color change and the addition of a granular exfoliant. The scent is pretty subdued, which is something I appreciate. I don&#x27;t prefer bar soaps with fragrance added to them, as I usually use them on my face and the skin their is most reactive to added fragrance or other stuff. This bar soap cleanses the same as regular Dove bar soap, though I do like the exfoliating action of this soap, as I sometimes have paint on my skin that requires extra scrubbing to remove. Even though I typically use a scrubbing pad in the shower, it&#x27;s still nice to have the additional exfoliating agent in the actual soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it better than standard Dove bar soap, and would recommend it to others - men or women.</li>
    <li> My husband is a Dial gold bar kind of guy. It’s about the only soap that he will use. I personally really love Dove products so I thought I could convert him with the Dove+Care Deep Clean with purifying grains. It sounded manly enough, for goodness sakes, it has purifying grains. I forgot about the fact that Dove products have that ¼ moisturizing cream. To me, moisturizing cream is good. To my husband, moisturizing cream, made him feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After he had used a couple bars, I started quizzing him on how he liked it. He said he felt greasy and like he couldn&#x27;t get the soap rinsed off. So for him, this was a no-go but the rest of the family still likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice clean soap scent. The purifying grains aren’t overly scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He would probably give it 2 or 3 stars, I would give it 5 stars so we’ll compromise and go with 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking my husband would use it mostly, but I have discovered I don&#x27;t need my lemongrass girly soap in addition, this &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; soap has grown on me.  It has a distinct perfume to it, masculine yes, but pleasant. It smells up the bathroom when my hubby takes the first shower but it seems to not leave a lingering scent on our bodies.  On to the second shower which is mine, I like this soap because it is very moisturizing and although it has some specks for the &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; part, they don&#x27;t get in the way for my leg shaving.  It lathers up nice and luxuriously and works just fine for a girly shave.  I would recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It doesnt leave your skin feeling dry after using it. This little beads in the soap make the showering more interesting but other than that its a creamy product and again wont feel dry after using it.</li>
    <li> Leaves you feeling clean</li>
    <li> Our family uses Dove Soaps most of the time. This bar, aimed at men, is used by all of us. Yes, it does have a manly smell to it....it smells good and not all perfume and flower like, which I (the female of the house) am grateful for. I am also grateful that the scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin very long because I am scent sensitive and don&#x27;t need a lingering scent on my family or myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is shaped a little differently than the Dove bars we usually purchase. Is it meant for a man&#x27;s hand? I have no idea. I&#x27;m pretty sure my husband&#x27;s hands, my hands, and our son&#x27;s hands are all shaped the same. Maybe it&#x27;s because their hands are bigger? But that would equal bigger soap, not different shaped soap. Anyways, the shape is nice, it&#x27;s easy to hold onto. (Maybe that it&#x27;s. Men must be known for being butterfingers with the soap in the shower.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has little exfoliating bits in it as well, but I feel like this version of Dove soap is less moisturizing than others.  My legs and my face were both over dried and I&#x27;ve had to use more moisturizer than usual on my body to compensate.</li>
    <li> I normally pick up the women&#x27;s version, but this time around I picked up the men&#x27;s. I wanted to see what the difference was if any. So right off the bat I had to get use to how fragranced this was. To tell you the truth I didn&#x27;t like the smell right away, but after the first few showers I got use to the smell. I also found that these bars didn&#x27;t last as long once wet. I&#x27;m averaging 5 days of use with these bars and with the women&#x27;s version I get a week+. Overall my skin feels the same. So will I buy the mens version again?? Most likely not unless I can buy it really cheap, but I will definitely continue to buy the women&#x27;s versions for sure.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.  I like the gritty part.</li>
