      <li>It&#x27;s strong when applying but after that I dont smell it anymore.</li>
      <li>Its worth the price and came very quickly!</li>
      <li>But it works fine.</li>
      <li>I never thought I could wear colors so bold before, but Nyx made me fall in love with color for my lips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am in love with Nyx Lip products! The feel is creamy and glides on effortlessly. It isn&#x27;t drying the way most matte lipsticks tend to be. The color is highly pigmented and pops on my lips. I am slowly working my way into every shade in this collection of Matte Lip Creams. You will definitely want to double the layer. Just remember to use a matching Nyx lip liner and let the first layer of lip cream dry in between applications. Don&#x27;t touch your lips together until you are finished and your results should be beautiful. So far, my absolute favorites in this Matte Lip Cream line are London and Copenhagen. These two mix well with a lip brush too, for a beautiful &amp;#34;bitten berry&amp;#34; type shade. I bought Transylvania for my daughter and she wears it beautifully. Her complexion is more caramel with dark hair and eyes. For reference, I have light hair, green eyes and fair skin. And have always worn nude type shades on my lips. I wanted to try something new and found Nyx Lip products to be very user friendly.  I never thought I could wear colors so bold before, but Nyx made me fall in love with color for my lips. Follow the instructions for these as they don&#x27;t go on like ordinary lip gloss. These are special and the color really lasts. I love them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Shipping was very fast! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the deep burgundy color. Smells nice and goes on smoothly. The reason for only 3 stars is it is WAY over priced AND you need multiple applications to obtain the advertised color.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is gorgeous! It doesn&#x27;t go on opaque in one swipe but it helps if you fill in your lips with liner before applying the lipstick, really solidifies the color and makes it stay better</li>
    <li> YASSSS is all I can say. This color is everything, Perfect for fall and winter. Long lasting and pretty!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, it looks great on her, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smudge and last noticeably longer than what she had been using before.</li>
    <li> Not worth all the hype or the price...you can get the same effect using WnW Cherry Bomb with MAC Nightmoth liner (which lasts a long time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was clumpy too, which I didn&#x27;t like...its alright, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> The best one I have ever tried! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Amazing color! Buy it, they smell great, aren&#x27;t too pricey and look amazing!</li>
    <li> This product was old and dry</li>
    <li> Works well nice creamy Matt finish. At this price it is worth trying</li>
    <li> Very matt finish color pay off is amazing  just need to reapply  pretty often.</li>
    <li> Colour wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I thought it would be and didn&#x27;t have much staying power also.....</li>
    <li> This liquid lipstick is gorgeous ! The first time I wore it, everyone was like...wow this colour is gorgeous. I love NYX and I&#x27;m not surprised I love this one.</li>
    <li> Best lip color I&#x27;ve ever had.!</li>
    <li> Not worth the hype and even moreso not worth the money.  Plus it&#x27;s not creamy,  it&#x27;s actually very drying on the lips but it does give that matte finish.</li>
    <li> first time ever using a matte finish lipstick...so it will take some getting used to</li>
    <li> Love this product this is my 2nd time buying the same color, a little drying. But if I put on a small amount of chap stick and lip liner prior to application its not as drying. Looks great on.</li>
    <li> This is a true matte. It is so cute...especially with the cat eye pin up look. I line my lips with liner. Put two layers of it. It stayed on except when I ate. It is really nice.</li>
    <li> I received my order within four days I purchase, which was a few days sooner than expected. I am very satisfied with the product, it has become my favorite lipstick. It has a lip gloss applicator, but goes on very smoothly and dries matte. There is very little transfer and the lipstick smells like frosting, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> I really love this product if you want something that last long please get this.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the feel is very light. I am a darker brown African American woman and I don&#x27;t wear glossy as it&#x27;s not what I prefer. This product has a repeat shopper. Only thing is it&#x27;s cheaper at the mall. I will just purchase online what I can&#x27;t find locally. So if you don&#x27;t want glossy, heavy waxy lip color I&#x27;m sure this would be a great choice.</li>
    <li> The NYX Copenhagen is an amazing lipstick. The lipstick feels so soft on the lips and does not dry out like most other lipsticks. It smells and tastes amazing. I highly recommend this product to anyone that loves NYX Cosmetics and lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Cant wait for fall to use this color more. Really pretty dark dark red. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this color! Suits my skin tone well. It wears off on the inside of my lips as I eat or drink so I have to reapply.</li>
    <li> The color is nice but the applicator isn&#x27;t suitable for applying this formula evenly. A brush might have been better.</li>
    <li> Dark burgundy wine color, color payoff is true to tube in 2 coats. Lasting ability is slightly lacking with only 4 or so hours before noticable fading</li>
    <li> Love this color, it goes on wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, but it needs to be reapplied at least twice if you&#x27;re wearing it for more than 4 hours. It also dries out my lips.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and not dry . Love the matte finish</li>
    <li> The color is awesome!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT! Its the matte I wanted and its &amp;#34;buildable&amp;#34; I usually do two coats to get it really evenly dark. It stays very well but you may leave a little on a cheek or two. Worth it.  I found out they sell NYX in my local hood hair store but do not carry this type of lipstick so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> you can just go to almost any black bss and get this for like 5$ and there&#x27;s an even darker color called Transylvania i think and they look so good blended together! just make sure to exfoliate your lips before putting them on and also find a way to moisturize because it will dry them out</li>
    <li> Goes perfectly with Slim Lip Liner in &amp;#34;Deep Purple.&amp;#34; Apply liner all over lips to get the most out of this lip cream.</li>
    <li> NYX Copenhagen - this is a really lovely dark berry-colored matte lip cream which is extremely popular right now and hard to find in-store. This goes on soft and looks matte and rich. It doesn&#x27;t seem to stain my lips.</li>
    <li> I had this on my wishlist for a while and then there was a problem with my account and this was accidentally sent to me. I am SO glad it was!! This is by far the best lip cream I have ever had. It goes on smooth and looks really great. I highly recommend this product! !</li>
    <li> Great color, I wish it would stay on longer.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! I love it and it smells so good. I&#x27;ve recommended this bad boy to other ladies and they&#x27;re excited to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I really like the Nyx soft matte lip creams. I want to try out more colors. I find this easiest to wear with a lip liner, but the color is very pigmented and I recieve lots of compliments when I wear this out. It&#x27;s a great fall color. Also It has a very sweet smell which I like but others may not. It&#x27;s strong when applying but after that I dont smell it anymore.</li>
    <li> Ordered and received less than a week!  Color of Copenhagen beautiful matte finish no high shine or gloss.  I usually wear it alone or add a touch of the NYX extreme creme &amp;#34;candy land&amp;#34; in the center of lips and it&#x27;s beautiful!!  Will order more products from this seller.  Keep the NYX products.</li>
    <li> Love love love except for the fact that I thought it would be a bit darker. This ones kind of on the pinky purple type of dark</li>
    <li> im in love with this matte butter lip stick</li>
    <li> I adore the NYX Soft Matte Lip Creams. I have 6 colors, including this one and I get so many compliments on it. Honestly though, don&#x27;t buy it for the price here. There are cheaper prices for them, like I bought mine during a sale for $3.40. Originally $6. Definitely worth the price; they dry to a beautiful matte finish, but make sure you exfoliate and moisturize your lips so they will last longer :)</li>
    <li> SMELLS AND FEELS GREAT</li>
    <li> so many compliments on this lip color. its great for fall i only had to apply it once more through out the day.  i adore this brand</li>
    <li> I love the color! Goes on beautifully! Not goopy at all! Just perfect!!</li>
    <li> This color is so on trend for the season and I love the way the product goes on smoothly and sets with a matte finish.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected , i thought the color would of been better quality really disappointed</li>
    <li> I wanted a more purplish shade of color. But it works fine.</li>
    <li> probably my favorite color lipstick/creme. Its worth the price and came very quickly! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied , my order should have bin her on the 24 &amp; it&#x27;s still not here today it&#x27;s not on time and I can&#x27;t track it .</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but find it difficult to put in in.</li>
    <li> Excellent service.  My order was shipped immediately.  I gave it a three stars because it&#x27;s not what I expected it to be.  The color was not as dark as it appeared to be once applied on my lips.</li>
    <li> I love NYX makeup! I have yet to buy anything I haven&#x27;t been impressed with - this Matte lip cream included. I was a little concerned with how dark it was; that it would be a little too goth looking for me, however, it looks great. It&#x27;s a good fall season color for any girl. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> great color and lasts long. price is a steal!</li>
    <li> Love it! Goes on smooth. Not dry &amp; chalky like most matte lipsticks. The color is amazing &amp; I really didn&#x27;t have to reapply often. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> OBSESSED with this color. Perfect fall color.</li>
    <li> Creamy and perfect. My only complaint was I had to order online as my local Ulta never had in stock.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Not drying&lt;br /&gt;-Dries to soft matte finish (like it claims)&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful beautiful color (it&#x27;s a bluer berry, which makes teeth look whiter!)&lt;br /&gt;-Less than $7! LC Velvetines may have plenty of appeal, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t argue that they&#x27;re 3x better than these. Will definitely be purchasing another one of these lip creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-(mostly due to the color) Sinks a little bit into lines&lt;br /&gt;-Vanilla/frosting-like smell (could be a pro for many, but for me it&#x27;s a little too sweet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;-The cream is very pigmented, but even though it&#x27;s quite dark, it can be built up.&lt;br /&gt;-Save yourself some time to apply this: you&#x27;ll DEFINITELY want to use lip liner (since a mess-up on this dark color would be obvious). The cream takes some time to dry (I&#x27;d give it at least 10 or 15 minutes at least before touching it) but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, very solid choice for an every-day matte lip color. I&#x27;ll definitely be returning to this line of product for my matte lip needs! :)</li>
    <li> Gorgeous opaque dark red. Would recommend for people who enjoy a dark vampy lip.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on very well like some other colors I own but I like the way they smell</li>
    <li> I love how deep this color is</li>
    <li> Love the color and it came in sooner than expected which is always a plus for me!!</li>
    <li> This color is PERFECT!</li>
    <li> I bought this when it first came out at a drugstore and I payed only 7-8 dollars. Damn Amazon exaggerates with their prices sometimes. I do love the lipstick though it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
    <li> The color is really nice, and so is its tendency to stay on for a long time. However, it gets drying after a while.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bright rich color. I liked it with one coat or two and it last quite a while!!</li>
    <li> I was honestly expecting to really love this lip cream, but I just didn&#x27;t fall in love the way I expected! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just this specific color but it&#x27;s very thin, and it takes a few applications to get a nice opaque color. The matte finish isn&#x27;t as I&#x27;d hoped, and the color smears off easily. If there is any dry skin on your lips, the lip cream adheres to it and makes it even more visible. It&#x27;s a really pretty color, but I just am so disappointed in the application and the actual product. I just bought Prague, so fingers crossed that one will win me over!</li>
    <li> way over priced only for the fact it comes off with a drink of water...wasn&#x27;t expecting that  for the price should have stayed on at least hours not minutes</li>
    <li> Beautiful color but the product doesn&#x27;t distribute very nicely and it doesn&#x27;t last all that long but for what I needed it, it was fine and the SMELL is so great haha</li>
    <li> great lip gloss, great fall color...fades quick</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick!  It&#x27;s matte so it really needs a little moisture (lip balm) to keep lips from feeling dry. The color lasts a long time - it&#x27;s just good!</li>
    <li> Love product. Quick shipment</li>
    <li> This is priced wayyy too high, the original price is 7 dollars. This is my favorite matte nyx color! If you live in the U.S. and are able to buy it elsewhere please do.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Only downside is that it is MUCH cheaper in the store... BUT it was sold out everywhere so I guess it was worth it</li>
    <li> AMAZING color. Rich creamy texture. Stays on as well as a stain without the drying effects. Don&#x27;t LOVE that I almost always need a touch up after a drink or couple bites of food. To prevent this during dinners or meetings, I apply a colored thick, but not sticky, lipgloss - you could use any color or clear you would like. I would recommend a colored gloss 1/2 to 1 shades lighter (I use Buxom lip plumping - can&#x27;t remember the name) and it helps keep your cream lipstick on your mouth instead of on your wine glass and forks ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Don&#x27;t be afraid to go explore these deep rich wine colors. They really DO look good on almost every skin tone and are appropriate for almost any event :) this has become my new staple!</li>
