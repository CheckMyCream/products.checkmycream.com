      <li>I spray it on my wife (against her will, of course, since she is chemically sensitive), and it makes me happy.  </li>
      <li>she is a True ROCKSTAR &amp; Business Woman!</li>

      <li>Bought this not to wear but because I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
      <li>I really Do Enjoy this Parfume.</li>
      <li>It is nice actually,not very strong(which</li>
      <li>Lovely scent that lasts all day, but is not too powerful.</li>
      <li>also includes Belladonna, an important ingredient used by witches in their rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>i find it nice, not too much.</li>
      <li>it smells sweet but not too sweet like candy and flowers ...</li>
      <li>It definitely catches a lot of people&#x27;s attention --- in a good way.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, love the bottle and love that it is black spray...</li>
      <li>* Shipping was Super Quick and packaging</li>
      <li>The shower gel smells like the perfume but in a clean crisp way.</li>
      <li>Sweet, feminine and adorably packaged, this lovely scent lasts all day and is nothing like any other fragrance on the market.</li>
      <li>It is a light sent, it wears off of clothing, but not so much off of skin.</li>
      <li>The blood is actually her own, so that the wearer will have \\&quot;a sense of me on your skin\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>everyone wants a spray, EVEN STRAIGHT GUYS!!!</li>
      <li>which is good these days when all the new scents seem to not last</li>
      <li>like all of the listed scent notes, so I&#x27;m very happy with my bottle of FAME; I&#x27;m looking at the bottles of my favourite perfumes right now and every key scent note in FAME is amongst them a few times.</li>
      <li>;).</li>
      <li>But be aware of the fact that it might not go with your skin, with your personality, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still Fame and supporting Gaga either way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first two pics is what you get.</li>
      <li>It lasts on me a few good 4 to 5 hours.</li>
      <li>i read the reviews i LOVE lady gaga but the perfume is ok not great not bad</li>
      <li>At least the price is pretty good.</li>
      <li>The smell changes are different for different people because of your skin chemistry, but it works out FABULOUSLY!!</li>
      <li>It is everything that I hoped for and I would have to say that the size is pretty decent.</li>
      <li>After an hour a lingering sense of liquorice comes though, thanks to the saffron, and maybe some clove too?</li>
      <li>depends on how much u put on.</li>
      <li>A very pleasing smell</li>
      <li>Those who put it very close to there</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a must have.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a surprise gift for my wife and she really likes it a lot.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really get the whole push-pull malarkey, but the fragrance is not linear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One star because the darn thing evaporated before I really got a chance to use it.</li>
      <li>its just light enough</li>
      <li>the whole, Lady Gaga Fame seems to be have been born out of a sex magick ritual.</li>
      <li>I really like this perfume.</li>
      <li>It is black, first of its kind, but it does turn clear when it is airbourn.</li>
      <li>1 spritz is enough because it is very strong and lasts long.</li>
      <li>She could&#x27;ve been allergic to the perfume, it&#x27;s main ingredient is Belladonna.</li>
      <li>a little strong at first</li>
      <li>It comes on Strong ( as does GaGa ) but ends in a Subtle Sweet Manner.</li>
      <li>Has a very mature scent to it.</li>
      <li>The claw is metal which is pretty cool(The big version).</li>
      <li>This perfume is actually quite lovely, soft and long lasting on me.  </li>
      <li>but im used to amazon stuff coming early</li>
      <li>The scent lingers throughout the day and has a wide spray radius, so you wouldn&#x27;t need more than like 3 sprays compared to other perfumes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this not to wear but because I&#x27;m a huge fan. It smells really good. Only one complaint, my aunt tried it on her chest and wrists. She said after about ten to fifteen minutes it started to slightly burn her skin. She could&#x27;ve been allergic to the perfume, it&#x27;s main ingredient is Belladonna. As well as dried apricot extract. It smells awesome!</li>
    <li> SMELLS LIKE SEX IN A BOTTLE!!!!everyone asks me what im wearing and i say &amp;#34;lady gaga fame&amp;#34; . everyone wants a spray, EVEN STRAIGHT GUYS!!!</li>
    <li> Before you buy this item, it will be good to know how this fragrance was conceived. I am reviewing the concept behind this parfum rather than the actual fragrance itself. So there is no rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Gaga wanted Fame to be based on the molecular structures of blood and semen. The blood is actually her own, so that the wearer will have \\&quot;a sense of me on your skin\\&quot;. As in the little monsters will be consecrated to Mother Monster??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fame also includes Belladonna, an important ingredient used by witches in their rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is egg shaped clasped by gold claws, modelled after the giant one Gaga arrived in for her performance of Born This Way. The eau de parfum is the first ever black fragrance. Black representing darkness or the dark side of fame. Interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, Lady Gaga Fame seems to be have been born out of a sex magick ritual. Watch the commercial, you may well find themes relating to mind control.</li>
    <li> One star because the darn thing evaporated before I really got a chance to use it. :(&lt;br /&gt;So now the bottle just sits in my bathroom empty and looking all sad.&lt;br /&gt;It did smell good though.</li>
    <li> this perfume has a presence to it. when u spray it, it does show up. unlike other really faint/ subtle scents u can&#x27;t even smell. But this one has a definite &#x27;incense&#x27; smell to it. so u have to be okay with that aspect. i find it nice, not too much. Not overpowering either. depends on how much u put on. But at least i can smell this one when i put it on. Its not a total waste of money, like some seem to be.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. But be aware of the fact that it might not go with your skin, with your personality, etc. I got lucky that it worked for me (so they say) :-)</li>
    <li> I did buy it for my wife and it smell so nice. It&#x27;s the perfect combination between sweet and daring...</li>
    <li> The 2 last pictures are false advertisement for this purchase.  It is not in a leather bond box nor do you get a roll on in the nice box shown.  The first two pics is what you get.</li>
    <li> Lady Gaga had me fooled with those rumors of her new fragrance to be reminiscent of the &amp;#34;dirty deed&amp;#34;, but alas, Fame is nothing like those crazy rumors. Sweet, feminine and adorably packaged, this lovely scent lasts all day and is nothing like any other fragrance on the market. Not to mention, great price.</li>
    <li> Very sexy and empowering scent! The perfume sprays clear and is long lasting. It definitely catches a lot of people&#x27;s attention --- in a good way. I definitely recommend the purchase!</li>
    <li> I must say I was very skeptical about buying this perfume. I went to Macy&#x27;s one day and asked for a sample and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s absolutely delicious! I later bought a gift set which had the 3.4oz perfume, 6.7oz Shower Gel and The .34oz Roller Ball. It smells sooo good! The shower gel smells like the perfume but in a clean crisp way. The claw is metal which is pretty cool(The big version). It has belladonna, tiger orchidea, incense, apricot, saffron and honey drops. All combined make a fruity seductive scent. It&#x27;s really a must have. 110% Satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first.  I don&#x27;t know why.  Perhaps it was because I was recently let down by Justin Bieber&#x27;s Girlfriend.  But, anyway, once the awful alcohol/chemical scent dissipates, you are left with an odor I miss.  Remember those college parties where you would wake up the next morning with a pounding headache, ready to fight the hangover with a few beers, and you smell it:  the beautiful smell of stale beer; stale white wine; stale red wine; and stale mixed drinks\\&quot;  Perhaps someone vomited and a half-assed attempt at drunkenly cleaning it up didn&#x27;t quite suffice?  Maybe even a little lingering smoke; not cigarette smoke, but weed?  You get it all here, my friends.  And it works!  I spray it on my wife (against her will, of course, since she is chemically sensitive), and it makes me happy.  It just really makes me happy.  And it will make you happy, too.  Enjoy Fame!</li>
    <li> I liked it in the store but after wearing it it is a little heavy and suffocating. At least the price is pretty good. It came when it was supposed to but im used to amazon stuff coming early</li>
    <li> i read the reviews i LOVE lady gaga but the perfume is ok not great not bad just o k</li>
    <li> The person who wanted this got it and they say it is just what they wanted.  So I suppose it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this! Weirdly enough, the package arrived smelling like a skunk so I was afraid the perfume had been compromised, but it wasn&#x27;t such! It is a light sent, it wears off of clothing, but not so much off of skin. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really Do Enjoy this Parfume. It comes on Strong ( as does GaGa ) but ends in a Subtle Sweet Manner. I was apprehensive at first but was pleasantly surprized! LOVE GaGa she is a True ROCKSTAR &amp; Business Woman! BTW * Shipping was Super Quick and packaging Great would Buy from this seller again!!</li>
    <li> Fame (EDP 1.0 ounces)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is the smallest version of Fame (not counting the rollerball or sample sizes), it has the same power and smell that the 3.4 size has but just in a smaller/ cheaper size! It lasts for hours and it changes throughout the time that you wear it. The smell changes are different for different people because of your skin chemistry, but it works out FABULOUSLY!! I&#x27;ve found that I need to only spray it 2-3 times a day and I&#x27;m good! Morning, maybe afternoon, and evening. It lasts! Yes, you might say that \\&quot;I&#x27;ve only seen people get the bigger version.\\&quot; or \\&quot;I don&#x27;t feel like a big fan/ supporter of Gaga if I get the small version\\&quot;, but really, just because it&#x27;s smaller doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not a true Lady Gaga fan or that you&#x27;re alone on getting this size. It&#x27;s still Fame and supporting Gaga either way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this is the smaller size, so if you want to get this size just to \\&quot;test it\\&quot; and then get the bigger size later, go for it! This size and the 1.7 ounce have the plastic cap, and the \\&quot;Le Masterpiece\\&quot; (the 3.4) has the metal cap so if that&#x27;s a deciding factor go for it! But just remember, this size is good to start with, and it&#x27;s about $30 cheaper! I would recommend getting the 3.4 ounce if you like it though! Even if you don&#x27;t like Lady Gaga, it is AMAZING!! Sorry this review is long, but this perfume is WORTH IT!!! Definitely get it!! Five out of five stars! ANOTHER JOB WELL DONE FROM LADY GAGA!! PAWS UP MONSTERS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a surprise gift for my wife and she really likes it a lot. And I must say, so do I ;). It doesn&#x27;t stain black when applied and 1 spritz is enough because it is very strong and lasts long. A very pleasing smell and if Lady Gaga wears this perfume herself, then maybe her meat dress won&#x27;t smell so bad after all.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the bottle and love that it is black spray...Lady gaga FAME is awesome, the scent stays on all day...</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume. It is differant, which is what you would expect from Lady Gaga. It has a lovely clean smell, not overpowering at all. My mom loves it too, so I would say any woman any age might enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is a fan of Lady Gaga. I also got a sample vial of it for myself. The perfume is lovely, complex  and subtle.</li>
    <li> This perfume is actually quite lovely, soft and long lasting on me.  The black tint really does evaporate and spray clear on the skin.  The 1oz size would probably be the most cost effective, since you wouldn&#x27;t need to use much during the day. It would last you a long time.</li>
    <li> The perfume is great and smells amazing. It is everything that I hoped for and I would have to say that the size is pretty decent. The scent lingers throughout the day and has a wide spray radius, so you wouldn&#x27;t need more than like 3 sprays compared to other perfumes. I&#x27;m not sure whether or not it leaves a black residue on the skin or clothing yet though, its not supposed to but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Has a very mature scent to it. More of a scent to wear to a special event. Glad I purchased this perfume. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume! My husband got it for me for our anniversary and whiten two months I used 1/3 of the bottle! It smells great and lasts! The bottle is sturdy too considering I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times!</li>
    <li> Great product! Lovely scent that lasts all day, but is not too powerful. Love it.</li>
    <li> i got the 1 oz and it smells fantastic.  a little strong at first which is good these days when all the new scents seem to not last but this mellows out within a couple mins and the scent stays around fairly long.  it has blueberry tones initially - it kinda smells like a mix of the old \\&quot;poison\\&quot; perfume mixed with blueberry oil and another lighter floral scent I cant place.  Very subtle once dried.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to base my review on what could have been, hype, or whether I love or hate Lady Gaga (like many other reviews on many sites), but instead this review is on what is actually in front of me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get why this is being described as a fruity/floral - FAME is definitely something that I would describe as a floriental fragrance. On me there is only the tiniest hint of apricot, but it so short lived that it doesn&#x27;t really make an lasting impression on me. I think some people may be confusing the rich honey accord as apricot, grape or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The belladonna and incense are the next notes to develop on me, which evens out the sweet honey with the spicy, dark floral notes. After an hour a lingering sense of liquorice comes though, thanks to the saffron, and maybe some clove too? I don&#x27;t really get the whole push-pull malarkey, but the fragrance is not linear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official scent notes: Belladonna, incense, honey drops, saffron, apricot, jasmine, tiger orchid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all of the listed scent notes, so I&#x27;m very happy with my bottle of FAME; I&#x27;m looking at the bottles of my favourite perfumes right now and every key scent note in FAME is amongst them a few times. Couple that with the gothic bottle design and black juice and FAME could have been created for my personal tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst FAME does go close to the skin after a couple of hours, I still catch lingering wisps throughout the day. When I wore it to bed, it was still detectable on my skin the next day. No: FAME doesn&#x27;t stain skin or clothes. I&#x27;ve even sprayed it directly onto a white t shirt and the liquid does indeed spray clear, despite being black in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love GaGa, but I was a little iffie about her perfum, I mean, ITS BLACK! I smelled it at a mall and I fell in love with it at first whiff! It is black, first of its kind, but it does turn clear when it is airbourn. Those who say that it doesn&#x27;t, well how close are you spraying it?! Those who put it very close to there skin, like 1/2 - 1 inch in distance, OF COURSE ITS GOING TO STAY BLACK! C&#x27;mon people!perfumes are suppost to be sprayed at least 2 inches in distance drom the skkin or clothing. I sprayed this on my white shirt and it did not stain it. It smells very good and it is now my go to perfum for every even. I get compliments on it all the time and when I tell them who its by, they are shocked. Forget getting as a gift for someone, get it for yourself! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> SO AMAZING.... best smelling perfume ever if you don&#x27;t like lady gaga ... don&#x27;t be thrown off by her name on the label....it smells sweet but not too sweet like candy and flowers ... its just light enough and i lasts for hours on your body... I put it on 6 of my girl friends and myself and all of our boyfriends LOVED it .... its a smell that guys and girls definitely love to breathe in!!!!!  I hope this helps &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Also if you love Flower Bomb by Viktor &amp; Rolf you will love this!</li>
    <li> It is nice actually,not very strong(which I find surprising) coming from Gaga.It lasts on me a few good 4 to 5 hours.</li>
