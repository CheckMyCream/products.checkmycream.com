    <li> Perfect for any homemade toiletries.  Love these little jars.  I use the 2oz clear ones for just coconut oil (which I use as a moisturizer and a million other things...no essential oils in the clear ones).  I use the same-size blue jars from same company for homemade toothpaste, and the brown ones for homemade pit paste.  I bought these 1oz smaller blue jars for lip balm.  Whether for my own family or for gifts, these are always a big hit.  I print out little labels with my label-maker, but because I use different colored jars for different products, just a quick glance at the jar color tells me what&#x27;s inside.  When products are used up, I just run the glass through the (top shelf) of the dishwasher and it&#x27;s good to go for re-use.</li>
