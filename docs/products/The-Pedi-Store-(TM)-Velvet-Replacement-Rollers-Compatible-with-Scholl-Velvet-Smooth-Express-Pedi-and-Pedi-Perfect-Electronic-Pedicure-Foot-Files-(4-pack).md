<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I could not find any replacement rollers for my Amopei, and thought I would just have to buy a new one.  These fit perfectly and were a great price.</li>
    <li> These match the pedicure devise I purchased and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> This product does what it is suppose to.  Easy to replace and works as good a the original.</li>
    <li> Replacement rollers are just like the original.</li>
    <li> The replacement rollers are good, but the basic machine is too weak to be worth the price and effort.</li>
    <li> These are replacement rollers and are of the same quality as the rollers that came with the scrubber.  I will buy them again as needed</li>
    <li> rollers work great, easy to change and use.</li>
    <li> Fit into my amope perfectly. Seem to work as well as the original roller.</li>
    <li> I just ordered these without knowing how long the initial roller on the Amope&#x27; will last.  Just looking around in stores like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Walgreens the price paid for these are a bargain.  I hesitate giving this a 5 rating as I don&#x27;t know how long they will actually last.</li>
    <li> love it works great on rough heels &amp; hands</li>
    <li> I would recommend this  product. It works very well. This is a very good price for 4 of these.</li>
    <li> not course like original.  it is more like original worn down or medium grade sandpaper.  I am returning it</li>
    <li> Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> this is a wife subject, but they do make her feet look great......</li>
    <li> Love this product. After years dealing with heavy calluses and using creams and files I tried this product. My feet are callous free and smooth. It is so easy l should have found and used this year&#x27;s ago.....</li>
    <li> These were for my husband and they work fine.  They seem to last long enough.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t keep them. The pedicure tool they went to was battery operated and didn&#x27;t seem like it would hold up to the use I planned to give it.</li>
    <li> Works very well on wife&#x27;s feet. She loves this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure they will be fine.I haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
    <li> Replacement roller have not used it yet the one that came with the Amope is great and just order this for later use.</li>
    <li> Appear to be the same as the rollers for the Amope.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely PERFECT for the Pedi Perfect machine!! The skin is very grainy removing away any unwanted dead skin. They are really high quality and they were priced ok. I am really happy with my purchase and even happier with the results!!! Thank you &#x27;The Pedi Store&#x27;, I will patronize you all again when I am in need of more rollers!!</li>
    <li> Fits my Amope perfectly and works just as well as the more pricier replacements.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly with my Amope.</li>
    <li> These look and fit just like the original Amope rollers.</li>
    <li> they worked very well with the Amope I have.</li>
    <li> Awesome...works great!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Amopei foot smoother for Christmas. Gotta say I love using it.  My feet don&#x27;t have rough crusty edges like the commercial but I do get a little dry skin from time to time.  These replacement rollers seem to work as well as the original one.  I hope that Amopei comes out with a smoothing roller like the Ped-egg smoother has.</li>
    <li> Great refill cost!! :)</li>
    <li> My feet are super happy.  They&#x27;ve never felt better and look beautiful, too. I use this almost everyday on my dry feet. This is much safer and easier than a small dremel tool I used to use or trimming that I used to do years ago. Great rollers work on my Amope.</li>
    <li> although they are generic. they fit the amopedi just fine</li>
    <li> These Velvet Replacement Rollers work Amazing with my Amope :)</li>
    <li> Fits and so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great product, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I think this look and work exactly the same as the one that it came with and you save a ton of money. I would recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and they are the correct items.</li>
    <li> A must have for multiple users</li>
    <li> I have very dry and cracked feet! This did the trick!</li>
    <li> Worked with my Amope perfectly and at a fraction of the cost compared to brand-name roller replacements!</li>
    <li> Great service and product</li>
    <li> Work as they should. No issues.</li>
    <li> Pricey but ythey work awesome and you kind of need them for amope</li>
    <li> Comparable with the Amope .  Reasonable in price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  I use thiese regularly and they keep my calluses down with NO pain.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the refills.  I am sure they will be just as awesome as the original.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the roller that came with the amope</li>
    <li> I got these to replace the rollers in my Pedi Perfect. The brand rollers are very expensive! I truly could see or feel NO difference between these and the Amope rollers. These rollers work great!!!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, and met all expectations</li>
    <li> I purchase these and split them with my son. He loves his and uses his Amope more often than I do. I like having them on hand.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and makes my feet look beautiful</li>
    <li> Works well with my amope! I actually like these pads better than what the product came with.</li>
    <li> Works just like the original cartridge that came with the Amope Pedi Perfect.</li>
    <li> These replacement rollers fit the Amope&#x27; perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great getting callous&#x27;s off your feet.</li>
    <li> Works like the original.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly lasts long</li>
    <li> Works great with my Amope. The lower price is a nice plus!</li>
    <li> It is not good quality comparing to the original.</li>
    <li> Fits and works perfectly with my Amope.  Never thought I would buy such a thing but I love it.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly in my Amope pedi perfect! Very happy with this purchase - 4 rollers should last quite a while!</li>
    <li> Wife love it, although lately found there are more than one manufacturers and style, but there is no point to start looking into a different made, happy wife happy home. She like it I love it!</li>
    <li> Stood up to hard use. Helped a lot.</li>
    <li> Loved the price and item</li>
    <li> I want to make sure I never run out of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the Amope now every other day. My feet feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
    <li> They work great, I went back and bought a larger amount for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is the review i wrote for the actual item Itsself. This would have gotten 5 stars from me if not for the batteries dying after several minutes of usage. They still work, but don&#x27;t have enough power to handle some pressure. Therefore you need to change them more often than it not. Overall the item is great. Does the job beautifully, but with the money its going to cost in the long run in battery purchases, I think I might be returning it even.</li>
    <li> Fit perfect on my amope.  Just what was needed and price was very reasonable.  They go on very easy and you are ready to roll with a fresh roller.  I must admit this foot soother has been like a miracle and now that I know I can get replacement rollers for a good price I am happy to know I will not miss a day.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter as part of a birthday present that includes an Amope Pedi Perfect.  Her birthday is not until January so I cannot attest to their use.  They arrived on time, in great condition and look exactly like the one that comes in the Amope package.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Price is great.</li>
    <li> cost effective replacement rollers</li>
    <li> Ordered to go with the amope&#x27; pedi perfect that my wife loves.</li>
    <li> Works better then all of the other items ive tried.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great replacement rollers. They do as advertised. They fit my Amope&#x27; perfectly.</li>
    <li> fits great on the amope.</li>
    <li> was very happy with them would buy them again!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the name brand rollers.</li>
    <li> Works great  on my feet.</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I wanted and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I think I have to agree with another reviewer who said it was faster to use the callous remover that you use by hand.  These are okay, but doesn&#x27;t really get as much dead skin off, and I end up finishing with my old callous file anyway.</li>
    <li> The velvet replacement rollers were compatible with my Amope Pedi. This was a good deal for roller replacements, I seen the Amope velvet roller replacements for $14.99 x2 that was the cheapest I have found.</li>
    <li> Got them because I was buying a foot file and wanted extra. Was in a sealed plastic packaging. Great product. Did just what they are meant for.</li>
    <li> They work well, but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the original one. After using a replacement, I actually put the original one back on to compare them.  It just seemed better than the replacements.  If you have very tender feet, you may like the replacements better.</li>
    <li> These work great on dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> great product I love it.  will purchase more when needed</li>
    <li> My wife says great for smoothing perfect fit for pediperfect.</li>
    <li> They arrived very quickly and the price was terrific. Have not used any of them yet but they look just the one that came with my Amope.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Amope Pedi Perfect</li>
    <li> Work great and at a cheaper price :)</li>
    <li> Replacement rollers are ok however they are not as good as the roller that comes with the original tool.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this refill pack! I found my dear husband using my pedi sander on his feet, so I guess I&#x27;m going to be replacing these fairly often!</li>
    <li> Amope rollers are the same but these are less exspensive....&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE MY AMOPE CALUS REMOVER !!!!!!</li>
