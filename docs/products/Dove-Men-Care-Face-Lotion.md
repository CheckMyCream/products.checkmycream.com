<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Solid facial lotion. Smells good, feels good and all for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the off the shelf retail brands like Nivea, Neutrogena, and Loreal and I have to say the Dove Men&#x27;s is the best of the bunch. It goes on clear without much shine and lately I read it&#x27;s the least harmful to your skin (of the these retail store brands). The scent is masculine too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best. Non-greasy and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it everyday in my morning routine.</li>
    <li> This face lotion works very well and is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lotion, it works. Isn&#x27;t greasy, soaks in quickly. One can goes a long way. I bought a 3 pack last year around this same time and only need to replace it now.</li>
    <li> This product does not feel oily on my face, and a small amount covers a lot of area. The size is small enough to travel with and its not bulky.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist advised me (63 year old male) to use a facial moisturizer with SPF after discovering and freezing a few pre-melanoma spots on my face.  The spots were on the left side (driver&#x27;s side) of my face.  Most facial lotions are sunscreens with the typical &#x27;beach&#x27; scent.  I would consider my forehead and nose slightly oily and the rest of my face and neck having normal skin.  After carefully reviewing many men&#x27;s lotions, I decided on the three-pack Dove Men+Care Hydrate(DMCH) with SFP 15.  I am more than satisfied with DMCH.  TEXTURE:  Not oily, Lotion feel, rapidly absorbs into skin once rubbed in.  FRAGRANCE:  I have a sensitive smell and noticed a slight scent when initially put on.  I did not tell my wife and she did not notice the scent until I got shoulder to shoulder with her. She asked what it was and commented that it had a manly faint smell and she like it&#x27;s pleasant fragrance.  As the day progresses, the fragrance wears off.  The only reason for lacking the fifth star rating was due to DMCH not having SPF 30.  I highly recommend Dove Men+Care Hydrate Lotion.  Dermatologist advised and wife approved!</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a year now.  Love how it makes my skin feel even in the dry west Texas area.  The added sunscreen is also great to help prevent minor sunburns if I&#x27;m working outside for a bit.</li>
    <li> Good overall feel. Not greasy. I used Neutrogena before. This feels less oily but has a slight smell to it</li>
    <li> Feels good and doesn&#x27;t have much/any scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian college student in my 20&#x27;s. I have very sensitive skin and most face lotions (nivea, body lotion with face lotion) make my facial skin feel some type of way. Other lotions that I have tried will either be too sticky or will dry up too fast leaving a parched feel to your face (probably for non-sensitive skin).    Once you try Dove&#x27;s Men Face Lotion you will immediately feel the soothing effects of the face lotion \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; your skin. Once the lotion dries, your faces feels \\&quot;hydrated\\&quot; (similar feeling after you rinse your face and feel refreshed) without feeling/looking oily and sticky. There is also a gentle,subtle, floral yet calming aroma coming from this face lotion compared to the loud smell of most face lotions.    RECOMMENDED FOR SENSITIVE or NORMAL ( I used to break out by using [body + face lotion] products (for my face) as it was too harsh for my skin)</li>
    <li> This is a good price and a good product.  I live in a very dry climate, and this product helps keep my skin hydrated.  I only have one warning to those who are going to use it:  Be very careful around your eyes if you live in an area where you may sweat.  I put this on my face and eyelids and found that when sweating, the product gets into your eyes and burns like most sunscreens.  It is very uncomfortable and dangerous for your vision.</li>
    <li> so i thought that the SPF would be just like an added bonus but this lotion smells like straight sun screen. it does its job but personally i can&#x27;t stand the smell on my face all day.</li>
    <li> Great product usually just one pump and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> there is an empty one!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and a little goes a long way on the face. I normally use one pump for the face and another for the neck area. Lightly scented and nice to know its added sun protection is there as well. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great face lotion for guys with a subtle, fresh scent.  The consistency is nice; not too thick, not too thin.</li>
    <li> thank you for reasonable price &amp; fast shipping</li>
