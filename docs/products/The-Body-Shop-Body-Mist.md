### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I think&lt;br /&gt;I made an awesome decision.</li>
      <li>Smells awesome.</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>Not too good if you put this on after a shower and accidentally drop it.  </li>
      <li>Smells so fresh and citrus-y (LOL)!</li>
      <li>Lovely!</li>
      <li>and it is lovely!</li>
      <li>But still refreshing.  </li>
      <li>sure what everyone else on these reviews likes about this.</li>
      <li>Love the grapefruit scent.</li>
      <li>Seriously, I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>It is more like a perfume...and</li>
      <li>However, the shipping was quick and packaging was nice :)</li>
      <li>It smells nice when you first put it on.  </li>
      <li>I wish the scent would linger just a bit longer like when you first put it on, but I love this and am glad I chose this when my bottle of \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; grapefruit broke</li>
      <li>Love the grapefruit smell, just like fresh cut.  </li>
      <li>fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for more than 10 minutes (in this case, that is a good thing!!!).&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does smell quite good and summery, but I would not purchase again just to get a 2 second whiff each time it is sprayed.</li>
      <li>Fresh Smell... feels like a spring day - and again men find this particular smell on women to make them appear more youthful</li>
      <li>Smells just like a fresh squeezed grapefruit.</li>
      <li>have been looking for body sprays that have a lovely light scent that is actually like the fruit...</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have said, this smells good as you&#x27;re spaying it on, and then that&#x27;s it</li>
      <li>Not even if you put your nose right up to the skin it was just sprayed on to.</li>
      <li>I actually like this one better.</li>
      <li>Going to look for something with more of a lasting scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too flowery or too bitter, too light or too strong.</li>
      <li>I love this mist and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I was so hoping that this body spray had a light pure fruity pink grapefruit scent.</li>
      <li>And while on it&#x27;s own it smells rather offensive, when combined with any other perfume, it seems to enhance the scent of the of the perfume I actually like.</li>
      <li>It certainly smells exactly like pink grapefruit.</li>
      <li>will these body spray manufacturers go back to the pure scent?&lt;br</li>
      <li>This body spray is not as complex in its scent profile as the grapefruit spray from Bath &amp; Body Works which is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Not sure how to describe it, kind of like the the funk of a sour wash</li>
      <li>with no other scent added.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This spray does not have as much scent nor does it last as long as that cheaper</li>
      <li>Instead there is a brief hint of pink grapefruit when you first spray</li>
      <li>but it seems to need more essential oil and something as a longer lasting secondary note for when the initial citrus fades.</li>
      <li>Not long enough for an all night party.</li>
</ol>

<li> I bought the essential oil separately,  so I will add a bit to see if it keeps this from being a total waste.</li>
<li> just the pure fruit!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this unless you want to smell like one of those heavily perfumed little old ladies that you ocassionally get trapped in the elevator with!!!</li>
<li> Smells just like pink grapefruit, not too sweet....and it lasts.  </li>
<li> Vanilla, or flowers, spices or any other scent...</li>
<li> Probably because they used a lemon scent to boost the citrus smell of the grapefruit.... not a good combo for personal use.</li>
<li> A waste of money.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s therapeutic for me on a long tired day.</li>
<li> not enjoying the smell</li>
<li> I tried this as the other has always been a seasonal offering G and difficult to find.</li>
<li> Too bad the scent disappears almost instantly.</li>
<li> It is hard to find!</li>
<li> I am going to order another bottle soon - it was very hard to find this fragrance.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I bought 4.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, Bath and Body Works doesn&#x27;t sell the Grapefruit anymore which is where I used to buy it.  </li>
<li> but then there is a lingering horrible heavy smell that I have no name for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I am obsessed with this smell!</li>
<li> a bad one that lingers and lingers and gives you a headache.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>

    <li> I wish the scent would linger just a bit longer like when you first put it on, but I love this and am glad I chose this when my bottle of \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; grapefruit broke and I couldnt&#x27; afford their product.  I actually like this one better.</li>
    <li> Love the grapefruit scent. It is hard to find! Thank you for supplying it!</li>
    <li> Smells just like I hoped it would. It&#x27;s not too flowery or too bitter, too light or too strong. It smells just like grapefruit.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Too bad the scent disappears almost instantly.</li>
    <li> The smell is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  Not sure how to describe it, kind of like the the funk of a sour wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for more than 10 minutes (in this case, that is a good thing!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what everyone else on these reviews likes about this.</li>

    <li> But it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference. I suppose there are enough people who like it, otherwise it would be pulled. It certainly smells exactly like pink grapefruit. And while on it&#x27;s own it smells rather offensive, when combined with any other perfume, it seems to enhance the scent of the of the perfume I actually like.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to complement my grapefruit body gel.  Lovely! I am going to order another bottle soon - it was very hard to find this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This body spray is not as complex in its scent profile as the grapefruit spray from Bath &amp; Body Works which is my favorite.  I tried this as the other has always been a seasonal offering G and difficult to find. I used to get a grapefruit spray at Walmart that I believe was by Bodycology. This spray does not have as much scent nor does it last as long as that cheaper brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not an expert but it seems to need more essential oil and something as a longer lasting secondary note for when the initial citrus fades. I&#x27;m not buying this again. I bought the essential oil separately,  so I will add a bit to see if it keeps this from being a total waste.</li>
    <li> I bought the grapefruit scented spray. It smells like lemon floor cleaner! Probably because they used a lemon scent to boost the citrus smell of the grapefruit.... not a good combo for personal use. However, the shipping was quick and packaging was nice :)</li>
    <li> I wanted a grapefruit body spray that wasn&#x27;t over powering. And also something that was affordable. I think&lt;br /&gt;I made an awesome decision.</li>
    <li> Fragrance disappears immediately.  Daughter who loves the smell of grapefruit does not like it or use it.  I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> not enjoying the smell</li>
    <li> Smells so fresh and citrus-y (LOL)! I love this mist and it lasts a long time. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this smells good as you&#x27;re spaying it on, and then that&#x27;s it, you won&#x27;t smell it again. Not even if you put your nose right up to the skin it was just sprayed on to. It does smell quite good and summery, but I would not purchase again just to get a 2 second whiff each time it is sprayed. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> It smells nice when you first put it on.  The scent lasts only 2-3 minutes after you put it on.  Unfortunately, I bought 4.  They should have paid me to buy this.  Unfortunately, Bath and Body Works doesn&#x27;t sell the Grapefruit anymore which is where I used to buy it.  Also, this comes in a glass bottle rather than plastic.  Not too good if you put this on after a shower and accidentally drop it.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the grapefruit smell, just like fresh cut.  I can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore</li>
    <li> Last maybe 15 minutes.  Not long enough for an all night party. But still refreshing.  Going to look for something with more of a lasting scent.</li>
    <li> Yes, I want to smell like a tart fruit. Seriously, I LOVE this stuff. I wish it was perfume instead of body mist. Yum.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this smell! I have the scrub too. It wakes me up when I sit at my desk and get a whiff of it. It&#x27;s therapeutic for me on a long tired day. Smells just like a fresh squeezed grapefruit.</li>
    <li> Smells just like pink grapefruit, not too sweet....and it lasts.  I spay on my bed sheets and it is lovely!</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly. Glass bottle. Very nice.</li>
