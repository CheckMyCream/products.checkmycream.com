      <li>It probably would work better on someone with thicker hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok product..</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>I have allergies to many additives in conditioners and this one does not contain any of the ingredients that have caused hives or welts.</li>
      <li>I love what this conditioner does to my hair.</li>
      <li>works like magic</li>
      <li>I do not have dandruff, and I really needed a good moisturizing Conditioner..</li>
      <li>/&gt;After your hair is dry, put some in the palms of your hands, rub them together and smooth onto your hair, and it takes away frizz, adds moisture, smells great and is the perfect last touch when you&#x27;ve started with this quality</li>
      <li>I found a better one but its not bad for the price</li>
      <li>this product made my fine hair even finer.</li>
      <li>The smell lasts for days and her hair is shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is fantastic.</li>
      <li>And compared to the other Argan oil hair products out there, this stuff is a very good value.</li>
      <li>I have long, very curly hair, this is by far one of the best conditioners I have used and exceptional value on Drugstore.com for the large size!!!</li>
      <li>made my hair feel very healthy and soft</li>
      <li>It keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair really tangle free and smelling fabulous!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s absolutely true.</li>
      <li>Smelled nice&lt;br /&gt;Expected to give me better result, especially since i use it for more than a month..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also smells great, and the bottle lasts a pretty long time.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used the same kind of shampoo/conditioner twice in a row, rather than switching it up after the first bottle because most hair products seem to lose their punch after you use them for a while.</li>
      <li>My hair feels great and doesn&#x27;t get dry as fast as it does even when I was using a fancy salon conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind of conditioner I will buy.</li>
      <li>Altogether, they enhance the natural wave in my hair so it almost looks as if I&#x27;m at the tail end of a perm - which was always my favorite part.  </li>
      <li>- figured it was worth a shot).</li>
      <li>The One n&#x27; Only Argan Oil Conditioner smells great and makes my hair feel soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The Seller shipped super-quick and the product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>this stuff smells just like One N only and works even better.</li>
      <li>This is a terrific product and you will love how it makes your hair feel.</li>
      <li>and I love that you don&#x27;t have to leave it on for long</li>
      <li>Its ok if your hair is not that dry or damage</li>
      <li>I used this at a friend&#x27;s house a little over a year ago and immediately had to buy my own.</li>
      <li>but then it made my hair very oily.</li>
      <li>I did not care to much for it.</li>
      <li>The products are much richer and work so well for my hair, I won&#x27;t switch again.</li>
      <li>The real reason I use this is for the smell since it doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very silky.</li>
      <li>I do wish that you didn&#x27;t have to use so much to get it all through the hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other argan oil products that you can get but most of them make my scalp really really itchy.</li>
      <li>It has made my hair very soft (I had really crappy brittle hair before) and it looks much healthier.</li>
      <li>I have very light platinum almost white blonde hair.</li>
      <li>It did not leave my hair soft nor shiney, it did help with tangles if you have straight hair it will work for you.</li>
      <li>Whether I wear it straight or curly my hair feels so soft and it just bounces and swings.</li>
      <li>I would even condition the daylights out of a new perm just to get it that point quicker.</li>
      <li>I got it for my significant other as well</li>
      <li>, then some Argan Oil, plus a little Chi leave-in spray, curls rock or mousse, and my hair looks FABULOUS.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know I had it naturally until I started using these products.</li>
      <li>This along with the moisture repair shampoo has transformed my slightly naturally wavy hair from meh to the hair I&#x27;ve alway wanted.</li>
      <li>a must have for all family members to maintain hair soft and shinny.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair like most shampoos do, so it will feel a little weird the first few times you use it, but your hair will still get clean and it will feel healthier and shinier right away.</li>
      <li>but after so much money I said enough is enough.</li>
      <li>Yea, this product is kind of expensive, but I like to remind myself that conditioner is one of those things that you invest in.</li>
      <li>Compared to some other conditoners, it&#x27;s a decent price, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> This is now the only shampoo and conditioner I will purchase... Makes my hair less frizzy and leaves it moisturized and soft..</li>
<li> and this makes it soft, shiny and less</li>
<li> Ive use this a few time and it has my hair controllablily soft and the style last for days.</li>

<li> I have long, dry, coarse, curly hair</li>
<li> I do not blow dry or flat iron</li>

<li> I have not found One&#x27;n&#x27;Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair shampoo to help my dry scalp, or keep my hair from feeling  less dry and brittle.</li>
<li> This is my go-to; I don&#x27;t use any other conditioner.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d suggest using it every other day or maybe even a few days apart given your hair</li>
<li> The conditioner does not leave a heavy feeling and rinses out well.  </li>
<li> I am usually a product whore</li>
<li> I use fancy expensive hair masks and this does a very similar job.</li>
<li> While it may seem like an expensive purchase upfront, it lasts a really long time; you use about a dime size every time.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has thick frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I have very hard water</li>
<li> Also decreased dandruff.</li>
<li> had a hair stylist tell me this was the worst brand for argan oil use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this is the best smelling shampoo I have ever used. It is excellent at keeping your hair moist and shiny but the smell is simply amazing. I get it for all my daughters and I can&#x27;t stop smelling their hair. I got it for my significant other as well and she reaps the benefits from how happy it makes me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The One n&#x27; Only Argan Oil Conditioner smells great and makes my hair feel soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The Seller shipped super-quick and the product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again!!</li>
    <li> this product made my fine hair even finer. It probably would work better on someone with thicker hair. I did not care to much for it.</li>
    <li> Great price, and great product from this brand a must have for all family members to maintain hair soft and shinny.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is fantastic. I have long, dry, coarse, curly hair and this makes it soft, shiny and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great, and the bottle lasts a pretty long time. Compared to some other conditoners, it&#x27;s a decent price, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already turned several friends on to the Argan line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, then some Argan Oil, plus a little Chi leave-in spray, curls rock or mousse, and my hair looks FABULOUS. I get a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, another thing a lot of curly-haired girls seem not to have discovered yet: Got2be &amp;#34;Playful&amp;#34; pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After your hair is dry, put some in the palms of your hands, rub them together and smooth onto your hair, and it takes away frizz, adds moisture, smells great and is the perfect last touch when you&#x27;ve started with this quality conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably TMI but I know these products made all the difference in the world for me. Hope they help!</li>
    <li> Ive use this a few time and it has my hair controllablily soft and the style last for days. Also decreased dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love what this conditioner does to my hair. I use fancy expensive hair masks and this does a very similar job. I am usually a product whore but I have been faithful to this brand bottle after bottle.</li>
    <li> made my hair feel very healthy and soft</li>
    <li> This along with the moisture repair shampoo has transformed my slightly naturally wavy hair from meh to the hair I&#x27;ve alway wanted. I know that sounds cliche but it&#x27;s absolutely true. I also use the curl cream and mousse from this line. Altogether, they enhance the natural wave in my hair so it almost looks as if I&#x27;m at the tail end of a perm - which was always my favorite part.  I would even condition the daylights out of a new perm just to get it that point quicker. Didn&#x27;t know I had it naturally until I started using these products. I just blow dry the roots so the bangs are where I want them then let the rest of my hair dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hair stylist tell me this was the worst brand for argan oil use. I&#x27;m happy to disagree with her. I tried another brand based on her saying that but immediately went back to One N Only. The products are much richer and work so well for my hair, I won&#x27;t switch again.</li>
    <li> I found a better one but its not bad for the price</li>
    <li> very good product to use and buy.</li>
    <li> The conditioner does not leave a heavy feeling and rinses out well.  I have allergies to many additives in conditioners and this one does not contain any of the ingredients that have caused hives or welts.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and I love that you don&#x27;t have to leave it on for long and it leaves a nice sheen on the hair.  I use this on my daughters&#x27; hair as well.  I do wish that you didn&#x27;t have to use so much to get it all through the hair but I will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of conditioner I will buy. I&#x27;ve tried the other argan oil products that you can get but most of them make my scalp really really itchy. Yea, this product is kind of expensive, but I like to remind myself that conditioner is one of those things that you invest in. While it may seem like an expensive purchase upfront, it lasts a really long time; you use about a dime size every time. It has made my hair very soft (I had really crappy brittle hair before) and it looks much healthier. My only warning, I would be careful about using this daily. I started off using it daily but then it made my hair very oily. I&#x27;d suggest using it every other day or maybe even a few days apart given your hair condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: definite purchase. Cheaper than in the stores.</li>
    <li> I have very light platinum almost white blonde hair. Keeping hair that&#x27;s been lightened to this color hydrated and healthy but this conditioner does it! My hair feels great and doesn&#x27;t get dry as fast as it does even when I was using a fancy salon conditioner.</li>
    <li> For all hair types. This is a terrific product and you will love how it makes your hair feel. Bargain price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have long, very curly hair, this is by far one of the best conditioners I have used and exceptional value on Drugstore.com for the large size!!!</li>
    <li> best conditioner ever</li>
    <li> Really amazing stuff. Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair like most shampoos do, so it will feel a little weird the first few times you use it, but your hair will still get clean and it will feel healthier and shinier right away. I use it with the same brand conditioner.I have very hard water but you would never know. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used the same kind of shampoo/conditioner twice in a row, rather than switching it up after the first bottle because most hair products seem to lose their punch after you use them for a while. You will get the same results every time you use it with this stuff. And compared to the other Argan oil hair products out there, this stuff is a very good value.</li>
    <li> It made my hair looks amazing!</li>
    <li> It keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair really tangle free and smelling fabulous! The smell lasts for days and her hair is shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> This line is great. I mix some of the hair mask with the conditioner. I spend a lot of time in the pool so it&#x27;s exactly what I need. The hair mask is absolutely the best of all the products.</li>
    <li> I used this at a friend&#x27;s house a little over a year ago and immediately had to buy my own. This product gives my hair such body it looks like I came from the salon. Whether I wear it straight or curly my hair feels so soft and it just bounces and swings. I always get tons of compliments on it. The conditioner has a very light musky, floral scent. (I think that&#x27;s the smell of the argan oil). This is my go-to; I don&#x27;t use any other conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is now the only shampoo and conditioner I will purchase... Makes my hair less frizzy and leaves it moisturized and soft.. I would recommend this product to anyone who has thick frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Its ok if your hair is not that dry or damage i have had better try hayashi 911 emergency  pack</li>
    <li> This product took about two weeks to arrive. Product was great. It comes actually the way it is displayed on the site. I was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this for about 6 months (got a couple of those 2 ounce sample packets to try - figured it was worth a shot). My hair occassionally needs deep conditioning (especially after coloring).  This product works GREAT and it smells nice too.  I only need to use it a couple times a month.  Leaves my hair very silky.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.. I bought it to go with the One n&#x27; Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Shampoo. I suffer from dry scalp. I do not have dandruff, and I really needed a good moisturizing Conditioner.. I have not found One&#x27;n&#x27;Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair shampoo to help my dry scalp, or keep my hair from feeling  less dry and brittle. I do not blow dry or flat iron my hair, however it is chemically straightened.. I gave it a 3 because it smells nice. Just wish the fragrant smell lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT stuff!!</li>
    <li> It did not leave my hair soft nor shiney, it did help with tangles if you have straight hair it will work for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent and wonderful fresh smell</li>
    <li> I always loved using this but after so much money I said enough is enough. The real reason I use this is for the smell since it doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair. So I tried the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion and OH MY GOD!! this stuff smells just like One N only and works even better. Stop wasting your money and try it. I was skeptical but i am so glad i tried it.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice&lt;br /&gt;Expected to give me better result, especially since i use it for more than a month..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will bought it again</li>
    <li> works like magic and i love it. smells great too and leave hair nice and soft. try it out you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
