### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it is awesome, truly.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my sister-in-law, she loved it.</li>
      <li>If you wait even 24 hours you will lose a good window for the toner to leach out the gold tones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
      <li>Do not buy unless you are intending to erase warm tones so as to whiten hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have used manic panic virgin snow before many times to tone out the yellow and it has worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>Huge plus! :)</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>From what I have read it may even be best to leave it with the heat on all night to get the true white color this is supposed to create.</li>
      <li>This particular dye is a very lovely shade of bluish purple.</li>
      <li>got a light yellowish organeish color and now in hour 2 with Virgin Snow under the heat wrap</li>
      <li>Like most toners, use this RIGHT AFTER BLEACHING.</li>
      <li>First off I love Manic Panic because it&#x27;s vegan and for that fact that I have never had an issue with it.</li>
      <li>Good only if you have light hair.</li>
      <li>it did banish my brass and turned my hair a nice white,and it worked like a deep condition.</li>
      <li>Gets the job done but doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple day&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It worked very well on my bleached hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
      <li>You should really buy this</li>
      <li>Waste of money to be honest.</li>
      <li>I have been coloring my hair the ole normal medium brown</li>
      <li>Normally if you are just trying to get hair lightened to add a color to you could go with what I am getting</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ganna come brand new</li>
      <li>Clairol Shimmer Lights helps with that a little bit more since I can use it daily if I want.</li>
      <li>however.... I have shoulder length hair and was scrapping the bottom of the jar to completely get my hair, all in saying get two jars.</li>
      <li>No Smell no mess.</li>
      <li>I burned my platinum ( natural color ) hair with an curling iron and it turned yelloW and when I applied this it took the yellow out.  </li>
      <li>My natural color is the white form of grey that this treatment will get to</li>
      <li>but I have been coloring a medium brown which is why I may need to do a second round to get the pure white.  </li>

<li> I was feeling like I would be at creepy old lady trying to look young level if I went for it but then have seen a lot of 40-50somethings rocking the light purple, pink and blue hair.  </li>
<li> I am long of tooth and naturally white of hair.  </li>
<li> Even tho I left it on a long time.  </li>
<li> From my experience, even with a long application and adding heat, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a violet shampoo/conditioner</li>
<li> but I am actually trying for the White with only a few streaks of pink, purple and red</li>
<li> Definitely helped to tone down the yellow in my bleached hair but not strong enough to tone orangeish or reddish looking bits.</li>
<li> I left it on for an hour and a half and it took a little bit of the yellow out of the roots</li>
<li> It is almost white in some areas and a very pale yellow in others so combed through to re emulsify</li>
<li> Not one of Manic Panics better products. :(</li>
<li> Did nt last past one wash</li>
<li> This product sucks, no white at all</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t do anything to black hair.</li>
<li> Just be careful because I had a few areas on my skin that stained pretty bad due to the vibrancy of the color.</li>
<li> As the package came with a seal saying it&#x27;s sold as a set, leads me to believe it&#x27;s missing something.</li>
<li> I was a &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; teen once and still mad at Marta and Amy for not telling me about Manic Panic back then</li>
<li> Not satisfied with color.</li>
<li> This toner works alright, but not amazing.  </li>
<li> It is to give you white hair which you can then use as a base for other colors.  </li>
<li> (And no I don&#x27;t mean just Cyndi Lauper...)</li>
<li> this point, I have been addicted to peroxide products</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if I was sold fake product</li>
<li> Horrible The Color Didn&#x27;t Come Out &amp; I Have Blonde Hair...</li>
<li> This crap sucks.</li>
<li> It is not hair dye it is a toner so it was worthless to me.</li>
<li> I want as my base color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used manic panic virgin snow before many times to tone out the yellow and it has worked perfectly. I bought it this one time and left my hair ORANGE.  I don&#x27;t know if I was sold fake product but this has never happened before with manic panic virgin snow. The amount of damage I had to do to my hair to fix it. I will never buy from this store again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. However, you can do just the same with a T18 toner from Wella, if you want the permanent effect. This does wash off within 1 - 10 days... so if you do not want to constantly recolor, then I would not recommend this product. It won&#x27;t do anything to black hair. You would have to be already blonde to pull this off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T18 and purple shampoo... is my recommendation.</li>
    <li> Took the edge off my brassy bleached ends.... And was a terrific moisturizer! Huge plus! :)</li>
    <li> This is not a dye. It is a toner to turn your hair white. It will not make your hair purple. Do not buy unless you are intending to erase warm tones so as to whiten hair.</li>
    <li> This crap sucks. I had bleached blonde hair and it wouldn&#x27;t even phase it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to think or if I should even try to use the product. As the package came with a seal saying it&#x27;s sold as a set, leads me to believe it&#x27;s missing something. See photo</li>
    <li> okay so here&#x27;s my review of this.... it is awesome, truly. i wanted somthing without bleach to tone my hair.(up untill  this point, I have been addicted to peroxide products but my hair is starting to rebel) it did banish my brass and turned my hair a nice white,and it worked like a deep condition. however.... I have shoulder length hair and was scrapping the bottom of the jar to completely get my hair, all in saying get two jars.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff to have.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped to tone down the yellow in my bleached hair but not strong enough to tone orangeish or reddish looking bits. Even tho I left it on a long time.  Clairol Shimmer Lights helps with that a little bit more since I can use it daily if I want.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with color. I thought it would be white but it was not. Even when putting it on beach blond hair.</li>
    <li> This is to remove the yellow from bleached hair.  It is to give you white hair which you can then use as a base for other colors.  I am long of tooth and naturally white of hair.  I have been coloring my hair the ole normal medium brown but as I let my son get his blue highlights I felt a ting of jealousy.  I was a &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; teen once and still mad at Marta and Amy for not telling me about Manic Panic back then cause I would so have been purple and or blue haired all through school!  I was feeling like I would be at creepy old lady trying to look young level if I went for it but then have seen a lot of 40-50somethings rocking the light purple, pink and blue hair.  (And no I don&#x27;t mean just Cyndi Lauper...) So giving it the go!  I used once Manic Panic 40Volume Amplified Flash Lightning and used my head heater over the developing cap for 2 hours got a light yellowish organeish color and now in hour 2 with Virgin Snow under the heat wrap It is almost white in some areas and a very pale yellow in others so combed through to re emulsify (make it frothy) put the plastic cap back on and then put back on my Hair Therapy Spa head heater.  From what I have read it may even be best to leave it with the heat on all night to get the true white color this is supposed to create. Depending on where the color is at in the morning I may wait till next week doing several heat conditioning treatments then do another Flash Lightning and another Virgin Snow.  My natural color is the white form of grey that this treatment will get to but I have been coloring a medium brown which is why I may need to do a second round to get the pure white.  Normally if you are just trying to get hair lightened to add a color to you could go with what I am getting but I am actually trying for the White with only a few streaks of pink, purple and red so I need to get to that white white I want as my base color.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple day&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
    <li> This definitely gets the brass out of your hair. I would tone my hair with this 9 times out of 10.</li>
    <li> Not enough pigment. Did nt last past one wash</li>
    <li> Horrible The Color Didn&#x27;t Come Out &amp; I Have Blonde Hair...</li>
    <li> It works well enough, if you don&#x27;t mind a purple tint for a couple days, but i&#x27;d rather purple than yellow. Like most toners, use this RIGHT AFTER BLEACHING. If you wait even 24 hours you will lose a good window for the toner to leach out the gold tones.</li>
    <li> Not one of Manic Panics better products. :(</li>
    <li> First off I love Manic Panic because it&#x27;s vegan and for that fact that I have never had an issue with it. This particular dye is a very lovely shade of bluish purple. It worked very well on my bleached hair. Just be careful because I had a few areas on my skin that stained pretty bad due to the vibrancy of the color.</li>
    <li> It is not hair dye it is a toner so it was worthless to me.</li>
    <li> Good only if you have light hair. Didn&#x27;t work on my kids brown hair</li>
    <li> This product sucks, no white at all</li>
    <li> This toner works alright, but not amazing.  From my experience, even with a long application and adding heat, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a violet shampoo/conditioner and it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me. I left it on for an hour and a half and it took a little bit of the yellow out of the roots but it didn&#x27;t do much overall. I think it had to do with the circumstances. I&#x27;ll probably try it again some time.</li>
    <li> after the 1st treatment my hair was snow white. I&#x27;ll be honest ai didn&#x27;t think it was gonna work but to my surprise and delight it did, and it don&#x27;t require that you us a lot of the product! I&#x27;M HOOKED!</li>
    <li> You should really buy this it&#x27;s ganna come brand new</li>
    <li> I burned my platinum ( natural color ) hair with an curling iron and it turned yelloW and when I applied this it took the yellow out.  No Smell no mess.</li>
    <li> Waste of money to be honest.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister-in-law, she loved it. Would use seller again</li>
