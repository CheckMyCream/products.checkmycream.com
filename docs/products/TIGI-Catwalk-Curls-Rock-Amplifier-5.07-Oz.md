      <li>I have curly hair and love this stuff - i&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years now.</li>
      <li>but the first two give me the look I love</li>
      <li>I actually use it on top of Paul Mitchell hair lotion which is like a liquid</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop my curly hair from doing its thing but it does define my curls nicely without too much &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little - a quarter size - for my thick, past-my-shoulders hair so the bottles last a long time.</li>

    <li> My curls just are not the same without this product thank you..</li>
    <li> Curls Rock Amplifier is the absolute best curl scrunching cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried countless others but they just don&#x27;t work for me. I like my curls to be defined and this does the job. Other creams leave my hair soft and frizzy and I don&#x27;t like that look.  I towel dry my hair then use just a little. Tip: a little goes a long way and if you use to much then it is harder to get off your hands because it feels kind of sticky slimy but it works. I actually use it on top of Paul Mitchell hair lotion which is like a liquid and then I put this cream on top. I know what you must be thinking, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s a lot&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve actually cut back. I used to put mousse over these other two products as well but the first two give me the look I love so I don&#x27;t use the mousse anymore. Added pics of ingredients</li>
    <li> The best product for curly hair</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever used for my fine, curly hair</li>
    <li> Been using it for years to hold my curls. Never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not enough strength for me. I prefer a product that is a stronger hold.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my curly hair look awesome and natural.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair &amp;#34;piece-ier&amp;#34; and holds the curl longer than other products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It is wonderful for holding curl without drying the hair out.  In fact the hair looks healthier with it.  But, it is a bit crunchy when it first dries.  To soften your curls, you can scrunch your hair in your hands.  As the day wears on, it isn&#x27;t crunchy at all and the curls still look great if not better than earlier in the day.  I put a dime size bit on my palm and add water and rub my hands together, then smooth it on to my very curly short hair.  I only recently cut my hair short.  I have had long hair for years.  This is the only product I will use for my very curly hair.  It is wonderful.  Curls rock indeed.</li>
    <li> Best price I have found anywhere. It was delivered within 2 days too.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and love this stuff - i&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years now. I will occasionally add moroccan oil on a humid day. It doesn&#x27;t stop my curly hair from doing its thing but it does define my curls nicely without too much &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little - a quarter size - for my thick, past-my-shoulders hair so the bottles last a long time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have natural curly hair and my beautician says that I should always put a little product in my hair.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, keeps with the curls and It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> an excellent product for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Great product for wavy or curly hair. It really holds the curls. You have to be careful not to apply too much or it will become stiff after drying. I usually comb thru with my hands after applying. Been using this product for years and one bottle lasts a long time so it is fairly economical in the end.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Help shape and define my curls with one easy step! Just work it through from roots to ends, scrunch, and diffuse! Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! brings my natural curls to life...</li>
    <li> I luv this stuff...and this price is amazing!</li>
