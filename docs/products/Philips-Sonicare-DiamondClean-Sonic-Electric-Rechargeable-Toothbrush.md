<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! so cute, worth the money...</li>
    <li> I like it, but there is sth wrong with the charging.</li>
    <li> good color. good quality.</li>
    <li> the color is so nice :p</li>
    <li> This is great toothbrush due to the high price.  I used it for half a year, it is great. Of very high quality</li>
    <li> Purchased this item in Jan. 2015 as the previous Sonicare was quite old but still worked well.  As of three weeks ago I am using this old less expensive model.  This new DiamondClean is great when it will turn on which is now never.  No one else uses this unit.  I am extremely disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thoroughly cleans teeth and always leaves my them feeling brand new and sparkly clean. I love the travel case it comes in and the charging glass is very cool. A bit expensive, but completely worth it. The DiamondClean is a great investment for your oral health!</li>
    <li> This teeth brush is perfect and lovely! It has 5 different modes and easy to charge and use! Easy to bring it when traveling. The only thing is it is actually expensive.</li>
    <li> Omg it is just so pretty， u can also charge it in the cup.Girls gotta to have this pink ！</li>
    <li> The Sonicare DC (Sonicare Diamond Clean) a bit expensive but I decided to try it out because of the additional cleaning features--White, polish, gum-care, and sensitive options.    This model is lighter and sleeker than previous models, and oscillates much faster than my Oral-B Triumph Prof. Care. Since using it my teeth are whiter and my gums are much healthier (this makes my dentist very happy).  You have about three weeks use out of it (brushing 2X/day) before you need to recharge, definitely a plus!    The charging glass is nice but I would have purchased the same toothbrush with a basic charger if it meant the price would be $50-$75 less :-}.    All that said, I am very happy with my new Sonicare DC and would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like ... soooo cute</li>
    <li> best toothbrush in the world, definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> Got the white one for my bf and got the pink one for myself. No complaints. Great product. I&#x27;ve been using Philip Sonicare since 2011 when I started having braces. My teeth are clean and my gum is healthier day by day since I started using Sonicare. This is an upgrade from the previous version I had. Even the previous one still working perfectly, but DiamondClean is prettier and easy to charge. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. It really makes my teeth feel like they were polished!</li>
    <li> The Sonic I had for years just would not wear out, although through he years I did purchase new heads.  But when I saw this &#x27;beauty&#x27;, I was ready to trade in my old favorite brush for this new, more feminine looking version.  The color does not affect the performance, of course, but I could not resist.  The Sonic brush is always on the cuttingnedge of this kind of technology and is superior to other brands.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> the most glamorous toothbrush extant within the confines of even wildest imagination has been brought to us. everyone can relax now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i own &amp; love this toothbrush. if you&#x27;re thinking maybe maybe maybe, i encourage you to spare yourself any further debate &amp; just buy with one-click.</li>
    <li> Light pink.  Works beautifully.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Mom and she likes it I have the Black one</li>
    <li> I just want to ask why I have two same toothbrush head? I saw the video it should be one is smaller! Does anyone have same with me?</li>
    <li> We have had the previous Sonicare toothbrushes and been very pleased, &amp;#34;DiamondClean&amp;#34;, is truly reason to up-grade.</li>
    <li> Prettiest toothbrush restyled for looks and function. Nice to have heavy glass tumbler and travel case.</li>
    <li> very useful!! like it</li>
    <li> I bought one last year for myself and I love it.  When I went for a check up recently and my dentist told me he was amazed at how my gum health had improved since last year, I immediately bought one for my wife and one for my daughter.  This thing really works.</li>
    <li> very nice toothbrush and beautiful design!</li>
    <li> Lovely!! The best tooth brush I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and different functions do work in different ways. It also will give your whiter teeth after using several weeks! Easy to charge and easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> Has 6 settings. Great toothbrush. Brushes gums also. Also for different gum states. Does great job.</li>
    <li> This is the best electronic tooth brush on the market so far. My dentist recommended this product to me and I have been using it for almost 2 years. I lost the previous white one in a hotel, so I replace it with this pink version. It is as awesome as always.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to use sonicare! Love it so much!</li>
    <li> Good feeling when brushing teeth!</li>
    <li> I only used for like three month, but it start to have some connection problem with the Tooth head and the body itself.</li>
    <li> Wow! I just received this and my teeth have never felt so clean.  Mine didn&#x27;t come with heads as it should&#x27;ve so I hajacked one of my husbands.  I called sonic care to let them know and they are sending me 4 heads at no charge! Great customer service!</li>
    <li> It is definitely useful! I used it 2 weeks using the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; programe and my teeth become whiter than before! Beautiful and useful! It worth the price!</li>
    <li> I liked that my previous Flexcare+ Sonicare tootbrush had a sanitizer and the modes were easier to change. I like it, but miss the feature of my Flexcare+, to bad it finally died.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money spent. I had wanted this since the first time I saw it. I didn&#x27;t know it was made in pink. So I jumped on it when I saw it in pink. Very pretty and sleek and powerful.  Multiple settings for cleaning your teeth and gums.  Perfect little glass cup that it charges in and doubles as a glass to rince your mouth with. Carry case is neet as well. I wish it came with a cover for the too the brush. I feel it&#x27;s exposed and I want to cover it. Otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular toothbrush .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing , the color , how does it clean .&lt;br /&gt;now I need to buy  Water Flosser too</li>
    <li> Not use yet, but design is very good</li>
    <li> I like this very much. I hope it will serve me</li>
    <li> This toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling like I just visited the dentist for my regular cleaning. I really like the variable options.</li>
    <li> Works well except head is so small I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are getting cleaner than a manual brush.</li>
    <li> Had my sonicare diamond pink for 4 months.now all it does is whine. Brush doesn&#x27;t move. The price is way too high for this worthless brush . My old sonicare is 6 yrs old and still works fine. I wanted a new model..Don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
    <li> Love the color and the no drip, no build up glass container. Feels luxurious to use, great design too.</li>
    <li> So far it does job very well. The battery lasts for a long time which is nice.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it</li>
    <li> Love this beautiful pink toothbrush and travel case.  Works quite well.</li>
    <li> Never had a Tooth Brush like it. You just provide your mouth and it does all the rest!  A booklet is provided to tell you all it does and I am only half way through it.  What fun!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush!  It&#x27;s name speaks for itself!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is worth every penny! I used an electric toothbrush years ago and never really liked it. I eventually went back to using just a standard low-tech toothbrush but ended up getting my first cavity recently and decided I needed to amp up my dental routine. So I purchased this about a month ago and love it! My teeth feel ten times cleaner, the charger is so convenient, and the pink is adorable. It&#x27;s definitely pricey but I thought it was worth it to have good teeth for life. I figured it will hopefully cost me less in the long run (no mouth problems).  I use the sensitive, gum care, and clean settings primarily. It&#x27;s a little awkward to change the setting in your mouth but it&#x27;s convenient that the toothbrush saves the one you used last. So if you regularly use the sensitive setting you don&#x27;t have to scroll every time to the bottom - the toothbrush will automatically go to that one when you turn it on.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the charging cup getting dirty, as some reviewers were worried about, but I also rinse the toothbrush after every time I use it and dry it off. It looks nice on my counter-top and even when the cup is on the charging base it doesn&#x27;t look bad. They did a great job with the design of everything.  Since it doesn&#x27;t show it in any of the pictures - the charging base is basically an extension of the silver bottom part of the cup. So the cup looks a little taller when resting on it and has a white cord coming out. Obviously it looks sleeker and cleaner without the bottom so I use it maybe once a week to keep it charged. The toothbrush is never out of battery after only a week but it&#x27;s just easier for me to keep track of when I last charged it by doing it every Friday night.  The carry case is actually more compact that I expected as well so if you were really gung-ho about travelling with it you definitely could.  The pink is such a cute color and is true to what my monitor shows. I actually loved this toothbrush so much that my boyfriend bought the black and green one and now we just keep our own toothbrush head at each other&#x27;s house to use.</li>
    <li> best electronic toothbrush i have ever used</li>
    <li> brush is great, replacement heads are expensive!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny! I used an older model Sonicare for years, my hygienist has been recommending the DiamondClean and I wish I had listened and upgraded sooner.  This thing is incredible. No downside for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; from flexcare. I tried the diamond clean out a few times and maybe I was just too used to my flexcare. I couldn&#x27;t get used to it.  With my flex care I can turn it off right away with the diamond clean you have to flip through each speed. I didn&#x27;t like the glass cup charger because it seems very vulnerable to falling . That&#x27;s how I broke my flex care by dropping it/ fell off the counter.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned -- and the most expensive.  It does a fantastic job in cleaning my teeth though.  I saw a great improvement only just a week of using it.  I coincidentally had a dentist appointment a week after I purchased it, and the dentist was impressed with how clean my teeth were and that my gums were healthy.  With my old Oral B toothbrush, my dentist would have still been spending a long time scraping off plaque.  This visit was fairly short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is how noisy it is.  I usually brush my teeth in the next room while getting ready for work in the morning because the first time I used it I woke up my husband.  Still, worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love my new pink Philips Sonicare toothbrush!  It works great and has a beautiful glass, disguised as a charging station.  Such a great idea!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for my parents as gifts. The toothbrush itself is pretty good and workds well. However, one of these does not have a charging base inside the box. I am very disappointed about this and I hope amazon can help me to solve this issue.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  It gets my teeth as clean as after a professional cleaning.  I like the different settings.  The battery life is good and have the case to charge it is wonderful.  My only complaint is that the brush head doesn&#x27;t fit in the travel case when the brush protector is on the brush.</li>
    <li> Great product to have</li>
    <li> By far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Beats all my manual, electric, and waterpik.  My teeth have never felt so clean.  The travel case makes this brush the only portable electric toothbrush I can actually bring away with me.  Although the travel case has a USB connection for you charge with your laptop, I haven&#x27;t needed to use it because the charge lasts so long.</li>
    <li> a little pricy, u could choose other types of Sonicare with much cheaper price, but this one comes with a full package: a USB charged case, a glass, and more programmed options such as whitening and gum care etc.</li>
    <li> The appearance is so attractive. It works well.</li>
    <li> crazy love it!!! and the baby pink color!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this color. It really looks very cute.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush, feels like you just left the dentist.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush. Makes a difference on cleaning on your teeth as well as brightening!!!</li>
    <li> great sonicare toothbrush! it can be very gentle and strong. all you have to do is click the button. i use the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; mostly. i love the brush head very much. but haven&#x27;t use the glass cup yet. keep using and keep updates!</li>
    <li> Love it. Haven&#x27;t used all of the different settings, but this is a fabulous product. Has made such a difference at my dentist visits with receding gums.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s a great toothbrush, convenient to use. The color of this one is very cute but also makes the charging indicator hard to see. The battery of mine also seems to have minor problem. At first, it works fine but I am never able to use it for three weeks on a single charge. I have been using it for a month now and the battery use up very fast, I charge it once and can only use for like four days.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t include the small charging station.  Otherwise is fine.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.  The glass cup looks nice in the bathroom and it is easily cleaned.  Battery life is great only have to charge it maybe once a week and that is using it 3 times a day.  Used the travel case on 3 week vacation and it was amazing.  You just plug in the case and plop your toothbrush in there and it charges.....however it does it....no connectors to the toothbrush itself. Only thing I would change to the travel set is somewhere to store your wire wall plug in the case...but this suggestion does not detract from the purchase of this product at all. My previous toothbrush was an older model of Soniccare and at my last dentist appt. my late 40&#x27;s gums were in even better shape with this model.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush is fine. My wife likes pink color. Charging glass is the most ridiculous idea I have ever seen. You put the toothbrush in the glass to charge. It sort of just lays there. Looks weird and sloppy on the vanity. Fortunately glass hasnt broken yet, despite it being  easy to tip over. The glass itself gets all nasty looking as well. Its reall a terrible terrible charger design. Much prefer simple , small, light, unbreakable plastic on my other sonicare. Travel case is likewise too bulky. Toothbrush is heavy, and there is no waY I am hauling the heavy brush and big carrying case on a trip. Just bring regular brush. In short, brush is great. Accessories are just awful.</li>
    <li> OK it&#x27;s my own fault, I bought it mostly for the color. And the color is not as depicted. It is very very pale, barely pink.</li>
    <li> the gum health setting definitely makes the mouth buzz</li>
    <li> I Love this tooth brush!!!! I will never use anything different from now on!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  Easty to use and my teeth feel really clean after.</li>
    <li> shipping is very quickly l, pink looks very pretty.</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! Gray customers service</li>
    <li> Both of the heads don&#x27;t fit on the handle!</li>
    <li> Initially liked it but now my teeth are very sensitive which wasn&#x27;t the case before. Will consult with my dentist. There&#x27;s no way to decrease the intensity even though there are different settings (I can&#x27;t tell the difference between them). Also there are no separate buttons for the various settings. You have to put your toothpaste on, put the brush in your mouth and click through until you reach the one you want. Best to memorize which click is the setting you trying to get to. Now my husband has a very nice pink toothbrush since its been too long to return. I&#x27;ll never spend this much again on a toothbrush. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really love this toothbrush. The only issue I&#x27;m having with it is the charger either doesn&#x27;t work or breaks shortly after use. I&#x27;ve had two toothbrushes replaced because this stupid glass charger won&#x27;t charge the brush. The travel charger works great. At this point I&#x27;m just going to use that. But what a stupid idea for a charger. Just make something that works. Had I know this, I would have gotten a different toothbrush with a more convenient charging base.</li>
    <li> The charger glass stopped charging after 3 moths only! Very disappointed and cannot return it.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. I really bought it for the color, but it works great. My teeth feel like I just had a professional cleaning. Battery life is good. Took on a 2 week trip and didn&#x27;t need to recharge.</li>
    <li> although it is not cheap, it is a good one to use</li>
    <li> Awesome products! Clean the teeth very well</li>
    <li> Wow what an upgrade! Defiantly worth the splurge! My whole family is interested in upgrading to the diamond clean tooth brush.</li>
    <li> A+ service and product !</li>
    <li> Goods is very good! Easy to full is very poor!</li>
    <li> excellent toothbrush，and pretty</li>
    <li> Love everything about this toothbrush: sleek look, convenient size, multiple settings, and more. Unfortunately I bought it from a 3rd party seller and it did not come with the traveling USB case, but I already have an order for another one because I loved it so much already just from only just 1 use.</li>
    <li> I item is pretty good and I wanna give 4 star. however once I buy it  the price goes down. could i got the price adjustment and $10 credit back? Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works fine. But still too expensive. Not sure why this model price is that much more than others.</li>
    <li> ok people be careful with the color&lt;br /&gt;I bought the pink set and the white set for my family and the conclusion is dont by the pink set&lt;br /&gt;here is why: the pink brush&#x27;s charge indicator (the battery shaped light) is very faint on the pink background. you need to be very very carefully observing in order to catch the light.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush! Love it since day one</li>
    <li> Very nice shopping experience, will come back and buy the black one...</li>
    <li> OMG what an awesome toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had sonicare in the past and was replacing one that finally died.  The cost was more then I wanted to pay but you get what you pay for I guess. I find once you are familiar with the Settings with the one button ( which I think is great ) then you can get what you want at that time for making your mouth feel like a million bucks. I got the pink one and I am going on bout 4 weeks with the initial charge. I&#x27;ve been toting it around in my over night bags a lot and the case keeps it clean and in perfect condition. The only thing I have not used at all ( still wrapped in plastic ) is the glass charger. But it&#x27;s a neat idea but don&#x27;t think I would use it to rinse my mouth after brushing. Oh ya mine is not made in the USA and that was very disappointing:( the whole reason I bought sonicare years ago was because it was made in the USA..hey Phillips put our people here to work, we need the jobs here..</li>
    <li> It was delivered with the original package worn out. Feels like it was a returned item.</li>
    <li> great. I have bought 2.</li>
    <li> I had been resisting these little Sonicares for years and years. Then I got my third cavity in a year. I want to make it clear that I take excellent care of my teeth and have virtually no plaque when I go in for my regular cleanings. Sometimes genetics just sucks.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after the last cavity I broke down and ordered this toothbrush as a birthday present for me.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have bought one years ago. Every brushing makes my teeth feel like I have just had a dental cleaning. It is a little weird to get used to. It sort of tickles, and if you aren&#x27;t careful you spray toothpaste all over the place, but oh my, it is so worth the mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other nice features: It has inductive charging which is very cool, and comes with a convenient charging travel case. If I had room in my bathroom I would leave the charger out since it comes with a nice cup and base charger too. Luckily, the battery is supposed to last three weeks so I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it up every night. It has many settings and a 2-minute timer with little cues that tell you when to move to the next part of your mouth. But I&#x27;m not going to lie, the thing that finally convinced me was that it came in pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been considering a Sonicare, buy one now. It is absolutely worth every penny. I also can justify it by the fact that if I don&#x27;t get three more cavities this year, then it has paid for itself, since fillings aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> I had to wait for the pink version to come out, just because it looks fabulous! I am so glad I slapped down the bucks for this. I love love love how my teeth feel when I am finished. The brush looks and feels small but does an amazing job. I have not yet had it for 14 days, but apparently it starts out with a calmer vibrations and gradually works up to &amp;#34;full buzz&amp;#34; after 14 uses. It&#x27;s sleek. I love the ease of recharging in a cup. I am completely happy with my new toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I had used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years, but when my last one gave out, my dentist recommended the Sonicare. It takes some getting used to, but I love that it comes with a nice glass charger and carrying case. This is a great toothbrush, and the PINK is a HUGE PLUS!</li>
    <li> Excellent, my girl fren likes it a lot</li>
    <li> There is a scratch on the base face of the toothbrush. Seems it does not affect the normal function, so no need to exchange.</li>
    <li> it is so cute and useful</li>
    <li> On par with my old brush from Sonicare, but not worth the price tag for mediocre performance.</li>
    <li> Very nice toothbrush. Very cute look. The price was competitive.</li>
    <li> Good teeth treatment, battery works for around 10 days</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so beautiful. My girlfriend love it so much</li>
    <li> My mouth feels more fresh using this toothbrush than it ever did by brushing manually.  Now I have that just left the dentist clean feel.  I love the pink also.</li>
    <li> Looks awesome. Cleans superbly. Polishes beautifully. Whitens to perfection. But and it&#x27;s two big buts,  my dentist told me a non electric  toothbrush is generally  better for most people. This came two days after it arrived as a replacement  I purchased because the battery only lasts about a year and my first had just died. My wife had exactly same problem in that hers died after one year also. So I look forward  to 11 months more brushing with it. But this time,  knowing what I do about the battery and the harm electric  toothbrushes can do,  I won&#x27;t be replacing it.</li>
    <li> Best of the best! Highly recommend for everyone! Great investment, very expensive but totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works great and it came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Simply amazing!!! Have had it for almost 3 weeks and my teeth literally have never felt so clean! It has gotten rid of plaque in my bottom teeth and even revealed some plaque I didn&#x27;t know I had from some back molars ! Worth every penny!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if anything changes but strongly doubt it since I love it !!&lt;br /&gt;Also, slightly whiter since they are always clean :)</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife, she loves it!</li>
    <li> Missing a thing，I did see where has the lid of charging base, but the most thing that makes me feel terrible is toothbrush low-end has obvious scratch, This is a damaged products, I don&#x27;t think this is a qualified product. However，I really don&#x27;t want to wait for the return and delivery. Is a waste of time.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great teeth are clean, clean clean!</li>
    <li> I received a broken toothbrush! You can look it at http://bit.ly/BadPhilipsToothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The Out-packaging is good, toothbrush packaging is also good, but the bottom of the toothbrush is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to fix this problem. I&#x27;m in China, I don&#x27;t want return it to US-Amazon. This broken toothbrush works, but I hate Its  broken bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact me:mithvv#gmail.com</li>
    <li> The price of this toothbrush is probably more than you want to spend but it is worth the money.  My old Sonicare needed to be replaced so I decided to get the new one.  This one offers you a choice of several setting which is nice.  Your teeth will feel clean and look so white with this one.  Also the glass charging base is pretty cool and I like the pink color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush June 27 it is now August 5 and it just stopped working! Doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll be able to return it either so $200 down the drain!</li>
    <li> Had dreamed it for a not short time and finally purchased it. It deserves the price. Beautiful, elegant, effective and convenient.</li>
    <li> im a 5 years oral B user, and after some considerations we decide to give a try on the sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;in general, sonicare has better battery, slick design, also a very nice looking charge station and good travel case as well. all of those Oral B cannot offer.&lt;br /&gt;but brush head will cost more, and if you want to share it with your family members, it will be painful to find a place to put brush head. and you may not feels comfortable as oral B, especially when your tooth is touching the plastic body of the head. Oral B only the brush is vibration, sonicare&#x27;s whole brush head will vibrate. But after some time, we are getting use to it. i took one star off because of those.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the cleaning experience, all of them does good job. and sonicare were less likely to cause your gum bleeding. but it depends, different ppl may experience different thing.&lt;br /&gt;Also worth mentioning is the battery, we have suffer a big problem with the oral B&#x27;s battery life. at the begining, 2 weeks, 1 yrs later, 2-3 days at most. and their newer model does not support the 220V. very bad for the travelers. sonicare has a way better battery, at least from all other reviews.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel super clean, like after getting them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this.  Dentist recommended - charges in the glass so stays cleaner then other electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I love it really makes my teeth feel clean</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> beautiful and love it a lot</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothbrush!  Such a great investment in my oral hygiene.  The pink is lighter than I thought it would be....very pastel.  The USB charger is great for travel as well as the case.  Keeps my toothbrush protected and clean.  Also the cup keeps my bathroom counter organized while charging the tooth brush.  A fully charged brush also lasts several days.</li>
    <li> very good!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for the best of sonicare!</li>
    <li> I have used the sonicare line of electric toothbrushes for years. I finally upgraded to the newest model and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Gone is the gunk buildup in the older versions. I really love the clean lines, the timer that helps to brush correctly, and I think the glass as s charger is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel clean after brushing with this device.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned three different Sonicare toothbrush sets in the last 10 years. This set it by far my absolute favorite and I believe it received high accolades for best design. With each one I&#x27;ve purchased, the user experience just keeps improving. Keep up the great work, Philips!</li>
    <li> The absolute best electric toothbrush. The only problem (which I figured out) is how to get it to stand upright in the charger.</li>
    <li> My teeth are clean and my mouth feels amazing.  I LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this product very much, although it is a little expensive. After using it, my teeth become white than before. And it&#x27;s very easy to use. The time-reminder can let you know what should be done next. And... the pink color is very girlish and bright, I love it!</li>
    <li> I previously bought a different model that didn&#x27;t hold up.  This model is much &amp;#34;sturdier&amp;#34; and worth the price,</li>
    <li> love the design! impressive!</li>
    <li> OMG we love this toothbrush!!! I have had several high-end rechargeable toothbrushes in the last 15 years but this one cleans so fast and so thorough... It shipped so quickly and I am very happy to own this brush. The handle feels really nice in your hand and the programs do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great shipping experience. I&#x27;m so happy buy it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as her older Sonicare Flexcare broke after about 5 years of use.  She loves the pink color.  The charging cup and traveling case are a nice touch.  The traveling case is nice for &amp;#34;germ-a-phobes&amp;#34; since you can charge it without having to take it out when traveling. She claims this cleans her teeth much better than her older Sonicare Flexcare did.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush.  I have purchased 3 different Sonicare toothbrushes and this is my favorite.  There are several options for charging it, the color is exactly as described, as well as, the handle has a silicone type texture which is neat.  AND, the most important thing is it is awesome at cleaning my teeth.  I&#x27;m kind of OCD when it comes to my teeth especially since I have braces right now.  Absolutely, love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Christmas gifts this year. It works great, my mouth is super clean and its really pretty!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as my $40 Philips.</li>
    <li> Great sonicare toothbrush. Works way better than the earlier model I owned. Love the smaller handle and charging system with this model.</li>
    <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t felt cleaner!  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Delivered in 2 weeks since there was no sth when I placed an order. Highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Beautifu appearance, amazing function.</li>
    <li> Love the results but wow, it&#x27;s so loud.</li>
    <li> Gift for GF, she loves it.</li>
    <li> my wife love it very much!</li>
    <li> I just got my package today and im so happy and excited to try it. It comes two stander brush head but they are not working properly! It pop out right the way when i trun it on!!!! So disappoint it cuz I paid for that much money but I can&#x27;t even use is! And now i have to pay the shipping to send it back!</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife. She now has a new favorite toy.</li>
    <li> So so so cute!Love it so much</li>
    <li> I think this is the lowest price you can get with this color! It takes 15 bucks off when you place the order.</li>
    <li> Nice seller and product</li>
    <li> I upgraded from my E series sonicare to this brush. I absolutely love it. The previous brush I had was hollow under the head and got this nasty gunk build up I had to clean frequently. The diamond care doesn&#x27;t have a place for the yucky mildew to collect. It is sleek, quiet, and makes my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned every time. I really believe in sonicare and tell everyone I can that I do. My dentist feels the same. It shakes off the plaque, but is still gently on my gums. Awesome product. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> very good using experience</li>
    <li> It sits at an angle in the glass jar to charge. Looks very messy on the bathroom counter top. Bad engineering. if you&#x27;re buying it because you like things to be aesthetically pleasing don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really beautiful and easy to use</li>
    <li> The white one&#x27;s brush heads is not same as picture</li>
    <li> it is gentle and effective</li>
    <li> There are two brush heads in the package I received. The first one worked fine, but the second one is a total disappointment. The noise is tremendous and unbearable with the second brush head. I checked the rechargeable body with the first brush head right after the second one produced the terrible noise. It is just disappointing that the quality of this expensive toothbrush set is not consistent.</li>
    <li> it will clean your filthy mouth very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product, great performance, I love my new Soniccare Diamond Clean rechargeable toothbrush, I recommend this product to everyone...</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the price!!  I have sensitive gums and it made them recede more.  I&#x27;m going back to my $50 toothbrush.  Anyone want to buy mine for 1/2 the price?</li>
    <li> very like it! so fancy!</li>
    <li> Buy the black one to my boyfriend</li>
    <li> Quiet enough, does a great job of brushing.  Wouldn&#x27;t do without sonicare.  Nice sized handle, smaller than the sonicare I replaced.  An improvement over the older models.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush itself worked great but within three days the glass got knocked off the shelf it was on and broke into a million pieces!!!  Not a good thing in a bathroom.  This needs to be addressed so that it does not break like that on a tile floor!!  Obviously it is going to get knocked over!!!</li>
    <li> cute color，no more blood while brushing teeth</li>
    <li> clean my tooth well,easy use</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it has already broken down. The battery seems to have an issue.</li>
    <li> Very good item, so fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. You will notice a difference in the feel of your teeth immediately. If you haven&#x27;t used a sonic toothbrush, need to start slow - but your gums and teeth will quickly adapt.</li>
    <li> Happy wife Happy life</li>
    <li> I use it everyday! Now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Very good. I will buy it again for my family</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush EVER...can feel the difference immediately!</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter and she loved it!! great texture and design of this toothbrush and the cup looked pretty cool!! now my daughter is using it everyday with the cup and I think I&#x27;ll buy one myself soon.</li>
    <li> I know this Electric Toothbrush is very popular, but its quality is really bad. I bought this for 4 months, and now its broken down. BTW, I can&#x27;t return this cause If I want to return this item, it must be within 1 month. Think carefully when you want to buy this toothbrush. It&#x27;s just look good.</li>
    <li> Everything is good, but just a little bit pricy.</li>
    <li> My dentist had recommended this toothbrush to me and even gave me a coupon on my semi-annual visit.  I looked into getting one until I saw the price, Yikes, very pricey!  Finally, I took the plunge and purchased it and it is worth every penny spent.  The lovely feeling of clean teeth I get right after seeing the dental hygienist is a daily reality with this toothbrush.  It also claims to help with gums, I won&#x27;t really know about that until my next dental checkup.  I also love/hate the automatic timer on the toothbrush that turns it off after 2 minutes, guess I had become a little bit of a slacker on how long I actually brushed my teeth, this keeps you honest.</li>
    <li> Have to say the U. S. Amazon&#x27;s service quality is too high! The toothbrush is much cheaper than in stores sell, is also very good, very beautiful pink！</li>
    <li> REALLY FAST AND USEFUL!</li>
    <li> Love it to death... Feels very luxury!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had! The head is small enough to really get my back teeth clean. I also love that this has a sensitive setting on it.</li>
    <li> This is my first sonicare purchase and I love, love, love this toothbrush!!! Holds a charge well. Easy to travel with. My teeth feel amazing. Can&#x27;t wait for the dental hygentist to notice the difference at my next dental appointment.</li>
    <li> Best tooth burst ever! And it&#x27;s pretty. my boyfriend needs to get his own and stop using mine!</li>
    <li> Cleared up my sore gums in one month.  Beware, I&#x27;ve heard the charging glass can&#x27;t be replaced without buying a new toothbrush and it&#x27;s pretty spendy.  I would give it five stars if I could buy a new charging base, my puppy already chipped mine.</li>
    <li> Really love this pink one. It deserved.</li>
</ol>
