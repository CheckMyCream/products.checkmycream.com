      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are people who can manage well with this style, I&#x27;m just not one of them.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging too.</li>
      <li>This should be selling for a buck in a Dollar Store at most.</li>
      <li>The price is great for such good quality.</li>
      <li>great sturdy tweezer, fast service and delivery ,accurate description</li>
      <li>This pair doesn&#x27;t grab as easily and if by chance you&#x27;re trying to remove a splinter, you may as well give up.  </li>
      <li>These tweezers are so cheap.  </li>
      <li>Really cheaply made..</li>
      <li>these are my new favorite tweezers!</li>
      <li>Nothing special</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe Revlon would discontinue such a good product and put an inferior on in its place.  </li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised and pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Notably the edges of the part that touches the skin is rough and catches more than a hair.  </li>
      <li>similar one that I found to my favorite tweezers that needed to be replaced.</li>
      <li>The tool snips more regularly than it would grip.</li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t pick up small hairs effectively.</li>
      <li>Liked my old one a little better as it was slightly thinner, and seemed to be made of a little better metal, but this does the job.</li>
      <li>Scissor section is a bit small for most human hands, but is adequate...</li>
      <li>At my local Walgreens, this was the only tweezer available in this style.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to look for a style like the old one I had.  </li>
      <li>Compared to the original Revlon brand Twissors this is a shoddy product.  </li>
      <li>I previously had a similar product, where the tip was a little more rounded, but they don&#x27;t seem to make those anymore.  </li>
      <li>The piece above the handle joint is a different shape than my old one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are as described, and are serving my purpose. I previously had a similar product, where the tip was a little more rounded, but they don&#x27;t seem to make those anymore.  This was the &amp;#34;next best&amp;#34; similar one that I found to my favorite tweezers that needed to be replaced.</li>
    <li> great sturdy tweezer, fast service and delivery ,accurate description</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made in China.  Ergonomically poor design.  Poorly matched &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; on the tweezer part that grabs. This should be selling for a buck in a Dollar Store at most.</li>
    <li> This is my newest Revlon tweezer. I have eight tweezers, all are Revlon products. I have used Revlon products for many, many years. When I see new products by Revlon, I always buy them and I have yet to be disappointed. This is no exception. The slanted tip makes plucking easier. Really, treat yourself to this Revlon twizzer. I am sure you will be pleased with the tweezer. And will come back and check other Revlon products.</li>
    <li> Compared to the original Revlon brand Twissors this is a shoddy product.  Notably the edges of the part that touches the skin is rough and catches more than a hair.  Deeply disappointed, as the original was excellent.  Would have lasted forever, but lost them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this. The tip is to bulky.... Doesn&#x27;t pick up small hairs effectively.</li>
    <li> Easy tweezy!  Nothing special but it does the trick and for a good price!</li>
    <li> Two problems: (1) The blades don&#x27;t line up. (2) &amp;#34;This item is ineligible for return.&amp;#34; So...I will be throwing this item in the garbage.</li>
    <li> not much to say about it.</li>
    <li> These are great! Ever since I began shaping my eyebrows as a preteen, my grandmother had bought me my first pair, which were these. I&#x27;ve also tried other designs, but I&#x27;ve Always come back to these. Great, stead you, firm grip on each tiny eyebrow hair, even if your blonde and have those tiny blonde hairs between your eyes, above your nose!! Some people don&#x27;t see that, but I do. I take my 20X Handheld, lighted mirror, and I am so happy with my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I love them, very easy to use. Great quality. Totally washable. Have ridges as grips, which is an amazing feature. I love the packaging too. The price is great for such good quality.</li>
    <li> The tool snips more regularly than it would grip.</li>
    <li> Works well. Angle is good. Liked my old one a little better as it was slightly thinner, and seemed to be made of a little better metal, but this does the job.</li>
    <li> It is a useful product, but the tips are not good finished and I can use it. The tip have to be very good finish to avoid to harm the skin</li>
    <li> this model does NOT work like the previous design of this pair</li>
    <li> Not what is pictured. The one I got was a completely different product. Be careful.</li>
    <li> Scissor section is a bit small for most human hands, but is adequate...</li>
    <li> great product. happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> These work really well</li>
    <li> item received was not what is pictured.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are so cheap.  I can&#x27;t even tell if they are metal, and not just plastic.  The ends are large and cumbersome.  I would absolutely not buy this again.</li>
    <li> They are not as good as they use to be.....</li>
    <li> Bought these thinking I would give them a try. Pleasantly surprised and pleased with the results. Lightweight and very easy to use...these are my new favorite tweezers!</li>
    <li> This pair of tweezers is not as good as another Revlon style I had a few years ago (which I lost and am sick about).  In fact, they&#x27;re not the ones shown in the picture.  The piece above the handle joint is a different shape than my old one. This pair doesn&#x27;t grab as easily and if by chance you&#x27;re trying to remove a splinter, you may as well give up.  The tip is dull and therefore trying to grasp small eyebrow hairs is almost comical.  At my local Walgreens, this was the only tweezer available in this style.  I can&#x27;t use the Tweezerman style at all so this was the only option.  I could strangle my kids for losing my other pair!  I will continue to look for a style like the old one I had.  I can&#x27;t believe Revlon would discontinue such a good product and put an inferior on in its place.  Frustrating!  I&#x27;m sure there are people who can manage well with this style, I&#x27;m just not one of them.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheep version of a wonderful revlon tweezer I had for many years.  This is very poor quality.  Packaging was sealed but writing had been sliced off.  Perhaps it had previously been opened and resealed.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price but not the best. Its ok</li>
    <li> Really cheaply made..Trying to replace my Revlon look alikes...no contest. They suck!</li>
    <li> Has a sharp edge on it so it hurts your finger when you use them</li>
    <li> They do not deserve even 1 star-cheap and not able to pluck anything</li>
    <li> I like these, they handle better then regular tweezers.</li>
    <li> I returned this because it wasn&#x27;t the same product as on the picture.</li>
