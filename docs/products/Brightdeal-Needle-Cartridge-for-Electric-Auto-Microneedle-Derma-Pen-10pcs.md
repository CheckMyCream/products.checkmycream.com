<ol>
    <li> works as well as the $3000.00 ones. thank you</li>
    <li> Sterile, convenient, and awesome. Love the electric stamp and disposable sterile needles. All my friends are begging me for facials!</li>
    <li> It was very simple to install in the Microroller and I like that it is disposable after it was used.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of product in the past and this item has now been used for 10 facials.  I know because I used all of ONE box of heads.  AND NOW it does NOT have enough speed to even do anything,&lt;br /&gt;There is NO email to contact them and of course it is out of the window to send it back.</li>
    <li> good value would order again thx</li>
    <li> Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;good!!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that all are individually wrapped, that way I just open it before the client. The clicking in made it safe not to sprint out of place.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Nice to be able to get same results at home!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. The replacement needles come in individual sterile packages. Works great with my Highwinwin dermapen. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but need more economic pricing and postage.&lt;br /&gt;I use the cartridges in my skin care business, so need to cut costs&lt;br /&gt;Of supplies when I can.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works well with my skin pen.</li>
    <li> Individually sealed, keeping them sterile which I like.  They are identical to the cartridges I received with my microneedle derma pen.</li>
    <li> I like the needle rollers, but this works so much better without having to worry about bacteria. Just throw the needle away after using it. I am seeing a difference in the scars I have after a couple of uses. I use once a month.</li>
    <li> This is great if you have a pimple.  It gets rid of it fast.  does what is claimed to do...good</li>
    <li> Use at least two of these if not more per session. The needles dull quickly and will latch onto your skin and tear if not careful.</li>
    <li> Nicely built. Good value.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected . Doesn&#x27;t say which machine is compatible with. Picture  is not enough .</li>
