### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I do think maybe the bristles are on the firmer side which is  a consideration as to receding gum line problem so if you have that this might not be the best thing for you or else keep that in mind when you use it.</li>
      <li>Best toothbrush ever for an invigorating and throrough brushing.</li>
      <li>The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Price and products are really awesome.</li>
      <li>These are great toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Great seller, will use again.</li>
      <li>Great idea.</li>
      <li>Works well, good price.</li>
      <li>And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . .</li>
      <li>Good dental checkups.</li>
      <li>My family and I use this product and we are very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Despite this, I still love these brushes!</li>
      <li>vibrating feature is nice.</li>
      <li>nice brush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years and it does a great job getting my teeth that squeaky clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>Besides feeling great, when I first started using these brushes my dental hygienist noticed the difference, although she hasn&#x27;t commented again since.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these things.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for many years.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to find these at Amazon.</li>
      <li>And don&#x27;t use a toothbrush more than a month.</li>
      <li>so I feel confident buying these.  </li>
      <li>I love these things.</li>
      <li>Considering how much electric toothbrushes cost, these are a great alternative.</li>
      <li>But for me, I like this better.  </li>
      <li>My favorite toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I find them much more convenient than the counter top, electric toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t the most cost-effective choice, but they are by far the most comfortable for me, and they do a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
      <li>Overall a very good product to buy online.</li>
      <li>Thanks for good quality..</li>
      <li>Easy to take on trips.</li>
      <li>Love the clean feeling they leave.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, they are much more effective than normal toothbrushes; my teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
      <li>price is great and its one solid TB.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>the battery -based functioning dose not seems to be very useful to me,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Neither of the two toothbrushes worked, even when I took out the original battery and replaced it.</li>
      <li>In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible.</li>
      <li>and it vibrates as you brush to help clean your teeth, and vibrate out the impacted bits of material</li>
      <li>They are only good for a maximum of 6 months, and then you have to throw them out - no replacing the battery, nor the brush head.</li>
      <li>I replace it every time the battery dies which is not enough according to my dentist but good according to my wallet.</li>
      <li>My first one has lasted over 2 months and the battery is still going strong.</li>
      <li>But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
      <li>Single problem is the replacement of the battery (lucky with youtube!!!)</li>
      <li>The Oral B Pulsar appeared to clean my teeth better than the similar battery operated Colgate I had been using.</li>
      <li>so something&#x27;s right about this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money up front, but I am willing to spend a bit more for a more responsible product in the long run, and one that does not cost me some $7 every 6 months.</li>
      <li>I especially like these brushes because they are comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver in your mouth, unlike bulky and awkwardly-shaped rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>They last forever, help make sure you are brushing as well as you should with the added help, and you can replace the battery.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Pulsar Soft Bristle toothbrush offers a big head toothbrush, with excelled flexibility built in to give a great cleaning ability.  </li>
      <li>and my dentist said my gum health has improved since last 6 months check up :)</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars but many (including my family members) like the MUCH more expensive ones better.</li>
      <li>I have used these brushes for about five years and they are the best I have used, including the expensive Oral-B rechargeable handles with the rotating replaceable heads.</li>
      <li>I also love having extra toothbrushes for guest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its a good substitute for a larger and bigger electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;ll have to redo the connection pretty much once a week.</li>
      <li>My shiny teeth and me are super glad I&#x27;m amphibious, because now I can make my teeth twice as white at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The whole thing is a lot more hassle than it&#x27;s worth, and every time you twist the top closed after that to get it to run, it moves the tape a little</li>
      <li>Comfort fit in the hand and really gives you that extra frequency towards your brushing strokes!</li>
      <li>From now on, I will only purchase a toothbrush that allows for cheap bristle replacement, and that is rechargeable or allows for battery replacement.</li>
      <li>expect them to be really medium.</li>
      <li>The movement of the yellow bristles combined with the soft bristles has consistently worked very well and been both reliable and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>While I have a Sonicare toothbrush that has been as good as I expected, I really like the Pulsar and have used the Pulsar toothbrushes for a long time!  </li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush, and I order it because the price is good, and it has become quite difficult to find one locally</li>
      <li>Little things add up, and my loyalty will go to the product that helps me save over time, while still being healthy, and not harming the environment as much.</li>
      <li>I have tried em all, and I am quite particular to these.  </li>
      <li>Oral B purposely makes these toothbrushes with a high mark-up, and so that you cannot replace them.</li>
      <li>They last pretty long, but make sure you get SOFT</li>
      <li>Considering the what I consider excessive costs of rechargeable electric toothbrushes that are not considered disposable, I think this is much better cost wise, I mean how can you justify hundreds of dollars for toothbrushes</li>
      <li>This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied.</li>
      <li>I added them to my Subscribe and Save list and with each new order I am reminded to change my tooth brush, which keeps the brushing process sanitary.</li>
      <li>The battery on the first toothbrush out of the pack is still going 80 days later!  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;are sold as soft-</li>
      <li>And you are supposed to use the soft bristle.  </li>
      <li>Regardless, this my only give you a few more months, because still you cannot replace the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>There is a normal battery inside if you cut the brush open</li>
      <li>As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products.</li>
      <li>The battery generally wears out about the time the bristles wear out.  </li>
      <li>The Pulsar brushes are a bit overpriced and not at ALL durable - mine generally burn out after about 2 months.</li>
      <li>If you really like those other ultrasonic brands which are rechargeable</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is so wasteful, and I am disgusted that the company goes to such lengths to secure profits, rather than the loyalty of its customers with good, affordable products that are not extremely detrimental to the environment.</li>

<li> This is a shame, because the batteries occasionally die prematurely and these are NOT cheap toothbrushes.</li>
<li> the circuit will not be closed and the battery will not engage to turn on the toothbrush.</li>

<li> you might not like this other than for travel.  </li>
<li> I have other electric toothbrushes</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard to find the soft bristle ones at the store because they seem to like stocking the medium, which can be rough on the gums.</li>
<li> Since I prefer softer bristles, I think the vibration helps get the same cleaning effect without using the hard bristles that can damage tooth enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
<li> They come tightly packaged.</li>
<li> These are not as powerful as other sonic brushes, but the other ultrasonics are really annoying to me.  </li>
<li> Received a pair of toothbrushes with dead batteries.</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> I like the brash itself and its cleaning power</li>
<li> some arrive with dead batteries.</li>
<li> Arrived with both toothbrushes&#x27; batteries dead.</li>
<li> What a waste of my money.</li>

    <li> I like this thoothbrush, but you have to buy another every three month.</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes. My first one has lasted over 2 months and the battery is still going strong. No cords, changing batteries, just use till it dies and get another. Great idea.</li>
    <li> This is my goto brush since an year now</li>
    <li> Arrived with both toothbrushes&#x27; batteries dead.</li>

    <li> These are not as powerful as other sonic brushes, but the other ultrasonics are really annoying to me.  This has about 50-75% of the power, not rechargeable and disposable.  If you really like those other ultrasonic brands which are rechargeable you might not like this other than for travel.  But for me, I like this better.  I would give it 5 stars but many (including my family members) like the MUCH more expensive ones better.</li>
    <li> The batteries were dead upon arrival. Now I have to buy toothbrushes again :-(</li>
    <li> As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products. And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . . until the battery dies - - which occurs way before the brush needs to be replaced. You would think, therefore, that Oral B would make the battery user-replaceable. In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible. However, the battery compartment is designed so that it is virtually impossible to remove the battery without bending the metal contacts to the point that the vibration mechanism is rendered inoperable. There is a Youtube that shows how to change the battery using a screwdriver and an Exacto knife but why should it be necessary to jump through hoops just to change a battery???</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a more expensive travel electric toothbrush which I was very disappointed in. (travel sonic). This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied. The only additional thing I wanted was a case to carry it in, which the travel sonic came with, but that one was so ineffective I wouldn&#x27;t carry it no matter how convenient the packaging was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a home electric toothbrush, this might not meet the needs of some. But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
    <li> I have been using a version of this for several years.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and its one solid TB.&lt;br /&gt;I have no issues with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these last week and I gave them 4 stars because although they&lt;br /&gt;are sold as soft- expect them to be really medium. Mine are a bit stiff and I use them carefully.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the only knock. Otherwise they are a steal of a deal.</li>
    <li> Considering how much electric toothbrushes cost, these are a great alternative. This pack will last half a year and costs so little. Love the clean feeling they leave. Will definitely come back again</li>
    <li> I have tried em all, and I am quite particular to these.  And you are supposed to use the soft bristle.  Every dentist always tells me I brush too hard.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than stores..</li>
    <li> Works well, good price.</li>
    <li> I have other electric toothbrushes but they are bulky as to the handle because that&#x27;s where the batteries go.  This one has a thinner handle, easier to hold and works well.  The bristles hold up well.  Considering the what I consider excessive costs of rechargeable electric toothbrushes that are not considered disposable, I think this is much better cost wise, I mean how can you justify hundreds of dollars for toothbrushes - maybe there is something I&#x27;m not aware of with the expensive models but this just seems to be the way to go for me.  I&#x27;d hate like heck to pay $50 or $100 or $150 for toothbrushes and find it didn&#x27;t hold up to wear and/or perform so I feel confident buying these.  I do think maybe the bristles are on the firmer side which is  a consideration as to receding gum line problem so if you have that this might not be the best thing for you or else keep that in mind when you use it.</li>
    <li> Had these brushes before.</li>
    <li> 2 toothbrushes? My shiny teeth and me are super glad I&#x27;m amphibious, because now I can make my teeth twice as white at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re solid toothbrushes though.</li>
    <li> 4.5 rating; will do review after teeth cleaning in September.</li>
    <li> I am seriously considering not ever buying anything from Amazon again. This is the third time within a couple months that I have gotten a messed up product. Neither of the two toothbrushes worked, even when I took out the original battery and replaced it. I am seriously so upset, I wish we could give zero stars. What a waste of my money. Don&#x27;t bother buying this product. Its not going to work. I wish I had taken the other reviewers seriously when they said they got toothbrushes that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  They last pretty long, but make sure you get SOFT so you don&#x27;t damage your teeth.</li>
    <li> These are cheaper than I can find in my local drug stores. They come tightly packaged. I added them to my Subscribe and Save list and with each new order I am reminded to change my tooth brush, which keeps the brushing process sanitary. I also love having extra toothbrushes for guest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating feature is nice. Since I prefer softer bristles, I think the vibration helps get the same cleaning effect without using the hard bristles that can damage tooth enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that grooves in the rubber handle seem to be a magnet for tooth paste.  So unfortunately, to me the handles always looks a little dirty. I am constantly cleaning the handle.</li>
    <li> Bought it kinda on a whim--definitely works like a &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; version of a more expensive electronic toothbrush. Not really sure if my gums are healthier or if my teeth are cleaner--but it works. Not sure if I would purchase again unless it was on sale.</li>
    <li> Oral B purposely makes these toothbrushes with a high mark-up, and so that you cannot replace them. They are only good for a maximum of 6 months, and then you have to throw them out - no replacing the battery, nor the brush head. This is terrible for the environment, and for your wallet. There is a normal battery inside if you cut the brush open (it looks like a Duracell), but Oral B purposely has them designed so that they have a tiny protrusion at the end - meaning that even if you slice your toothbrush open, you can&#x27;t swap the battery with another because when you re-close it, without the tiny bump on the end the circuit will not be closed and the battery will not engage to turn on the toothbrush. There is a video on utube describing how to replace it - you can do it, but you&#x27;ll need to put the battery in backwards to get it to work, and put a tiny piece of tape or something that will help press the battery to the metal tip so it connects. The whole thing is a lot more hassle than it&#x27;s worth, and every time you twist the top closed after that to get it to run, it moves the tape a little so you&#x27;ll have to redo the connection pretty much once a week. Regardless, this my only give you a few more months, because still you cannot replace the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so wasteful, and I am disgusted that the company goes to such lengths to secure profits, rather than the loyalty of its customers with good, affordable products that are not extremely detrimental to the environment. I will never buy an Oral B Pulsar again. From now on, I will only purchase a toothbrush that allows for cheap bristle replacement, and that is rechargeable or allows for battery replacement. I don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money up front, but I am willing to spend a bit more for a more responsible product in the long run, and one that does not cost me some $7 every 6 months. Little things add up, and my loyalty will go to the product that helps me save over time, while still being healthy, and not harming the environment as much. I just don&#x27;t like being scammed as a customer, I find it blatantly disrespectful to design a slightly different battery just to prevent replacements.</li>
    <li> The battery on the first toothbrush out of the pack is still going 80 days later!  and my dentist said my gum health has improved since last 6 months check up :)</li>
    <li> Received a pair of toothbrushes with dead batteries. What a waste of money. Could have had two good non-electric toothbrushes for less than half the price and none of the disappointment.</li>
    <li> While I have a Sonicare toothbrush that has been as good as I expected, I really like the Pulsar and have used the Pulsar toothbrushes for a long time!  The reason I keep coming back to Pulsar and even appreciate it sometimes over my Sonicare is the size of the head, softness of the bristle, and mechanical and vibrating features of the Pulsar product.  So here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsar Soft Bristle toothbrush offers a big head toothbrush, with excelled flexibility built in to give a great cleaning ability.  The movement of the yellow bristles combined with the soft bristles has consistently worked very well and been both reliable and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B Pulsar toothbrush regularly for over a year. The Pulsar brushes are a bit overpriced and not at ALL durable - mine generally burn out after about 2 months. (I think it&#x27;s the electronics that are failing, not the battery.) Nevertheless, they are much more effective than normal toothbrushes; my teeth have never felt so clean! I especially like these brushes because they are comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver in your mouth, unlike bulky and awkwardly-shaped rechargeable toothbrushes. They aren&#x27;t the most cost-effective choice, but they are by far the most comfortable for me, and they do a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> The battery in these sometimes lasts longer than the bristles and other times only for a week.  Designed in a way that battery replacement is not possible.  For the price, performance, and disposability, I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for probably 5+ years now.  Big fan.  Haven&#x27;t found a cavity in a decade so something&#x27;s right about this product.</li>
    <li> the battery -based functioning dose not seems to be very useful to me,&lt;br /&gt;But I like the brash itself and its cleaning power</li>
    <li> some arrive with dead batteries. nearly impossible to change with new battery.</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrushes.  The battery generally wears out about the time the bristles wear out.  I find them much more convenient than the counter top, electric toothbrushes.  Easy to take on trips.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these for several years and like them a lot.  They last quite awhile before the battery dies.</li>
    <li> Price and products are really awesome. Delivery was very instant. Overall a very good product to buy online. Its a good substitute for a larger and bigger electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, and I order it because the price is good, and it has become quite difficult to find one locally</li>
    <li> Once you use this toothbrush you&#x27;ll never use another one again. I even tried the off brand and had to come back to this. The battery lasts as long s the life of the bristles. Comfort fit in the hand and really gives you that extra frequency towards your brushing strokes!</li>
    <li> Thanks for good quality..</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used! And don&#x27;t use a toothbrush more than a month.</li>
    <li> I like the pulsar feature on these toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes for about five years and they are the best I have used, including the expensive Oral-B rechargeable handles with the rotating replaceable heads. Besides feeling great, when I first started using these brushes my dental hygienist noticed the difference, although she hasn&#x27;t commented again since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries inside the Pulsar and cannot be replaced. This is a shame, because the batteries occasionally die prematurely and these are NOT cheap toothbrushes. Despite this, I still love these brushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years and it does a great job getting my teeth that squeaky clean feeling.  I replace it every time the battery dies which is not enough according to my dentist but good according to my wallet.</li>
