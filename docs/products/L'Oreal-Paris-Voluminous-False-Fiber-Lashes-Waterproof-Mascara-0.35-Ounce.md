      <li>What works wonderfully for one probably won&#x27;t work for all.</li>

      <li>This mascara is great for lash building.</li>
      <li>Amazingly, this mascara does almost meet its hype!  </li>
      <li>You have to get this mascara because its literally amazing!</li>
      <li>ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS</li>
      <li>it works really good</li>
      <li>mascara, and L&#x27;oreal had one that worked perfectly years ago, then stopped being available.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>

      <li>:) use it for all the time and doesn&#x27;t run with sweat or tears!</li>
      <li>Love this mascara!  </li>
      <li>Amazon is amazing ...</li>
      <li>Really nice, thickens your lashes really nice.</li>
      <li>the Voluminous mascara comes off nicely with Mary Kay eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>How nice to be able to add it on to an order and not spend 15 minutes trying to find it at the drugstore.</li>

      <li>okay.  </li>

      <li>Really like this mascara great product.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy it though :)</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where the love ends for me though.  </li>
      <li>(I guess I&#x27;m more vain than I realized).  </li>
      <li>For those thinking about purchasing this mascara, I would say read reviews with a grain of salt because as with most beauty products, the results will vary for everyone.</li>
      <li>and I go over it with Makeup Forevers mascara as a top coat.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t let that effect the review since I know there are lots of people on both sides of the mascara wand camp :)</li>
      <li>It does an ok job of lengthening the lashes without clumping up</li>
      <li>Tripled my lashes or more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;this was DEFINITELY worth the purchase!!</li>
      <li>I like the brush, though a bit long it is nicely shaped with a wider bottom that tapers off into a thinner top which is great for getting at those teensy lashes.  </li>
      <li>It gives just the right amount of POP!!</li>
      <li>I cannot believe it, but it&#x27;s true!</li>
      <li>You definitely will need a good eye makeup remover with this one!</li>
      <li>Easy to remove with soap and water or face cloths.</li>
      <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far in a VERY lengthy search.</li>
      <li>And the smudges aren&#x27;t removed easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, stays where you put it.  </li>
      <li>The formula is easy to apply, not clumpy, and the brush is an easy to use shape.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s water proof but washes off fairly easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>The slightly angled brush is wonderful.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT !</li>
      <li>Its not necessary, the Voluminous is AMAZING on its own....</li>
      <li>Its light weight</li>
      <li>when you close it, there&#x27;s a \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve tried thus far that lengthens my lashes.</li>
      <li>I have been trying out some of the more expensive types and been kind of happy with some of the results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds, but I think this stuff is the best.</li>
      <li>lasted through a professional dye job (read &#x27;trip to the salon&#x27;), a good night&#x27;s sleep (blushing!), &amp; another day (bigger blush!!)</li>
      <li>I have found my new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and really thickens and lengthens my lashes.</li>
      <li>last all day but kind of dries out too quickly</li>
      <li>So far this is my favorite mascara ever.</li>
      <li>I have enough darkness &amp; puffiness all on my own, thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Nice long lashes, and not too clumpy</li>
      <li>The tube itself is pretty lengthy, but I do like that</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I wish I had bought it at my local drugstore where I could have easily returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it certainly wasn&#x27;t me or anyone with oily lids!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m VERY</li>
      <li>You can add as much length &amp; thickness as you want.</li>
      <li>why do I like this stuff so much?</li>
      <li>But I really wanted to try it</li>
      <li>and I really like it,</li>
      <li>I have to really scrub to get them off and end up removing patches of eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make your lashes look longer or fuller.  </li>
      <li>Its the same stuff you get in the stores, right at your door!</li>
      <li>However, it does need occasional reapplication, maybe once midday, to maintain the full lengthening effect.</li>
      <li>every mascara I&#x27;ve tried clumps, more or less.</li>
      <li>Great mascara but very hard to remove!</li>
      <li>but it does tend to smear under my eyes a little more than I like.  </li>
      <li>The first couple times I used this it was nice, but it gets very clumpy and looks fake.</li>
      <li>but I thought the idea of making my lashes more voluminous and making them look like false lashes would be really pretty.</li>
      <li>While I love this  brand and type of mascara when bought in a bricks and mortar store, I experience the one bought here as less than satisfactory and totally different in texture ....</li>
      <li>I will probably keep using in spite of the slight irritation because it&#x27;s one of the few mascaras I&#x27;ve found that gets a good score from ewg.org and last more than a few hours on my oily skin</li>
      <li>if I want it, and also a straight no gimmicks wand, this is close enough for now.</li>
      <li>Overall, I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>It does flake a tiny bit, but not anything really noticeable.  </li>
      <li>This particular item took multiple applications to apply.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing - thick, long eyelashes!  </li>
      <li>I bought black and it requires 3-4 coats for the length and volume I&#x27;m used to getting from other (better) mascaras (Mally, Tarte).  </li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s waterproof, I had no trouble removing it with just my facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>The formula is dry, even on my first application it was dry and flaked all over my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>As good as some expensive mascaras that don&#x27;t last nearly as long.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re little black fibers that you brush onto wet mascara, then seal with more mascara.</li>
      <li>And that was BEFORE my little helper Ready To Wear Lash Extensions.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It feels very heavy and your lashes feel like the stick together every once in a while when you blink. I did try it a few times before I posted this! It wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as it was advertised to be. Works well if you add another coat of some other brand that plumps, but it still makes your lashes catch on one another when you blink.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased this mascara for about a year now, and it is one of my all-time favorites. The formula is easy to apply, not clumpy, and the brush is an easy to use shape. It adds length to lashes with just a little bit of volume. It is never flaky and the waterproof version doesn&#x27;t rub off under my eyes during the day. However, it does need occasional reapplication, maybe once midday, to maintain the full lengthening effect. Ultimately, I swear by this mascara!</li>
    <li> A couple of swipes and you&#x27;re done.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Love this.  My lashes look great!</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like this mascara.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by that Gwen Stefani commercial. This mascara is terrible. Streaky, clumpy, stubborn and ineffective. I went back to using the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend knockoff of Blinc mascara, which I would give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> its usually hard for me to find a mascara that makes my eyelashes long without making them look clumpy at the same time but this mascara takes the cake! it works really good and it doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes look clumpy and smudgy at all. Its light weight and it makes your eyes pop. You have to get this mascara because its literally amazing!</li>
    <li> Amazingly, this mascara does almost meet its hype!  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve used that actually seems to lengthen my pale, little, short lashes!  :)</li>
    <li> I read (and watched) a lot of reviews for the regular, non-waterproof version of this mascara and was hesitant about purchasing either one because most of the reviews claimed that the regular version was either mediocre or not very good at all. But I really wanted to try it so I went ahead and purchased this waterproof version instead. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have relatively short and thin lashes and one of the key components I look for in a mascara is lengthening. This mascara does just that! My lashes are noticeably longer (to me), it holds a curl, and I had NO problems with clumping, smudging, flaking, or raccoon eyes. The brush is long and tapered, which I prefer. The tube itself is pretty lengthy, but I do like that when you close it, there&#x27;s a \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound so you know that it&#x27;s closed completely. Even though it&#x27;s waterproof, I had no trouble removing it with just my facial cleanser. It&#x27;s definitely the best drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve tried thus far that lengthens my lashes. However, this mascara did nothing in terms of \\&quot;volumizing.\\&quot; Then again, I have yet to find an affordable mascara that lengthens AND volumizes to my satisfaction; it&#x27;s either only one or the other. For those thinking about purchasing this mascara, I would say read reviews with a grain of salt because as with most beauty products, the results will vary for everyone.</li>
    <li> This product makes lashes look longer and thicker.  The downside is that I still get &amp;#34;raccoon eyes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t great but okay.  It doesn&#x27;t really make your lashes look longer or fuller.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this mascara again.  This is just a personal experience.</li>
    <li> The Claims:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Discover a breakthrough in fiber mascara technology. Voluminous false fiber waterproof lashes features a unique blend of long and short nylon and rayon fibers, the same material used to make false lashes to deliver lashes that appear fuller, longer, curled and sculpted. Long-lasting and waterproof. No clumps or messy results. Just outrageous volume from every angle.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing \\&quot;outrageous\\&quot; about this mascara is the flaking and smudging and the claims made by L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s marketing team.  I don&#x27;t know who they tested this out on but it certainly wasn&#x27;t me or anyone with oily lids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let me back up a bit.  I like the brush, though a bit long it is nicely shaped with a wider bottom that tapers off into a thinner top which is great for getting at those teensy lashes.  That&#x27;s where the love ends for me though.  The formula is dry, even on my first application it was dry and flaked all over my cheeks.  After a few uses the brush started collecting what I guess are the \\&quot;fibers\\&quot; near the tip so it must be wiped off before each use.  And the flaking gets worse with every use.  I bought black and it requires 3-4 coats for the length and volume I&#x27;m used to getting from other (better) mascaras (Mally, Tarte).  It does an ok job of lengthening the lashes without clumping up but I don&#x27;t see a lot of curling going on.  But its biggest fault is that it smudges on my brow after only an hour or so of wear.  I bought the waterproof version so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about looking like a fool mid-day but it failed me.  And the smudges aren&#x27;t removed easily.  I have to really scrub to get them off and end up removing patches of eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this again.  It is so not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Yup! The best I&#x27;ve found so far in a VERY lengthy search. I&#x27;m 67. Lashes have always been rather short &amp; straight, but several bouts with serious illnesses &amp; surgery left me with skimpy lashes to boot!&lt;br /&gt;Virtually every mascara I&#x27;ve tried clumps, more or less. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous False Fiber Lashes (WATERPROOF!) left fewer clumps than most of the others. LADIES! Invest in a small toothed metal comb made for lashes &amp; brows. It busts the clumps!&lt;br /&gt;So why do I like this stuff so much? Because EVERY other mascara I&#x27;ve tried has ended up UNDER my eyes! I have enough darkness &amp; puffiness all on my own, thank you very much. Don&#x27;t need to pay for a product that just adds to them!&lt;br /&gt;This lasted through a professional dye job (read &#x27;trip to the salon&#x27;), a good night&#x27;s sleep (blushing!), &amp; another day (bigger blush!!) before transferring ... just a little! Only tried it the one time ... WITH moisturizer (that&#x27;s usually the killer) &amp; I&#x27;m VERY pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It also curled a little, &amp; lengthened, &amp; thickened. And that was BEFORE my little helper Ready To Wear Lash Extensions. They&#x27;re little black fibers that you brush onto wet mascara, then seal with more mascara. You can add as much length &amp; thickness as you want. I get them on one of the shopping networks ... and no! I don&#x27;t work there.&lt;br /&gt;Oh ... the Voluminous mascara comes off nicely with Mary Kay eye makeup remover. Don&#x27;t work for them either. I just know how hard &amp; expensive it is to find the right products so I&#x27;ll pass along any good stuff I come across. Just remember ... What works wonderfully for one probably won&#x27;t work for all. ;)</li>
    <li> While I love this  brand and type of mascara when bought in a bricks and mortar store, I experience the one bought here as less than satisfactory and totally different in texture ....it also starts off  way too dry .  I shall buy in a store in future.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras, both expensive and drug store brands, and this one works as well as the department store expensive brands</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It is easy to apply and really thickens and lengthens my lashes. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> last all day but kind of dries out too quickly</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes.  It does flake a tiny bit, but not anything really noticeable.  It makes my eyes itch a little, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It does a great job giving me added length and volume.  As good as some expensive mascaras that don&#x27;t last nearly as long.  I will probably keep using in spite of the slight irritation because it&#x27;s one of the few mascaras I&#x27;ve found that gets a good score from ewg.org and last more than a few hours on my oily skin (I guess I&#x27;m more vain than I realized).  Don&#x27;t love the brush - it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brush and I prefer the rubber type applicators for mascara - but I can&#x27;t let that effect the review since I know there are lots of people on both sides of the mascara wand camp :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup for about 20 years). I have naturally long lashes, but I&#x27;ve always wanted them to look fuller. The slightly angled brush is wonderful. It has a lot of bristles, which has always been my preference. I haven&#x27;t experienced any clumping and really like the way my eyes look after application. I even had one of my doctors ask me whether I had something &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; to my eyelashes! With the influx of Rx lash products (that can completely ruin your eye color), and the hassle of false lashes, I will stick with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous False Fiber Lashes Waterproof Mascara, Blackest Black.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - thick, long eyelashes!  I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds, but I think this stuff is the best.</li>
    <li> Very good. Have no problem with product drying out in tube.</li>
    <li> Used his when I went scuba diving and I came out looking flawless!! :) use it for all the time and doesn&#x27;t run with sweat or tears! Easy to remove with soap and water or face cloths.</li>
    <li> Price and performance, L&#x27;Oreal works for me. I need a waterproof(and sweat proof!) mascara, and L&#x27;oreal had one that worked perfectly years ago, then stopped being available. After shopping more expensive brands for years  I went back to L&#x27;Oreal, skeptical of packaging/name changes, but is working for me regardless. I prefer the choice of brown if I want it, and also a straight no gimmicks wand, this is close enough for now. How nice to be able to add it on to an order and not spend 15 minutes trying to find it at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Really like this mascara great product. Tried the one not waterproof did not like it; has not got the staying power of the waterproof. This hold up under the worst of conditions and performs well</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend and she loves it so I bought one for myself and I really like it,</li>
    <li> Product seemed dried up on arrival!  I am very comfortable with Loreal products. This particular item took multiple applications to apply.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara before from the store and loved it but this time the one I got seems a bit dried out as if it were past its sell by date.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  Easy to apply, stays where you put it.  Long lasting.  Tripled my lashes or more.  I always throw away my mascara after 3 months, I&#x27;m afraid of eye infections, but there was still plenty there.after 3 months of daily use.  I have purchased several, both regular and water proof.</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite mascara ever. It&#x27;s water proof but washes off fairly easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> The first couple times I used this it was nice, but it gets very clumpy and looks fake.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Did not live up to expectations.  I wish I had bought it at my local drugstore where I could have easily returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I chose the waterproof mascarra and it is just that!!! Staying power gets a 10 plus. I have found my new favorite mascara. It gives just the right amount of POP!! without the appearance and pain of false lashes. I have been wearing this for about a week and everyone has assumed that I have had on false lashes. To eliminate over bulking I use the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous False Fiber Lashes as the base and I go over it with Makeup Forevers mascara as a top coat. Its not necessary, the Voluminous is AMAZING on its own.... works so well I bought 3 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was DEFINITELY worth the purchase!!</li>
    <li> I have always been a L&#x27;Oreal mascara girl. Even though I use other more expensive products and brands on my face, for my mascara, the brand has always stayed the same. However, that is until the last few months. I have been trying out some of the more expensive types and been kind of happy with some of the results and then I tried this ... L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous False Fiber Lashes and I am completely BLOWN AWAY!! I have a tester of a $35 Dior Mascara that is a joke compared to this one. Sometimes more expensive is just NOT better ... ( FYI I bought this is Blackest Black Waterproof). I will never ever switch again. My lashes have tripled in size and they curl ... I cannot believe it, but it&#x27;s true! Amazon is amazing ... give it a try and if it&#x27;s not all it says it is then return it, but I don&#x27;t think you will be having that problem! This is the best mascara I have ever used in my life! Ever Ever!!</li>
    <li> Great mascara but very hard to remove! You definitely will need a good eye makeup remover with this one!</li>
    <li> Really nice, thickens your lashes really nice.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for lash building. Makes them look longer. There nothing wrong with shopping at home!! Its the same stuff you get in the stores, right at your door! (just know what you are buying!)</li>
    <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst one I&#x27;ve bought on line. It nearly dried up when I received it which made me furious, so don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
    <li> I kept hoping these would work. I naturally have long lashes and usually wear clear mascara but I thought the idea of making my lashes more voluminous and making them look like false lashes would be really pretty. Unfortunately, I ended up with clumpy lashes and a bunch of black particles all over my eyes that looked like smudged mascara. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend these. Maybe they work on shorter, thinner lashes.</li>
    <li> Nice long lashes, and not too clumpy but it does tend to smear under my eyes a little more than I like.  I will continue to buy it though :)</li>
