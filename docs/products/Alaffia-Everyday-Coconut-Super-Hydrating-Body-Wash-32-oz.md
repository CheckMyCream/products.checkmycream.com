      <li>but this one is great.</li>
      <li>This is amazing!</li>
      <li>Great company, fair trade ingredients.</li>
      <li>It smells so good</li>
      <li>So I was very pleased to find that we can buy it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Foams up nicely and feels good.  </li>
      <li>We love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>It foams up nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
      <li>it smells more like raspberry or something fruity.</li>
      <li>Love the smell leaves my skin silky and refreshed.</li>
      <li>This body wash has made my skin notably softer since I started using it a week ago.  </li>
      <li>Love it, wish I had a gallon of it.</li>
      <li>My skin also felt very clean post-shower.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels great - very squeaky clean after use.  </li>
      <li>Plus, I love - love - love that it supports fair trade and working women internationally!</li>
      <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I originally gave this product 5 stars because it did not exacerbate any of my eczema symptoms (rarity).  </li>
      <li>It does not sud much and I need more without some sort of sponge.  </li>
      <li>It was purely meant to be a quick fix until my favorite soap was delivered.</li>
      <li>But this is my second bottle (as I said, it really lasts forever) and even with the warmer weather I am thrilled with glowing and smooth results that this product is helping me</li>
      <li>This body wash is all natural, it does not leave any type of film on your skin, but if you are in a hurry you would be able to omit a moisturizer for the day.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use many soaps because I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty mild on the skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right, closer to the texture/thickness of shampoo.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and while I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as calling it &amp;#34;Super Hydrating&amp;#34;, it also doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most soaps.</li>
      <li>The container is reusable as another kind of liquid dispenser long after the soap has been used up.</li>
      <li>I love this bodywash because it is gentle for the skin, it leaves it soft.</li>
      <li>I find that it dries my hair out, but as far as being body wash goes, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Smells great, thick gel, and a lightweight, moisturizing body wash.</li>
      <li>While visiting family in Oregon, we bought our first bottle of Alaffia body wash.</li>
      <li>Light scent, moisturing &amp; works for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>you won&#x27;t smell anything at all, however it does leave my skin pretty soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The bottle is huge so it should last a long time which is nice for the price.  </li>
      <li>I was worried that this would be really watery, like Dr. Bronners, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>However, the creaminess (without the greasy feeling that you would expect from natural coconut oil products) was addicting that when my soap came in, I simply re gifted it and stuck to my big bottle of heaven.</li>
      <li>I originally picked up this body wash in my local food store.</li>
      <li>It smelled weird at first sniff, but now it smells great to me.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes and cleanses with lovely slight scent</li>
      <li>Help tremendously with my dry skin.</li>
      <li>My only gripe about this is that it does not have much of a scent.  </li>
      <li>My husband wanted a typical body wash, but I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals.</li>
      <li>I also like that I can use this while pregnant and not have to worry about harsh chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I have eczema on my elbows, and very sensitive skin overall, and I have tried just about every body wash on the market.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of coconuts, so I was pleasantly surprised that this wash has a very neutral, natural scent.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that gets dry and itchy</li>
      <li>My husband and I both have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues with this.  </li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem drying, but my skin is much softer using their black soap.</li>
      <li>really easily (even worse</li>
</ol>

<li> I would give this product 5 stars if Alaffia could find a way to make this product less drying.</li>
<li> It does it&#x27;s job and works well, but I gave it four stars because Allafia&#x27;s Black Soap blows this out of the water for moisturization.</li>
<li> When I am unable to get the black soap I normally use, this is my go to alternative.</li>
<li> I think I was just so used to artificial fragrances in other products that my nose didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
<li> Try it, you will not be disappointed !</li>
<li> Worst smell of any body wash I have ever smelled!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!! It smells so good and it is easy to use. The container is reusable as another kind of liquid dispenser long after the soap has been used up.</li>
    <li> Worst smell of any body wash I have ever smelled!  No coconut smell at all, and cannot even tell what the scent is!  Whatever it is, it lingers, almost like the bar soaps I remember as a kid!</li>
    <li> This body wash has made my skin notably softer since I started using it a week ago.  The bottle is huge so it should last a long time which is nice for the price.  I also like that I can use this while pregnant and not have to worry about harsh chemicals.  My only gripe about this is that it does not have much of a scent.  I was hoping for a coconut scent to it but that is not a deal breaker.  I will def buy this again!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! Moisturizes and cleanses with lovely slight scent</li>
    <li> This bottle lasted 6 months for my toddler and me. It does it&#x27;s job and works well, but I gave it four stars because Allafia&#x27;s Black Soap blows this out of the water for moisturization. This one doesn&#x27;t seem drying, but my skin is much softer using their black soap.</li>
    <li> Helps with dry skin on my legs and body.  A little goes a long ways.  No perfume smell.</li>
    <li> I originally picked up this body wash in my local food store. It was purely meant to be a quick fix until my favorite soap was delivered. However, the creaminess (without the greasy feeling that you would expect from natural coconut oil products) was addicting that when my soap came in, I simply re gifted it and stuck to my big bottle of heaven. This body wash is all natural, it does not leave any type of film on your skin, but if you are in a hurry you would be able to omit a moisturizer for the day. I utilized this in the winter when we all feel and see certain changes in our skin; mine feels so dry and tight. But this is my second bottle (as I said, it really lasts forever) and even with the warmer weather I am thrilled with glowing and smooth results that this product is helping me achieve.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a very soapy or extremely foamy body wash, which to me immediately says &amp;#34;no tightness or dryness in my skin&amp;#34;. The creaminess and thickness of the product alone should satisfy any strict critic out there. Try it, you will not be disappointed !</li>
    <li> Does not have a strong perfume or artificial smell and does not leave an offensive lingering smell. It suds very well when I use it with an exfoliating sponge and a little goes a long way. It does not sud much and I need more without some sort of sponge.  The Amazon price is less expensive than I can buy at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that gets dry and itchy really easily (even worse so now that I&#x27;m preggie), and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this soap. It smells nice and while I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as calling it &amp;#34;Super Hydrating&amp;#34;, it also doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most soaps. Plus, I love - love - love that it supports fair trade and working women internationally!</li>
    <li> Love it, wish I had a gallon of it.</li>
    <li> Great company, fair trade ingredients. Light scent, moisturing &amp; works for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and use it as a body wash and a hair shampoo.  The ingredients are almost the same for their shampoo product, so I did not see the reason to purchase that along with the body wash.  My skin feels great - very squeaky clean after use.  As for a shampoo, no complaints - I like it!</li>
    <li> Foams up nicely and feels good.  Not much smell.  I can&#x27;t use many soaps because I have sensitive skin but this one is great. I recommend the shampoos and conditioners also but always look at the ingredients label.  Some of their products have chemicals in them so don&#x27;t assume because one is without chemicals that the others don&#x27;t either.</li>
    <li> Smells great, thick gel, and a lightweight, moisturizing body wash.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a typical body wash, but I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals. I was worried that this would be really watery, like Dr. Bronners, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just right, closer to the texture/thickness of shampoo. I find that it dries my hair out, but as far as being body wash goes, it works just fine. It smelled weird at first sniff, but now it smells great to me. I think I was just so used to artificial fragrances in other products that my nose didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff!  I recently switched to this body wash from Jason Aloe Vera wash.  (I noticed the Jason&#x27;s scent has changed for the worse too strong and less natural scent.)  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of coconuts, so I was pleasantly surprised that this wash has a very neutral, natural scent.  My husband and I both have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues with this.  It foams up nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  We will be repeat buyers!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local organic store when it was on sale.  I have mixed feelings about this product.  I have eczema on my elbows, and very sensitive skin overall, and I have tried just about every body wash on the market.  I originally gave this product 5 stars because it did not exacerbate any of my eczema symptoms (rarity).  Also it lathered well when I poured it onto my sponge-- a little goes a long way.  My skin also felt very clean post-shower.  However, as other reviewers noted, this product is not very moisturizing despite the fact that it is labeled &amp;#34;for dry skin&amp;#34; and hence the 2 star deduction for an overall rating of 3 stars.  My skin felt dry and tight post-shower.  As a result, I had to slather on body oil from head to toe because this body wash was ultimately too drying. I would give this product 5 stars if Alaffia could find a way to make this product less drying.</li>
    <li> Definitely moisturizing but not enough coconut scent.</li>
    <li> Help tremendously with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> When I am unable to get the black soap I normally use, this is my go to alternative. Love the smell leaves my skin silky and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love this bodywash because it is gentle for the skin, it leaves it soft.Also do not have harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> My son has severe eczema. While visiting family in Oregon, we bought our first bottle of Alaffia body wash. Great results! His eczema has improved 100%! So I was very pleased to find that we can buy it on Amazon. Fan for life!</li>
    <li> It does not smell like Coconut whatsoever it smells more like raspberry or something fruity. The scent is pretty mild on the skin you won&#x27;t smell anything at all, however it does leave my skin pretty soft and smooth.</li>
