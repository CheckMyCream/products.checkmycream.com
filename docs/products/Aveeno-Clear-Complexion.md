      <li>very mild cleansing soap; love it</li>
      <li>This is a great project for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Best, most gentle facial cleanser I have ever found.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in the amount of acne I get.</li>
      <li>, I noticed my skin still feeling refreshed and smooth.  </li>
      <li>But you can&#x27;t just clean your skin.</li>
      <li>in all, this is a great product for those with very oily and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This foaming cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Easy way to get a fresh, clean face.</li>
      <li>Also, I love how clean it gets my face as I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin, and this is the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
      <li>:) I would recommend for any skin type, my friend has very oily skin</li>
      <li>It has a light scent, greats really foamy and rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>It was working fine the first week, my skin felt good after I would wash my face with this product then the second weeks It got rid of all of my acne</li>
      <li>Good gentle cleanser for my 12 year old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to any with mild to medium acne problems.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for cleaning your face of oils and dirt after a long day.</li>
      <li>This product is great for teenage skin in particular.</li>
      <li>The foam also makes it super fun to use, not gonna lie</li>
      <li>I do not need to use much, and because of the foaming part, I still get a clean face.</li>
      <li>This product does seem to clean the face very well, and the foam goes on very gently.</li>
      <li>Makes face feel great, not tight feeling after washing like some other brand</li>
      <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think that people who are overly sensitive to intense sugars (diabetes run in the family?) are prone to acne and yeast blooms within days of ingesting sodas, cheap candy, and so forth.</li>
      <li>I tried various skin care products and they would work at first, leaving my skin fresh and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Leaves a clean soft feeling after each use.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product, I didn&#x27;t like it too much because I was used to skin care products that also exfoliates.  </li>
      <li>really use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, Aveeno peeps:</li>
      <li>I high recommended it!</li>
      <li>After about a week, I noticed my skin being very oily</li>
      <li>I do find that I need to use gentle exfoliation once a week though.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t like those feeling.</li>
      <li>/&gt;By day 5, my face was back to normal, where it felt smooth all</li>
      <li>Very gentle on my sensitive, breakout prone combination skin.</li>
      <li>I have very oily, sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>it really does clear your skin in no time</li>
      <li>Gentle enough to use very day.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin clear!</li>
      <li>After the first initial use in the morning, I noticed an immediate difference.  </li>
      <li>Clear skin.</li>
      <li>You can even use it gently right around your eyelashes to get any last bit of mascara off (I sometimes use a q-tip, especially if I used waterproof mascara, and gently scrub back and forth over my lashes) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes at all.</li>
      <li>so it starts to work to help clear current acne and any new acne trying to come through.</li>
      <li>The almond-shape of the bottle flies faster the tighter you squeeze, because you really have to push on the pump with a lot of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up and poured the contents into an empty Neutrogena pump bottle.</li>

<li> Makes my face feel a bit dry, but when combined with lotion, it works.</li>
<li> usually my skin is really soft</li>
<li> and I have very dry skin</li>
<li> The thing that really annoys me about this product (and unfortunately knocks it back a star)</li>
<li> same quality like usual</li>
<li> day 3-4, my skin started to peel due to dryness.  </li>
<li> Moreover, unless you absolutely must have artificial sweeteners, avoid them too, since they can aggravate acne, not to mention that some medical studies have found they to be carcinogens.</li>
<li> and I had little bumps(the little bumps that come out when your skin is dry)</li>
<li> My girlfriend really likes this foaming cleanser, but she&#x27;s totally obsessed with Aveeno, so it makes sense.</li>
<li> Believe me, if you have one molecule of soap on your hand, you will send this thing flying if you try to press down on the pump with one hand.</li>
<li> is that very little comes out when you press the pump.</li>
<li> I usually use this once a day, but even using it twice a day doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
<li> Its not amazing</li>
<li> Two hands are not much better!</li>
<li> IF ONLY they would re-design this HORRIBLE bottle.</li>
<li> Too expensive?</li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any crazy breakouts or anything with us, so that&#x27;s an added benefit.</li>
<li> Too bad for Aveeno, I can &amp;#34;advertise&amp;#34; to guests what brand</li>
<li> BUT my skin was peeling off terribly</li>
<li> It is very annoying to be in the shower and having to pump this thing four or five times to get a sufficient amount out to wash your face.</li>
<li> and my skin felt terrible like sand paper</li>

    <li> Best, most gentle facial cleanser I have ever found. IF ONLY they would re-design this HORRIBLE bottle. Believe me, if you have one molecule of soap on your hand, you will send this thing flying if you try to press down on the pump with one hand. Forget it. Two hands are not much better! There is nothing to hold onto! The almond-shape of the bottle flies faster the tighter you squeeze, because you really have to push on the pump with a lot of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up and poured the contents into an empty Neutrogena pump bottle. Too bad for Aveeno, I can &amp;#34;advertise&amp;#34; to guests what brand I really use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, Aveeno peeps: put your excellent formula into a pump bottle that one can use with one hand. You have seen an &amp;#34;hour-glass&amp;#34; shaped bottle, haven&#x27;t you?? Too expensive? The try something rectangular. Just not &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; shaped. That is reserved for missiles.</li>
    <li> good price! same quality like usual</li>
    <li> This product is great for teenage skin in particular. But you can&#x27;t just clean your skin. Some people have food sensitivities and if your skin breaks out, that may be part of your issue. In my experience, three days after ingesting corn syrup, some people, especially hormonal teens, break out. For what it&#x27;s worth, I think that people who are overly sensitive to intense sugars (diabetes run in the family?) are prone to acne and yeast blooms within days of ingesting sodas, cheap candy, and so forth. Moreover, unless you absolutely must have artificial sweeteners, avoid them too, since they can aggravate acne, not to mention that some medical studies have found they to be carcinogens.</li>
    <li> very mild cleansing soap; love it</li>
    <li> Its not amazing but I do notice that it keeps my skin as even as possible. Which is what I bought it for, so it definitely does the job</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Leaves a clean soft feeling after each use.</li>
    <li> This is a great project for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is incredible!!! I used many foaming cleansers in market, but I felt something kind of slippery feeling after I use many cleansers and I really don&#x27;t like those feeling. However, this foaming cleanser don&#x27;t have those feeling and I bought this again! I high recommended it!</li>
    <li> This is one of my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; products that I hope aveeno never ever stops making. I have very sensitive, dry skin, and this is the best face wash I have ever used. It&#x27;s not very drying (I always moisturize immediately anyway) and it removes any traces of makeup that might be left on your skin. You can even use it gently right around your eyelashes to get any last bit of mascara off (I sometimes use a q-tip, especially if I used waterproof mascara, and gently scrub back and forth over my lashes) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes at all. The foam also makes it super fun to use, not gonna lie :) I would recommend for any skin type, my friend has very oily skin and I have very dry skin and it works beautifully for both of us.</li>
    <li> Been using this cleanser for years &amp; I like it a lot. It foams up well &amp; cleans well.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great. Your skin feels amazing after using it. Gentle enough to use very day.</li>
    <li> This cleaner is fantastic!  Makes face feel great, not tight feeling after washing like some other brand</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin after I went through chemotherapy and this face wash is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I usually use this once a day, but even using it twice a day doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It does even out my complexion and works well for my occasional acne. I do find that I need to use gentle exfoliation once a week though. The foaming pump bottle is wonderful and I tend to only need 3-4 pumps. This does last me several months. Terrific face wash and awesome packaging!</li>
    <li> I have very oily, sensitive skin.  I tried various skin care products and they would work at first, leaving my skin fresh and smooth.  After about a week, I noticed my skin being very oily midday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried this product, I didn&#x27;t like it too much because I was used to skin care products that also exfoliates.  After the first initial use in the morning, I noticed an immediate difference.  I went into work and midway through the day, I noticed my skin still feeling refreshed and smooth.  Even coming home, my skin was not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day 3-4, my skin started to peel due to dryness.  During this time, I lathered my face with face lotion but it didn&#x27;t seem to have any impact.  I later learned that my face was getting to dry from this product so it was required for me to put lotion on every day after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day 5, my face was back to normal, where it felt smooth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be to use this in addition to a good face lotion.  Also, to avoid skin peeling, I would also suggest exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product for those with very oily and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel a bit dry, but when combined with lotion, it works. I do not need to use much, and because of the foaming part, I still get a clean face.</li>
    <li> It was working fine the first week, my skin felt good after I would wash my face with this product then the second weeks It got rid of all of my acne BUT my skin was peeling off terribly and I had little bumps(the little bumps that come out when your skin is dry) and my skin felt terrible like sand paper usually my skin is really soft, I don&#x27;t know if this was supposed to happen or what? But I&#x27;m never using it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Clinique face cleanser. I love it!  Fresh clean scent and the foam crests a great lather for your face. Works perfect to remove makeup</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin clear! Just a note that this product contains 0.5% salicylic acid so it might make skin dry.</li>
    <li> awesome product to leave my face feeling very clean and fresh</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for cleaning your face of oils and dirt after a long day. It is a bit drying so moisturizer is needed afterwards. I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in the amount of acne I get. I still get periodic break outs.</li>
    <li> This foaming cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized.  My pimple breakouts are reduced, but not completely eliminated.  But, it does do a great job at controlling my breakouts.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to any with mild to medium acne problems.</li>
    <li> Good gentle cleanser for my 12 year old. Has taken control of his acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really likes this foaming cleanser, but she&#x27;s totally obsessed with Aveeno, so it makes sense. This product does seem to clean the face very well, and the foam goes on very gently. It hasn&#x27;t caused any crazy breakouts or anything with us, so that&#x27;s an added benefit. The thing that really annoys me about this product (and unfortunately knocks it back a star) is that very little comes out when you press the pump. It is very annoying to be in the shower and having to pump this thing four or five times to get a sufficient amount out to wash your face. Besides that, though, it seems to be very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  Have been using it for years.  My sister bought it and it wasn&#x27;t for her so I tried it and I never looked back.  It is the only cleanser that I can use to wash my entire face - makeup and all - and it does not burn my eyes - so I can use it to wash off my eye-makeup as well.  Also, I love how clean it gets my face as I have very oily skin and I love that it has salicylic acid so it starts to work to help clear current acne and any new acne trying to come through.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my sensitive, breakout prone combination skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cleanser. It has a light scent, greats really foamy and rinses off easily. Easy way to get a fresh, clean face.</li>
    <li> Amazing product  it really does clear your skin in no time</li>
    <li> Clear skin. Can&#x27;t complain about that.</li>
