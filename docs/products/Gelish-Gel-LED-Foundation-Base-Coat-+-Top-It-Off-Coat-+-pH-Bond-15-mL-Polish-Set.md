      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I was gonna be able to do it myself at home.</li>
      <li>I love gelish products.</li>
      <li>I love gelish.  </li>
      <li>It is mostly Isopropyl Alcohol (rubbing alcohol)and</li>

      <li>Work good, though top coat is not very thick and you need to make sure you don&#x27;t have more than  </li>
      <li>Awesome product, exactly as described, fabulous shipping speed, overall very pleased with my purchase and would buy again and/or recommend to friends and family.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The seller also included a free mini bottle of polish colour, and I LOVE the colour.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, fair price and item as described .</li>
      <li>Lasts 2 weeks without chipping away and you don&#x27;t have to feel cautious as this is strong holding and a bit thicker but comfortable and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
      <li>And FABULOUS price</li>
      <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply, quick to do and super quick drying.</li>
      <li>The Gelish system is super easy to do - easier than painting with nail polish because it doesn&#x27;t run all over your cuticles.</li>
      <li>I love love love Harmony Gelish, actually an addict.</li>
      <li>Super quick shipping, product arrived very quickly as well.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly enough it&#x27;s was easy fast and a great turn out .</li>
      <li>All full size bottles.</li>
      <li>And at such a good price, the foundation itself can run $18</li>
      <li>bottles  are full size and they are salon quality.  </li>
      <li>They did send me a &amp;#34;Nourish&amp;#34; rather than a &amp;#34;PHBond&amp;#34; but after one quick email they sent the PHBond</li>
      <li>Cures ery quickly</li>
      <li>My nails look glossy and freshly manicured every use.</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying gel polish</li>
      <li>and I will be buying again when my first set is all used up.</li>
      <li>exactly what my salon used.  </li>
      <li>Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>If you do get it on your skin be sure to remove prior to curing, otherwise it leaves a lift and if your anything like me you&#x27;ll pick and pick until you ruin your manicure.  </li>
      <li>It works perfectly with my cnd uv lamp and as a base and top coat for any gel polish .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper!&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are saving so much money when buying these from Amazon.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this brand to.</li>
      <li>My nails normally chip after 2-3 days, but Gelish stays on my nails for over two weeks!  </li>
      <li>so I just used the three steps to have clear and wallah!!</li>
      <li>I could do my nails everyday for as many colors I have purchased.</li>
      <li>Products work exactly as intended and are the same as the products they use in the nail salons.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use with the Epica Double Wide Dryer.</li>
      <li>I get tired of the same color very quickly and enjoy doing my gel manicures at home whenever I wish to do so.</li>
      <li>Was surprised to have 2 sets.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last, difficult to use, nails become more apt to peel and break upon removal, not worth the money, save your time and $</li>
      <li>The brush on the base coat is short making it easier for application, the brush on the top coat is longer and the top coat is a bit runnier</li>
      <li>It just seems like the top coat is kinda thin...</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve had trouble with is if I don&#x27;t do two layers of top coat, it does start to chip a little bit after about 2 days.</li>

<li> I do have to cure it for at least 5 minutes on the top-coat but a major plus if you do not want to use UV lamps because of their harshness.</li>

<li> No chips at all, only the usually growth.  </li>
<li> I have tried many base and tops coats for gel polish.</li>
<li> Sometimes it does peel, from the base coat, but could be user error more than product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super quick shipping, product arrived very quickly as well.  All three pieces were in one box.  I did get the gelish brand pH balancer and not the Harmony brand as pictured but that is obviously not a problem.  Products work exactly as intended and are the same as the products they use in the nail salons.  I use a Sensational Light and the top coat cures in 60 seconds. The brush on the base coat is short making it easier for application, the brush on the top coat is longer and the top coat is a bit runnier so you have to be careful not to get it on your skin.  If you do get it on your skin be sure to remove prior to curing, otherwise it leaves a lift and if your anything like me you&#x27;ll pick and pick until you ruin your manicure.  Overall this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Worked great and first time I had ever done it myself.  Was surprised to have 2 sets.</li>
    <li> Love all of my Gellish products.</li>
    <li> wonderful product!! my manicure lasts longer than with other polishes</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I was gonna be able to do it myself at home. Amazingly enough it&#x27;s was easy fast and a great turn out . granite I didn&#x27;t have money to buy color so I just used the three steps to have clear and wallah!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last, difficult to use, nails become more apt to peel and break upon removal, not worth the money, save your time and $</li>
    <li> I love love love Harmony Gelish, actually an addict. I could do my nails everyday for as many colors I have purchased. I get tired of the same color very quickly and enjoy doing my gel manicures at home whenever I wish to do so. So grateful these are so affordable on Amazon. Absolutely no complaints, ever about Harmony Gelish, not ever!!</li>
    <li> Gelish is the best nail brand I&#x27;ve ever used!  My nails normally chip after 2-3 days, but Gelish stays on my nails for over two weeks!  No chips at all, only the usually growth.  And their color selection is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, exactly as described, fabulous shipping speed, overall very pleased with my purchase and would buy again and/or recommend to friends and family. And FABULOUS price</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying $40+ to get my nails done, but having super thin nails that split I can&#x27;t go without acrylic or gel. The Gelish system is super easy to do - easier than painting with nail polish because it doesn&#x27;t run all over your cuticles. Dries instantly in the UV lamp. I&#x27;ve used the top coat alone or over the Gelish polish. So glad I discovered this product! No more overpriced salon visits for this girl! I bought this set and the UV lamp by Melody plus 2 Gelish color polishes for the price of 2 visits to the salon.</li>
    <li> SUCH A DEAL!! must buy. Using this product and their nail polishes or the CND my manicure lasts over 2wks</li>
    <li> Very pleased with gel nail polishes.</li>
    <li> This gelish system is giving me all sorts of life. And at such a good price, the foundation itself can run $18 but here you get all three! They did send me a &amp;#34;Nourish&amp;#34; rather than a &amp;#34;PHBond&amp;#34; but after one quick email they sent the PHBond so I was one happy customer. I use an 18w LED lamp with this and it works wonders. I do have to cure it for at least 5 minutes on the top-coat but a major plus if you do not want to use UV lamps because of their harshness. 100%recommend. My nails look glossy and freshly manicured every use.</li>
    <li> I have tried many base and tops coats for gel polish. So far Gelish and Sally Hansen are the best IMO. Though Gelish takes the #1 slot.</li>
    <li> This is the best set I have tried.  Cures ery quickly and it keeps the gel polish on very long.  Going on 2 moths with my toes!</li>
    <li> Great product !!! The base sticks to nail without chipping ,peeling or pulling.have had my manicure on now for over a week and it still looks good. I ordered the IBD gel base first and threw it away !manicure only lasted for one day ,even after proper nail prep! Will keep buying this product though!</li>
    <li> Love doing my nails at home instead of paying a grip at the salons. This is a great starter set to do them at home.</li>
    <li> You are saving so much money when buying these from Amazon. The products are the larger bottles of Gelish and all of them are the actual Gelish brand. All work great and I will be buying again when my first set is all used up. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> What nail salons I&#x27;ve been to use - works great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great for gel nails!! Every single polish is just wonderful! just a glossy top coat also!</li>
    <li> Work good, though top coat is not very thick and you need to make sure you don&#x27;t have more than  you need or it just flow around your fingernails while drying.</li>
    <li> I use this system with OPI, IBD, Sally Hansen, Sensationail, and Gellish gel polishes and it performs wonderfully.  I get about two weeks wear out of it (this system plus 2 coats of gel polish).  I recently added Gellish&#x27;s \\&quot;Structure,\\&quot; which seems to be the same formula as the \\&quot;Foundation\\&quot; except the Structure is thicker.  I&#x27;ve used Structure to both repair ripped nails (along with some silk nail repair fabric) and also to add overall strength to my nails.  It works great!  I just put the Structure on in between the Foundation and color layers.</li>
    <li> great product.  exactly what my salon used.  performs as expected.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;ve been just discovering gel polish. I started with sensationail, and have kept with that, but what I&#x27;ve used of the gelish has been good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Anytime I have my nails the salon charges $20-25 extra just to have shellac/gelish UV/LED gel polish instead. I no longer have to pay a steep price for long lasting nails. Very easy to apply, quick to do and super quick drying. Lasts 2 weeks without chipping away and you don&#x27;t have to feel cautious as this is strong holding and a bit thicker but comfortable and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing it. MAKE SURE you follow all directions though to get results. You can use rubbing alcohol in place of their brand prepping supplies they suggest. Save yourself the starter kits price and don&#x27;t buy the cleanser...It is mostly Isopropyl Alcohol (rubbing alcohol)and some added skin conditioning additives. It&#x27;s much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;The seller also included a free mini bottle of polish colour, and I LOVE the colour.</li>
    <li> it works the way I thought it would. I love when reality meets my vision!! You will be pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and exactly what I ordered!!</li>
    <li> I love gelish.  It&#x27;s all I use.  Sometimes it does peel, from the base coat, but could be user error more than product.  Definitely need this for gel application. I wish all the brushes were small.  It would make for easier application.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! Very happy!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT - the Foundation reinforces you nails so you have added protection. Love the colors too!</li>
    <li> AWE-SOME. So easy to use with the Epica Double Wide Dryer.</li>
    <li> This for some reason does not stay on very long and has a very difficult time to dry.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I think that it is going to be  great. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it works very good to as well.</li>
    <li> Has been very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great seller love these products!</li>
    <li> bottles  are full size and they are salon quality.  I&#x27;m completely  happy  with the purchase.. the mini  versions  cost about $12  each so,  excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, fair price and item as described . It works perfectly with my cnd uv lamp and as a base and top coat for any gel polish .</li>
    <li> Thanks you make me happy is look very awesome</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying gel polish so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this brand to. Not really willing to give up my giant regular nail polish collection I&#x27;ve been doing a gelly sandwich technique and have had pretty good results. The only thing I&#x27;ve had trouble with is if I don&#x27;t do two layers of top coat, it does start to chip a little bit after about 2 days. It just seems like the top coat is kinda thin...but that could be due to the fact that I&#x27;m using regular polish....unsure which is the culprit. But I AM ecstatic that my nails are growing really long now that they have some &amp;#34;beef&amp;#34; to them. And I&#x27;m so happy that my time consuming, intricate nail art lasts more than a day!</li>
    <li> Its exactly what I wanted. I love gelish products. My order was shipped promptly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal. All full size bottles. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great deal, havent used it yet!</li>
    <li> Just like at the salon</li>
