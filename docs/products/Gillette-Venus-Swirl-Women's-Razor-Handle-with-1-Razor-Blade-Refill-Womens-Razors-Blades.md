<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this razor to try out from Venus and it is AMAZING! I got an extremely close shave and 3 days later my legs still feel smooth which is unusual for me. I usually prefer a men&#x27;s razor but I have been converted!</li>
    <li> The razor head on the Venus Swirl is AH-MAZING! I always thought that 3 blades was all you need, and any more is just a way to make you pay more money. I am here to tell you how wrong I was! The 5 blades on this razor head make shaving so much faster and simpler! I only have to go over each area once to remove hairs (compared to twice with my old 3 blade original Venus) and if I want a super close shave, I only have to go over each area twice (compared to 3 or 4 times with my old 3 blade razor). I don’t feel like I have to apply too much pressure to get a close shave. The MoistureGlide serum on the head is also amazing! When I shave, I do so by simply running water over my legs. I never use any kind of shave gel or cream. Since the MoistureGlide serum is water activated, this is perfect for someone like me. Not sure how long the serum will last, I have seen it decreasing and the shave quality degrades slightly. As a warning, don’t wrap the razor in a towel, it ends up soaking up some of the serum if you do.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  I was using a different brand but was getting annoyed by the closeness of the shave, and my skin was very irritated.  Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  Also, I am not scared with the razor to shave my armpits, knees, ankles and bikini area, and it does not get irritated, which is a huge relief for me!  I will definitely be purchasing this from now on!  Thank you Venus!</li>
    <li> I have the softest legs and arms thanks to this new razor! I love the moisture glide, it gives me a close and smooth shave every time! I love the grip, very easy to manage. The blade did last a long time, compared to the other brands I have previously used. I will definitely be added this into my routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette! -</li>
    <li> A gift for the little lady her favorite razors so I always get them for her</li>
    <li> (I tried the Venus Swirl free on a promotion from Gillette in return for my honest opinion).  The Swirl looks great out of the package, and the Flexiball seems like a great idea to shave in tricky areas.  The first time I used the Venus Swirl, I nicked my ankle, which of course happens sometimes, but I was bummed as I thought something like the Flexiball would help prevent that.  However, the next time I used it, the same thing happened!  Additionally, I do not think that this shaves as close as other brands of razors, as I can normally eek three days out of a shave, but need to shave every other day with the Swirl.  So while I liked the handle of the razor, the blades left much to be desired. I truly wanted to love this razor, my expectations were not met. I will not be buying more cartridges for the Venus Swirl.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I received a free one to use thanks to Gillette.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for few weeks and have zero complaints.  No nicks or cuts and the flexiball makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love the grip on this razor. It has a good grip and doesn&#x27;t just slip out of your hand. Gilette sent me one free to try out.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BZZ agent and gillette, I got to use this shaver for free!! The after math of the shave was great. It left my legs feeling super smooth. I couldn&#x27;t ask of anymore from a shaver. Love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally splurge on razors, but this one is really worth the money. BuzzAgent and Venus sent this product for me to try &amp; I love it! No more cheap throwaway razors for me! I&#x27;m a Venus Swirl girl now. This razor makes shaving feel like a spa treat. It adds something pretty and special to my shaving routine. One of my favorite features is the MoistureGlide serum which makes the blade effortlessly glide over your skin for a smooth moisturized silky smooth shave. For the first time in years, I was able to shave and received no nicks or cuts on my legs. For more of my product reviews and buying guides, visit: http://melindalongoria.hubpages.com/</li>
    <li> by far one of the best razors I have ever used. I received my Venus swirl raise or last month and I still haven&#x27;t had to change the cartridge it. It gives you a smooth and silky clean shave. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more cartridges and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use my own throat sore again! I received my product free from bzz agent but free or not it&#x27;s definitely worth what you would pay for it</li>
    <li> When I first got to use the Gillette Venus Swirl razor, I initially noticed the packaging. The razor is assembled nicely in a very pretty purple packaging, as well as a nice coupon towards future razor heads. It was nice of them to include the coupon, for the razor only comes packaged with one razor head. Once I open the packaging up I was very pleased with the overall look and feel of the razor. Most razors I have used in the past look and feel very cheaply made. This one however, felt heavy with some durability to it, as well as nice designs around the razor. Another added feature is the metal-like ball just under the razor head for move movability of the razor head while shaving. Another thing to note is that this razor head is a lot larger than most feminine razors, especially since it has 5 razor blades as well as two sections of moisturizing soap bars around the razors. I have very sensitive skin, so I was happy that it had these.&lt;br /&gt; Although the razor itself was very pleasing to the eye, the real test would be to see how it would shave when it comes to my sensitive skin. In order to form the best overall opinion of this razor, I decided to shave with it for two full weeks in order to really give my honest opinion. First I will say the only negatives I found when using the razor. As for the care of your razor, I suggest leaving it razor side down in a dry area when not in use. I left mine once face up after use and the soap strips puffed up and dried in a very weird shape, which was odd to me. However, I was thankfully able to moisten the razor and it went somewhat back to its original shape. Secondly, is the fact that it only comes with one razor head in the packaging. Besides these two aspects that do not affect the shave of the skin, there are many pros to using this specific style and brand of razor.&lt;br /&gt; After the first use and many times following I started to notice I needed to shave my underarms and legs less often. Because there are 5 blades (more than normal female razors have) I was able to get a much closer shave, as well as cover more ground while shaving with the larger razor head design. This left my legs feeling smoother than ever, and in little time. As well I experienced no cuts around my harder to shave areas, such as my knees or ankles. I feel this was due to the metal-like ball that propels the razor easily around the curves of the skin.&lt;br /&gt; Once using this razor, I feel like I can’t go back to the wimpy disposable razors that I once knew to be my cheap go-to. The Gillette Venus Swirl razor I can easily say is an improved version of most razors today. With its easy moving design, I am able to achieve a perfect shave for summer beach days when I want my legs to be the smoothest they can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.than normal female razors have) I was able to get a much closer shave, as well as cover more ground while shaving with the larger razor head design.

    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor!!  I received the razor from BzzAgent as a promotion from Venus,  and I&#x27;m so glad I did! The new flexible ball makes reaching all those awkward and hard to reach areas a complete breeze.  The moisturising serum allows me to shave with no shaving lotion and no razor burn!  The razor is strong,  durable,  comfortable,  sleek,  moisturizing and flexible!  Total win!</li>
    <li> I am trying this product for free thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent. I wanted to love this razor. I tried to like it every time I picked it up, but I just don&#x27;t. The flexiball is a nuisance more than anything else. I constantly have to keep readjusting it as I shave up and down my legs. I do not care for the moisture serum around the head of the razor. I have a fog free mirror in my shower with a little shelf to rest your razor and this moisture serum is now all over it. It&#x27;s very sticky and gooey and nothing like I&#x27;ve ever encountered, even with the Schick Intuition. Yes it produces a close shave, but overall, it&#x27;s a regular razor with a head that spins around. I will not be buying replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Good razor though I&#x27;m not sure that the shiny ball seems to make a difference in the quality of shave.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free from Gilette. While i really love the flexible head and the comfort of the handle, I don&#x27;t really feel as if the razor was the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t really feel as if I get a close shave as I do with my favorite razor I owned prior to this one. I could get three days of shave free shower time with my razor and with this one I always feel as if i need to shave with every shower which would be every day. I was also heavily nicked by the razor i used. While I&#x27;m not satisfied with the bleeding body parts I shaved and the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; the razor left behind, I really do love the razor and may purchase a the refill kit or even another razor just to be sure I didn&#x27;t receive a defective razor because even my favorite razor has bad refills.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette for sending me this amazing tool to test out! I can already tell im soo loving this and that it will be my go to! It has these 5 blades that make sure to get every single hair follicle and the unique flexibal makes the process much more easier. I have very dry sensitive skin and the moisture glides leave my skin extra soft and moisturized just as it should. Since its my first time using it i will be seeing how long it will last with ots greatness! Thank you Gillette!!!</li>
    <li> I got this razor thanks to BzzAgent (for free!) so I was really excited to try it out, especially since it was sent to me right before summer started. Unfortunately however, this probably just postponed my summer by a tiny bit. On the first attempt to shave, I noticed that the &amp;#34;moisture strip&amp;#34; was anything BUT moisturizing. It was almost like plastic, and about to fall off (manufacturing error, probably), but I decided to keep on going regardless, because I needed to be hairless to start off the summer. I woke up the next day after my shower/ shave, and I had knicks and cuts all up and down my legs. It was awful. I even noticed a little bit of razor burn down by my ankles, and I haven&#x27;t had razor burn on my legs since I was a teenager! However, I kept on giving it more shots, and the more I used it, the less it actually hurt the next day. Knicks and cuts soon diminished, but I still would never recommend this to someone who just occasionally shaves, or who is a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; shaver.</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free thanks to bzzagent! This razor works wonderfully! I have used it for a few weeks and I have not cut my legs nor has the moisture strip stopped working. I will be purchasing refills for it!</li>
    <li> Spot on description, speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Gillette. This is a nice razor. It left my legs feeling really smooth. It didn&#x27;t cut my legs like a lot of razors do. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I used this razor three times now and am in love with it. Thanks to Gillette for giving me this product for free to try out the many benefits this razor blade has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has built in lotion/gel that makes your shaves sleek and smooth. It truly makes shaving fun and there&#x27;s really no need for a shaving gel, so good for you if you don&#x27;t have one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 5 blades that make sure it gets as close as it can get to your leg without missing a spot and without hurting your skin. I find my legs growing hair slowly because of the close shave! After a week, the hairs will be there, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable because they&#x27;re so short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this brand not just because this blade is awesome for the numerous reasons above, but also because this is a very reliable brand that I trust. If you are shaver that dreads to shave often, go for this razor because you&#x27;ll get the job done for sure!</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product and is greatly improved.  So far the razor and refills are well worth the increased price despite wishing that they were slightly less expensive!</li>
    <li> If you have long legs, buy this razor!!!!!! It is incredible! I normally give up shaving entirely in the winter. This one&#x27;s never-ending, but thanks to this razor, I won&#x27;t look like Punxsutawney Phil! Seriously, though: the flexiball is a GAME CHANGER.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount of cartridges!  I love this razor.</li>
    <li> ***I got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With the very first shave, I expected to have tiny cuts like I do every time I sahve with a fresh blade, but no cuts and no razor burn appeared. The blade seemed to flex with my skin and left me with a smooth, silky shave. After using this razor for 6 shaves without changing the blade, it is still sharp and the moisture strip is still in good condition. I have extremely sensive skin which often leads to razor burn, but I have experienced no burn at all with the Venus Swirl.  The head seems to move with every curve of my leg and the blades never &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; the hair as I&#x27;m shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful razor and I will recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this item for free, from Gillette. If I could give this two separate reviews, for the legs and for under the arms, I would. For under the arms, I would only really give it 2 stars. I did not feel I got a very close shave, with the Venus Swirl; I ended up going over my shave with another brand 3-blade razor, to get the stubble left over from the Venus Swirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as for my legs, I would definitely give this 4 or 5 stars. Shaving around the ankles and knees, especially are always tricky areas; The Venus Swirl helped make the shave quick and effortless. I feel the MoistureGlide Serum also helped with the smooth glide, as well- and this was only with soap and water...I had run out of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the grip of the razor was not that great; I found the handle to be slippery, when wet, which led me to fear I would end up cutting myself, since I couldn&#x27;t hold onto it that great, however I did not.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product out for free thanks to Gillette and BzzAgentI had high hopes for this razor. I thought it was super cool, because I had been waiting for the &amp;#34;flexi-ball&amp;#34; version of women&#x27;s razor since I saw the one for men! I was super excited to get it for free to try as a BzzCampaign - until I tried it. I was super disappointed the first time I used it. The &amp;#34;moisture strips&amp;#34; felt like plastic and did absolutely nothing to help moisturize my skin. The &amp;#34;flexi-ball&amp;#34; feature is kind of a joke. It does absolutely nothing to help my shaving experience. It was not very flexible at all and was just overall pointless. I have sensitive skin, and while it gave me a decently clean shave, it had nicked my skin and given me razor burn, even with shaving cream. The shave was not as clean as with other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, unfortunately. I thought I would give it a couple more tries to see if it just needed to be broken in, but I had no luck. I feel like the next few times I used it, the shave wasn&#x27;t as close. I would not pay the retail price for this razor. Not to mention that the 6 pack of refills cost $27. $27!! The price is too high for the quality of the razor, and I will definitely not be using this product in the future unless some kinks are worked out.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had:) No Knicks!!</li>
    <li> My favorite razor blades delivered right to my door!  The swirl blades are perfection in my opinion, easy to replace, long lasting, and a pretty color too!</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and have been using the Venus Embrace Sensitive Razor. I like that razor a lot, so I was skeptical about trying a new one. I&#x27;ve been using the Venus Swirl for about a month. I like the handle - love the handle actually, but I&#x27;m not wild about the actual cartridge. I have found that the cartridge for this razor irritates my skin. I will probably continue using the handle, but see if the sensitive skin cartridges fit (I think they will.) If so, I&#x27;ll be very pleased!!  (I received this product free for testing purposes through a Gillette Promotion)</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to try this razor for free through bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;i was very excited about it. seeing all those blades, i thought i would be able to cut down the number of times i shave per week.&lt;br /&gt;as a very busy mom of little ones, i don&#x27;t have the time to myself like i used to  ;)&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  the Venus swirl razor was no different than my favorite inexpensive razor that i buy, actually it took longer to shave because i had to hold the razor head still in order to really get a close shave  :(&lt;br /&gt;it was also difficult to get close in those intimate areas as the razor itself is rather large, kind of awkward to maneuver it just right.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me Gillette, sorry.</li>
    <li> These blades are amazing!  I was given the opportunity to try the Venus Swirl razor free from Gillette.  I was very wary of it as I am an avid man&#x27;s razor consumer.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and have a lot of area to cover, however this blade handled my knees and ankles just as well as any man&#x27;s razor.  I&#x27;d recommend this to any woman looking for a close shave in trouble areas.</li>
    <li> I would have to say that the new Gillette Swirl razor is my favorite from the Venus line. I usually purchase the venus sensitive cartilages. Although the sensitive ones are great, they do not compare to the swirl! The range of motion in the razor handle is perfect for the areas that are hard to shave like the knees and ankles. The blades on the Venus Swirl are SHARP. I had a few nicks using it the first time but that was user caused and not the razors fault. The blades also stay sharper longer than the other variations I have previously tried. I shave every other day and 2 cartilages last me a little more than a month. I love how silky and smooth the Gillette Swirl razor left my legs and I am converted to using this brand over the sensitive from now own. Love my Gillette Venus Swirl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette!</li>
    <li> I guess my wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t run out of the bathroom with blood running down her legs lately, so guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> My skin is so sensitive I had given up on the idea of ever shaving without getting razor burn.  Thanks to the sharpness of the blades and the moisturizer that I feel I no longer suffer from razor burn.  I had tried all the advice and was only using a razor twin blade razor once then throwing it away to try and reduce my skin problems.  Thanks to the quality of Venus razors I have had 3 pain free shaves from one head.  I had given up on ever having legs that where smooth to the touch but with this razor they are.  I&#x27;m very glad Gillette Venus gave me a free sample of this product to review because I had given up on ever having smooth legs or a pain free shave.  After the first shave I was so happy I brought 6 refills so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Not really the best shave i have ever had but since i got this for free from bzzagent so i cant complain. The  razor itself is great !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used cheap, disposable razors for awhile now and almost always get nicked every time I shave.  The Venus Swirl is amazing!  It glides around curves (it does the back of my legs especially well) and the MoistureGlide Serum is wonderful.  I used half the amount of shaving cream I normally do and will probably be able to just use the MoistureGlide Serum for my next shave.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved my legs for a week (full disclosure: it was finals week, so sue me), therefore I wanted to use shaving cream just in case.  Best of all, no nicks, no blood, just smooth skin!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to disposables!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Nearly a month later and still haven&#x27;t drawn blood or nicks --I&#x27;m sold ... &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Disclaimer: I was given a sample to try out courtesy of Gillette]</li>
    <li> When I first got this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this razor was going to be good.but after I tried it I was very happy about how it worked. I don&#x27;t normally use razors to shave but this razor caught my attention. I am very grateful that I got to try this product for free (from buzzagent.com).</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try the Gillette Venus Swirl. Once it came in the mail by BzzAgent by a promotion gillette is doing i got it for free. First thing I did when I got it was buy the shaving gel. So I finally tried it and I have alot of mixed emotions. I love how it gets the work done and leaves your skin really soft. First leg shaved great, loved it. But once I shaved my other leg it got the work done too but it still left behind some of my hairs and I cut myself apparently. But I don&#x27;t know if its because I let that leg dry or because of the razor. But it gets the work done so I do like it. Also with the flexi ball wow i love it, it moves around really smooth with it. Im going to keep using it and see if it was my fault or the razor but so far mixed emotions with it. I want to love it so I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from venus to test it. I really like it and the 5 blades worked really well and caused no irritation. The razor worked very well around the knees and the back of the legs. I like  the rotation ability it works well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor!! It is the closest shave I ever had and it did not irritated my skin like it usually happens when I shave. The blades are super sharp but the moisture strips keep your skin silky smooth. This now my go to razor for ever and ever till the end of time.</li>
    <li> after the first swipe all I could thing was WOW!!!  I&#x27;m highly in love with this Venus Swirl.  A very comfortable and save feeling as you shave flat or curved surfaces.  This razor glides very smoothly and gently.  When it comes to razors I&#x27;m really not to sure what else you could ask for.  My skin was so very soft after I finished shaving, like impressively smooth.  I highly recommend giving this girl a try.  She is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> iam glad to try this amazing product  i receive for free thanks fot venus ...the 5 blades cut my hair so low the i dont have to shave every day  and so cuts and the best no dry skin...so glad to find this</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette, I am trying the Venus Swirl Razor for FREE!  So far, the blade has held up well, and given me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in a while.  The cost of the refills seems a bit high, or this would be a 5 star rating!</li>
    <li> The virus swirl refill razors offer a close shave that is painless with no discomfort or cuts. The refills razors slide on for easy use and pop off for easy disposing. I was happy to get these refills with a coupon thanks to buzz agent and Venus.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades for an awesome razor! A close shave with no discomfort. Highly recommended.  I received this free from venus.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a promotion from the brand &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did. When looking for razors that only thing that matters is &amp;#34;Is this razor going to give me a good close shave with no nicks or razor burns?&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s the only question we ask ourselves when staring at about a billion options. This razor along with the Venus Shave Gel - Violet Swirl (which smells amazing btw) gave me an amazing shave. I had no nicks or razor burns and my skin was left smooth and hair-less. The only thing about this razor I don&#x27;t understand is the whole flexiball thing. I don&#x27;t know how it works or helps in anyway, but obviously it does. Typically I use men&#x27;s razors because of the better shave they give. But this razor may warrant a change in my future razor purchases! Great razor, two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> These are easy to put on and take off, the razor glides very easily, and I would know this thanks to a sample I received through Venus and bzzagent.com, I love how smooth it leaves my legs, also love the color of the razor.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing! So much moisture! The shave is so close I dont have an armpit shadow and I can go 3 days without shaving my legs! (previously every darn day) I am hooked. I received this as a promotion from the brand and was pretty skeptical because I have used men&#x27;s razors for years to get a closer shave. But now i get that wonderful shave PLUS moisture that we women love.</li>
