      <li>This is a reorder, we love the product so much we are using it as a team.</li>
      <li>It feels fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I noticed immediately upon opening the bottle because the smell, texture, and color of the soap is so much different (BETTER!).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll consider it a success</li>
      <li>It does smell strongly of tea tree oil, which is a major  Ingredient and if you like the fragrance of tea tree oil, you may not like it, but</li>
      <li>Has a bit of a funky smell to it, like a tea tree oil, and doesn&#x27;t make me feel super clean like using regular body wash.</li>
      <li>I hope by removing the jojoba oil they haven&#x27;t made this soap less effective.  </li>
      <li>Updated 5 star review: 5/17/2015 - When my last order ran out I ordered more and the new bottles included the jojoba oil again.  </li>
      <li>I have used lots of things - prescriptions and over the counter products - Defense shower gel works really well for controlling dandruff and eczema.</li>
      <li>My son is a wrestler and it has worked very well in keeping the dreaded ring worm away.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
      <li>It has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feel.  </li>
      <li>This product is pretty effective against fungal skin infections and a big help with kids involved in wrestling and other contact sports.</li>
      <li>My high school wrestling boys haven&#x27;t caught anyskin diseases yet but the season it just getting started.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several years without problems, but my most recent order must contain this new formula</li>
      <li>also bought a small pump dispenser for this, very convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Infinitely better than trying to treat with ointments</li>
      <li>She is very sensitive and this Defense shower gel, is really keeping her legs and arms clear.</li>
      <li>My son uses this product, I haven&#x27;t seen any new fungus.</li>
      <li>so far no skin out breaks on son who use&#x27;s it after his wrestling matches.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this soap forever as long as they don&#x27;t mess with the formula.  :)</li>
      <li>The smell takes a little getting used to (Tea Tree oil like musk) but actually isn&#x27;t that bad after a day or so to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had any skin irritation or infection while using this product which is great as I train 5 or more days a week.</li>
      <li>The color of the soap went from an amber color to colorless, the smell isn&#x27;t nearly as nice now, and the bottoms of my feet have started getting hard and rough again.  </li>
      <li>I had before complained about the shipping and this item, this time when i reordered it was much better ( less than a week ).</li>
      <li>Our new kitten had ringworm (where it started), then the dog, then the other cat, and finally my daughter!  </li>
      <li>But I have not gotten any ringworm since using it, so if you are in any combat sports, this is definitely useful (especially for hard rolling no gi days).</li>

    <li> This stuff smells great.  So far so good.  My high school wrestling boys haven&#x27;t caught anyskin diseases yet but the season it just getting started.  I&#x27;ll consider it a success if we get through the entire season with no infections.</li>
    <li> I have used lots of things - prescriptions and over the counter products - Defense shower gel works really well for controlling dandruff and eczema. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or hair. I am using the shower gel in conjunction with the healing salve. I have also been using the Super Shield Plus in the laundry with great results.</li>
    <li> This product works great!</li>
    <li> This is a reorder, we love the product so much we are using it as a team. I have all the other wrestlers on the team using is without any problems from time out from ringworm!!! Last year one team brought it to a tournament and it cost a lot of wrestlers valuable time off!! Defense is the answer!</li>

    <li> great product, use daily</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  One application a week keeps all the dandruff off my cat.</li>
    <li> Worked very quickly getting rid of ringworm on my shoulders, haven&#x27;t had an issue since.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a small pump dispenser for this, very convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Infinitely better than trying to treat with ointments</li>

    <li> My Son is a Wrestler and seems like ring worm and other crap is almost unavoidable. This stuff works!!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the soap bars</li>
    <li> Both my son and husband wrestle, and use this soap after they get off the mat. It smells great and so far we&#x27;ve had no issues with any skin infections that are common among wrestlers.</li>
    <li> I had before complained about the shipping and this item, this time when i reordered it was much better ( less than a week ). And I reordered because out of all the products I have used this is the best.</li>
    <li> Updated 5 star review: 5/17/2015 - When my last order ran out I ordered more and the new bottles included the jojoba oil again.  I noticed immediately upon opening the bottle because the smell, texture, and color of the soap is so much different (BETTER!).  My guess is either the manufacturer had temporarily run out of jojoba oil, or was messing around with different formulas and temporarily removed it, or maybe I received a knockoff in my last order.  I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m just happy to have it back the way I like it.  Changed my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars based on this.  I will continue to buy this soap forever as long as they don&#x27;t mess with the formula.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old 2 star review: This soap used to be perfect, but recently I think they&#x27;ve changed the formula by removing the jojoba oil (according to another reviewer here).  The color of the soap went from an amber color to colorless, the smell isn&#x27;t nearly as nice now, and the bottoms of my feet have started getting hard and rough again.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several years without problems, but my most recent order must contain this new formula and I don&#x27;t like it as much.  I hope by removing the jojoba oil they haven&#x27;t made this soap less effective.  I checked their website for an explanation and didn&#x27;t see one.</li>
    <li> Smells good and cleans me. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Great soap for after grappling/wrestling.  The smell takes a little getting used to (Tea Tree oil like musk) but actually isn&#x27;t that bad after a day or so to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had any skin irritation or infection while using this product which is great as I train 5 or more days a week.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty effective against fungal skin infections and a big help with kids involved in wrestling and other contact sports. Also great for adults. It has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feel.  It does smell strongly of tea tree oil, which is a major  Ingredient and if you like the fragrance of tea tree oil, you may not like it, but we like it&#x27;s strong clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> Like the bar soap. Great summer time soap. I only use it every two or three days.</li>
    <li> Has a bit of a funky smell to it, like a tea tree oil, and doesn&#x27;t make me feel super clean like using regular body wash. Also a little bit drying on the skin. But I have not gotten any ringworm since using it, so if you are in any combat sports, this is definitely useful (especially for hard rolling no gi days).</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I had a ringworm outbreak on my animals at home.  Our new kitten had ringworm (where it started), then the dog, then the other cat, and finally my daughter!  URGH!!  Everyone was on systemic anti-fungal medication prior to using Defense, but once I gave everyone a bath with DEFENSE shampoo, it only took 2 days to start seeing results! We are now ringworm free.....yay!  I have even gone back to my vet, and told him about it too.  He is now going to recommend it to his patients as well.  Thank you Defense!</li>
    <li> We LOVE this soap. It stinks, but keeps the ringworm and worse away. My boys just follow up with a 3 in 1 that smells good. They use it after every wrestling practice and meet.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, definitely works as advertised!! Took between 1-2 weeks to notice the results with daily use.</li>
