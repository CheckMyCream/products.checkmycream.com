      <li>Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
      <li>The curls did drop throughout the day, but the result was a nice wave that still looked like I had paid attention to my hair that</li>

    <li> Not very good. So far, I haven¬¥t been able to find a suitable adapter for flat iron. Can you help?</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was wanting and absolutely love it.  It straightens the hair fast and efficiently and I would purchase again.  Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> This flat iron exceeded my expections.This flat iron made my hair so silky and shiny.Everything they say about this flat is very true to its word.The only things I dont like about it is the top of the flat iron gets very hot and you have to watch the way you handle it other than the this flat iron in my opinion is better than the chi and I love the way you can lock the temperature you set it on.This is now my favorite flat iron</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I just use it for my bangs, and it works perfect. I really like that it heats up super quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to use. Just loved it!</li>
    <li> doen&#x27;t work well for thick hair</li>
    <li> I really like this flatiron</li>
    <li> This flat iron really does get the job done fast and my hair looks nice</li>
    <li> I bought this iron and i can say that  This product is great, this iron is wonderful , my hair look  beautiful and healthy .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have curly, somewhat coarse hair so I needed something that had adjustable temperature settings.  After the 1st use I was hooked!  It works just as good a a CHI but is only a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> My wife is happy whit this</li>
    <li> Probably the best flat iron I have ever owned. Nuff said</li>
    <li> I really love it.  The only downfall is the red.  I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten the pink one, however i think they were limited edition so I can&#x27;t be to upset.  Works great though, love the heat settings!</li>
    <li> I got this fir Christmas this year, I don&#x27;t think my mom got it from Amazon but when I opened it from the gift wrap I was a little disappointed to see it wasn&#x27;t a salon recommended straighter such as chi, but I decided to give it a shot, I rarely ever straighten my hair so I&#x27;m like why would I need a $100 straightener I&#x27;d use once every 6 months. I have course 4c, 4b African American hair, it&#x27;s unpermed, so I washed my hair, blew it dry and gave it a go with this hair straightener, I&#x27;m absolutely in love it was almost like pressing my hair! It came out so silky smooth and boy does this heat up fast, also there&#x27;s an awesome 4 year warranty on it definitely a thumbs up for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this 1 inch hair straightener but it fell a little short of my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely heats up quickly! I had to be careful not to put the temp too high.&lt;br /&gt;The cord was a good length.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to hold/handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The straightener has to be held tightly to straighten properly and the plates seemed to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at my hair. I couldn&#x27;t get a smooth pass over the hair. I thought it was the plates not floating properly? Anyway, whatever the cause, I tried loosening my grip and then didn&#x27;t have as good a result of straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it isn&#x27;t a bad deal, but my experience sent me back to my old straightener.</li>
    <li> Tnx...it was very amazing üëçüèª</li>
    <li> This review is from my wife since she is the one that uses hair straighteners around this house...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: heats up quickly, adjustable heat levels; it has a lock to keep it closed which is nice for storing it and probably a little safer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The outside of the straightener gets pretty hot where the plates are (you don‚Äôt really hold this part, but my hand tends to slide up there while I‚Äôm using it); it does an okay job of straightening, but I like other straighteners that I‚Äôve used better.</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth Remington Flat Iron and it&#x27;s not my favorite one. This ceramic iron has a bit of a flimsy feel to it. It may be because it&#x27;s a 1 inch but compared to the other Remington flat iron I have which I use daily, it feels lighter and doesn&#x27;t work as well. You have to hold the plates tightly for the iron to work and it feels a little snaggy when it runs down my hair and doesn&#x27;t clamp down on my hair very well. The other model I own is more substantial and works easier than this model. As far as the Silk, you still really have to protect your hair with heat protector or at high temps it will still fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two big pros to this model though. It heats up very fast and gets super hot-which are two pluses that are important. This model may work well for short, fine hair and hair you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time with a flat iron on. Personally, I&#x27;d have to give this one a C.</li>
    <li> this works very well, I got it for my wife and she does really like it, but it does not have a flat side to it, so it tends to roll around when she sets it on the counter.</li>
    <li> it just okay. It heats up very fast thats what i like about it.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t snag my hair. Slight burning plastic smell at first but it&#x27;s gone</li>
    <li> Not best quality but definatly got what paid for and its better than the one I was using</li>
    <li> Really good for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons more than humans lol..people if your looking for a affordable salon quality curling iron THIS IS IT!!! The wait is over and you have change left over as well! Lol</li>
    <li> I received this through the Vine program but would still think it was a bargain if I&#x27;d paid for it. I&#x27;ve been buying drugstore flat irons, usually the cheapest one in the store for $25 or so, and was happy enough with them, but never again!  This flat iron does everything right and for only a little more money.  I love the temperature control, the lock to keep it closed when not in use, and the swivel cord.  I have thin but wavy hair and the low temp works for me, and the plates leave my hair smooth and soft, not &#x27;fried&#x27; feeling.  I haven&#x27;t tested the higher heats on thicker hair but I suspect that it would get the job done.</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace my old Revlon straightener - it was a cheaper drug store model that I have had for almost 10 years.  It still works but I need multiple passes on my hair (fine, easy to straighten) and have to turn it to the highest temp setting (dial up to 25 - no idea what temperature that is).  After reading numerous reviews on this model, several other Remingtons, as well as CHI and HSI models, I decided to try this - it seemed like you could still get a great flatiron for under $50 and again, I have easy to straighten hair so I didn&#x27;t think I needed a professional iron.&lt;br /&gt;This iron pulls my hair out so badly!!!  I am not sure the plates are fully ceramic or just plated - there is a big difference!  This iron pulls out so much hair because it sticks and it does a lesser job straightening than my Revlon model.  Also, it does not include a heat pad/case and the temperatures increase in increments of 20 on an even scale (i.e. 380, 400, 420, etc.).  Unfortunately, I am beyond the window to return so will be donating this or selling it somewhere else as I will never use it on my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I spoke with a hair stylist friend (who educated me about the ceramic plates) and ordered the FHI Heat Platform Plus.  As much as I love Amazon, I ordered it on Folica.com because the device warranty doesn&#x27;t cover unauthorized online retailers and I didn&#x27;t want to risk jeopardizing the 2 year warranty on it.</li>
    <li> The Remington S9600 Flat Iron works well for anyone who needs to style their hair in a hurry. We have used (my wife and daughter) more expensive brands without any real difference in performance. The Remington heats up quickly, has variable temperature settings, and glides easily across your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up very quickly - under 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Automatic turnoff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Digital display that allows you to set the temperature in increments of 5 degrees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cord is definitely long enough for use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cord rotates within the flat iron so that it does twist/knot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Clamps and glides easy over hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The narrow width makes it helpful for hard to reach areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Area for improvement -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- At this width it does not lay flat on the counter - there is some worry that if the heating element touches some counter-top surfaces it may damage the counter or the flat iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - With the exception of the difficultly in making it lay flat the Remington S9600 is a high quality and affordable flat iron option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a slim enough, temperature controlled flat iron for my little girl&#x27;s hair and this was the answer. I knew the wrong type iron will leave them scared about the process so I wanted something that had a protective edge so it never felt like their scalp was burning up. Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it at any temperature higher than 325degF because above that, the heat damage to curly hair can be irreversible. This one starts at 300degF so low temperature control earns it a fourth star.</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair which I must iron to finish my straight hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a digital temperature reading which can be turned up to 455 F, and you can easily read on the handle. It has a good handle to grip on and I can finish my slightly below my shoulder hair in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that like with all flat irons, you should NEVER flat iron wet hair (this will fry your hair, and create split ends) Always flat iron when your hair is just slightly damp or near dry. I blow dry my hair straight on a medium setting, then I apply a serum before ironing it. You should always use a heat protecting hair care product like a spray, serum, mousse or cream before subjecting your strands to high temperatures from irons and dryers. It will also make it shinier as you apply the iron to your hair, especially if you use a serum as the oil in the serum gets &amp;#34;heated up&amp;#34; or activated by the iron creating a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are done, if you live in a humid area, be sure to apply Anti-Humidity hairspray to lock in your finished look! (yep those sprays exist!)</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have very curly hair. I gave up trying to straighten our hair years ago. I guess I wasn&#x27;t using the right flat irons, because.... I have straight hair right now! I was shocked when I was able to smooth out my hair without any products and just a few swipes of this iron! I used the highest temperature to straighten mine, but my daughter uses the lowest setting and still gets pin straight hair. We love this iron! I&#x27;m tempted to buy another one for backup! Can&#x27;t recommend this iron enough!</li>
    <li> The flat iron came in a plain plastic bag.  When I opened it, there were scratches and gouges...it&#x27;s obvious that this was either used or a floor model.  I returned it for the HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON and am completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical on purchasing this flat iron, but my sister has an older model that she swears by so I thought I would give it a shot. I am African-American with thick, coarse relaxed hair and yaki hair extensions...I said all of that to say that my hair is thick and it&#x27;s hard to straighten or hold a curl without practically burning my hair. I was VERY impressed with the performance of this tool! It took less than a minute to achieve full heat at 420 degrees.....I probably could have done 400, but I wanted to make sure it would be effective.....I also used Tresemme heat protection spray to help with styling.  The iron gripped my hair tightly without breaking it, and it glided through my hair without snagging. The edges are curved, so I was able to put some curls in that weren&#x27;t too tight or too loose. I also have bangs, and the iron was small enough to get close to the root so I could put a little bump curl in front. The best part is that there was also no burning smell. The curls did drop throughout the day, but the result was a nice wave that still looked like I had paid attention to my hair that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the iron was very reasonable and overall I feel like it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great product!!! This is my second Remington flat iron and the first one was good too! But this is amazing, it makes so smooth and soft my hair. I love it and definitely recommend!!  Berrin</li>
    <li> This is with out a doubt the best flat iron I have ever used. My old flat iron even though it was brand new didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten the ends of my hair so it would still come out with a curl. Needless to say I no longer have this issue.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, this flat iron is attractive and fits in your hand easily.  It is autoset to 380* and that is  hot for my thick, medium textured and highlighted hair,  LED read out right on top with a simple up and down +/- control setting to raise and lower the temp made it easy to set exactly.  The short instructions indicate the proper temperature for your own type of hair.  The rounded edges are nice, and seem to make it easier to use.  I&#x27;ve also been able to use it to flip the ends into a curl or even twist into a wave.  I like that it has a swivel cord so you can twist the iron and the cord swivels with your movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the test of a flat iron is 1:  Does it do what it is supposed to do?  In this case, it easily straightens my hair.  It just depends on the heat setting as to how fast you want to do it.  With this, you can precisely set your best temp.  2:  Does is have an auto-shut off, so I don&#x27;t have to wonder if I&#x27;m going to burn my house down? (this one does).  And 3:  Does it hold up over time and use with styling products and still work perfectly?  I can answer yes to the first two, and get back to you on the third when I&#x27;ve</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gf and she love it, exelente price for the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Remington s9600B PINK ceramic flat iron, 1 inch. But instead I recivied the S-9600 reds.  It came with scratches on The outside. Also the ceramic flats are not pair, it closes from the top but at the end doesn&#x27;t close. I want to know what do I have to do to get the product that I asked for.</li>
    <li> (review from my daughter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron works well, and covers a decent amount of hair in a quick time period. The quick heating is critical for those mornings when you&#x27;re getting ready for school and need to do your hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temperature gauge is kind of pointless. Might as well just have Low, Medium, High, etc. who really cares what the temperature is besides being a novelty item.</li>
    <li> Everything about the iron looked great esp all of the features. There are 2 major issues that I&#x27;m not liking.&lt;br /&gt;1: the polarized plug doesn&#x27;t fit the outlet I have in the bathroom that has the water/shock feature built in. Even though other irons fit, this one seems to have thicker prongs. I can work around it at home, but this can be a problem for travel if it&#x27;s not \\&quot;universal\\&quot; enough.&lt;br /&gt;2: like other ppl have mentioned, the hair slides out when doing a one hand clamp. You have to use both hands for each swipe to ensure up contact. When I hold the 2 arms together, there&#x27;s a gap between them. Well, there&#x27;s my answer, it&#x27;s a design problem.&lt;br /&gt;A minor issue is the LED is dim and hard to see. Maybe it&#x27;s just on this iron?&lt;br /&gt;Other than these 2 items, the iron works well. I have thick hair so I need to keep it at the max 455</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron purchase. The price is good, spent less than 30$. I like that you can control the heat setting from 300 to 450. I set it at the lowest 300 and it did not burn my hair and I finished curling my hair in no time. I like this product</li>
    <li> This is a nice straightener for this price range. It heats up to 455 degrees very quickly. The digital display is nice and the control buttons are easy to use. There is just a power button and up &amp; down buttons for the temperature. They are on the side, but not in the way while using. I don&#x27;t experience any snagging of the hair. My hair turns out nice and smooth when using it, but I do have a bit more fly-aways than when I use my T3 straightener. The cord is on a swivel, so it won&#x27;t get twisted up. Overall it feels well made and solid.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair to shoulder length and needed a narrower flat iron. This product works great, is light weight and easy to use.  I have very thick, very curly hair, which I wouldn&#x27;t trade, but sometimes you just want a more sleek look. As recommended I put the heat to higher settings, which works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Remember not to use on damp hair (when it&#x27;s more fragile), If you have the time, let your hair dry naturally (maybe pull back into a bun or scrunchy to keep the curl down). If not, blow dry with a big brush, then use your flat iron. After straightening your hair, hit it with the blow dryer set on COOL. This will will close the hair cuticles and also \\&quot;set\\&quot; the hair to minimize any slight frizzing later.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick hair with some stubborn waves underneath, this iron works GREAT! I leave for work early in the morning and do not like to use the hair dryer for fear of waking up my family. This Iron heats to full heat so fast it is amazing! I&#x27;d say less than 20 seconds. It is fairly light weight which is great. The plates glide very smoothly over my hair. No pulling at all. I would never spend too much on a flat iron because of past disappointments, but with this one there is no need. It is pretty inexpensive. I would absolutely recommend trying this one. I love mine!</li>
    <li> Reached on time, was shipped safely. I was very impresssed and pleased with the service I received. Flat iron worked really well, and I have very thick curly frizzy hair, it left my hair smooth for days</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s your typical flat iron. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s something terrible, but it&#x27;s most definitely nothing special. The silk plates don&#x27;t give off any extra shine to your hair. Also, while straightening, the plates made a sound like they were grating against rocks or something- didn&#x27;t feel smooth. I&#x27;m returning it because I&#x27;m looking for an iron that will straighten my lots of Middle Eastern thick, curly hair easier so I&#x27;m not straightening one itty-bitty section for 15 minutes and sweating a ton from the heat emanating from the iron.</li>
    <li> Worked fine- did a pretty good job as far as straightening but would&#x27;ve liked for it to have been a tad wider to hold more hair in one pass and get the job done quicker. Outer appearance is nice, deep red color, made well, and has some nice features like the digital thermometer and a swivel cord- also heated up extremely quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this one somewhere between 3-4 stars depending on what you&#x27;re looking for. I wish it was wider, the one I received was a one inch, not a 2 inch. After using the product hair turned out straight and looked good though I wasn&#x27;t blown away though it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m somewhat happy with this one just wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my extremely expensive straightener I&#x27;ve had for years after it finally blew a fuse and got this one based off of the reviews - I&#x27;m quite pleased with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quickly and almost just as importantly it seems to cool down WAY faster than straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past, which means I don&#x27;t have to leave it out on the bathroom counter all day, I can put it away before leaving without worrying about it melting something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self timer is pretty nice too if you&#x27;re the forgetful type like me! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The truth is I have manageable hear but it is quite curly. This little iron is fantastic. It has settings I will never need. I have it on the second temp setting and it makes my hair smooth and soft. It rests nicely when I set it down , it doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers or scalp when it gets close and I can just go fast with it and do my whole head in 10 min. I totally love it. Recently a friend came to visit not at all versed in irons and she used it once and fell in love with it as well.</li>
    <li> I just go it in the mail today and it took some time considering I live in Canada so It took 11 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 13 and was using the instyler but it never really straightened my hair before. I just tried it and it works amazing my hair wasn&#x27;t shiny but my hair is dead/bleached/dyed aswell. That&#x27;s all I can give you and I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It got a 4 star cause I just got it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It been about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m INLOVE with it, it give great curls and my straight hair last all day. That impressive since it mean going through the snow,hats and hood and not a kink. So Yeah... get it!</li>
    <li> In the past I have not really been impressed with any of the styling tools from Remington but I decided to give this particular flat iron a try and once again I was disappointed. First off the look of this flat iron is very nice...the bold red color, adjustable temp, swivel cord, etc... is a plus but the overall function of the flat iron is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is a 1inch flat iron it seems pretty bulky and not as sleek as other flat irons I have used. The worse part is that it does not grip your hair tight enough for it to even get straight the first time, therefore you will have to make at least 3 passes (or more) on a section of your hair for it to get straight which is a negative for me. This is one flat iron that will defiantly leave your hair with extreme heat damage. Stay away!</li>
    <li> The Remington S9600 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron heats quick and does a great job. My hair is naturally wavy. I usually wash my hair at night and in the morning I can quickly make my kind of scary morning hair manageable in just a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> AMAZING !!!  Many heat settings, heats up fast and smoothly straightens my hair in seconds.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
    <li> This item was delivered fast and on time.  It is a nice flat iron.  I am a novice flat iron user, but would recommend this product.  It is lightweight, easy to use and leaves my hair shiny, not dry and breaking.  It heats up extremely fast which is a big plus for busy mornings.</li>
    <li> This has been so helpful in improving my hair styling - I&#x27;m not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but this does a great job on straightening my slightly wavy hair, even the bleached bits. I&#x27;ve not turned it up to max to see just how hot it can go, but the standard setting on it works perfectly for my purposes. The width is great, but if you&#x27;re a lefty, just be aware that the display will be upside down. It came with directions for wet hair, and mentioned a red light that would turn on when it was ready - but I&#x27;m not sure how it would display red, when the display is blue. Either way, it&#x27;s been great for my limited purposes, as long as my hair is mostly dry when I start.</li>
    <li> It works fairly well for my hair :) It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all really and keeps it soft and silky. Of course I use a moisturizer and heat protectant spray beforehand (I recommend that for any flat iron) But it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far :] And it&#x27;s big enough for bangs and small enough to stash anywhere I haven&#x27;t really straightened my hair in a while (Going natural so it&#x27;s only my bang I&#x27;m flat ironing) So after I&#x27;m done my natural journey in December I&#x27;ll start using it more often and edit it :D</li>
    <li> I got this straightener from KMart a couple months ago. And I have thick, course, naturally curly hair. I am mixed race so my hair has different textures to it. And I wanted a straightener that would really get down to the roots of my hair and get those straight,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since that is where keeping your hair straight starts. I was using another straightener and had it for 2 years and it totally died on me, but it also was a 2 inch one. Which wasn&#x27;t getting down to my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Googled which straightener inch would be best for thick hair and they said the 1 inch is the best. So I went with this one at KMart. I will break down what I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product look: Very sleek. Very thin and smooth texture. The plates are also very smooth and the LCD screen is a nice touch. You can easily see what temperature you are going up to and it goes up to 455. It heats up very very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the 455 heat setting for my hair. The cord is long, not as long as others, but it&#x27;s still longer than most drug store straighteners. The red color is very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use: This product is very slippery as far as holding it goes. It&#x27;s so smooth in texture that you need to hold it more towards the top where the two finger grips are so your hand does not slip while using it. But.. I like to hold my straightener at the  base because that is most comfortable for me. If you use it up to 455 like I do, then be careful because of course it&#x27;s hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the plates slide right through my hair and it does get down to the root which is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all thoughts: This straightener is a very good one that doesn&#x27;t cost over $50. It does the job especially for thick hair. It leaves my hair very very silky feeling. It does NOT leave my hair with a burnt smell and doesn&#x27;t smell like that while using it. Even though I use it on the highest setting. This straightener will get your hair very smooth and very much frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Use a good hair oil and a heat protectant. I suggest using an oil with Moroccan or Argon oil in it. And I use the Brazilian Keratin heat therapy spray which is found at most drug stores and Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That really helps protect my hair and keeps it smooth. Section your hair is an many sections as you can to help with the process and so you can get smaller sections easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clip up the top half of my hair with one clip, then take the rest and pull it up in another clip, leaving a little bit at the bottom and on the sides out. I leave my side bangs free as well as I do those first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this straightener to anybody who has thick hair and wants it to be smooth and stay smooth.Tips: Use a good hair oil and a heat protectant.

    <li> I&#x27;m totally new to hair straightening, it is my first iron, and I just love the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast, beautiful, really good product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. Maybe the reviews hyped it up so much that I had unreasonable expectations... It does a very respectable job but it&#x27;s not \\&quot; blown away!! Omergood\\&quot; worthy. Still, very decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit ****6 months later *****&lt;br /&gt;One drawback for me.. The placement of the temperature buttons make it that you keep inadvertently pressing the + or - ( or even power) buttons when gliding the flat iron on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had too many times where all of a sudden , my hair is smoking and I wonder \\&quot;what the heck?\\&quot; and it turns out I pressed the temperature all the way to 455 !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a major, major flaw but kinda inconvenient ..</li>
    <li> This flat iron is excellent high temperature reached quickly, is ideal for applying keratin treatment, the hair iron can be closed for storage and also has a turbo button for even faster hot iron, I am very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> We bought two of these for friends in Honduras. One broke on the second day. The other is still working, as far as I know.</li>
    <li> The Flat iron was chipped, it was in a white box And not the original packaging. The button ti decrease heat And loco temperature does not work at all. The performances of the Flat iron is good, it leaves my Hair pretty silky And no frizz at all</li>
    <li> I had the purple straightener for a year until it broke due to water damage. So I came on hear and ordered it again in pink. I was excited for when it was coming but when I opened the package I saw a red straightener and not a purple one . I was disappointed so I returned it and ordered a new &amp;#34;pink one&amp;#34; we&#x27;ll see what happens.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick, very wavy hair that can be a little impossible at times (her words- not mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So she likes to straighten it a couple times a week. This is the best flat iron she&#x27;s used to date. The plates meet up smoothly, and using it with a heat protectant spray- this smooths her hair super sleek and shiny. It heats up fast and works fast. It does get really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my already straight hair to add a little body at the top and that&#x27;s really quick as well. It also works well to add shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> Having curly hair presents its challenges, but these flat irons lived up to the test.  At the highest setting, I was able to straighten my hair in under an hour with very little &#x27;do overs.&#x27;  At that temperature, the irons get really hot to touch and I found laying them flat a bit challenging.  I really like the locking option as it took me a few times cutting it off to decide to use the feature and it works perfectly.  I recommend these irons to people who need relatively high heat to straighten hair.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest. If you&#x27;re serious about the quality of your flat iron, you want a Baby Bliss, not a Remington. However, as far as Remington&#x27;s go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington in the 24th and a half century!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington seems to have gone all-out on futuristic features (if you can believe that). What am I talking about? Digital read out for temperature. Buttons instead of dials. Automatic shut-off after an hour. Fine temperature controls. A power button to turn off (no accidental power-off during use). Beveled edge at the end so you can hold the plates shut without burning your fingers. A swiveling cord so it doesn&#x27;t tangle. A body engineered to stay cool with plates at full heat. Well...that&#x27;s great! But just the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plates don&#x27;t offer as much control when attempting to do curls or waves (you better ONLY want to straighten your hair). Takes at least 30 seconds to heat-up instead of the advertised 15 (possible false advertising). Plates are set too close to the edges so there is possibility of self-injury due to burns. &amp;#34;Silk-infused&amp;#34; plates is an advertising gimmick (won&#x27;t do anything to improve hair quality).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the world&#x27;s best straightener (that would be Baby Bliss) but it&#x27;s quite far from the worst. For the average consumer it&#x27;s going to be great. Definitely worth the thirty dollar asking price. Four and half stars.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron. It works great.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s review since I don&#x27;t straighten my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair that can be really hard to maintain. This hair straightener really does the trick, my hair comes out straight and soft every time. It can also do nice elegant curls as well. Before this straightener, I used the Instyler. This one works as well as the Instyler with a much better price range. The only time I prefer the Instyler to this one is when I want to straighten my hair when it is wet. In this case, the Remington does not work as well.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it. A expensive flat iron can do the same things this one do. It flattens &amp; glides. It&#x27;s pretty good. All Remington&#x27;s are pretty good. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixxed and it works great when I use it I can flip my hair like I&#x27;m white</li>
    <li> Love that this flat iron has multiple heat selections, because most irons get much too hot for my fine hair. The cord swivels, it is very easy to use, has a lock so that you don&#x27;t accidentally change the temperature while using, and doesn&#x27;t snag or pull out my hair like some. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Such a great straightener, especially considering the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently cut my hair in an angled bob style. Since my hair had always been very long the straightener I had was much too wide for my new style so I gave this one a try. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! It heats up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull or tug on my hair. I can do a straight, sleek style or make loose waves with great results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about getting a flat iron priced under $50, but I ended up thoroughly impressed! It is light weight, has digital temperature controls, and heats up lightning fast. It heats up quicker than the $150 flat iron I previously owned. I&#x27;m a big fan of the 1 hour shut off feature because there has been a time or two I&#x27;ve been in a rush and forgot to turn my iron off. Very good safety feature to have! I&#x27;m ecstatic about this product!</li>
    <li> Good, really good product. My wife is happy with it. thks</li>
    <li> This is perfect! Warms up so quick! I&#x27;ve  had for about 6 or 7 months , does a great job with my thick hair</li>
    <li> Great straightener. I got the matching blow dryer and used together or separately my hait feels phenomenally soft and smooth. I was between this and the remington pearl ceramic for the longest time but I chose this because of the newer technology</li>
    <li> I bought this iron thinking maybe it would do better on my thin yucky hair, but it seems to do only a little bit better than the cheap Revlon irons I have tried.</li>
    <li> I had a salon level flat iron before this so keep in mind my opinion will be slightly jaded.&lt;br /&gt;I will say for the price this is a decent flat iron.  It heats up quick, feels smooth when flattening, and is a simple design and lightweight.  The power chord could be a bit longer, but then most non-salon grade products have shorter cables anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything in regards to longevity since I haven&#x27;t had it long, but for now the plates are smooth, and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll go for a wider plate, I was too used to having a 1.5&amp;#34; one.  As for the &amp;#34;SILK powder coating is infused onto the iron&#x27;s high-grade ceramic plates,&amp;#34; who knows how long that &amp;#34;powder coating&amp;#34; will last.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fantastic because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it heats fast&lt;br /&gt;2. it has variable heat settings so you have full control&lt;br /&gt;3. It heats to a 455-degree high heat so my stubborn curly hair gets flat in one pass&lt;br /&gt;4. it has tilting metal plates that move in and out to the depth of the hair you place within the plates&lt;br /&gt;5. the plates are smooth and don&#x27;t tangle or snag my hair&lt;br /&gt;6. it does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron, I have nothing bad to say... it gets very hot, very quickly. Straightens hair perfectly and quickly.  No static.  Loved how I could change the temperature to lower heat and it adjusts quickly.  The handle is a great grip. Definitely recommend. I love the red color.</li>
    <li> It works great and does what it needs to do.its great for pressing hair and I love the high heat setting</li>
    <li> My last flat iron was an FHI, it was one of those with only one heat setting. Although it worked well, I felt the temperature was a bit too high for my hair type (I have thick hair, but it straightens fairly easily.)  I started noticing slight breakage and static after awhile. I definitely needed temperature control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the performance of this flat iron. It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold while styling. A nice clear digital temperature reading. There&#x27;s two buttons on the side (click up or down) to set the temp that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the floating plates, they make the whole process much faster. Glides easily through each section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington S9600 Silk Ceramic (1in.) flat iron, fits the bill for me. No breakage due to an overly high heat setting (yay, for temp control!), and I didn&#x27;t have to spray a ton of Static Guard on my hairbrush. Smooth straight hair. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Best feature: has a lock mechanism for the paddles.  You can lock is shut for easy storing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this on several occasions and it really does heat up in 15 seconds which is fantastic for the days when I am in a hurry.  It&#x27;s also light weight which helps a lot when my arms get tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is the best flat iron I have used ever.  Must have!</li>
    <li> This Remington Silk Ceramic 1-inch flat iron is amazing. But warning, it gets really hot really fast. Be careful (goes up to 455 degrees which I believe would be considered \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot;). What I like best about this iron is that it has a digital display so you can actually see the temperature. This is a nice addition to home flat irons. Very easy to reduce the heat quickly if necessary. I find that it works a bit quicker than even my Chi which I have to run over each hair segment three or four times. This one needed just one or two passes. Left me with no static or frizz whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this iron. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had read a lot about this new product a while back but was a bit skeptical. Ordered it for the Summer since my hair is a frizz ball. It really, really works! My hair really felt silky and straight after I used it. Thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have very wavy hair that sometimes goes a little frizzy. It&#x27;s nice to have the option to straighten it, but I am not hair appliance-savvy. This flat iron was so easy to use. The temperature is adjustable so you don&#x27;t fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very quickly, which is nice because I have long, thick hair and I don&#x27;t want to spend all day styling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. I can&#x27;t come up with any negatives.</li>
    <li> Love the adjustable settings for different types of hair. I have very long wavy thick hair. This flat iron heats up quickly and smooths out my hair easily. I have no complaints, the product performs as promised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a flat iron for some time.  But using this one I discovered what the difference a HOT flat iron makes.  Makes it much easier to style my hair.  But a work of caution don&#x27;t get your fingers too close to the heating pads, or the flat iron too close to your ears.</li>
    <li> A good replacement for my old Remington flat iron.  Certainly, works pretty well and easy to use as usual.</li>
    <li> best product for best price</li>
    <li> I really liked the product, heated very fast , the only downside is that buy two pinks but they came in red!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Mucho cuidado cuando vendan productos sin su caja original.</li>
    <li> It works great so far, I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months. I like that I can adjust the temperature, but I don&#x27;t like how hot it can get on the opposite side of the plates. It&#x27;s not going to burn you, but it&#x27;s not very comfortable if you hold that area when you use it. The one I received was red, which was dissapointing since I love pink, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t break I&#x27;m happy. Good product for the price, I usually go for a chi, but they tend to break unexpectedly (I usually get 4 years or so of use). I&#x27;m hopeful that this will last at least a year or two, maybe more, and it is comparable to a chi. If it weren&#x27;t for the hot exterior opposite the plates I would give this streightener 5 stars. It fits comfortably in my hand, and heats up quickly. Definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my adult daughter and she was very pleased with it. It is a nice size and weight. The ability to adjust the temp to your liking is the best. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through quite a few hair straighteners, and this one is my favorite! I have long, thick, wavy hair that gets super frizzy.  I love the digital display and that my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught up in it.  It glides nicely and only takes one or two times to get it completely straight.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t take forever to heat up and that it works so well! The other thing I like is that it leaves my hair smooth enough to skip the smoothing serums that I used to have to put in my hair.  Love love love it and highly recommend it.  (For my hair, I use the 455 degree setting but each experience might be different depending on hair type and temperature, so experiment to find the right temperature for you.)</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. Glides right through hair and leaves it complete straight! Does not pull on ahoy like some straighteners.</li>
    <li> Great product and a good price</li>
