<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells like playdough or something but I guess it works.</li>
    <li> As usual, the Australian Gold comes through.  It won&#x27;t get you really dark, but it gets you noticeably darker then you were when you first got into the tanning bed. Smells okay too.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Noticed a slight difference within the first use. Hope it makes me darker. Will continue use. Love how it&#x27;s cheaper on here then in salons !!</li>
    <li> Love this product makes you tan really dark.&lt;br /&gt;A great tannning lotion would recommend it  to everyone who loves to tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big into tanning but this product seems to work fine. The scent is fine.  I&#x27;m aware of Australian Gold&#x27;s reputation and I trust it so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion to use to get your tan started.  I have already used one bottle and this is my second.  no streaking or burning and leaves your skin soft.  The smell is ok but I always shower after tanning.  Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> Like the product. It arrived on time, was packaged securely it just has a darker bronzer than I am used to but you will see definite results, just make sure to rub in evenly.</li>
    <li> After a few days I noticed a difference in my color. It creates an even brozed color. It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. Has a wobderful smell and does the job wonderfully. I would order it again if needed.</li>
    <li> I like the Australian Gold tanning products and this one has become one of my favorites. The bronzer gives a nice little boost of color and is easy to apply. I think the best feature is the &amp;#34;hemp&amp;#34; smell of the product</li>
    <li> Smells good, gives a great bronze color and was sooo much cheaper on here than in the salon. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Not the best smell in the world, definitely smells like tanning lotion, but it works and it&#x27;s a great price. See results every time I use it, several shades darker, and not orange. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again as it&#x27;s about 1/4 of the price of the lotion I was using before.</li>
    <li> No problems with shipment. Just didn&#x27;t like product. Watery and I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Good  product,  minimal  bronzer</li>
    <li> Love it smells amazing and works really well to darken.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal. Not an imitation but, it did little for me. I used it for over two weeks, everyday. I stopped using it and went to a different lotion and had a tan in about 3 days.  It does not have a bad smell before or after laying. kind of clean. I compared it to the lotion that was at my local salon. It seemed to be genuine. It just did not work for me. I am fair skinned, I burn but tan pretty easily. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin. I did kinda notice that while using it, my skin seemed to be very dry. That could have just been my imagination also. I can&#x27;t chock that up to the lotion completely. It could have been a coincidence. But, I felt that it was worth mentioning. Also purchased from Green Web Inc.</li>
    <li> You know I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but looks good</li>
    <li> I saw results within days and it&#x27;s a very good value.  This product sells in the Salons for $30.00 and up!</li>
    <li> For the price of this, I buy it at the salon for $15, and it works *really* well. I&#x27;m very fair and only tan for about a month to two before vacationing to ensure I won&#x27;t burn during vacation and this gives amazing color, smells great, and is a great investment.</li>
    <li> My favorite bronzing lotion - very effective!</li>
    <li> This lotion is okay. It dries fast so you don&#x27;t slid around in the bed. I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in using this lotion and not using lotion at all. it smells good until you get out of the bed. I recommend this for new for tanners. If you can&#x27;t find another product. But The shipping was fast. I got in in three days.</li>
    <li> I received my order 2 days early which is a huge plus :) however the product itself was just simply okay. I don&#x27;t know why they say it has 30X bronzers because i sure didn&#x27;t see it and i wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell at all, it has that nasty after tan smell that i hate so much, but the lotion is fairly inexpensive so i guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I ordered this from RI on Tuesday evening and it was at my home in GA on Friday morning, very prompt shipping which I love! As for the product itself, I love Austrailian Gold products and this has been working really well for me for about 3 months. Im a pale Irish girl but this stuff helps me stay tan and actually prolongs my tan when I cant make it to the salon.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Product came just as pictured and described!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It is my 3 one that I bought. Girls, just amazing! That&#x27;s a Brazilian who is saying... PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> This was the actual product, not a fake lotion. Works really well and doesn&#x27;t stink! I used to spend money on products like cypher but this does as good of job!</li>
    <li> love the lotion will order again and would recommend to other people. bronzes very well and a good price ok</li>
    <li> This lotion is absolutely AMAZING! I just used it for the first time today and I already see a dramatic difference, and I haven&#x27;t gone in over a month and it looks amazing! I recommend  this lotion.</li>
    <li> luv the lotion...works and  smells great</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product and I love it. I typcially buy 1 tanning package a year to get ready for boating season and this stuff is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve found without breaking the bank. It&#x27;s smells good, it&#x27;s not greasy and it leaves your skin a nice dark bronze color. I love using it for indoor tanning as well as out on the boat.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion came packaged up, and as described.  I like the smell of it, and it does have some bronzer in it which I like.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion 3 or 4 times now and I have only slightly gotten some color. I will being going back to sinfully black which made a huge difference in just a couple tans.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in over a year.... Bought this and used it twice, I already look like I&#x27;ve been tanning for a month! Got my really dark FAST!!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Great skin moisturizer, and love the smell. Looks good on the shelf with my other 1/2 dozen AG products.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion, not oily or greasy where you feel you need a shower as soon as you put it on.  Also gives you a very deep dark rich tan.  Bought two bottle here for less than the price at the local tanning salon.  Will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> Decent, okay, not the best but worth a try. I tan very easily so this may work for other skin types...</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my niece...she buys it at the tanning salon for $60 a bottle.  This was a lot less even with the shipping.  The seller shipped very fast.  She loved it and we will be ordering again.  She has told all her friends and they are now ordering from here too!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with using this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t stink but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t smell good. Lotion is very thin and watery.</li>
    <li> This is product that met my expectations</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does give a good tan when using in the tanning beds.  It has a better smell than the usual tanning gels.  I would recommend you wash your hands after applying to your body before you tan.</li>
    <li> Get product!!! Deep bronze tan that last. Not to mention the great price and excellent smell. I will def. continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great. Makes my skin incredibly soft. Recommend to those wanting something a little cheaper to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will work. I don&#x27;t do beds. Or lay out in the sun and bake for hours like I used to years ago. However, I would still like to have some nice color for summer time. I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait and see :)</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I had read reviews and heard good things about this tanning bed lotion.  The price was good, and the delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> I love hardcore black, it smells amazing and it gives a great tan, I pair it with my snooki lotion and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Great lotion for the price!  Will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great at getting you darker but the only problem is that I have a clear line down both of my sides. In not sure why. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years &amp; have used probably 30 different lotions &amp; I&#x27;ve never had dark lines from any tanning lotion before until now.</li>
    <li> Just as described Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion based on the reviews and the Brand.  While I do like Australian Gold, this is not one of my favorites.  The smell of it is ok but I didn&#x27;t seem to notice that my color was any better than some of the other products I&#x27;ve used of theirs.  The price was ok but I think that the products I&#x27;ve paid more for in the salons seem to work better.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells great, not too sticky and works great indoors or outdoors. Excellent price as well.</li>
    <li> Im not impressed with this lotion.. It smells good though. When I saw HARD CORE BLACK 30X yada yada yada.. I was expecting some hard core bronzers and didnt get it. It shipped super fast I was pleased with that wish I liked the product better. So far my favorite (I am on about my tenth lotion) lotion is the kardashian special event bronzer. Tribute was also decent.</li>
    <li> Dont spend all kinds of money on lotion just because it has a celebrity name thrown in the name. This is all you need. Cant believe how fast I got dark (and i used to spend $$$ on lotion). This will be my choice from here on out.</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii but this is my favorite so far and I&#x27;ve tried a ton! This one smells great and gives an even tan!</li>
    <li> The lotion is amazing! I started getting dark after only using it 2 times!! I would highly recommend it!!! Also it arrived fast!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion in the past and had great results so I decided to order it and give it another try.  As expected, it worked great.  My skin tends to tan easily, but with this lotion, I saw almost instant results after my first time tanning even though I hadn&#x27;t had a chance to tan in months.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pale, so tanning isnt an easy thing for me, but this lotion is awesome!!  I have noticed just after 2 times that i am getting that nice deep golden brown color.  I was scared that I would get the orange color, but not with this lotion.  my daughter says it smells a little like chocolate...  I dont know if i would say chocolate, but its not a horrible smell.  I will def get this lotion again!!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion a lot! I got a few shades darker with it and it smells good! I would recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> Good product and very fair price. I thought it would have a light tingle but there is none.... I would buy again, but also would select something with a bit more bronzer and tingle. Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> This bronzing lotion is sold at a great price. This product works great! One of the best lotions for the price.</li>
    <li> I wanted a tan cream for the month I bought at a tanning salon.  I liked this product very much.  It helped me get tan.</li>
    <li> Drys out skin terribly. Has the odor we all hate and did not bronze my skin at all. I did finally find a great bronzer.  Check my reviews by clicking reviews by my name.</li>
    <li> Nice coloring before and after, I even have used as body lotion for a little &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color.</li>
    <li> it works really well and has a light scent unlike some tanning lotions that give you a headache. It&#x27;s a really great price for how well it works. Definitely purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and the product works better than any other tanning lotion!! I would recommend it for just sun tanning.</li>
    <li> This lotion just didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other bronzers I&#x27;ve tried. Could have been the bed, so I don&#x27;t fault it completely. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion first time at salon yrs ago ,I use with natural Sun light love how dark I get, however every skin tone is different and finally found one that works</li>
    <li> This is a great tanner that my wife uses when she goes to the tanning salon or the beach. It works really good and gives her a nice dark color. It smells really really good as well. :D</li>
    <li> Smells like the typical tanning lotion, coconut mixed with burned flesh. ha! This works well...I would recommend for beginners. It hydrates well and provides color very quickly after 3-4 uses in a level one bed.</li>
    <li> The product was okay, I mean I don&#x27;t really have any complaints it just didn&#x27;t give the best of color</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells wonderful, it&#x27;s moisturizing, and it works! You&#x27;ll love how your skin looks and feels after a tan.</li>
    <li> I went to tanning booth 7 times and was using this bronzing lotion... I can hardly see any tan at all on me. Basically, this tanning lotion did absolutely nothing to make my skin darker. I have a pretty pale skin, though... but, still... no bronzing and barely-there tan.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  This lotion has a good smell and works quickly to enhance your tan. Get your tan on!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I will never pay expensive prices for lotion again! I read some reviews saying that it stunk but to me it smells like tropicana lotion. Well worth trying for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. It smells a little musky after you&#x27;re done tanning but I think that&#x27;s expected. I get a deep tan with it. It has a subtle instant bronzer in it too.</li>
    <li> has nothing to do with the buyer, product isnt quite as thick as i thought it would be.  It came in a completely sealed package, no leaks or anything. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, one of my favorites. It moisturizes very well. I use this everytime I tan and it smells good too!!!</li>
    <li> I saw immediate results with this product. It also gives me a nice bronzed glow and did not make my skin feel dry. The sinfully black product made me itch but this hardcore black did not. I have used it several times now and still love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion! Worked quick. Nice golden skin color.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample pack of this at the salon, and it&#x27;s very watery and greasy. It was way to slippery when I put it on and took forever to dry on me. Also it smells awful! And it didn&#x27;t get me anywhere near black at all! The name of this is very deceiving!</li>
    <li> Adds a nice tan hue when applied.  I&#x27;ve had zero issues with streaks or staining while tanning.  I feel confident it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT SMELLS WONDERFUL BUT DOESN&#x27;T DO THAT WELL</li>
    <li> I recently bought this, I have always purchased tanning lotion online, and have never had a problem.  I read great reviews on this.  Well I must&#x27;ve got a 20yr old lotion, it smells horrible. Not just a bad tanning lotion scent, but it smells very very old, almost like clay.  Not impressed at all!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion. Bronzer isn&#x27;t so much it makes a big mess. But yet leaves you brown and even. The smell isnt bad at all. Not bad for a cheap lotion that does work pretty good.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this tanning lotion.  For me, it&#x27;s too watery and takes too long to absorb into your sking.  If you use a tanning bed, you understand that you don&#x27;t have long to put on your lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! I&#x27;ve always gotten the tan I wanted when using this lotion, so I will continue to do so in the future. It is one I always look for on Amazon, because you can save yourself quite a bit of cash buying here rather than in a tanning salon.</li>
    <li> excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic, easy to use. Love it</li>
    <li> This is the only indoor tanning lotion I use.  It smells good and gives me great color each and every time.</li>
    <li> this is a good lotion because it doesnt smell bad like a lot of the other ones do also it was a pretty good deal and the shipper sent it out pretty fast</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> I am a year round tanner, and switch between tingles and bronzers. The salons always charge so much for lotions and my particular salon doesn&#x27;t use the purchased lotions towards upgraded beds anymore, So i resorted to amazon.I haven&#x27;t been tanning for about two months ,and I&#x27;m usually a 3+ times a week tanner. I have to say its so far an OKAY lotion.I have used it 4 days in a row and im about a shade darker. I use higher level beds and this lotion isn&#x27;t the best, but isnt the worst. Its nice and creamy, a little on the thick side. Its not that dark of a bronzer so this would be good for beginners, or for getting back into the tanning routine.It smells a bit odd, but nothing crazy. Kinda like perfumy play dough haha, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. I think i&#x27;m gonna use this for more of an outdoor lotion at the beach, but it is good for the price !</li>
    <li> Have used nearly the whole bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to smell bad.  Although, it doesn&#x27;t have a scent that I can even describe since it isn&#x27;t close to being memorable.  I can say it doesn&#x27;t make be embarrassed to stop at the store on my way home though.  That&#x27;s a plus.  Overall, it is nice, and seemed to work.  I did not notice myself getting darker any quicker than what I had been using previously, which was over a year old.  For that reason I purchased another Australian Gold lotion to use next.  For the price, I would buy again, if my new one doesn&#x27;t pan out.  I just see no need for a Rave review over it.  It is worth trying if you are not a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; tanner.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many lotions through out the years and I have to say Australian Gold is one of the best. Hardcore Black 30X by this name brand will give you an instant deep dark tan. I tanned once with this lotion and I see a difference already. The color of my skin is a dark golden brown. I have been tanning for one week with the lotion (SUPRE SMOKE) and was not happy with it. The reviews on smoke drew me in to buy it and try it out. It must work wonderful for some people but I was not getting those same results. Iam a very serious and experienced tanner and realized now some of the most expensive lotions out there are not what they say they are. Australian Gold is one of the best lotions out there that is not expensive nor misleading. For all the tanners out there who are searching for a noticeable deep and dark tan. This lotion is worth the $13.00. Tan in the morning and as the day goes by you will notice you are alot darker. Iam so happy with my purchase. Brandy</li>
    <li> Hardcore Black works well.Not a miracle in a bottle or anything, but I like the Australian Gold products and this one seems to do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I&#x27;ve used the super cheap stuff and the super expensive stuff and this works really well for the price! I even use it on days I don&#x27;t tan and it seems to enhance the bronze even when I don&#x27;t lay in the tanning bed. The scent is nice and not too strong and it makes my skin nice and soft! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Scent--Don&#x27;t care for it at all, it&#x27;s nothing special. It almost reminds me of sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;Results--I hated it, this lotion didn&#x27;t give me any color. Overall this lotion was just terrible, I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It COULD smell a little better but I&#x27;m in love I got 30xs darker.</li>
    <li> very fast shipping, love this, I have been tanning for 20 years and this lotion really kept me dark, will buy again</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this lotion. The smell, consistency , absorption, moisturizing ability, and able to obtain colour in a relatively fast time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for fair skin - as I have , and hard to tan skin - again, such as me.&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a good starter lotion for beginners. The price is right for a good product with a good reputation.&lt;br /&gt;I am not supposed to tan anymore , due to health and genetic issues, so I will probably will not buy this product again :(</li>
    <li> Smells jus like summer :) works great!!!! Kind of thinner lotion but all in all great product especially for the price!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it like I do some of the other AG products but the smell is pretty amazing :)</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion around :) I love it and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since I first got it! Well wOrth the 20 dOllars. Go to a tanning salon they will charge you 50-80</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve bought so far. Works great!!! Get color right away after first tan and stays. Also after s few tans you get really dark</li>
    <li> This is a really good brand and if you are looking for a really pretty dark tan with a glowing bronze to it I suggest this one because it has the best bronzes in it. I use it all the time and I am really dark . I get compliments on my tan all the time. Try it you love it , (no tingle in it )</li>
    <li> enhanced the color I already had, definatly had more people asking me where I went on vacation. I will use again for sure.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite tanning lotion ever! The smell, color everything! I&#x27;ve bought several bottles of these and I will continue to do so. I highly recommend this lotion. Its the perfect amount of bronzer without giving that orange look!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  I&#x27;ve had better but for the price it isn&#x27;t bad.  I would recommend 24 Karat Gold but this is a second.</li>
    <li> When I first started to tan I haven&#x27;t had a tan since I moved to NC from FL back in 1999 so I wanted to see if I could get a good tan again. I used this bronzer CONSISTANTLY and the most minutes I laid for was 12 minutes at a time. I went about every day or every other day. After one month I seen a very good noticeable difference. I burn usually on my face and shoulders in normal sun after being out for 3-4 hours solid with no protection. I don&#x27;t tan easily or burn bad. I hope this comment helps others know how well this product works based on my skin. Hopefully whoever reads it has the same skin type. This product really doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it also does not smell bad. It really smells like a normal lotion, not a big deal. It DOES leave you skin VERY soft and gives it a healthy glow. I usually don&#x27;t take the time to review a product either. It took a month before I noticed results, but I see myself every day and I&#x27;m a bit impatient, but ITS WORTH THE WAIT! :D</li>
    <li> i bought this cause it said 30x and i had just a normal bronzer with that said i have no problem gettin dark with my normal bronzer i just wanted to get darker and this did not help me do that i actually think my other lotion i had worked better i will not buy this again</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product! I recommend it if you are looking to get a great, long lasting tan! I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered on the 9th &amp; received it in the morning of the 12th; just like they said I would! The cap was sealed with that plastic wrap &amp; it had a plastic wrap around the whole bottle. The shipping was fast, everything was tighly sealed, &amp; my bottle is new. Overall, i&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I searched Hardcore Black results on FOUR websites before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I got the bottle this morning so of course I wanted to try it asap! I put it on &amp; went straight to the tanning salon. (Usually I wait 30 minutes before I go, but my salon was closing in less than an hour.) Literally I noticed results as soon as I got out of the tanning bed. I didn&#x27;t think that was possible lol. Yay. :)</li>
    <li> My Hardcore Black arrived quickly with no problems.  I had started tanning with the Aus Gold Sinfully Black, which was very good, and with a light berry kind of scent.  The Hardcore is twice as strong (30x) and smells more like tanning lotion.  It feels good on the skin &amp; gives you a great natural deep tan very quickly.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It can create a dark color and it does so pretty quick.  I would have to say the smell isn&#x27;t the very best but it isn&#x27;t bad either.  Just odd.  However, the smell is the only thing I could complain about with this lotion.  It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin after you tan.  I consider that a plus.  I would buy this lotion again.  It is MOST DEFINITELY worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Irish so I&#x27;m very pale and I have trouble tanning. I decided that I was going to get a good lotion to use and I did my research. This lotion is rated very high and I can say that even with just one use I&#x27;ve seen results! The smell of the lotion also doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous like some I&#x27;ve smelled before, it smells like coconut. I would recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time.. WOW!!! this is amazing... you must have a good base tan before using this, otherwise you will burn. This made my tan get deeper and my skin was so soft.. Nice light scent!!!...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so cheap and works so good! It is even cheaper on here than in my tanning salon. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it isn&#x27;t the best smelling lotion but for the price i don&#x27;t care!</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying, I am not a ginger.  However, I was cursed with ginger pale, freckled, ultra sensitive skin, which immediately turns tomato red after ten minutes in direct sunlight.  I joined a gym which offers tanning as a part of my membership, and why not utilize all my membership pays for?  And what girl with alabaster skin doesn&#x27;t dream of being bronze and beautiful?  I first checked the Australian Gold website to locate a lotion that contained bronzers.  Finding this item, I located it on Amazon and purchased two bottles (so I could get Free Super Saver Shipping.)  It arrived yesterday and I used it for the first time last night.  Everyone at work knows me as the pale girl, but after one use, people have noticed I don&#x27;t glow quite as brightly as I did two days ago.  This stuff works and without a burn.  Just make sure if you&#x27;re a fair-skinned tanner like me, that you gradually work up your time in the bed.  Don&#x27;t just immediately jump in for 10+ minutes the first time.  Just a friendly tip from one ginger-skin to another.</li>
    <li> Love Australian Gold products...and this is my favorite by far.  I recently used the 15x (highly recommend it too), and this is even better.  The smell is very nice, not overwhelming or perfume-y.  LOVE the color I have from this lotion.  I only tan 12 minutes 2 or 3 days a week and the color is very natural.  Gave me a great base for swimsuit season.</li>
    <li> My 21 year old son loves this tanning lotion. Being blessed with olive tone skin...this lotion gives him a golden tan and he says the lotion doesn&#x27;t smell like a &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant in ordering this lotion. But once I received and used this, I got instant results within the first day! I love it! I use it when I am outside and the bronzer is a bonus with this product. I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I have used many AG products. Sinfully black is one of my favs so i expected to like this one but i really didnt like the smell. It smells like an outdoor tan lotion which is good but doesnt really cover the ato. The bronzers are very nice though so if u want a nice soft scent, you would probably enjoy this lotion. Plus its nice and light and speads very easily.</li>
    <li> It is just like the tanning salons sell......only more affordable. Great results! I will buy again in the future! Lasts for a long time</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference in color as this was supposed to be a bronzing lotion. The potion had a strange consistence that did not go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Will always buy this product for tanning. This is the best I have ever found for me.</li>
    <li> I love this dark tanning lotion. I am somewhat sensitive to some of the tanning lotions out there but this one works great. Dark tan results, does not burn or itch and nice smell. Seller is Awesome!!! Shipped so quickly and received to me as I never expected to receive it in a matter of a few days! Highly recommend and will continue to buy from them again. Ty</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my daughther who has a hard time tanning. This tanning lotion has gave her a AWESOME tan. It has a great smell and it moisturizes you skin as well. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! The shipping as FAST too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this lotion based on my fiancé&#x27;s opinion. I bought this for my him just to put on when he is doing stuff outside. He says this lotion is alright, compared to not having any lotion on. He has only used it once or twice so far, so there is no color notice yet. However, I did not like this lotion. It seems like lotion when you squeeze it out, but it&#x27;s to watery when you try to rub it in. It just had to dry. Also, the smell was really faint. I&#x27;m wondering if it is the real stuff. I won&#x27;t buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> was not what the bottle said, no way was this australian gold hardcore black, i had it before and this was not it,, but it did look and smell like a cheap off brand bought from walmart, i had purchased in ;the past..very disapointed..</li>
    <li> Smells good. Not greasy. Color looks natural. Good tan starter. Love this!</li>
    <li> I get an amazing tan when I use this lotion. I always come to amazon for my lotion because tanning salons charge double and triple the price. I tried the sample at the salon and then came home and ordered a bottle! Great product, you don&#x27;t stink, it doesn&#x27;t stain your hands.</li>
    <li> Awesome color and smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> I used this for a month and never got any color. I used one from my tanning salon and 1 use ended up with a lot more tan than this stuff. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product from my local tanning salon, and did so with a lot of skepticism because of it&#x27;s fairly low price...figuring that it probably wouldn&#x27;t work very well. After using it just once I noticed a pretty substantial increase in dark color that I achieved from just that one session. I absolutely love how it smells both before and after tanning too. I have since found this product on here for just a small fraction of what the salon was charging, and now look forward to a very long business relationship with regards to making a weekly reorder, because I know that I can rely on the product showing up in a more than timely manner, as I&#x27;ve also always experienced the product showing up very prior to even the earliest estimated delivery date. I can&#x27;t wait to start looking for other tanning products on here too.</li>
    <li> The shipping was great, I got it in like 2 days after I ordered it. I don&#x27;t know how the lotion is supposed to smell, but I think it smells weird for an Australian Gold product. I have used some of their stuff before and it smelt amazing but this lotion smells like play dough to me.</li>
    <li> i use this product  all the time  best part is the price  can&#x27;t buy it that at the  tan spa  keep the price right</li>
    <li> I like this product because of the bronzers in it. I prefer Designer Skin products however this was a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Does a great darkening job..</li>
    <li> Good lotion and it goes on evenly</li>
    <li> I really like this tanning lotion. Does not give you orange stripes. It is not thick and greasy. No after tan smell which I loved! Nice scent.</li>
    <li> Product arrived damaged and all over the inside of the shipment box.</li>
    <li> Very good tanning lotion for the price. Have had much success with it and really like the product. Australian Gold&#x27;s products are worth the $$$$.</li>
    <li> I started by using tanning lotion from Walmart i used it for a month. I saw no results so i decided to go with going with the real stuff lol. I stared using the hardcore black and within two weeks i was dark it gives you really great color and didnt streak at all.</li>
    <li> Hardcore Black is just okay for the price.  Don&#x27;t think the bronzers in this lotion are really that great.  No noticeable difference after a couple of tans.  I have been tanning for years, and would just consider this product to be average for color.  It does, however, leave your skin very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different tanning lotions...expensive ones from the salon, high-end brand name ones from Amazon.  This one is BY FAR the BEST tanning lotion out there.  The price is super affordable (especially when lotions that are half as effective sell for 10x the price in the salon).  I had a good base tan already but had hit a plateau.  I used this one time in a low-pressure stand-up and came out with amazing color - very noticeably darker immediately.  I&#x27;ve since used it several more times and I keep getting darker.  People have asked where I&#x27;ve been on vacation.  This stuff works.  I won&#x27;t bother with other lotions any longer...this is THE ONE.</li>
    <li> You must tan 3 times then use this or you will not see the correct results. You should always tan bare your first 3 tans of the season. Will change the way you look at tanning.g salon lotions again....$$$$$$ no more high prices! The color is almost good enough to be mistaken for a darker race. Also do not apply to face. It will cause breakouts and dry flaky patches. As do all tanning lotions after prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I have a fair complexion and this lotion worked great at giving me color without looking orange and fake! I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> love australian gold products, better than all that other expensive products..Can really tell the difference after a couple of uses!</li>
    <li> Works well, not to thick not to thin but it stinks. Reminds me of clay. Wish they would alter the smell!</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy more!!!!</li>
    <li> After using hardcore black for about 3 weeks, seen VERY little difference in my tan. It would basically roll off of me and had a cake like appearance. Would not bother with this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, have purchased many times and always gets me extremely dark.</li>
    <li> This is the very best of all the tanning lotions me and my wife have tried.  It works way better than some others that are twice the price ( or more)  Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> I really loved this lotion. It gave my skin great color and left it moisturized!!!  Loved the scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews....This is a good lotion gets me dark but not super dark. I&#x27;m Dark skinned anyways so what some people think is dark I don&#x27;t. However for me to get dark dark I have to have a tingle lotion. But I think for the average joe this would work just fine!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! I never imagined that it would work so well because it was so cheap.  So if your looking for a good lotion that is not expensive this is it</li>
    <li> MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL ALIVE AND SILKY. WORKS REAL WELL. THAT WHY i BOUGHT SO MUCH AND GREAT PRICE TOO. OH THE SMELL IS GOOD TOO.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it&#x27;s going to. It helps you get a tan while using a tanning bed. It also will help while your out in the sun too. ive used this product before and it does what it says.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great smell an is like $30 at the tanning place.  I saved so much by buying it on here!  It also is better than Walmart brand indoor tanning lotions because is doesn&#x27;t have all the extra dyes in it and doesn&#x27;t turn your hands that funny orange color like the others do.  This is a great product and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I got so bronze with this stuff! I would recommend it to anyone who is needs to get a quick tan. I personally used it for body building competition to get my base tan!</li>
    <li> try many tpye&lt;br /&gt;but one smell good&lt;br /&gt;taste cool go a all way to&lt;br /&gt;try it the cst good to</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite tanning lotion. I love the smell and it leaves your skin silky smooth for hours!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this lotion. Leaves my skin feeling good, not too greasy. Helps get a nice even tan. It&#x27;s worth it to buy it here. My salon charges $30+ dollars for it there.</li>
    <li> First time using this particular product from Australian Gold.  I expected to be more bronzing as advertized on line.  used in the sun and not too much of a bronzing product.  Will finish out the bottle but not sure would order again</li>
    <li> GOT MUCH BETTER RESULTS WITH THIS BRONZER. EVEN HAVE PEOPLE TELLING ME IM DARK ENOUGH!!  NOT ! EVEN GOT TOLD I SMELL GOOD AFTER TANNING !!  THAT WAS A FIRST :)</li>
    <li> Better than many of the more high priced lotions.</li>
    <li> Works great on both sexes</li>
    <li> Good lotion. I love Australian gold products!</li>
    <li> have only used this twice and can see a difference in my tan. smells really nice--not like some tanning lotions with bronzer. leaves your skin moisturized and smooth. i always follow up with a aussie gold post-tan lotion. (see my other reviews). i&#x27;ve learned my lesson the hard way (spending too much on other lotions). australian gold is the only way to go!! PS: does not streak or stain your hands!</li>
    <li> Good color, not orange. Smell could have been better. A little too watery for my likings but I&#x27;m too cheap to pay $100 for a bottle of \\&quot;Good\\&quot; tanning lotion. You get what you pay for and its better than using nothing at all.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and when we got this product in I tried it and loved it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and made me darker after the first time going into the tanning bed when using this product.</li>
    <li> loved it!! Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> This is by far the worste lotion I&#x27;ve used, Guess you pay for what you get. I&#x27;ll stick with the more expensive brands for now on. This is very watery, it&#x27;s like rubbing water on my skin. It looks like lotion when it comes out but once I rub it on its very liquidy. It smells OKAY in the bottle, but nasty once its on my skin. Very bad after smell my husband has commented the few times I used this that I stank. I switch up on lotions and the times that I&#x27;ve used this one I&#x27;ve seen no results as if I didn&#x27;t even tan. Maybe this is a fake lotion or watered down, who knows, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Didnt really do anything.  Smells nice but no color.  Sounded good but i will pass next time.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> works well with no staining, very pleased.</li>
    <li> This actually done very good,it made me look naturally dark.i would definitely recommend it.my friends tried it as well and that&#x27;s all they use..although i lean more toward the heat tingle lotion....&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my wife is happy with it.Good fragrance not messy.</li>
    <li> Lotions all busted in my order.  I will never Order this product in the summer time</li>
    <li> My wife was looking for an alternative to the $30-$40 bottle at the tanning salon and I found this one on Amazon. She loves it. Great performance for the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even real lotion. It&#x27;s watery and doesn&#x27;t work and stinks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Australian Gold indoor tanning products for over 8 years now. I love their products because they are more price moderate and have always been satisfied with the end results. I feel their products get better and better over time.</li>
    <li> If you are low on funds, this would be a nice alternative to the more pricey lotions! It has a nice smell and lingers a bit, with no after tan odor! I would recommend this to beginners as well as advanced tanners!</li>
    <li> I was getting white spots from tanning without using a lotion. The salon recommended I use Hardcore Black and saw instant results my first time back in the bed. No spots, nothing. I didn&#x27;t burn or anything. I&#x27;ve gone three times now and have used this product every time. It makes a dramatic difference and am really happy with it. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> it has a good, not really girly sent to it but then again it doesn&#x27;t smell like cologne either ...tough to describe but its not a bad thing... seems to work pretty good to if you&#x27;re just looking for a cheaper one...i&#x27;m Italian so i tan well anyways i just wanted something to help moisturize while i tanned...good product for cheap thats the name of the game right</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It DOES get you darker. The smell is pretty bad, but if you want results at an affordable price without the DHA, this is the one for you. Also try It Factor by Australian Gold. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> i am very disappointed in this charm..a few days after wearing it it changed colors. I am very unhappy with this piece.  I didn&#x27;t get it wet and it still changed.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this lotion works for me. I don&#x27;t get a rash or break out when I tan. I love the smell and it gets me dark quickly!</li>
    <li> Used this twice and am already noticing a difference! I LOVE IT! It gives me great color and it smells amazing before and after tanning!</li>
    <li> .Great lotion for a great price. Love my color! Will buy again!n. Australian Gold is by far the best brand around.</li>
    <li> didnt get the results that it said i would get even after useing the whole bottle and i tan very easy so its not that</li>
    <li> I was very excited when the item had arrived and ive used it several times just to bronze myself over some since I constantly work inside and I can say that it has done its job and I would buy it again. this is a suggested purchase</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!!! Super dark fast</li>
    <li> I love this product. Does what it should and that&#x27;s what counts. I&#x27;ve been using Australian Gold for a long time now. It&#x27;s what doesn&#x27;t break my skin out which is sensitive and I don&#x27;t feel sticky either. Smells good too. I would recommend this product and would buy again</li>
    <li> works great!! Smell is descent and isnt to oily. i wouldnt recommend wearing it all day but i take a shower after a few hours on tanning.</li>
    <li> As an avid tanner, i have used 150.00 lotions and 5.00 lotions.&lt;br /&gt;This product has to be the best bronzing lotion that i have used in years.&lt;br /&gt;I was a fan of California Tan, specifically CT7.  This lotion has stolen my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product at an outstandng price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of tanning lotions in my time for I am a long time indoor tanner.  I decided to buy something a little cheaper this time and I am so glad I did.  got instant results and no streaking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times now. It&#x27;s a great lotion to help tan without turning you to leather. I have my own tanning bed and use this as well as Solid Black. Both seem comparable to one another as far as function. Hardcore Black wins on scent tho. I&#x27;m not interested in the darkest tan possible. No matter the lotion, that looks bad on anyone.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a week. Have been very pleased with the results :) This is not a good lotion for a newbie tanner however.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s fine.  Definitely not as thick as other products in the line.  I do like the smell.  Reading that people have been using it &amp;#34;for weeks&amp;#34; and have developed no tan is just silly.  It may not really add to my tan but certainly isn&#x27;t repelling it!</li>
    <li> why pay for those expensive lotions.  This one works great. i plan to order it again. Quality was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion for the price. I didn&#x27;t have any amazing results, just average. I liked that the after tan smell wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> lotion does not work well for me bought because reviews were good and it was priced low rather pay little bit more for a better product</li>
    <li> Love the product, i would recommend the Hardcore Black&lt;br /&gt;Australian Gold to anyone wanting a good tan. I would love a sale on this product in the future</li>
    <li> This was the second full bottle I have went through and I absolutely love it. The bronzing agents give you the great color you want and quick. This products also leaves your skin very soft and has a great smell. I would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, not too greasy -- wonderful results and uni-sex...both of us use and love it!  Have been using it over a year and keep reordering!</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad, however this bronzer isn&#x27;t great but if your looking for an affordable decent lotion this will work but as soon as I get paid I will be purchasing the black smoke</li>
    <li> Wife did not like it very water base no results, nice sell thought</li>
    <li> Works very well, just like other Aussie products.  I recommend it, but keep the bottle itself out of direct sunlight - it will swell.</li>
    <li> awesome awesome awesome.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> great with a great price!!</li>
    <li> Definitely helps you get darker quicker</li>
    <li> awesome scent, not sticky, love everything about it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and didn&#x27;t smell like the usual bronzing type lotions, it actually smelled pretty good.  On the other hand, it did absolutely nothing to help with my tan.  After a week of use, I just dropped it in the trash.  I usually really like Australian Gold products, but I guess there is a first time for everything.  This turned out to be completely useless.</li>
    <li> I love all Australian Gold products.  This one seems to be a good lotion, however, I&#x27;m not to crazy over the smell.</li>
    <li> Within using this one day I seen a difference. Also it isn&#x27;t a tanning lotion that quotes working. You can use this lotion all the time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Designer skin, Millennium tanning, Supre, California Tan, Swedish Beauty you name it, but this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used and I use it outdoors/indoors.  I only lay 2-3 times a week and I&#x27;m darker than the girls who lay with the more expensive brands and lay longer and more often than I do.  I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect company and lotion to order. I&#x27;ve made 3 different purchases from this company and they go over the top.  I pair this with AG forever all day moisturizer after tanning and I&#x27;m set.</li>
    <li> I gave it five stars because it does just as it says it will.  I received it just three days after I ordered it.  After the first time using it I was darker then I have been in a long time.  I will be buying it again.  The product worked great for me.  Try it for yourself and you will see a great dark tan.  It also has a very good scent.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I tried it when I started tanning in preparation for a trip to the Dominican.  I wanted something with bronzing agents without paying a small fortune as I was only going to a tanning bed for less than a month.  I tan easily, so this was a perfect product for me...and it was waaayyyy less than anything a the actual tanning salon.  They were wanting a minimum for $50-$60 for some of their lowest line of products, and there was no way I was ever going to pay that much for any tanning lotion.  I love Australian Gold products and that&#x27;s all I use for indoor tanning as well as outdoor tanning.  This product is definitely worth it and I would use this again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Just about anything Australian Gold is going to be top notch and this goes right along with the rest of their lotions. I use this regularly and very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> i use this in the indoor tanning bed at the gym. i love this product not a loud smell either.</li>
