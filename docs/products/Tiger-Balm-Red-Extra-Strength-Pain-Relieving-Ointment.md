<li> There was less than half the amount I thought.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem greasy, just leaves the skin slightly tacky.&lt;br</li>
<li> I like the smell, but it seems odd to be rubbing on yourself.</li>
<li> The bottle is too small.</li>

    <li> This came in super fast and it&#x27;s magic stuff!  Seriously - this stuff is great :)</li>
    <li> Great, smooth transaction and great product!</li>
    <li> This was not the true &amp;#34;RED&amp;#34;  Extra Strenght Tiger Blam, that was looking for.</li>
    <li> Just the thing I need after taking 2-3 Zumba classes back-to-back!</li>
    <li> This is the Best pain relieving ointment  I have ever try; I would recommended it to everyone!</li>
    <li> If It wasn&#x27;t for Tiger Balm  I would have already had Hip Surgery. That&#x27;s how good the product is.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that 75 % of the stores I buy it from are out of stock all of the time. So as I result&lt;br /&gt;when I see 4 jars on the shelf I buy them all and I am good for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;The stores I buy it from are Walmart,Target,CVS and sometimes Rite Aide.&lt;br /&gt;In the store it costs between $ 3.99 and 4.50 depending on the store.&lt;br /&gt;But on all the online Websites for the same size jar it cost $ 7.99 plus shipping.</li>
    <li> it works good, it doesn&#x27;t have a powerful smell to it, and the next day i do feel better little by little</li>
    <li> A very good and effective product on arthritic knees and hips.</li>
    <li> Tiger balm makes a number of great, potent products and this is no exception. I just haven&#x27;t figured out if there are any substantial differences between their products, besides consistency and smell. This product is slightly waxy which I expected to dislike but it turns out to be just fine. It doesn&#x27;t seem greasy, just leaves the skin slightly tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is what stands out. All menthol products are potent, but this one is unique. It smells strongly of chai tea or gingerbread. I like the smell, but it seems odd to be rubbing on yourself. It actually makes me hungry, and I can&#x27;t decide how I feel about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it works well and definitely smells better than some of the other medicinal-smelling products.</li>
    <li> There are no words to explain this balm.  It is the best rum on balm I have ever experienced. It works immediately. Would reorder</li>
    <li> Compare the one I order from Walmart tiger blam..this one was small and scent more weak</li>
    <li> I have tried the Ultra white Tiger Balm and I did not like it.  It does not have the spicy smell of the Red and has a Vasoline feel to it.  I have switch back to the original Red with it&#x27;s waxy feel. I buy it at the local CVS store as I have read that there are a lot of imitations being sold on the InterNet.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Took a very long time though.  Low price.</li>
    <li> Many people believe that the White Tiger Balm is more effective because it has more menthol, and therefore, they feel more sensation when they apply it.  This is the original Tiger Balm, and it&#x27;s much more effective- I&#x27;ve been using it for almost thirty years.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what I thought. There was less than half the amount I thought. Should have known something was not right when I could not find how much was in it. For a little bit more I get more than twice as much. Beware when buying on line or anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Came packaged as expected, product as advertised. Love using this stuff on my knees when they ache, in conjunction with foam-rolling (I am a powerlifter)</li>
    <li> grat great great stuff....only need a little and it goes a long way..... does the job for me very well..thanks</li>
    <li> The bottle is too small. Takes long time to get it.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff.  It works wonders..........</li>
    <li> I was looking for the green extra strong</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> My favorite thing to use for eliminating a head ache.  You take a small amount and rub it clockwise into your 3rd eye area on your forehead until you feel some warmth.  Then watch the head ache disappear.</li>
    <li> Tiger balm is a great friend for the martial artist . Especially aging martial artists. It works very well on sore muscles.</li>
    <li> Tiger balm is made in Thailand and is one of the best ointments for colds, sore joints, stuffy nose etc.</li>
    <li> Awesome…way better than bengay! Smells pleasant but not too strong.  Its great for joint pain and exercise aches.  It also works well to clear the sinuses.</li>
    <li> Love it. Got it faster than said. :-)</li>
    <li> this stuff is great!! helps with the pain I have in my upper back ! Love It!!!</li>
    <li> Always a great product</li>
    <li> Use it daily during Brazilian jiu-jitsu training.</li>
    <li> Very good product and we were informed when it would arrive so we were not surprised by the transit time. Good value.</li>
