<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would definitely buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this soap so I gave it a try! now I have ordered about 4 16oz bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin type but lately I had some pimples, this soap has helped me a lot! my face is cleaner now and the pimples are reducing day by day. This soap cleanse very well! Its totally natural + its the best soap I have used tell now.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. I have sensitive skin and I love this soap, it works well to clear up acne and other skin aliments; only a small amount works wonders. I like to moisturize after use because the soap can potentially leave my face a little dry. I&#x27;ve had acne for a good portion of my life but this product solves my skin condition; I have not had a major break out since I&#x27;d started using this product. I&#x27;d bought a travel sized bottle and mixed my favorite face soap (I like grapefruit acne scrub with facial beads) with a small amount of African Black soap (maybe 25% of the bottle or less, it&#x27;s very concentrated); in addition, I&#x27;d started using light makeup like BB cream instead of foundation. Voila, my acne has cleared up and the scars are minimized.</li>
    <li> This liquid goes a long way with just a little. Refreshing for my oily skin with no irritation &amp; cleansing for my body. Also great for shaving.</li>
    <li> Was like water...not what I expected. I was hopping it had some thickness, but sadly it wasn&#x27;t thick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be a good product, but because of the watery nature of it, I didn&#x27;t even open the bottle. I sent it right back. Not sure what it&#x27;s best for. I wanted to use it for the shower.</li>
    <li> I thought the liquid might be more convenient that the bars, but it is not.  I added the liquid to a pump bottle and it was constantly clogged.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my face feel. Notice my acne scars from teenage years have diminished. A little messy but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Mixed with a little patchouli essential oil and loved it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very watery and just Palm and kernel oil, nothing else. I expected more like most black soap, and thicker.</li>
    <li> love it a whole lot better than bar soap and it last a long time because you only need a little bit</li>
    <li> I expected the quality to be the same as the bar soap in liqiud form but it seemed a bit water down. The suds/lather not as thick and sudsy as the soap and did have the same fresh feeling after rinsing</li>
    <li> Really alkaline so you are actually getting and feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;Great for whole body as well as hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;We use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Also works great for teenagers who are fending off acne.</li>
    <li> This is some really great soap. The price is right, as well. It has a woody fragrance and you have to rub hands together for a while to get it soapy. It is so good for your face. The only reason I gave it a four rather than a five is because there needs to be a dispenser on the top so that yhou can squeeze it out rather than pour it in your hand. You lose so much soap when you pour it out as opposed to squeezing it out. Other than than, i will order again.</li>
    <li> I like it, smell was okay, makes a lot of foam, not sure if it works but makes my body skin soft.  I don&#x27;t recommend on all facial skin types.  It had a burn sensation on my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shea oil and saw this product.  I love both.  I use it for bathing and shampooing my hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This soap gets your hair extremely clean. For a natural product, it does super well. I use this type of soap twice a week or so to help w/buildup &amp; it is a very nice facial cleanser. It arrives very fast in the mail &amp; is very fairly priced.</li>
    <li> Last a long time.  Very gentle. Neutral aroma.</li>
    <li> I love how this product cleans my hair! It leaves my hair very soft to the touch. I use it from head-to-toe!! I have gotten my husband using it now and he doesn&#x27;t want to use anything else!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other african black soaps brands, this is bad quality, too watery, doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate, it makes a lot of foam.</li>
    <li> The pH is to high on the soap.. It burns your face and dries it out.. I tested it and it was an 11 which is to high for our skin pH. A bad purchase for natural products and a definite no no for hair.</li>
    <li> very watery  I prefer the bar soap as this feels too watered down and I am Leary of purchasing another liquid</li>
    <li> This soap rules my world! I use it on my face and body very comfortably. I recommend extra diligence when rinsing your eyes. Or ouch. Also, this will take stains out of fabric like nothing I have ever tried! Use it to spot-clean a stain on a down comforter and prepare to be pleased. (Alleviates but has not cured my mild eczema, fyi)</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to other customers for use. This product leaves your skin feeling extra clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the thick African Black Soap which can have rough pieces in it, which does help with exfoliation, but if skin is sensitive, the liquid is a better way to go. Wonderful product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love black soap in general ,but now it&#x27;s in a liquid form simply amazing ..will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I love this soap......you only need to use a small amount and it lathers up great. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Being that I am originally from Africa and have always used Black Soap, I am well aware of its authenticity when I see one. This soap is FAKE. It&#x27;s like a lot of water was mixed with it to quantify it instead of using the original syrup-like mixture.  It&#x27;s a complete fraud. Do NOT purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this product on Tuesday of this week.  I used it that evening when I showered.  By the time I got out of the shower, I had resolved within myself to purchase more.  My skin and natural hair felt the most positive difference immediately and immensely.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, the soap is very watery.  I don&#x27;t necessarily think this is a bad thing since it does lather extremely well.  I used it for my eczema and it helped to clear my skin within 7-10 days so for that reason alone, I&#x27;d consider purchasing this again.  I have older, dry skin normally and with the use of this soap, it seems to help exfoliate &amp; soften and is safe to use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not find the scent unpleasant.  I found it refreshing and I do in fact feel very clean without any soap film on my skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does produce a lot of foam or &#x27;soap scum&#x27; that gathers in tub and shower so with the use of this product I have to be sure to scour the tub on a daily basis to prevent buildup.  One bottle has lasted me about a month with daily showering but I did not change the container as other reviewers have done so if I had, it may last longer.</li>
    <li> Originally I had bought this soap to help clear up my face a little bit but I wasn&#x27;t consistent enough with it. However, every time I do use it on my face it leaves with a feeling of squeaky clean! However, I decided to share another reason why I really like this soap. I recently got a new tattoo on my arm and had an allergic reaction to the colored ink - it left a bunch of really itchy bumps all around my forearm. I tried putting cortisone cream on it to realize the itching but it only helped for a few minutes. One day I tried washing my arm with this soap and it took away all of the itching right away and it lasted for hours! Within a few days of washing with this soap the allergic reaction stopped and started to heal. It worked wonders and I&#x27;m so thankful that I had it - it definitely works great for clearing up rashes - or in my case an allergic rash and has helped my skin stay clear too!</li>
    <li> I want to amend my review. Yes, the packaging is different but it still works very well.</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap has cleared my complexion.  It is superior to the soap I paid $70.00 for.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair and works as a body wash also with minimal amount required. Will be purchasing this continuously as needed</li>
    <li> This product works really well and the seller shipped my merchandise very fast! I love it and I have only been using it for a week now. This African Black Soap is a most have, especially those suffering with mild to severe acne. Wish I would have known about this product sooner.</li>
    <li> I have used Black soap for years on everything from Bath and Shower wash to shampoo.  It has always worked for me.  It may be thin in consistency but it makes a world of suds.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I use to all over even face it smells really good and it does the job. Although at first when I used it on my face it did made my face a little dry, I had that tingling feel after using it. After a couple of uses it stop so its good. I also see a little lighting in my skin, I have blemish marks and they are getting lighter. I love the product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this soap but over time the soap began to irritate my skin.  I admit my skin is pretty sensitive but I&#x27;d heard so many good things about black African soap.</li>
    <li> It is a bit runny, but expected it to be so. Exactly what was ordered.  Yes it should come in a pump bottle, but easy enough to do so myself.</li>
    <li> This product is very watery as soon as you open the cap it pours out like coffee. I feel like the producers packed it with water to save money but the quality is not good. Also black ink from the packaging label runs off as soon as you put your wet hand on it.  The ink washes off of your hands but that was pretty upsetting to see the black ink running down the bottle onto my hads and on the side of my tub although it did not stain.</li>
    <li> Love product only need small amount for each usage.  Only down fall is bottle is cheap material and soap woild not come out of nozzle.  I had to purchase bottle to put soap in.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a better product.  It smells like crayons to me, you probably can get the same results from a body wash from the store.</li>
    <li> I like it but I thought black soap was not supposed dry out your skin. Maybe its just my type of skin, but while using it I could feel a difference in my face (besides the dryness).</li>
    <li> The consistency of this product was like water (which was unexpected) but it did keep my skin clear of impurities.</li>
    <li> This my go liquid  soap. I purchase this regularly. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for years now, but the last batch I bought is more dilute and has a different consistency compared to the previous orders. The packaging has also become cheap, with the ink used to print the label bleeding onto my bathtub as soon as the bottle touches water. It&#x27;s too bad that I will have to switch to a different brand</li>
    <li> So glad I found this..it works well</li>
    <li> This stuff literally leaves my face squeaky clean! I will definitely reorder this. Next time I will order a larger amount though.</li>
    <li> So I use the Shea Terra black soap and love it, but hated the price. This black soap is the same quality and you get more product per oz than you do Shea Terra black soap.</li>
    <li> Kind of useless since it is so liquidy rather than soapy</li>
    <li> MY FAMILY REALLY LOVES THIS SOAP.</li>
    <li> I like this soap for my hair when I want to detox, however, that being said you will need to use a conditioner, it will clean!  What I do is actually mix in with my usual shampoo, and helps alleviate the build up.  I has an earthy organic scent that you may not care too much for.  Some people like using for a body and face wash.  It is good for those oily individuals or those who are prone to breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love the african black soap, it get rid of dandruff and acne, this soap is so versatile you can you it and a face soap, body wash and shampoo all in one</li>
    <li> makes your skin VERY soft</li>
    <li> I feel like I bought a bottle of snake oil. The bottle isn&#x27;t sealed, there are no ingredients listed, and I really do not know if this soap is what it says it is. It does lather well, which surprised me for African black soap. It is very, very drying and I have oily skin. It is runny but not much different from other natural soaps. Like another reviewer commented, the label does leak black ink but it washes off.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again. I will probably buy a bar from a recognized company. DO NOT use this in your hair or shampoo.</li>
    <li> The product work great for me I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast! Arrived the day before it was supposed to arrive. I&#x27;ve used it 2 times already and I see a huge difference in my skin. My skin feels a lot softer and the pores on my face seem smaller. I wanted to review after a week of use but it&#x27;s that great! I love how you need a small amount and it lathers up great. One issue is the label. It bleeds like crazy when wet but it&#x27;s not that bad.. The smell reminds me of wet wood or something. It&#x27;s actually really refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love black soap, however, this one seemed a bit watery than others i&#x27;ve had before.  Will continue to use until gone, not sure if i&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> This one bottle of soap can last a long time and makes me feel very clean. I use it in the shower. The downsides are the bottle label comes off with water exposure and gets caught in my drain, the soap stained my hot pink wash cloth black, and the soap residue can make my tub look disgusting so I have to clean it more often than with other body washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have made a better decision than to switch to this soap! Other family members are slowly getting to use it - and so far, they are happy with what they see.</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast and I received exactly what I order. This product remains me of the solid African soap I used. It refreshes the skin and deeply clean the pores. Although,  the label ink of this product runs when wet. It makes a mess! Other than that, this product is superb!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not like this soap</li>
    <li> Was a bit too harsh for my skin and it seemed to dry it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it supposedly helped with acne and psoriasis.  It was extremely watery and seemed like a waste of money but my husband and I figured we would try it.  There was no improvement with the psoriasis or acne and it just seemed like a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I started using African black soap about 2 years ago when I had a psoriasis flare up and couldn&#x27;t get rid of it for months...the soap had it gone in a week so I&#x27;ve been trying different ones, all seem to do the job and it hasn&#x27;t been back since. Most soaps I&#x27;ve found at the store are thicker and easier to use. This is obviously watered down a lot, which is why the 3 stars. It still lathers and goes a long way, but not as far as others I have tried that are thicker and about the same oz size. The other complaint is the bottle and top. With this being so watered down it was unusable with the twist cap, pouring about an ounce out every use on accident.  I actually poured it into my old bottle of soap, and it worked a lot better. Seems like a bad place to cut costs. I won&#x27;t buy this again. It is real soap, but watered down probably 100-150%.</li>
    <li> cleared my skin and left it bright &amp; clean</li>
    <li> Works great.  You get a great lather and your skin feels squeeky clean.  I also use to shave and as a shampoo.  A little goes a long way.  Soap has a natural product smell which I also like.  Will definatley buy again and again.  I have used a diffrent African Black Soap before and this is the BEST.</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh scent.  Liquid is a little too runny for my preference but lathers nicely.</li>
    <li> Using it on my face, but still occasionally breaking out (I&#x27;m no youngster).  Thought it would better prevent skin problems under my beard and mustache.  Lathers really well.</li>
    <li> Will continue to buy the product at long as it&#x27;s on the market.</li>
    <li> When I received my liquid African Black soap, it was packaged well.  I&#x27;ve been incorporating this soap in my handmade soaps and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
    <li> for year i have try a lot of soaps. payed lot of money on soap that did not help me not one bit.... when i got the African black soap i did not know if it was going to work on my dry skin. but with in days of using it on my face my skin look much better and no dry skin and very clean skin i am now use it as the only soap in my house I LOVE THIS SOAP TRY IT I GIVE 5 STARS....</li>
    <li> This is an odor free soap that is worth the price. I have only used it in bar form before and I find this a cleaner alternative.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using Black soap in general. At 50 I had to change up my routine to meet the needs of my skin and Black soap with a daily aragon oil application is my daily routine. The bar Black soap is great but melts and creates a bit of a mess. I don&#x27;t get to use the whole bar. I took a chance on the liquid black soap and this is fantastic! My skin is soft, my adult acne (never had acne until age 49) is gone!. My daughter uses it and loves it. This is perfect for me and my family!</li>
    <li> I have dreads which is why I bought this soap, to wash my hair. It just made my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> so far, so good.  I really prefer this liquid over the bar soap!  I&#x27;ve used the bar soap for about a year now, and have liked it, but now that I this liquid, I prefer it much better.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery, item fit the description.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to find in the store so&lt;br /&gt;I purchased online, large bottle which will last for months</li>
    <li> I love this product ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    <li> Ugh what a waste of a purchase. These are too runny. Better off buying a soap! We tried these wanting to re purpose a soap dispenser but ended I p being useless!</li>
    <li> Awesome. This soap is wonderful. Feels great, smells wonderful and really helps your skin. You can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; is killing germs on your skin. All natural and very easy to use via the squeeze bottle. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the item described. I received something similar with only Shea Butter and water listed as ingredients. I have to say I like it better. It is simple and works great. It is gentle. I don&#x27;t break out from it and my skin, face and hair feels fantastic. I only worry that if I re-order I don&#x27;t get the same two-ingredient product. The only con to this is the spout constantly clogs. After I use it I now take off the spout and rinse it in hot water. You might find a safety pin or paperclip works better for you.</li>
    <li> Used this as a body wash and my skin was super soft!! I barely used a teaspoon and it lathered up great. Rinsed clean and left my skin SOFT!! I agree that the packaging is annoying and should have been in a pump bottle but you can always transfer it into a pump bottle or change the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE - 03/17/14*&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using this on my 11 year old&#x27;s face. She has acne and I can not tell you how MUCH BETTER her face looks after just three days. We&#x27;ve tried, proactive, prescriptions and none have helped. Give it a try if you&#x27;re experiencing acne.</li>
    <li> It is overly watered down.  If you need to use any on a bath brush, it will drip right off no matter how little you try to pour.  Other liquid soap are thicker and gel-like and can stay on your sponge.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that not only doesn&#x27;t disrupt my eczema, but actually improves its condition. I would recommend it to anyone with eczema, no matter the severity. Also, I have noticed when I do use this product the amount of lotion I have to use is much less. This combined with just about any unscented lotion (but I prefer Aveeno) post shower, is the perfect combination for eczema suffers. And it&#x27;s also worth noting the price is reasonable and it&#x27;s all natural  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> May work for some, but too drying for me:-(.</li>
    <li> Second order, excellent product. I  prefer this over other black soaps, cleans skin very  well and reduces ance and or blemishes</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t as yet had a chance to use it, but like the smell.  If it turns out that it&#x27;s a good buy, will use it also.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Love it!!! I would strongly recommend it. Use as a soap or shampoo. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! you need an amount smaller than a quarter of the size of your pinky nail and it lathers right up! My face gets squeaky clean, naturally. It isn&#x27;t stripped from the overpriced cleansers with ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce.  Also has helped to clear up my acne! I will never use any other cleansers, again. I am and forever will be an African black soap user every morning and night.</li>
    <li> We use this as shampoo for my son with eczema and it helps.</li>
    <li> I use various African soaps and this one is really good. No scent, but lathers up really well (even in super hard water). I thought it would stain/darken white wash cloths, but the color washes right out with no problem.</li>
    <li> Good product I will be ordering this item again!</li>
    <li> when I first tried it, I thought do liquid black soap suppose to be this watery. but the more and more I used it I got used to it and the smell. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again, but the soap was okay but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> It is stinging a little after each use but no dry skin afterwards. Also it is watery in consistency, so you tend to use more than necessary.</li>
    <li> A gentle clean with a wonderfully clean fragrance and smartly priced. Certainly won&#x27;t be the last time I purchase this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing knowledgeable about the benefits of natural products,especially black soap.The texture is runny,BUT!!!,about a 1/2 tsp goes a looonnggg way,the lather is excellent,theirs a faint scent that is not bothersome.I can&#x27;t wait to experience the benefits of this soap.I will definitely return with an update:).</li>
