### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very nice!</li>
      <li>With use of this product it is twice a year again, Works great</li>
      <li>Perfect fit for my Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried some dental gel kits from my dentist (who is amazing and</li>
      <li>I will be buying more just wish they would have some kind of sale</li>
      <li>I love these ones they seem to be my favorite</li>
      <li>I love that I can whiten my teeth, and efficiently at that, just by brushing.</li>
      <li>Great quality, works fine and is exact replacements for ones</li>
      <li>Going from  poor reports to great reports with my DDS is great, It will be nice nothaving to see the dentist every 3 months.</li>
      <li>makes it easy.</li>
      <li>Very convenient, I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had others in the past, but this one cleans under the gum line much more efficiently and is good all around.</li>
      <li>My front teeth have the feeling of freshly being polished.</li>
      <li>am very well pleased, although I think the brush heads are very over priced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I rarely go to the dentist and people are always complimenting my pearly whites.</li>
      <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t work, the Vitality and its various different brush heads are still a great toothbrush to use, so</li>
      <li>Good concept but less than stellar results.</li>
      <li>first it seemed like forever -</li>
      <li>with any Vitality brush head, you still get the smooth clean feeling after brushing, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap way to lighten your teeth up, give this a go before you consider investing in more expensive procedures.</li>
      <li>will order new ones when needed but instead of changing the head every 3 months I am going to try 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;In closing, other than the exorbitant price I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like brushes with large heads.</li>
      <li>Be sure to buy a true Oral-B. After trying a generic replacement, I went back to the Oral-B produced ones.</li>
      <li>Thanks for educating me on my toothbrush system.</li>
      <li>I like to have one ready and subscribe and save</li>
      <li>Whitening head really seems to make a difference, my teeth feel more slick and polished after even the first use!</li>
      <li>I have used this head about 5 times and find that I actually get slightly better whitening results from the standard floss action head that comes with the Oral-B 5000.  </li>
      <li>Now I am using the Whitening setting with this new head.  </li>
      <li>while you pay a little bit extra for a special attachment, you&#x27;re only losing $2-3 at most.</li>
      <li>This rubber middle cup will hold some whitening paste, but even without anything I can see a real difference.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>I will swear by this toothbrush - the Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush.</li>
      <li>, so I only ordered one to see if it might work, but once we&#x27;ve use up the other floss action heads, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of these for me and my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The yellow polisher in the middle really makes my teeth shine.</li>
      <li>While the cup design is supposed to hold the paste longer to produce the whitening results, it doesn&#x27;t have near the overall bristle movement of the floss action head.  </li>
      <li>They are a little pricey but definitely worth the money if you want whiter teeth.</li>
      <li>I would say however this only works well on your front teeth and a floss action brush is recommended for everything else.</li>
      <li>I have been using only cleaning and sensitive brushes and I realized my Oral B toothbrush has several settings.  </li>

<li> like that the Pro-white brush actually vibrates after 2 minutes to let you know that you have brushed long</li>
<li> The price was comparable to three heads on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;While this seams to be a genuine Oral-B brush the quality is poor compared to other heads I have purchased.</li>
<li> Not much to say, it&#x27;s a replacement head that works.</li>
<li> I was actually pretty skeptical about this working (I mean, c&#x27;mon, JUST a polishing cup??)</li>
<li> I use it a few times a week.</li>
<li> This small head allows you to get in all areas of your mouth.</li>
<li> I was not exactly sure how well this product would work when I purchased it</li>
<li> dentist said don&#x27;t scrub or rub hard -</li>
<li> just hold the brush head on the teeth and move it around slowly - let the brush head do the work</li>
<li> I change them at least every 3 months and always after a cold or any illness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not much to say, it&#x27;s a replacement head that works. One problem with ordering on Amazon though is that you can&#x27;t specify the color of the ring. We got one that was the same color as our existing head, so we lose the ability to tell the two apart. (We left the colored ring off one of them to solve the problem.)</li>
    <li> I will swear by this toothbrush - the Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush. I&#x27;ve had others in the past, but this one cleans under the gum line much more efficiently and is good all around.</li>
    <li> Going from  poor reports to great reports with my DDS is great, It will be nice nothaving to see the dentist every 3 months. With use of this product it is twice a year again, Works great</li>
    <li> I love these ones they seem to be my favorite I will be buying more just wish they would have some kind of sale so I can stock up!</li>
    <li> Great quality, works fine and is exact replacements for ones I had&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Do buy Branded ones not Generic</li>
    <li> I love that I can whiten my teeth, and efficiently at that, just by brushing. Very convenient, I love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like brushes with large heads. This small head allows you to get in all areas of your mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried some dental gel kits from my dentist (who is amazing and oh so helpful) but even those didn&#x27;t work as well compared to this head. In 2 weeks, my teeth were a noticeable shade lighter. Even my boyfriend, who had been gone for 2 1/2 weeks on a trip noticed the change. I was actually pretty skeptical about this working (I mean, c&#x27;mon, JUST a polishing cup??), so I only ordered one to see if it might work, but once we&#x27;ve use up the other floss action heads, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of these for me and my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with any Vitality brush head, you still get the smooth clean feeling after brushing, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap way to lighten your teeth up, give this a go before you consider investing in more expensive procedures. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work, the Vitality and its various different brush heads are still a great toothbrush to use, so while you pay a little bit extra for a special attachment, you&#x27;re only losing $2-3 at most.</li>
    <li> I have been using only cleaning and sensitive brushes and I realized my Oral B toothbrush has several settings.  Now I am using the Whitening setting with this new head.  Thanks for educating me on my toothbrush system.</li>
    <li> I was not exactly sure how well this product would work when I purchased it but I decided why not try it anyways. I was pleasantly surprised. My front teeth have the feeling of freshly being polished. I would say however this only works well on your front teeth and a floss action brush is recommended for everything else.</li>
    <li> Be sure to buy a true Oral-B. After trying a generic replacement, I went back to the Oral-B produced ones. Don&#x27;t ever go generic with your toothbrush head again!</li>
    <li> These work well with my Oral B toothbrush system. I change them at least every 3 months and always after a cold or any illness. I like to have one ready and subscribe and save makes it easy.</li>
    <li> I was upset to find that this add was for ONE brush head only. The price was comparable to three heads on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;While this seams to be a genuine Oral-B brush the quality is poor compared to other heads I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Although my teeth are a bit stained from coffee &amp; tea, there was no plaque on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Pro-white brush actually vibrates after 2 minutes to let you know that you have brushed long enough.&lt;br /&gt;That is the ADA recommendation, brush for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;At first it seemed like forever - but now I am so used to it that when it indicates time is up I feel I could actually brush longer.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said don&#x27;t scrub or rub hard - just hold the brush head on the teeth and move it around slowly - let the brush head do the work, that is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;I am very well pleased, although I think the brush heads are very over priced.&lt;br /&gt;I will order new ones when needed but instead of changing the head every 3 months I am going to try 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;In closing, other than the exorbitant price I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Helped me get another A+ from my dentist!</li>
    <li> Used with whitening toothpaste, my teeth are whiter and brighter with this brush-head.  The yellow polisher in the middle really makes my teeth shine.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t even need toothpaste or whitening gel. This rubber middle cup will hold some whitening paste, but even without anything I can see a real difference. I use it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I have used this head about 5 times and find that I actually get slightly better whitening results from the standard floss action head that comes with the Oral-B 5000.  While the cup design is supposed to hold the paste longer to produce the whitening results, it doesn&#x27;t have near the overall bristle movement of the floss action head.  Also, it does not work well with a gel type toothpaste because the gel does not adhere to the cup for prolonged use.  Good concept but less than stellar results.</li>
    <li> Have been using these brush heads for years. I rarely go to the dentist and people are always complimenting my pearly whites. They are a little pricey but definitely worth the money if you want whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my Oral-B electric toothbrush.  Whitening head really seems to make a difference, my teeth feel more slick and polished after even the first use!</li>
    <li> Very nice! This works as advertised. I can already see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Upgraded version of the replacement brush. It polishes as well.</li>
