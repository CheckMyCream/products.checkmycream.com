      <li>I&#x27;m sure this product would also be good for someone with lighter skin trying to get some color.</li>

      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found to impart a natural looking hue.  </li>
      <li>I have a nice healthy tanned glow again.</li>
      <li>Best lotion on the market, i am allergic to the sun, so this is a great alternative to getting dark for the summer.</li>
      <li>Scent is great at first but after having it on for awhile it has an overpowering odor that I&#x27;ve ran into before with tanning lotions.</li>
      <li>I love Nivea lotion</li>
      <li>I have a lot of family members who started using this on my recommendation and they love it as well.</li>
      <li>but it smells chemically like most tanning lotions after an hour or so</li>
      <li>but I love the feel when it goes on.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>This product does the tan well and has healthier ingredients than most self tanners.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this lotion.</li>
      <li>but this one is ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than jergens and you get more product.</li>
      <li>bought more  </li>
      <li>I like this one a lot better than Jergens.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very sweet like a citrus</li>
      <li>Clear Skin - to my great surprise</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and goes on smooth like most Nivea lotions.</li>
      <li>* Easy to Use</li>
      <li>I love this sunless tanner because its quick to use.</li>
      <li>I saw a difference after one use but after about 4 my skin did get more of a golden tone.</li>
      <li>It gives a gradual light tan but doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly light skinned, but tan</li>
      <li>I really just use it because I need a good lotion to keep my real tan.</li>
      <li>I have not used this yet as I am waiting for it to get a little warmer, I have used this product before and it goes on nice and smooth, smells nice, does not give you that orange look .</li>
      <li>but it is NOT a bad smell at all.</li>
      <li>This is a great benefit versus other tanners that are drying.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Nivea is great hands down and this lotion does not disappoint from a moisturizing and scent standpoint.</li>
      <li>THIS IS AMAZING STUFF, THIS IS THE 2ND YEAR USING IT</li>
      <li>Seems to darken crevices more as most tanning products do, so be careful of that.</li>
      <li>I was really careful to apply evenly, but I did use it fairly liberally.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
      <li>No orange look and rarely a streak.</li>
      <li>Super I use this on my legs as they are slower to tan and a great small boost in color in the winter months.</li>
      <li>THE COLOR IS NICE AND STAYS FOR A LONG TIME OF CORSE</li>
      <li>The color is pretty and it works right away  </li>
      <li>Best part of all - it smells great, no hint of that awful tanner smell</li>
      <li>Very natural looking, non greasy, light moisturizer</li>
      <li>And the moisturizers in the lotion work well to keep skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>For the first time in my adulthood I feel like I can go out without makeup.</li>
      <li>and it does not leave that funny color all over you and your hands.</li>
      <li>I just tried this for the first time.</li>
      <li>Perfect tanning lotion, I use the medium tan shade, I can see color the first application, does not stain my hands, very natural sun kissed look! and does not have the typical tanning lotion smell, and actually hydrate my skin.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it</li>
      <li>Some tanners fade very splotchy.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m an african american, I was wanting to find a way to give my skin a kind of glow.</li>
      <li>Nice even color, it takes a few days to build up color.  </li>
      <li>I really have nothing negative to say, it is just that good.</li>
      <li>I like this way better than any of the other brands</li>
      <li>This stuff rocks, no streaks, natural color &amp; works fast!</li>
      <li>It seems to dry rather quickly too!</li>
      <li>The tan last maybe two days at most then its just suddenly gone.</li>
      <li>If you add more every day or every other day, you can maintain a natural looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They really like this Nivea Sun-Kissed Radiance because it gives a natural looking brown color to their skin without any orange.</li>
      <li>i had this stuff a few years ago, and absolutely love it-</li>
      <li>Within hours you get a little color, after several days you have a nice tan.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell (while applying, next morning smells like fake tanner), love the feel.</li>
      <li>so I consider a day pretty low staying power.</li>
      <li>It is streak free, and far less scent.  </li>
      <li>Though being a glow moisturizer expected to be used daily and being wicked easy to apply, its not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would say it definitely shows results after ONE use, almost as much as the Loreal tanning wipes I use.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a lot of color, but you will have  soft skin.</li>
      <li>Creates a natural color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works really well without giving that weird orange glow that you get from self tanners.  It does still have that self tanner smell.  I can&#x27;t really describe it but if you&#x27;ve used self tanner you know what I am talking about.  It gets the job done though so as long as you can deal with the smell, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this lotion. Nivea is great hands down and this lotion does not disappoint from a moisturizing and scent standpoint. But, even with daily use the &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; effect was non-existent. I will continue to use this as its a great lotion but I will have to go back to other brands to get any color.</li>
    <li> I like this one a lot better than Jergens.  It is streak free, and far less scent.  The color is pretty and it works right away  I really have nothing negative to say, it is just that good.</li>
    <li> Within hours you get a little color, after several days you have a nice tan.  JUST DON&amp;#34;T LIKE SMELL.  BUT, what self tanner ever smells good.</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS!  I like this way better than any of the other brands and I have tried them all.  It&#x27;s not as heavy or thick as Jergens and offers more color that Jergens also.  I won&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
    <li> Nice even color, it takes a few days to build up color.  It is hard to make a mistake with this!  I have a lot of family members who started using this on my recommendation and they love it as well.</li>
    <li> I love this sunless tanner because its quick to use. I&#x27;m always busy and hate tanning. I just hate being ghost white more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to Use - just slather it on like any lotion&lt;br /&gt;* Streak Free&lt;br /&gt;* Natural color - when I put my arm next to my boyfriend who tans we are the same color.&lt;br /&gt;* Smells fair - None of them smell &#x27;good&#x27; but this one is ok. My boyfriend says I smell like peaches. He likes it. I&#x27;m use to it.&lt;br /&gt;* Moisturizing - I have miserably dry skin. This is a great benefit versus other tanners that are drying.&lt;br /&gt;* Clear Skin - to my great surprise this cleared my adult acne and made my spider veins (HATE!!) much harder to see. For the first time in my adulthood I feel like I can go out without makeup. Biggest benefit in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;* Fades Great! - Some tanners fade very splotchy. This one is just there and then gone. I do have a little trouble on my shins but hey, having intensely dry skin it is what it is. No tanner will be flawless on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No Staying Power - The tan last maybe two days at most then its just suddenly gone. Expect to never skip a day to keep your tan around. I use L&#x27;Oreal Sublime for performance to get dark. That stuff will last about 4 days on me so I consider a day pretty low staying power. Though being a glow moisturizer expected to be used daily and being wicked easy to apply, its not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Sublime give a beautiful dark tan on me that last but STINKS - even after a FEW showers. My boyfriend always makes faces at me when I use it. So - my trick is I actually mix 3/4 of Nivea with 1/4 sublime. I get the benefits of both with less cons. Does make the Nivea stink a little more but its barely noticeable and the tan is darker and last longer. Use it before bed and your set.</li>
    <li> Starts to work within a couple days. Not terribly dark though. No smell!!!! Makes your skin really soft. Don&#x27;t expect a lot of color, but you will have  soft skin.</li>
    <li> Very natural looking, non greasy, light moisturizer</li>
    <li> Perfect tanning lotion, I use the medium tan shade, I can see color the first application, does not stain my hands, very natural sun kissed look! and does not have the typical tanning lotion smell, and actually hydrate my skin. My favorite!</li>
    <li> They have change the dispenser so you can not turn it upside down and have it stand up to drain the last of the lotion out. Other than that it adds a touch of color and keeps my skin moist; no complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find this product at my usual brick &amp; mortar haunts with no luck. I&#x27;ve used this gradual tanner for a couple of years and really am happy with the results. Thanx to Amazon I have a nice healthy tanned glow again. Love the product and Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product does the tan well and has healthier ingredients than most self tanners.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year and it&#x27;s great.  It gives a gradual light tan but doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky.</li>
    <li> I have an awful  awful rash!!! I am in severe pain, loads of Benedryl and using hydrocortisone creme!!!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion.  Does not dry out ones skin.  Great brand</li>
    <li> THIS IS AMAZING STUFF, THIS IS THE 2ND YEAR USING IT AND IT DOESN&#x27;T TURN YOU ORNAGE DISCOLOR YOUR HANDS RUB OFF ON OUR CLOTHES. THE COLOR IS NICE AND STAYS FOR A LONG TIME OF CORSE IT USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> I was getting spray tanned 3x a month by a woman that recommended this product to maintain the spray. I ended up not going spray tanning anymore… and just used this everyday. NOT streaky (I&#x27;ve done them all). I work in cosmetics and like to maintain a little color throughout the year to keep a certain look… and this product does it without the harm of a tanning bed. Couldn&#x27;t recommend more (although I think my spray tanner is regretting it!)  NOT a substitute for all over spray tanning, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the $7-8 to try out if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Scent is great at first but after having it on for awhile it has an overpowering odor that I&#x27;ve ran into before with tanning lotions. I just want something that doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very effective for lighter skinned users. While I&#x27;m an african american, I was wanting to find a way to give my skin a kind of glow. The lotion did darken my skin and that&#x27;s why I gave it the rating I did, but the glow I achieved with a body oil mist.</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the first time. Love the smell (while applying, next morning smells like fake tanner), love the feel. It&#x27;s not too greasy and goes on smooth like most Nivea lotions. It seems to take a LONG time to dry. It says streak-free, but I&#x27;m noticing some small variations in color. I was really careful to apply evenly, but I did use it fairly liberally. Seems to darken crevices more as most tanning products do, so be careful of that. I would say it definitely shows results after ONE use, almost as much as the Loreal tanning wipes I use. Definitely less streaks than those though. I&#x27;m fairly light skinned, but tan well, so I opted for the medium to dark. I do not regret the decision of going darker. I think you get quicker results that way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion in the summer for years (sometimes even in winter for a sunny pick me up) &amp; I love it! I wish they would bring back the self tan lotion with the shimmer in it- it makes summer legs look so great!!</li>
    <li> This product does not look &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; like some gradual tanners. It seems to dry rather quickly too!</li>
    <li> I dutifully use sunscreen when I&#x27;m out and about in the summer because I am fair skinned, but I hate not having just a little bit of color.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found to impart a natural looking hue.  No orange look and rarely a streak.</li>
    <li> I love this product it gets the job done and the smell is awesome. I was using a tanner by bath and body works, but the smell of it had that tanning lotion smell that lingered with you for a long time. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Super I use this on my legs as they are slower to tan and a great small boost in color in the winter months. Not orange and I have never had this streak.  I use it after I get out of the shower at least 2 to 4 times a week. I have used this brand for years - loved the Sun Kissed leg version but never see it in the stores any more. Some other brands have itched or bothered my skin and this brand doesn&#x27;t.  Works Great - Very good item quality for price. It came on time and in good condition. No problems Great</li>
    <li> Lotion works great.  Creates a natural color.  The issue is the lotion stinks.  The smell gets worse as the day goes on.  I love Nivea lotion but I just couldn&#x27;t make it through the bottle.  I threw it away after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely with no odor.  However, I was expecting the medium to dark tan to be a deeper color.  You also have to be careful to blend in the product well so you have even tanning.</li>
    <li> I have not used this yet as I am waiting for it to get a little warmer, I have used this product before and it goes on nice and smooth, smells nice, does not give you that orange look . You get a nice glow from this and you will gradually get darker depending oh how often you use it. Great price for the name and the size.</li>
    <li> i had this stuff a few years ago, and absolutely love it- the smell is great, even for a man!</li>
    <li> The smell is very sweet like a citrus but it smells chemically like most tanning lotions after an hour or so but it is NOT a bad smell at all. I saw a difference after one use but after about 4 my skin did get more of a golden tone. You DO need to apply this evenly because some spots can end up a little darker than others. It has a bit of an orangey tone but it doesn&#x27;t look that fake. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market, i am allergic to the sun, so this is a great alternative to getting dark for the summer.</li>
    <li> This is the best gradual tanner I have ever used.  Light scent, great coverage, no orange!!  And the price.....hello!..no store that I found can beat it!!</li>
    <li> For someone who tans regularly, this product isn&#x27;t a miracle. I really just use it because I need a good lotion to keep my real tan. Although, it&#x27;s nice to have something that is gradually giving you color too. This stuff is a little thick for me, It is a pain to completely rub in. It smells good though. I was worried that there wasn&#x27;t going to be much product because it isn&#x27;t a super big bottle, but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m sure this product would also be good for someone with lighter skin trying to get some color.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks, no streaks, natural color &amp; works fast! Best part of all - it smells great, no hint of that awful tanner smell</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I used it every day for two weeks, sometimes twice a day, for the back of my legs which are never tan. I never noticed a tan. It does not smell bad right out of the bottle but once you rub it on your skin it has that nasty smell that most tanners have. I would rather have white legs than smell Wasted my money on this one.</li>
    <li> My two teen daughters like to use sunless tanning products and have tried just about every brand. They really like this Nivea Sun-Kissed Radiance because it gives a natural looking brown color to their skin without any orange. It takes several days of applying it to get to the optimal color, but then it lasts for days. If you add more every day or every other day, you can maintain a natural looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight scent, as do all the sunless tanners, but it quickly fades after you apply it. And the moisturizers in the lotion work well to keep skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Not the best smell but I love the feel when it goes on. I love the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; I get with this!  :)  It&#x27;s cheaper than jergens and you get more product. The only downside is the smell but it&#x27;s nothing unbearable.</li>
    <li> bought more  I like the way it feels and it does not leave that funny color all over you and your hands.</li>
    <li> Good product. Thanks!</li>
