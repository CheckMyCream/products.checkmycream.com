      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>so you can use your favorite brow color.  </li>
      <li>my rebel brows don&#x27;t love at all when I put this gel On.</li>
      <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
      <li>and it does a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>It can be removed easily with your nighttime face cleaner.</li>
      <li>Easy to work with</li>
      <li>It smooths &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; eyebrows easily.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money. :)</li>
      <li>They are a great finishing touch to my look on a daily basis!  </li>
      <li>I have used this brow gel for a few days and am so impressed with it.  </li>
      <li>Very light and good product that delivers as promised as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply.</li>
      <li>Does a great job keeping my brows flat.</li>
      <li>Keeps my brows in place and laying flat, great product.</li>
      <li>but they are definitely worth it!  </li>
      <li>I love it as it make my brows look highly manicured and also makes my eyes look larger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gel is light, so it holds your eyebrows in place and seals in any powder you use to darken them without making your eyebrows look &amp;#34;wet.&amp;#34; that is why it is worth the money vs. buying a cheap clear mascara.</li>
      <li>I love the Anastasia clear brow gel.  </li>
      <li>With that being said, I have never found a clear gel that worked better.</li>
      <li>like it better than Maybelline clear mascara.</li>
      <li>Yes they cover grey and make your brows fuller and more youthful!</li>
      <li>Suggest you brush your eyebrows with an eyebrow brush right after applying the gel to style.</li>
      <li>Definitely makes me feel better when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this for several years and it is fantastic!</li>
      <li>The little bit I could, it did work nicely.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This product really does shape and maintain the brows.</li>
      <li>but it really does nothing.</li>
      <li>seeing that I was at a Halloween party and was dancing the whole night until I took it off with a make-up wipe.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used regular drug store clear brow/mascara gels all my life and finally gave in to this product when i read all the good reviews.</li>
      <li>The price here was  better than other stores.  </li>
      <li>Much better than using vasaline or any other at home product to make your brows look fuller.</li>
      <li>I recommend the clear gel first and when it dries, the color of your choice.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
      <li>I discovered this brow gel through a makeup artist who highly recommended the Anastasia line.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend; worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have only used this product a few times and love it already!</li>
      <li>and  I  can&#x27;t  live  </li>
      <li>Makes your brows look very natural when filling in with powder.</li>
      <li>My brows are pretty short, so I ended up not using this.  </li>
      <li>I use the Anastasia set and brush right over my brows after letting the gel dry for a minute.</li>
      <li>I ordered clear gel, but I got a brown color.</li>
      <li>I like that it is clear</li>
      <li>Before I knew there was clear brow gel, I was using the brow drama by</li>
      <li>HOLDS BROW IN PLACE AND GOES ON CLEAR.  </li>
      <li>It is a clear gel as I prefer.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Clear gel because that is what my brow esthetician suggested.  </li>
      <li>I tried clear mascara and that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Just got last night, my brows go straight up, I am a stomach sleeper</li>
      <li>I have wild brows</li>
      <li>It really holds my unruly brows in place for the entire day.  </li>
      <li>and I am on my third tube of the clear brow gel!  </li>
      <li>Lost a star because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the steep price, but due to the brand and the fact that it is the only product out there like this, I will continue to purchase!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brow gels, including just clear mascara and hairspray.  </li>
      <li>High quality and long lasting.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this for several years and it is fantastic! It holds my browns in place nicely without looking like I am wearing a product.  It never flakes off or looks white like some similar products. The price here was  better than other stores.  This is a must have product!</li>
    <li> I finally received this product after ordering it Dec 29th It took 11 days :(&lt;br /&gt;I wore it Jan 9th today when i got it. I like it. It held my crazy unruly brows in place, I only put a little bit because it can flake and cake if too much is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than Maybelline clear mascara. Expensive but worth it. I hope it lasts for more than 1 month since i don&#x27;t wear make-up every day.&lt;br /&gt;Try it and compare for yourself,you may like or lOve it. :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Very light and good product that delivers as promised as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply.</li>
    <li> Keeps my brows in place all day. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best clear brow gel on the market. Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice size, great price. This product really does shape and maintain the brows. It is a clear gel as I prefer. I use the Anastasia set and brush right over my brows after letting the gel dry for a minute. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Does a great job keeping my brows flat.Love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve used regular drug store clear brow/mascara gels all my life and finally gave in to this product when i read all the good reviews. it keeps my eyebrows in place ALL day, without reapplication. I love, love, love. Totally worth the money. :)</li>
    <li> Great product! Lost a star because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the steep price, but due to the brand and the fact that it is the only product out there like this, I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Not as impressed with this product as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Overall, I like the product. Does keep your eyebrows in place without being sticky or gooey. Suggest you brush your eyebrows with an eyebrow brush right after applying the gel to style.</li>
    <li> A little sticky but keeps your brows in place!</li>
    <li> The best thing to hold your eyebrows in place all day!!! Not too heavy either.</li>
    <li> Makes your brows look very natural when filling in with powder.</li>
    <li> Before I knew there was clear brow gel, I was using the brow drama by I think Maybelline? to set my eyebrows. I noticed that the brow drama would put more brown into my already perfected brows.. So I bought this and I absolutely love it. Very necessary buy if you want your brows to stay still once you&#x27;ve perfected them!</li>
    <li> Just got last night, my brows go straight up, I am a stomach sleeper so eight hours forced,  this is helping so far. I would recommend a brow comb after putting gel on, maybe they should have a comb and not a brush as applicator</li>
    <li> I thought it would make my brows thicker but it really does nothing. It was a waste of money as it does nothing.</li>
    <li> This product is no different than any gel I could dip my pinkie into and apply to my brows.  It did not keep my brows in place.  I find that a spritz of hair spray on my finger then applied to my brow works better than anything. Don&#x27;t waste your big bucks on this</li>
    <li> I ordered clear gel, but I got a brown color. I like Anastasia brow gels any way. So I did not return it.</li>
    <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is pricey. With that being said, I have never found a clear gel that worked better. Someone mentioned that it gets crusty and hard. If you do not touch the gel after apply, it does get a bit hard. I like to do a once over the product with my index finger. Afterwards, I never experience any crustiness or hardness on my brow. After it dries, I will sometimes use a brow pencils to fill in areas needed. My brows stay perfectly all day.  This gel has given me confidence that my brow stay shaped the way I left them in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this product was discounted. I use it everyday and have had it two months. I have yet to replace due to running out. I gave it four stars because I believe part of the expensive cost is due to it being a brand name product.</li>
    <li> While what wasn&#x27;t dry worked well, 99.999% of it was dry!!!! The cap wasn&#x27;t on tight and it must&#x27;ve been sitting around for a while. I will try purchasing it from Ulta or Sephora instead. Not going to bother sending it back.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brow shaper!</li>
    <li> Very good Quality. my rebel brows don&#x27;t love at all when I put this gel On. I Definitely recomend this gel.</li>
    <li> I discovered this brow gel through a makeup artist who highly recommended the Anastasia line. First time I bought the whole kit which basically teaches you how to make your eyebrows awesome; now I can do it on my own with just a pencil and this gel. I hope they never discontinue the product bc I&#x27;ve repurchased about 5 times over the past two years. Definitely recommend; worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use a heavy hand or your boyfriend will ask why your eyebrows feel hard.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clear gel because that is what my brow esthetician suggested.  I love it as it make my brows look highly manicured and also makes my eyes look larger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! I purchased both the brow pencil and gel made my Anastasia!</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> Works well.  Took one star away because it makes your eyebrows really hard.</li>
    <li> HOLDS BROW IN PLACE AND GOES ON CLEAR.  NO COMPLAINTS.  CAN CAUSE A CRUSTY FEELING BUT THAT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME SINCE IT DOES IT&#x27;S JOB.</li>
    <li> This did work if I put my brush in several times, tube was almost dry, couldn&#x27;t get any out. The little bit I could, it did work nicely. But would never buy again because of being almost dry, too expensive for that.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does what it says! I have thick eye brows and I love to have them nicely shaped without the need to over pluck or trim. This product maintains them in place and it lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Love it! Much better than using vasaline or any other at home product to make your brows look fuller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the product on the wand. It takes using for a few weeks to build up to get a decent amount for application. For the price I was expecting something with better hold. Will search for something stronger next time.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great and my eyebrows stay perfect all day</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this but I actually hate it. It made my brows dry and crusty by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Easy to work with and it does a pretty good job.  It might take a couple of swipes for those tough to tame brow hairs. You might need to refresh it if you go from work to dinner.  I like that it is clear so you can use your favorite brow color.  I recommend the clear gel first and when it dries, the color of your choice. It can be removed easily with your nighttime face cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times and love it already! I have gnarly eyebrows and nothing could tame them I tried clear mascara and that didn&#x27;t work. This is expensive but worth it if your eyebrows don&#x27;t stay in place after brushing them out. This keeps them perfect after filling them. I can&#x27;t wait to try a tinted one!</li>
    <li> I love the Anastasia clear brow gel.  It really holds my unruly brows in place for the entire day.  If I touch my brows, I can feel the gel--kind of like when you have a lot of hair spray in your hair.  But it doesn&#x27;t clump, flake, or otherwise give any visual cues that it&#x27;s there--other than great looking, stay-in-place eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Ordered and reordered.  Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I have wild brows and I was looking to see if there was anything that can tame them, this product did just that for the time that I put it on, it did not&lt;br /&gt;Flake seeing that I was at a Halloween party and was dancing the whole night until I took it off with a make-up wipe. Great product!</li>
    <li> My brows are pretty short, so I ended up not using this.  I can see that it holds good and would be great for someone with unruly brows:-)</li>
    <li> Only reason I am giving this product 4 stars is because I&#x27;d like it to last longer. I find that for every pencil and a half that I use, I need to replace the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if the gel could through two pencils - otherwise, excellent product and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Best brow gel I know of. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Holds my eyebrow shape all day. Great product and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It smooths &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; eyebrows easily.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Same price as sephora.</li>
    <li> Keeps unruly eyebrows in place all day</li>
    <li> I love this! A girl friend introduced me to this product. As a male with thick and unruly brows, just a few swipe of this thing in the morning and the hairs just neatly stay in place throughout the day. It&#x27;s not noticeable unless you feel it (the dried texture feels like dried hairspray). My only complaint would be the $$ for such a tiny tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brow gels, including just clear mascara and hairspray.  This works much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  Keeps brows in place.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows stay in place all day</li>
    <li> Keeps my brows in place and laying flat, great product.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, nothing spectacular!</li>
    <li> The BEST brow gel available--superior to all others.</li>
    <li> I know my local supermarket stocks a clear brow gel for just a couple of bucks, unfortunately it made my brows look like I had applied a two dollar gel to them.  I have used this brow gel for a few days and am so impressed with it.  It tames my unruly brows without a pound of goop or flakes.  Definitely makes me feel better when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It has been over a year and I am on my third tube of the clear brow gel!  I have also on my second jar of eyebrow pomade.  These items are more costly than the drugstore but they are definitely worth it!  High quality and long lasting.  They are a great finishing touch to my look on a daily basis!  Yes they cover grey and make your brows fuller and more youthful!</li>
    <li> This gel is light, so it holds your eyebrows in place and seals in any powder you use to darken them without making your eyebrows look &amp;#34;wet.&amp;#34; that is why it is worth the money vs. buying a cheap clear mascara.</li>
    <li> Perfect  and  strong  fixing!&lt;br /&gt;I  have  long  and  thick  hair  on  my  brows  and  I  can&#x27;t  live  whithout  this  product.</li>
