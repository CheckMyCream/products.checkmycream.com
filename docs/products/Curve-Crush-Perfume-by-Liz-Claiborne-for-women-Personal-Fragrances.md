      <li>Fast shipping, they kept me updated of the shipping status, the product is exactly as described, excellent for the price,I&#x60;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love</li>
      <li>My favorite fragrance and at a lower price than the department stores.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Not overpowering like most perfumes.  </li>
      <li>The packaging for the perfume and the perfume bottle looked authentic but when I sprayed the perfume it didn&#x27;t smell like Curve Crush.</li>
      <li>I love Curve Crush.  </li>
      <li>I think it also makes a lovely room scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok scent</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The receipient of the Crush by Curve was totally satisfied, as was I, with this purchase from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I just love the scent of this parfume.</li>
      <li>As a guy, I always love smelling this on my lady.  </li>
      <li>It lasts all day it I love</li>
      <li>Would be great for younger ladies or teachers, nurses etc where strong fragrance is not appropriate..but still has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend first commented how good I smelled when wearing curve</li>
      <li>This perfume is not too strong but more on the medium scent.</li>
      <li>It would go on strong and then after a while the smell would just disappear.</li>
      <li>- so glad I can find it on Amazon - its a very soft, warm floral scent - softer version of the original Curve... often after spraying</li>
      <li>Product arrived in perfect condition in just a few days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for quite some time, and frequently get compliments about how good I smell</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more on the spicy side which I don&#x27;t like very much.</li>
      <li>I am a huge collector of frangrance and this is definitely a sweet powdery day fragrance..</li>
      <li>I do recommend the original curve for women.</li>
      <li>It is a light, sweet smell.  </li>
      <li>It was the right price!  </li>
      <li>I was super excited about that</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>It has good throw and one or two spritzes will definitely do the job.  </li>
      <li>the fragance is not bad.  </li>
      <li>This perfume smells great, but for some reason almost immediately gave my wife a headache when she put it on and unfortunately for us if you try to return it, Amazon says this:  \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
      <li>The first thing I think when I smell it, is of those slightly sweet lavender baby products by Johnson and Johnson.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price of $22 for the 3.4oz bottle.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the original Curve back when I was a teenager, but grew out of that style of fragrance and have not touched a Curve scent since.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not watered down to fill the bottle, this is the real deal for a great price!</li>
      <li>Absolutely intoxicating!</li>
      <li>very shower fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product from many different stores before but never at the price of 19.64</li>
      <li>Curve Crush initially goes on quite strong, with an almost soapy smell however.  </li>
      <li>THANKS.</li>
      <li>Bought this for a Christmas gift for my mother, she absolutely loves the gift set.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a very  feminine scent.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s mildly reminiscent of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft).  </li>
      <li>After just an hour or two, however, it fades significantly, leaving behind a much softer, more powder-like scent.  </li>
      <li>I think they ask more with this cologne than any of my more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>Definitely consider if you are looking for a quick gift.</li>
      <li>It is so simple elegant sensual relaxes ur thoughts and stress and whenever I smell this it makes me feel simple at home!</li>
      <li>Will definately make more purchases as its better than buying from expensive department stores.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it as a daily-wear perfume.</li>
      <li>I use to wear this scent in high school</li>
      <li>I love fragerances and have a few which I use.  </li>
      <li>This is a very wearable scent - it&#x27;s not too youthful and not too mature, but instead lies in the middle in a very casual-scent territory.  </li>
      <li>That is what you will hear when you put on this velvety soft scent!</li>
      <li>Why buy expensive perfume when you can have an equally pleasant experience.</li>
      <li>its very soft, not intrusive, loud or offensive ...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve also sprayed it over my sheets (which you will want to avoid doing near your pillowcase of course).      </li>
      <li>and I think, wow ...</li>
      <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I usually just can&#x27;t get enough of this perfume, and now on Amazon I can get a bigger bottle than most places offer for a heck of a deal!</li>
      <li>Curve Crush would be ideal for the woman who is looking for a very subtle, understated fragrance for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not for me (23 yr old)</li>

<li> This is a little powdery and definitely has some lavender in it and also a sweetness to it - which is not overwhelming and is far more toned down than, say, Pink Sugar.    </li>
<li> Ordered this beatiful fragrance and it was shipped very fast in a hard shell.</li>
<li> Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about buying a fragrance online because some sites have watered down deals</li>
<li> I love this fragrance for every day wear, be it jeans and a hoodie or dress down day casual at the office.</li>
<li> With all the other Curve Crush perfumes that i&#x27;ve purchased from different places the smell lingered well into the evening.  </li>
<li> This is definitely my scent, it&#x27;s subtle and soft, yet it stays with me all day.  </li>
<li> This scent is so not worth buying at all.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic like Curve.</li>
<li> but my little sister loves it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The price was superb...even with shipping charges was cheaper than dept stores prices.  Great service.  Product arrived in perfect condition in just a few days.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for years. I get so many compliments on it.  It is a light, sweet smell.  Not overpowering like most perfumes.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great, but for some reason almost immediately gave my wife a headache when she put it on and unfortunately for us if you try to return it, Amazon says this:  \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.

    <li> This perfume took me by total surprise.  I enjoyed the original Curve back when I was a teenager, but grew out of that style of fragrance and have not touched a Curve scent since.  I tried this one because my sister in law gave it to me and I figured I might as well!    The first thing I think when I smell it, is of those slightly sweet lavender baby products by Johnson and Johnson.  This is a little powdery and definitely has some lavender in it and also a sweetness to it - which is not overwhelming and is far more toned down than, say, Pink Sugar.    This is a very wearable scent - it&#x27;s not too youthful and not too mature, but instead lies in the middle in a very casual-scent territory.  It has good throw and one or two spritzes will definitely do the job.  I think it also makes a lovely room scent and I&#x27;ve also sprayed it over my sheets (which you will want to avoid doing near your pillowcase of course).      I give this 4 out of 5 stars - lovely scent!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Sister. She said she wanted some perfume for Christmas and she liked Curve. I bought her this and she says she loves it. That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  It was the right price!  I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, they kept me updated of the shipping status, the product is exactly as described, excellent for the price,I&#x60;m very satisfied with this purchase. Keep up this excellent service guys!!!!</li>
    <li> love it! I dont smell the cinnamom as some reviewers have but oh well. If you like VS \\&quot;heavenly\\&quot; you will probably like this.</li>
    <li> There are very few perfumes I purchase immediatly after depleting, but this is without question my all time addiction. The scent is powder fresh, with hints of delicate spice and the bloodhounds always seem to come out of hiding when I&#x27;m wearing it. Absolutely intoxicating!</li>
    <li> Curve Crush initially goes on quite strong, with an almost soapy smell however.  After just an hour or two, however, it fades significantly, leaving behind a much softer, more powder-like scent.  There is a vanilla quality to the fragrance as well as very slight floral notes.  Overall, it&#x27;s a feminine fragrance with a youthful air about it (it&#x27;s mildly reminiscent of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft).  Curve Crush would be ideal for the woman who is looking for a very subtle, understated fragrance for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> That is what you will hear when you put on this velvety soft scent! I love this fragrance for every day wear, be it jeans and a hoodie or dress down day casual at the office. Men as well as women always stop and ask me what am I wearing? I think they ask more with this cologne than any of my more expensive ones. It is just that good! If you are a fan of lavendar,baby powder and a bit of vanilla,this little spray-on is a treat!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out all curve perfume varieties. I thought this would be a sweeter scent but it&#x27;s more on the spicy side which I don&#x27;t like very much. It&#x27;s an ok scent but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I do recommend the original curve for women. That&#x27;s a very  feminine scent.</li>
    <li> This perfume is not too strong but more on the medium scent. Why buy expensive perfume when you can have an equally pleasant experience. I like all curve scents and I think you will too. My boyfriend first commented how good I smelled when wearing curve and I wear a lot of scents and that has never happened. I find amazons price quite good also. I personally think curve is for the ages of 15 to 35 but would probably work well with all ages. Plus this perfume don&#x27;t make me sneeze like some do.</li>
    <li> As a guy, I always love smelling this on my lady.  Definitely draws me close.  I highly recommend it as a daily-wear perfume.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for a Christmas gift.  Purchased  through Amazon this was an excellent value, saving more than 40% of the retail cost.  In addition, a great deal of time and money was saved in shopping online and the product was received in perfect condition and in a timely manner. The receipient of the Crush by Curve was totally satisfied, as was I, with this purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> People always tell me how good I smell when I wear this! I love it.</li>
    <li> I am proud of this purchase.  The price is great and the item is great.  Speedy delivery and the fragance is not bad.  Great for the price.  Will definately make more purchases as its better than buying from expensive department stores.  GREAT BUY.. THANKS.</li>
    <li> I use to wear this scent in high school and I was so excited to find it at a great price. It lasts all day it I love</li>
    <li> I brought Curve Crush for women and was very disappointed when I received it. The packaging for the perfume and the perfume bottle looked authentic but when I sprayed the perfume it didn&#x27;t smell like Curve Crush. It would go on strong and then after a while the smell would just disappear. With all the other Curve Crush perfumes that i&#x27;ve purchased from different places the smell lingered well into the evening.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product from many different stores before but never at the price of 19.64 so I thought it was a great deal. Next time I will just go ahead and spend the extra money. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with Amazon before and I will continue to order from here just not when buying my perfume.</li>
    <li> My sister is obsessed with this perfume, I brought it for her last year, when she was 13, and I&#x27;m buying this again for her this holiday as a stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells okay. It&#x27;s definitely not for me (23 yr old) but my little sister loves it.</li>
    <li> Product got here in two days !!!!!! I was super excited about that and it smells amazing ! Can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic like Curve.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance and at a lower price than the department stores. Will purchase over and over. Love Love Love</li>
    <li> Ordered this beatiful fragrance and it was shipped very fast in a hard shell. I just love the scent of this parfume. It is so simple elegant sensual relaxes ur thoughts and stress and whenever I smell this it makes me feel simple at home!</li>
    <li> I stumbled on to this scent over a holiday season, but find it very hard to locate - so glad I can find it on Amazon - its a very soft, warm floral scent - softer version of the original Curve... often after spraying, I feel like I can no longer smell it - but then someone compliments the scent and I think, wow ... its very soft, not intrusive, loud or offensive ... but just enough for people to notice</li>
    <li> This by far the best perfume price I have ever seen. I thought the gift sets were good, this size is awesome.</li>
    <li> I usually just can&#x27;t get enough of this perfume, and now on Amazon I can get a bigger bottle than most places offer for a heck of a deal! Definitely not watered down to fill the bottle, this is the real deal for a great price!</li>
    <li> I love Curve Crush.  It&#x27;s one of those scents that never goes out of style.  It&#x27;s very sexy.  I&#x27;ve gotten complimented on it every time I wear it.  Definitely worth the price of $22 for the 3.4oz bottle.</li>
    <li> Always loved the aroma of this fragrance.  Quite a surprise to see it on Amazon, but very happy I did.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my scent, it&#x27;s subtle and soft, yet it stays with me all day.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for quite some time, and frequently get compliments about how good I smell</li>
    <li> I love fragerances and have a few which I use.  I added this too my collection and EVERY time I wear it I get a compliment on how good I smell by a gentlemen...nice way to spend the day :-)</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Christmas gift for my mother, she absolutely loves the gift set. Definitely consider if you are looking for a quick gift.</li>
    <li> Smells like baby powder or something for a baby! This scent is so not worth buying at all. Save money and use baby powder if you want this perfume</li>
    <li> el articulo es justo lo que esperaba, el articulo se encontraba en perfecto estado y sin detalles, lo recomiendo 100%, excelente</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about buying a fragrance online because some sites have watered down deals but it is the actual fragrance.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter as a Christmas present.  She was very pleased with the bottle size, and fragrance, I was quite happy with the price.</li>
    <li> I am loving this perfume..I am a huge collector of frangrance and this is definitely a sweet powdery day fragrance..very shower fresh smelling. Would be great for younger ladies or teachers, nurses etc where strong fragrance is not appropriate..but still has a pleasant scent.</li>
