      <li>The three of them apply nicely but out of the 3 of them Essie Shine of the Times</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice effect - not as blown away as I thought I was going to be after reading the reviews here.  </li>
      <li>Also I love the Nubar brush, and the formula is good.</li>
      <li>but it really looks best out in sunlight.</li>
      <li>This is a nice nail polish</li>
      <li>I also wore it on its own.</li>
      <li>I just really liked this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shiny, and the bottle is nice.</li>
      <li>Very cool holographic flakes in this polish looks great over any of your favorite nail polish.</li>
      <li>The polish has a liquid-y gel like substance so over applying is very easy to do.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than most of the Finger Paint flakies out there as well!</li>

      <li>top coat does have a noticeable red-orange-yellow tint to the flakes when the light hits it, not quite a full rainbow spectrum, but still a beautiful and easy layering effect that is sure to impress.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on this, and want to try more Nubar polishes.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m glad i bought it</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Most glitter you can feel, it sticks up, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very eye-catching and looks great over a variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Besides, who can resist that adorable bottle shape?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE this polish!  It has the same effect as Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hidden Treasure, which was a limited edition and is extremely hard to find.  The shape of the bottle is great too and makes it really easy to control the brush. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is awesome and I got it so quickly! Must have, can go on any color of nail polish, especially looks good on the darker ones!</li>
    <li> I love glitter and holographic nail polish- I was so disappointed when China Glaze discontinued their holographic collection. I don&#x27;t like my holos to have texture- this doesn&#x27;t. I am still experimenting with it putting over different colors. This polish has fine glitter, mostly pink-orange-peach mixture, with indoor light. With sunlight I can see slight specks of green and blue. This is great stuff and I am stocking up on it before it goes away too! The more layers you put on, the more holo effect you get. It dries pretty quick too.</li>
    <li> This is my first flakey polish, and I love the look, a green, yellow, orange reflection. Over black it&#x27;s like autumn leaves or an oil slick, over a sheer nude it looks like an opal. My only complaint is that the finish Is not as shiny as I would like. I would prefer not having to add an extra top coat and plan on checking on Nails, Inc flakies in the future to see if they fix that problem.</li>
    <li> Nubar 2010 was my first flakie polish and I love it!! I always get compliments when I wear it, especially over dark colors like black and grey. The polish isn&#x27;t too thick and not too thin. I think it was priced fair and free shipping is always a plus :)) I would DEFINETLY recommend this polish to anyone thinking about buying!! Great seller too! Received the polish fast!! :D</li>
    <li> Came in right on time! The application of this nailpolish is smooth and everything i wanted! I love ittt!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is amazing. It has pretty big flakes that shine red/orange to green.  I suggest wearing it as a top coat over black, blue, or dark purple, as it looks boring on its own. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on this, and want to try more Nubar polishes.  I&#x27;ve had problems with some glitter polishes where I dip the brush in and get all clear polish and no glitter, but this doesn&#x27;t have that problem, one coat is sufficient.</li>
    <li> The mail delivery time and pricing on this item gets a ***** star rating from me. Thank you and please pardon the delay in my response. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This polish looks deceiving, like jus another polish but when u layer it it transforms your polish, especially.dark ones, looks molten almost. Get it , it is amazing!</li>
    <li> This was my first flakie nail polish. When i was searching for it I couldn&#x27;t find a decent price including shipping, until i noticed it on amazon. This nail polish is a perfect match to Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hidden Treasure, which is extremely hard to find unless you are willing to spend insane amounts of money on, and GOSH Rainbow, which is a UK brand and is also impossible to find in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a topcoat or even by itself. The flakes shine a red, orange, or green depending on the lighting and layered over black looked like molten lava. Even though this works better/shows more of an effect on dark colors, it also looks great on lighter colors. And if you are feeling extra creative you can layer a matte finish on top of this nail polish for an even more unique look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removal of the polish is a bit harder then just plain nail polish due to the flakes, but its easier than glitter nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! It looks specifically fantastic over dark colors, though not so much on its own or over light colors.  The brush is nice too; it&#x27;s wide, but not hard to handle at all.  Nothing but good things to say. &lt;3</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish EVER! I had been contemplating buying it for a long time and finally decided to when I got an Amazon gift card. I painted it over OPI&#x27;s Midnight in Moscow and it has yet to stop amazing me. Every light makes it reflect a different color: in very low light it reflects purple, in conventional house lighting it reflects mostly reds and greens, in sunlight it reflects an entire rainbow, and in bluer lights it reflects yellow. I have only tried it with dark nail polish, but I am excited to keep trying out new combos. Everyone comments on how amazing it looks!    Definitely apply two coats, though. The first coat will look good enough, but the second coat provides more even coverage. Be sure not to wipe off the brush too much, as you&#x27;ll be wiping off the flakes.    If you are even looking at this page, BUY THIS POLISH. It will change your life.</li>
    <li> The nail polish arrived sooner than expected and was in perfect condition. This is my new favorite nail polish! If you would like to see pictures of this polish please visit my blog [...]I would recommend this nail polish to anyone who loves doing their nails!</li>
    <li> This polish is wonderful. I was thinking of buying either this or Essie&#x27;s \\&quot;Shine of the Times&#x27; (they both had a similar effect). I am so happy that I purchased this item. The pictures do it no justice. I am wearing it over black right now. After two coats, it has a beautiful color-changing shimmer. I&#x27;ve already gotten complements after not even a full day. If it were possible, I would give it more than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I ordered this item, but decided it looked cool.  When I got it in the mail and tried it on my nails, I was blown away!  It looks so amazing on my nails!  It adds beautiful iridescent flakes to any solid nail color and looks slightly different on different colors.  On a dark color, the flakes are more obviously colored and reflect red, orange, yellow, and green.  On a light color it gives the iridescent feeling of an opal.  I loved it so much, I bought a bottle for each of my friends for Christmas!  Perfect for changing up any color!</li>
    <li> This is a super color! No one has anything like it. PLEASE DON&#x27;T READ those reviews that say the color is static, it isn&#x27;t. It changes as the light refracts; you have to turn your nails over and around to get the full spectrum of colors this polish gives off. It is great. I said it before, but it is worth repeating: I am officially an OPI convert! This is a great product for an AMAZING price!</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments on this polish! I love it and can&#x27;t stop staring at it... it is very fun to try with different colors.</li>
    <li> beautiful on any color especially  on dark purples and black. a big eye catcher in the sunlight. definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> Very cool holographic flakes in this polish looks great over any of your favorite nail polish. This product is very very similar to Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hidden Treasure, which is very hard to find in retail stores. However, it beats Sally&#x27;s price by far.</li>
    <li> This looks both orange and green and looks amazing if you put it on top of a dark nail polish ie. a black one. Looks almost like Minx! Love it! It is nice and thick so looks nice at the first coat.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is awesome! It creates a prism effect on your nails! Best used with a nice dark nail polish (just because you&#x27;ll be able to see it more) or you can do what im doing right now and just use it as a top coat on your natural nail. The only thing thats stopping it from becoming a 5 star is that you see more red prism than the other colors/ but when you do get to see the other colors its like a sparkling light show on your nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite what I expected, but it&#x27;s still pretty. it&#x27;s more of a brass/gold flakes, where I was expecting more neutral. I still really like it though and have used it a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t pay the $30 I have seen it for other places. I think I payed like $8 for it here and that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wondering if this was mislabled. My 2010 is just tiny red sparkles. Not impressed at all, very disappointed. Nothing like the photos. Loved the other 6 Nubar items I purchased.</li>
    <li> After applying this I was trying to figure out what all the great reviews this got were about because all mine turned out to be was red glitter in a clear top coat, no flakes of radiant color, nothing like the pictures at all!  I was very dissapointed.. I also read another review on here that said the same thing, red sparkles for them too, I wonder if this is not the same polish as advertised.  I&#x27;ve applied it by itself and on dark polish as a top coat and just red sparkles :( I could have gotten the same effect with my other polishes I have! Very disappointed indeed.</li>
    <li> Came quickly in the mail. I was wanting this nail polish for a long time before buying it, I was a little disappointed when I tested it and found that it was as \\&quot;flaky\\&quot; as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s more of tiny circle glitters and small flakes of iridescent color. Overall I would definitely buy this again as it is still a pretty color and it will take any nail polish color up a notch.</li>
    <li> I love this polish over dark polishes. It gives it a foiled effect. Very similar to sally hansen hidden treasure and other colors that may be easier to get. I wish they would make more in different colors. Fingerpaints had a line like this at one time</li>
    <li> Loved this polish. It is so unique. Looks great over other colors, especially darker ones. It is great as a top coat for me as well. My polish always comes off at work. With this you could hardly tell where it had started to wear. Hope they come out with more similar to this.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with \\&quot;flakies\\&quot; you&#x27;ll love this. Nubar 2010 has opalescent flat foil-like flakes of various sizes suspended in a clear base. I think this polish is best suited as a top coat for other colors. This is a lot of fun to try on different color polishes, especially dark colors. If you&#x27;ve never tried a flakie style top coat, I highly recommend this one. Unlike some glitter top coats, 2010 dries flat on your polish. Nubar 2010 looks cool topped with a mattifying top coat too. Any nail polish fan should definitely add 2010 to their collection.</li>
    <li> i was looking for the sally hansen hidden treasure nail polish, and i heard this was like the same thing, and was cheaper, and more convenient and readily available. i am so happy i ordered this baby! it is amazing, with all the wonderful holo flakies in it! it transforms a boring mani into something so much more! i will need to get backups of this for sure!</li>
    <li> After seeing a manicure using Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hidden Treasure, I immediately went searching for it.  And nearly fell out of my chair to discover how much it was selling for...waaaaaay out of my price range.  Then, thank goodness I saw a comparison between that and Nubar 2010!  They are almost a perfect match and Nubar 2010 is sooooo much more affordable!  I received my polish very quickly and well packaged. I set out to use it right away. I love love love this as a top coat over dark colors, but it bumps up any polish to another level! I HIGHLY recommend Nubar 2010 if you are search of an awesome flakie polish or just a stunning top coat to make your current polishes POP!</li>
    <li> This polish seriously makes every nail polish look 10 times prettier!  It has so many amazing colors.  It looks just as good over dark colors as it does over light ones.  I would highly recommend this polish!  I would suggest using 2 coats to get the full effect.  I use it over the bundle monster stamps for some really fantastic looks.  People are amazed at the look of my nails!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Nubar and \\&quot;flakies\\&quot; polish. While the polish *looks* plain, once you put it over a darker color, the magic begins! I put it over a deep red and voila! The flakies turned lovely shades of yellow, gold and orange. The other amazing thing about flakies is that they are \\&quot;suspended\\&quot; in the polish. Most glitter you can feel, it sticks up, etc. So this is a really cool effect. Very happy I read the reviews and got this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s less dense than Essie&#x27;s Shine of the Times but more dense than Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hidden Treasure. In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than most of the Finger Paint flakies out there as well! When it&#x27;s under dark polish, Nubar 2010 reflects all kinds of colors ranging from green to copper to red! Also, it has the perfect amount of flakies in that it&#x27;s not so much that it overwhelms your base color but not so little that you have to cake on 3 coats just for it to look decent. This is definitely the best flakie out there and it isn&#x27;t too expensive. Besides, who can resist that adorable bottle shape? Out of my 60+ nail polishes, most of which are high end, Nubar 2010 is one of my absolute favorites.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic polish for layering over dark colors to bring out the holographic effect. It consists of irregular shaped flakes of holographic material that reflect gold, orange, red, green and blue, depending on the light, in a clear base. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this highly coveted polish.</li>
    <li> Using my brother&#x27;s account to write this.  The seller sent the package well and everything was really good.  Now, as for the product itself, I currently own Fingerpaints Twisted, Essie Shine of the Times, and well, Nubar 2010.  The three of them apply nicely but out of the 3 of them Essie Shine of the Times is obviously the most beautiful. You need 2.5 coats of Fingerpaints or Nubar to get the beauty of Essie.  I&#x27;m not even an Essie fan in general, I believe that almost any polish can look glamourous and long-lasting with a good topcoat and basecoat. I say this cause I have $20 polishes as well as $1 and have found them to all look nice when applied right.</li>
    <li> Nubar 2010 is truly a gem. It&#x27;s chock-full of flaky goodness! The iridescent flakes are suspended in a clear base. The flakes flash mostly copper and green, but if you watch closely you&#x27;ll see shades in between for a quick second. It really shines best when used as a top coat, especially over dark colors. My personal favorite combination is this layered over China Glaze First Mate, though I think it would look equally amazing over a dark green polish. My only problem with this polish is that it&#x27;s so beautiful I can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails when I&#x27;m in class or at work. I&#x27;m wearing it now and I keep stopping to admire it! Haha.   The formula is very nice as well. It applies very nicely and dries quick enough, about 5 minutes to dry to the touch but I usually err on the side of caution and give it a good 10 minutes.   Get this polish! It&#x27;s truly worth it!</li>
    <li> It compliments EVERY color as a top coat and I will buy a million more of these! It can be used with every nail polish even alone as a nail polish, you would just need to maintain it so it doesn&#x27;t look dirty on a bare nail.</li>
    <li> I just really liked this product. I&#x27;ve used it a few times over different colored bases and it always looks awesome</li>
    <li> omg, this polish is GAWJUS(gorgeous)!!! i have got soo many compliments on this polish today! it goes on as advertised, and it looks like i got my nails professionally done!  it is like flakes, instead of glitter...and the rainbow colors really beam from gold,green,pink,blue..it really is like a rainbow prism!! this is an alternative to those looking for fingerpaint flakies, this is the bomb.com! love love love, can&#x27;t u tell i love it.</li>
    <li> This polish changes from orange to green. Its very cool. Looks great on dark colored polish. It came in within a few days of me placing my order.</li>
    <li> First of all, this seller is stellar. I ordered it on Sunday (day after New Years) and got it on Tuesday. Also, the shipping on the Nubar site is astronomical, while this seller is so reasonable! Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is so lush and expensive looking. It&#x27;s my new favorite. Extremely easy to apply and so dynamic. It changes colors depending on the light and direction.</li>
    <li> This polish is awesome over a base coat.  I have so far tried it over a hot pink polish and it is beatiful!! This polish really does look like the pics you will see that people have posted.</li>
    <li> This is pretty awesome stuff. This is my first time using Nubar polish, and I&#x27;m  impressed. The glitter is very pretty with flashes of orange and green, and it lies nice and flat on the nail. Nice and smooth, and each coat goes on thin, but with dense glitter :) Dries pretty fast and it&#x27;s hard to ding.     They need to make one that flashes more blue/purple/green!</li>
    <li> This polish is hard to find in my area so I was glad to find it sold for a reasonable price here. It&#x27;s just as I expected and the shipping was super fast!!</li>
    <li> This one is kinda hard to describe. It&#x27;s full of flakes of iridescence. The flakes are all different sizes. It&#x27;s not a glitter. It looks different depending on what polish you wear underneath. I wore it with a light pink but I didn&#x27;t like the results because you could see the little grey flakes when they weren&#x27;t reflecting any colors. I also wore it on its own. It looks okay indoors but it really looks best out in sunlight. It sparkles greenish yellow or reddish blue depending on what angle you look at it. It&#x27;s a unique addition to my polish collection. Also I love the Nubar brush, and the formula is good. Very smooth.  Update: Because of the 2012 flakies craze, I&#x27;ve tried Nubar 2010 on other colors of polish. I have found that wearing it on hot pink looks absolutely AMAZING. I got loads of compliments. There are dupes of Nubar 2010 but I prefer the original, and I&#x27;m proud to have it in my collection!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I have been looking around at flakie nail polishes and this was a great one for a great price. The flakies are mostly red just so you know but it looks fantastic layered over other colors.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Goes best over dark polishes.  Has green/gold/copper highlights depending on the angle you look at it.  Super thin and not clumpy.  I&#x27;m running out after a year....need more!!</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful and somewhat iridescent when applied over a dark nail polish. Great price and long lasting.</li>
    <li> A few things to take note of with this polish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The most accurate customer image is the one from Oakland, CA. Notice that it is mostly orange with the colors changing either in particular light or at certain angles. You&#x27;re not going to walk around with your nails always looking like the first customer image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* MUST use a topcoat. I didn&#x27;t bother with a topcoat when I first applied this polish as a test and while it does harden somewhat (after a while) it remains very soft and is very easily scratched off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Looks best with a single, thin coat (looks like first and second customer image), or else the flakes will overlap too much and just sort of turn into a glittery mass of orange (Oakland customer image). The polish has a liquid-y gel like substance so over applying is very easy to do. Since you only need a thin coat the bottle should last you a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I bought this. I tend to buy flat medium/dark, muted colors but I find a lot of appeal in this. I keep stopping mid-typing just to stare at it. Good stuff at a great price.</li>
    <li> This looks absolutely stunning. On light polishes it has a coppery glow, and on dark colors it shines like rainbows. I need to buy more of this!</li>
    <li> This is one of my new favorite nail polishes, I&#x27;ve tested this over almost every base color I have and it works with almost any color you can imagine. If you&#x27;re patient you can even layer it to make a kind of fire-like gradient effect that looks incredible. The polish is pretty durable, and I like the big metal beads in the bottle, they really do a good job stirring the polish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat does have a noticeable red-orange-yellow tint to the flakes when the light hits it, not quite a full rainbow spectrum, but still a beautiful and easy layering effect that is sure to impress.</li>
    <li> nubar 2010 adds an awesome, fun effect to any nail polish color. I love it and have received SO many compliments on it already. Get it today! It is more sophisticated looking than a glittery top coat.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is so unique and I think it looks a bit more sophisticated than simple sparkle polishes.  It looks so amazing on so many colors too, it adds such dimension.      I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another bottle so I&#x27;ll never be out of this...</li>
    <li> A wonderful flake nail polish. The flakes lay flat on the nail and is long lasting. My manicure lasted for a week without any chipping.</li>
    <li> Really is a must-have!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it forever and the little ball inside keeps the polish going.&lt;br /&gt;It looks amazing on MIdnight Blue colors--like an iridescent night sky</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the most unique nail polishes in my collection.  In the bottle, it looks like shimmery fish scales.  When layered on top of another nail polish color it brings even the most dull colors to life.  The flakes flash from green, to orange, to red, to blue and more depending on how the light hits it, it&#x27;s a definite must have in every nail polish collection!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with how this product turned out. I suggest that you use it on top of dark nail polish colors like dark dark dark blue. I also warn future buyers that the changing colors are very distracting in the best way ever.</li>
    <li> Really lovely looking polish. It almost reminds me of a Nfu Oh polish, only half the price. It&#x27;s shiny, and the bottle is nice.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments about this polish because no one has seen anything like it before. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so I ordered it online. I love this polish! It reflects a variety of colors and looks different from traditional glitter. I usually use about 2 coats to get a really good look, and it works well over any color polish! People will be impressed!</li>
    <li> This polish will give your nails an incredible opalescent finish. It&#x27;s very eye-catching and looks great over a variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think this is a must have polish. It looks great paired with everything I&#x27;ve tried, but it really makes dark colors pop.</li>
    <li> This polish, by far, is my favorite top coat of all time. It is reminiscent of Sally Hansen Hidden Treasure, which is now unfortunately near-impossible to find unless you want to pay an arm and a leg on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect the polish gives is amazing. It will completely transform any dark polish into a beautiful multicolored, fishscale effect - specifically over black. It also adds an interesting twist to lighter, pastel shades and your typical French manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems this Nubar 2010 isn&#x27;t available on Amazon anymore, however if you&#x27;re looking for something identical, pick up Essie Shine of the Times. I own both Nubar 2010 and Shine of the Times, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two!</li>
    <li> Nubar 2010 is a layering polish with iridescent flakies suspended in a clear base that flash gold/orange/copper and green/blue as the light reflects off of the iridescent flakes. The predominant color is copper. Some call this a \\&quot;glitter flake\\&quot; but it&#x27;s certainly not what I think of as a glitter. Glitters are very difficult to remove and have a definite glittery texture - flakies are smooth and easily removed. It&#x27;s one of the best flakies I&#x27;ve tried as the base is semi-thick, but not so thick it&#x27;s difficult to apply.  Dry time is normal. Best of all, it&#x27;s three-free (Formaldehyde, Toluene and DBP) and not tested on animals. This one&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I saw lots of blog reviews of SH Hidden Treasure and Gosh Rainbow. I fell in love with the effects created. Unfortunately both are very hard to find and extremely expensive if you can find them. I had read a blog comparison with Nubar 2010 and the results were nearly identical. Since this product was so inexpensive, I thought it was well worth giving a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived very quickly! I was very impressed with the seller. When I put Nubar 2010 on, I was absolutely delighted with the range of effects it produces! One coat gives a delicate, nearly invisible gloss but with an eye-catching surprise! When you move your hands around, the light catches flecks and sparks of fire just like an opal gem. More coats, more fire! Layering this product over other colors is where it really makes a statement, though. Over pale or translucent colors, the effect is dreamy and mesmerizing!  Layer it over brights and candies and you will be truly dazzled! Layer it over shimmers and your mind will be blown! Layer it over dark colors for a truly stunning effects like night lights, tortoise shell, flecked stone, hammered copper, etc. Nubar 2010 is a clear gloss with transparent holographic flecks. It&#x27;s very, very pretty all by itself. But the best thing about it is that it transforms any nail color beautifully. This means all those nail colors you bought but never use will be transformed! Every color will now be your \\&quot;favorite\\&quot; with a coat or two of Nubar 2010 over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is no joke - it is the best layering nail polish I have tried.  I have one from China Glaze and it is pathetic compared to the Nubar 2010.  I just got in the mail and put it over one of my sparkly Zoya (deep purple) polishes and it kicked it up 1000 notches.  Worth every penny so far and shipping was lightening fast!    I can&#x27;t wait to play around with it more!</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful! 1 or 2 coats gets the desired effect, it doesn&#x27;t take a day to dry, and it&#x27;s simply stunning.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on it. It looks great on black and dark colors, but also nice on lighter colors (I love it over a seaglass color with a mat overcoat!) or white (think opal stones!)</li>
    <li> This polish makes a really cool effect when used as a top coat over a dark or bright nail polish.</li>
    <li> I was very curious about this polish, why so many wonderful comments about this particular polish.&lt;br /&gt;Also didn&#x27;t have any bottle from this brand, so I wanted to give it a try to test the color and the brand.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I find nothing special about this. I don&#x27;t like the red hue over black, it doesn&#x27;t stand out over light colors either.&lt;br /&gt;Overall dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better glitter polishes, but I&#x27;ll definately try other colors in this brand.</li>
    <li> I hate buying a polish and thinking I will love it only for it to fall short. But now I throw this polish on top and I instantly love it. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> this polish isnt at all unique, there are plenty of dupes out there. but i found this one to be the cheapest. it came quickly and in good condition. i like it and i&#x27;m glad i bought it</li>
    <li> Okay - I will confess that this was my first experience with \\&quot;glittery&#x27; nail polish - and though I had read accounts of it being more challenging to remove than regular nail polish, I didn&#x27;t realize I would be requiring a jackhammer LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice effect - not as blown away as I thought I was going to be after reading the reviews here.  It works better with some colors than others, but it&#x27;s hard to play around and experiment when you know how difficult it&#x27;s going to be to take it off.</li>
    <li> This is a amazing polish. Matter of fact I have almost used it all. it is very pretty in sunlight and artificial light.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I LOVE this product. She introduced me to this nail polish and now I wear it all of the time! It looks the best over black polish.</li>
    <li> This is a nice nail polish and I do enjoy it very much. I read reviews that some people said the flakes were &#x27;red&#x27; in color. Although the color seems to change in the lighting, they do seem more red than any other color. I am fine with this product and it is a very neat top-coat.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It changes your nail color so dramatically.</li>
    <li> this is my fav nail poilsh i have right now. i use it when i want soemthing more on jut a bold color. i will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Nubar is a very good polish. I paid 8 dollars for mine about 6 months ago. I can&#x27;t believe it is so expensive now. Just a tip for girls who want the look but are strapped for cash try E.L.F.&#x27;f fairy dust. It&#x27;s 2 dollars and will give the same ranbow effect,even though it smells like funiture varnish until it dries and DO NOT try frankening with this polish brand because it wil turn opaque and the flakies will look dull. Also wait for the base color you layer this over to be completly dry so a reaction doen&#x27;t occur(I&#x27;m refering to fairy dust not 2010). 2010 is a super brand and ten dollars would be all I could pay for it.</li>
