      <li>The best</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is a winner! My husband is always saying good things abut it and wants me to order it again for him.</li>
    <li> Much easier to use than the hard shaving soaps. Seems to have better glide to it. Smells great too, always get compliments from the ladies.</li>
    <li> Works as it should, lathers up easily and allows for a pleasant shave. Love the smell as well.</li>
    <li> Cream is of high quality. I have very sensitive skin to a lot of things and I thought that I would react to this but I did not. With my de razor and this cream I have never had a closer shave even if I payed for them. Smells very strong but I like the smell. Say if i shaved at 6 am you can still smell it on me the next morning. I will buy this brand again and try different sents. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Smells great,whips into a lather easy. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Fabulous shaving cream.  The best</li>
    <li> The container came in cracked. Very frustrating</li>
    <li> Smooth &amp; Thick, Smells Great!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and lather of the shaving cream.  I am switching over to this after finishing off my Baxter shaving cream that I&#x27;ve used over the past year or so.  I noticed the scent stays around for a little while, but not in an off-putting way.  Additionally, this product allows for an extremely close shave (I use a Merker Long Handled Safety Razor).  I actually got several in-grown hairs after the first 3-5 shaves, but these have recently subsided (I have used almost daily for the past two months).  Recommended if you are willing to drop a little more coin for a quality shave.</li>
    <li> Meh. I can&#x27;t criticize this, but it adds little to my wet shave experience. Smells good, has good lubricity, but it is kind of a pain to open and apply in the shower. I will use it up, but actually prefer a wet shave with a double blade using only a great shave oil. My shave oil under this helps greatly, and I don&#x27;t see the need for this extra layer, except for the tradition of having some type of lather on your face.</li>
    <li> I bought the Edwin Jagger safety razor for my husband and bought this product to go along with it. I recall my father used this brand when I was a young girl and also the safety razor. It has a wonderful luxurious lather and you can find dozens of youtube videos with people showing their Sandalwood Shaving Cream off. My husband who had always used those disposable razors (Gillette is definitely not the best a man can get.) was really happy with this product and I think this is going to be a game changer for his bathroom rituals. It smells great and rinses clean. Just remember you need a separate bowl for the shaving cream, you don&#x27;t want to turn the entire bowl into lather. You can buy that separately on Amazon or just use a bowl that you have at home. The consistency is like a soft butter so it&#x27;s easy to transfer to another bowl to use. Some people just put a dollop on the middle of their badger brush and lather it right on their face. I&#x27;m sure you will find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, great product and will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaving cream. My wife loves the scent so much, I have taken to not washing it off, but merely wiping it off thoroughly. Leaves my face in great shape.</li>
    <li> I pretty much always go with Taylor for shave cream.  I know that some people think that sandalwood is a dated scent, but I like it and my 7 year old son gets a kick out of me putting a dollop on the end of his nose, too.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and works well.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells great and lubricates the skin when you are all done.  Very good product, giving it to all of my close friends</li>
    <li> The smell is great, but a little too strong. Strong smells seem to be the staple of the TOBS shaving creams though. The consistency and quality of the lather is good. As other reviewers noted the smell is somewhat old fashioned and might not go well for younger people, but I happen to be middle aged :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to dry my skin a bit more than it should and dries on my face a bit too fast. An excellent product and it inspired me to try other shaving creams by TOBS.to pick the one I will stick with.</li>
    <li> This is not only an excellent shave cream, it is a tremendous value at the price I paid. I&#x27;ve used several premium brands of shave cream/soap in the past, including the Art of Shaving, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn and others. I would put this at or above the others in terms of quality/scent and a much better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick, creamy and slick product, and the Sandalwood scent is very pleasant without being overbearing. The scent is somewhat similar to the Crabtree sandalwood. How you use it will affect your results. The first time i used it I took some out of the container with a wet shaving brush and applied it directly to my face. I got MUCH better results by taking about a tablespoon size portion out of the container onto the brush bristles and then whisking it in a separate shaving bowl to froth it up. That has provided an excellent shave with a thick lather that has given me a well protected shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the extra step creates a little extra clean-up because I&#x27;m using a separate bowl to whip up the lather, the outcome is better than trying to lather this directly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with it and may try other scents. Although not specific to this product, I&#x27;ve found creams somewhat easier to use than shaving soaps, and they produce a stiffer, more protective lather, in my experience.</li>
    <li> Great product for great price.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad and he loved them specially the Sandalwood Shaving Cream and the brush. The stand id sturdy and good quality.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve tried both this product and Art of Shaving&#x27;s - the two big names (evidently) in shaving creams - I figured it&#x27;s about time I write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that both products are very good, and if you&#x27;re trying to decide between one or the other, you&#x27;ll probably be happy with either. However, ultimately I prefer the Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s product a tad bit more. The first one I tried was the Art of Shaving&#x27;s Sandalwood. When that ran out, I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood. When it ran out? I ordered more Taylor of Old Bond Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent-wise, I actually prefer Art of Shaving&#x27;s sandalwood over Taylor&#x27;s. Art of Shaving&#x27;s has a more classic &amp;#34;old barber shop&amp;#34; (or &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;...) sandalwood scent, while Taylor&#x27;s is a little lighter and more...citrusy or floral. Art of Shaving&#x27;s scent seems to last a bit longer on your face, too, which I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products lathered up well, even with my very iron-rich well water (which, for reference, does go through a water softener). I have taken both products with me on travel and they seem to do well across the spectrum of water qualities. Despite Art of Shaving&#x27;s claim that this can be used &amp;#34;brushless&amp;#34;, you&#x27;ll want to use a shaving brush with these products, not just your hands. A little bit goes a long way with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I did notice is that the Taylor of Old Bond Street product seemed to fully dissolve and lather a little bit more completely that Art of Shaving&#x27;s. What I mean is that at the end of the shave with Art of Shaving&#x27;s cream, when rinsing out my shaving mug there was always a little glob of unlathered product; Taylor&#x27;s always fully dissolved and did not leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave about every other day - my facial hair isn&#x27;t too thick or fast-growing I guess - and the 5 oz size lasted me around 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comments above are really the only notable differences / comparisons I could find between the two products. Again, they are both very good and you&#x27;ll probably be happy with either, but for me the Taylor of Old Bond Street came out ahead.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve used shaving soap, and this stuff is on another level.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing, feels good, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Just good stuff.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best shaving cream I have used.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product. You don&#x27;t even need to use a lot to lather yourself up if you&#x27;re using a brush. It smells great and it keeps your face lubricated while you shave</li>
    <li> This is my husbands absolutely fave shaving cream after trying many many others over the years. I actually bought my last supply at Taylor&#x27;s in London, so was extremely excited to be able to get it easily now from Amazon. Sandalwood is by far the best scent.&lt;br /&gt;Subtle, manly, and not overpowering. Best when used with the Taylor of Bond shaving tools, of course.</li>
    <li> Very easy to lather, very slick, great traditional scent, and affordable too.  I&#x27;ve been exclusively wet shaving with single bladed safety razors for several months now, and this is the best cream yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself to an old fashioned shave with this classic scent, you won&#x27;t regret it.  I&#x27;ve had ZERO shaving nicks since I switched to Taylor of old bond street.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit picky about the amount to use, too much give and overly thick lather that&#x27;s hard to get down through to the hairs, and too little cream or too much water can be so thin the razor drags. Mostly I think that is getting used to using it.</li>
    <li> Only ok. Of all the sandlewood shaving items I have tried this is the best, I have just figured out I don&#x27;t care for sandlewood! The ToBS Jermyn Street is seriously good though, and I will buy that rather than this next time.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome shave cream.you need to use very little of the product. lasts a good long time. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff lathers up well with brush and you don&#x27;t need much. I really like the manly smell. . . but my wife says it makes me smell like her grandpa (we are in our late 30s)</li>
    <li> Smells great, works as intended. One container has lasted me 6+ months. Worth the money, Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Not a good scent at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a very nice creamy texture that produces a rich lather for smooth shaving. Love the &amp;#34;Sandalwood&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> So much easier to use than shave soap.</li>
    <li> It lathers very well.  I use about a pinky-finger-sized dollop to get plenty of lather for my very tough beard.    I dislike any kind of perfume odor.  This has a subtle, somewhat pleasant odor that does not bother me.  I would prefer no odor at all, however.    My only complaint:  it dries out too quickly on my face.  I have to put a little hot water on my face midway through my shave to soften it up.</li>
    <li> I really like Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams, especially the avocado scented one. The sandalwood shaving cream also lathers really well and smells like an old-time barber shop. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that my bowl lasted a short period of time considering that I use very little cream on my brush. Maybe it was not filled all the way. My avocado bowls have lasted 3-4 months, this bowl barely made it 2. Oh well, it&#x27;s still a great shaving brand in my book.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite shave cream. I am now preferring soaps, as they seem to protect just as well but wash off easier than a cream like this, but when I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to take five minutes building a lather from a soap, TOBS is my go-to cream. It builds up a lather extremely quick, takes water nice, and provides a good protective layer that gives me confidence when I&#x27;m using my DE blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old so the Sandalwood scent takes me back to going to the barber but more than that it lathers up very nicely and is giving me a smoother shave than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The sandlewood smell is unique and very strong, I won&#x27;t lie, I didn&#x27;t like it at first. After a few shaves it grew on me, and while I tend to use artisan soaps like the blades grim smolder that gives me far better performance, I do break this cream out about 3-4 times a month, it&#x27;ll last you awhile, as a little goes a long way with this one, great lather as you&#x27;d expect from creams, not as slick as Id like hence why I stick to soaps most of the time..... But overall great experience and no regrets</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loved this product  and is his second purchase of it already.</li>
    <li> Just switched to using a brush and cream.  I love the way this smells and I feel like it gives me a close shave.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and I&#x27;m not even half way through it.  This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> A wonderful shaving cream, but the sandalwood fragrance was a killer for me.  Overwhelming.  (I’m sensitive to these fragrances.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviewers promised I’d get laid by using this stuff.  I didn’t.  Disappointing.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have been using shaving gels and foams for over 15 years and wanted to get back the old fashioned way. This shaving cream lathers up quickly without using much of the cream - based on my estimation it should last me at least 6 month of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very nice - a little strong at first, but very pleasant. The action of lathering up really prepares the skin for a close shave without any irritation or ingrown hair afterwards. This is much better for my skin than any of the gels I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Edited to answer a question that was asked - The ingredients do not list &#x27;Tallow&#x27;. In fact I have not heard of Tallow being used for pretty much anything in the last few years.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent and lathers really well, I have been mixing it with shaving soap as well and they really compliment each other. Went ahead and ordered some for my father that&#x27;s how much I liked it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the safety razor scene, but I can tell you that this is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  Makes that other hard bar soap stuff look like garbage.  It&#x27;s aroma is also really nice, so it&#x27;s a win across the board.  Pricy?  Yes.  Worth it?  Absolutely.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, jump on in.  It&#x27;s top drawer.</li>
    <li> I had used a shaving mug and brush for forty years, but only in the past six months did I switch from a cartridge razor to an Edwin Jagger safety razor. It didn&#x27;t take long before I realized I needed to stop using my synthetic bristle brush (I replaced it with a badger brush) and I also had to stop using the Van Der Hagen shaving soap available at the nation&#x27;s premier discount store. After some online research and reading reviews posted on Amazon, I found two excellent shaving creams. One of them is Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream. [Note: The other is by Cella.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it costs way more than the generic bar soaps like Van Der Hagen or Williams, but this 5.3 oz. bowl will last me about a year--that&#x27;s only about five cents a shave!  Soap lathers well, and I don&#x27;t need to start with much soap on my brush to allow for a third or even a fourth application. In addition, the sandalwood scent is refreshing without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are serious about using a safety razor, don&#x27;t skimp on any of the essentials:  razor and blades, brush, and soap. I have never had closer shaves.  I am extremely pleased with this product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this but I have found this doesn&#x27;t lather up as well as other soaps available on Amazon</li>
    <li> Great scent, good lather.</li>
    <li> The scent takes me back to the old barber shops my grandfather used to go to. Its lathers so well and is very refreshing on my face. This product alone has made me an avid fan of Taylor of old bond street. I highly recommend trying it. Ive had my tub for nearly 6 months now and still haven&#x27;t scraped the bottom.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, and got introduced to fine shaving products through &amp;#34;the art of shaving&amp;#34; and are looking for a more affordable substitute for a shaving cream... Look no further!!! This product is fantastic! It&#x27;s as good if not better than the art of shaving sandalwood cream. The scent smells of an old school barbershop and sandalwood oil. The shave is amazing and the foam production is great! All this and it&#x27;s about 1\3 the cost of other shaving creams. I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> A small dab of this cream will lather up your face for the smoothest shave. There is no substitute for this quality product. Have used it for 25 years and happy to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream along with a merkur 180 and the merkur blades I love it.The smell is great and it makes a very good lather,my girlfriend said this is the same stuff her grandad used.Somethings do what they are suppose to,i guess that&#x27;s why I was able to purchase the same product that has been around for decades.</li>
    <li> It shaves great, smells incredible, and looks classy. Now you too can smell like Don Draper&#x27;s less handsome friend while romancing the ladies (or the men, I don&#x27;t want to assume. Good work on DOMA by the way, SCOTUS. You did the right thing. Man, this review went off track.)</li>
    <li> Classical shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheaper alternative to Geo. F. Trumpers sandalwood shaving cream, which has become my gold standard.  Taylor of Old Bond street was considerably cheaper, so I decided to give it a try.    The immediate difference I noticed was the strength and quality of the sandalwood fragrance.  It&#x27;s too highly scented for me, and neither is it as pleasant a scent as Trumpers.  Whereas Trumpers leaves a hint of fragrance behind after a shave and a wipe-down with a wash-cloth, I find that Taylor leaves behind an \\&quot;aftershave\\&quot; level of fragrance, which is more than I prefer.  Also, the scent is a sharper, more artificial smell that brings to my mind a dryer anti-static sheet, not something I&#x27;d want to smell like.  I don&#x27;t have any allergies to fragrances, so this is purely a preference thing, and I had no bad reactions to the scent.    It lathers up nicely.  I dare say, slightly better than Trumpers.  Taylor seems to be a drier formulation, but I had no trouble getting an appropriate amount on my badger-hair brush, and getting a good coating on my face.    It shaves well.  I&#x27;ve had no problems getting a close shave with it.    However, whereas Trumpers seems to leave behind a bit of oils on my skin for a nice moisturizing effect, Taylor leaves my skin feeling drier.  As I have naturally dry skin, Trumpers works better for me in this regard, but I can believe someone with oilier skin would appreciate Taylor&#x27;s more soap-like effect.    It&#x27;s a good product, and I would frankly probably switch to it for the cheaper price, but I really can&#x27;t stand the heavier scent of it, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I love the shave cream. There comes enough to last a year.</li>
    <li> nice scent and lather but this brand (I have another) seems to burn my face, especially if I do 2 shaves!  Other brands do not have this effect on me.</li>
    <li> this product has a cloying, overpowering smell that lasts all day--and doesn&#x27;t smell at all like sandalwood. this product should come with a warning label.</li>
    <li> Smells really old. I&#x27;m going to give this to my grandpa, not sure if he will use it but I won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap strictly based on previous reviews for it.  It seemed a little expensive just for shaving cream, but I figured with all the great reviews, I would love it.  Well to make a long story short, I didn&#x27;t.      Here are the reasons I don&#x27;t like it.    #1 Burns my face.  I noticed this after a few seconds.  I&#x27;m not sure what is going on here.  But I was not comfortable with this shaving cream at all    #2 The lather it develops is subpar.  For the price, I was expecting something better. It is very slick. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a great lather.    #2  The smell is very strong (as other reviewers are posting).  I don&#x27;t need this first thing in the morning...    Now what I DO recommend is Van Der Hagen shave soap which is a LOT cheaper and has a very very light smell, and creates a great lather.  You can even find this product on amazon.com.  Just do a search!  Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells!</li>
    <li> Whip it up with a hot bowl, a little water and a nice badger brush.  Brush on and let sit for a few seconds and shave off smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smell for sure!  creamy and easy to shave off, softens hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None so far except the price but even that is debatable if you use just a bit and brush it up with hot water.</li>
    <li> First started using this after stopping into their shop in London 15 years ago.  Still look forward to lathering up my brush with this thick shaving cream with the subtle scent.  Also like the original Old Taylor scent.  A very small amount is all you need so a bowl lasts a long time.  I usually go through about two a year.</li>
    <li> Almost out and I will definitely purchase it again, fantastic shaving cream and the sandalwood smell is awesome!!</li>
    <li> really really rich and creamy soap, good for thick and coarse facial hair</li>
    <li> I have better shave creams, but none that have the memories that this product has. Still a good product and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve purchased so far. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> Great scent, easy to whip up a great cream with my cheap brush.  Will buy again.  Might try other scents too, just to see what they are like.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream. Very mild likeable fragrance,  just a dab with a brush does my entire head and bread. The small amount used mitigates the high price of the item. Softens my beard great and I use it in union with a Taylor beard softener oil. Nothing better than those two items combined in my point of veiw.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v used this product before simply amazing. Very lubricant great smell. Sadly for me the person that delivered it never rang the door bell and it sat in the sun on a Sacramento Ca summer day. Was just mussssshhhh but actually still did a good job. Hope it hardens out a little because it was very watery and runny from the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start of by saying I am new to shaving with a safety razor, let alone using shaving cream (I use electric razors I have a very sensitive face). This shaving cream, which was recommended to me by a friend, is all I wanted it to be, and more. Not only does it work when using the double edge safety razor, but also while using my electric.    First, the name brand does it all for me. It has such a unique presentation, and industrial feel to it. In fact, it feels much like its right out of the industrial age in Britain! In my opinion, this is very unique. When it arrived I was happy to start shaving with it because like I said, I always have problems with shaving, whether it is red dry skin, or not getting a good enough shave. This cream really does it all. When using the safety razor, I feel protected, and the shave is smooth. When using an electric razor, I apply it on with a brush like normal, then wipe it off slightly and shave. Both ways generally produce an amazing shave and minimal irritation while cutting down extremely low.    This shaving cream is a nice addition, or nice first choice for new shavers, or people getting into shaving with safety razors. It really has a nice lather, feel, and soothes the skin. I do recommend using a brush, otherwise it will be messy and won&#x27;t exfoliate your skin. Although a bit pricey, you do really get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a brand name and is a high end product. I have to say this site is the cheapest way to get this item. Other websites are hefty on shipping fees and charge a nice premium. If you were lucky enough to see it here, buy it!    I will conclude with saying that the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 was for personal reasons. Although its great on the skin, and has a nice lather, the smell is very strong. I do enjoy it, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I would next time try something a bit more subtle and fresh. This smell is very \\&quot;manly\\&quot; which is a good thing, but a bit \\&quot;musty\\&quot; for my taste.    If you are in the market for new shaving cream, give this a try! Might I recommend another scent however, such as avocado or lavender, and then move to this after. As always I hope my review helped, if you have any questions feel free to comment, if I helped out let me know by clicking that button. Thanks!</li>
    <li> the aroma is perfect and it builds a great lather.  will be buying more of this.  shave with a safety razor, it&#x27;s the best decision for my face i ever made.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel incredible! This is my first experience using a straight razor, and this is what I read to use. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any better out there, but this is by far the best that I&#x27;ve ever used of any shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have very sensitive skin, and have never had an issue with this one. I honestly will not go back to any other type of shaving cream, this is amazing!</li>
    <li> Superb product! A little goes a long way, softens the beard, does not require a brush, excellent on the skin. Great British product which is NOT overpriced, especially when one considers how long it lasts since so little is needed per shave!</li>
    <li> This is pretty good shave cream but it needs extra hot water in the bowl to lather up.</li>
    <li> I order this product because I have used Taylor of Old Bond Street shave creams for year.  I have tried many of the scents and personally like the Sandlewood.  The pricie was right and i ordered two which lasts me close to a year.  I was almost out when I ordered and was excited when the package arrived (i could shave).  Much to my disappointment, althought the package arrived in 3 days, Amazon screwed up on the fulfillment.  They sent me an alternative Taylor of Old Bond Street shave product.  The price difference was about $1.50 so i was not going to go through the time and cost to return the item.  It was my first bad experience with Amazon and i was incredibly disappointed.  Strike One!!  I hope never to have this happen again and I keep them as trusted online merchant.</li>
    <li> It lathers well, it smells wonderful (seriously if you like sandalwood, you will love it) and provides a great shaving surface. What more could you ask for in a shaving cream?</li>
    <li> I had to try it out the day I picked this up from my post office. An absolutely great scent, manly yet not perfumy or overbearing. It also lathers up REALLY well with just a little on my badger brush. After I was done shaving, I noticed it left my skin really soft and also left a pleasant scent behind. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff and it makes for a great shave.  But for the guys out there who say it lasts for months i don&#x27;t know what product they&#x27;re referring to because this stuff goes a hell of a lot faster than a can of neutorgena or aveeno shave gel.  I would say one $6 can of shave gel will last five times as long as this.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the smell which I guess is all that matters.  A little does go a long way and it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> purchased for husband and I am enjoying the scent of this cream after he shaves!</li>
    <li> Very nice, gives a good lather and smell great, so I have been told.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream ever.  I have that traditional rough red beard and this shaving cream sets my beard up for the closest shave.  I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this cream is what all others should be rated against.  It sets the bar in performance, smell, cost, and in short is my personal favorite. I always come back to Taylor&#x27;s Sandalwood as best all around, bang for your buck cream.  Lathers well, smell is perfect, and you can purchase two of these for the price of more expensive creams. (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Geo. Trumpers, and others) I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed with this cream. If you are, send it to me! I will gladly use it up for you.</li>
    <li> Tried Proraso, Loccitane, Bozano and Body Store. None of them delivers a creamy lather like the Taylor of Old Bond without any major effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this cream, one should be gentle when loading the brush because only a dab will produce enough lather to overflow from your mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is worth noting: a nice hard plastic with a screw lid sturdy enough you don&#x27;t need to worry about it opening in your luggage.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. The scent of sandalwood and the feel of a badger hair brush laden with this rich shaving cream will transport you to an earlier time, a time of elegance and refinement. Exactly what era it is, I do not yet know; upon being transported back in time, my appearance, mannerisms and clothes alarmed the primitive peoples who saw me, and I was forced to retreat to this place, a haven created by those stranded in time and space by this excellent shaving aid. We have managed to create a link to the internet in your era, and hope that the wizards employed at Taylor of Old Bond Street see our plea and send us help, a way back to our rightful time. Our rudimentary generator begins to fail, so I must hasten to complete this message. Already I hear the roar of the mob forming in the village nearby as they gather to pry us from our defenses. But on the balance, I would still buy this product again. It was a thoroughly enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Recently I had been using the dollar shave club &amp;#34;shave butter&amp;#34;.  I really like the &amp;#34;shave butter&amp;#34; but it started to cause break outs.  After reading all the positive reviews about Taylor of Old Bond, I decided to give it a try.  After using it for about a month, I have concluded this is probably the best shave I have ever had.  I use this with the executive blades from dollar shave club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon completion of the shave, my skin feels very tight.  I have never noticed this with any other product I have used.  I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes a great lather and the smell is very relaxing to me. My wife is not much a fan of it but hey, it my face!  Will order again when I get close to running out.</li>
    <li> The British do shaving items well.  Their idea of breakfast with pork and beans and blood sausage....not so much.  This lathers up great and smells fantastic....</li>
    <li> Easy to mix and lather, feels great on your face, helps the razor glide with ease, and I love the old-school sandalwood smell. Great product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t think there&#x27;s such a thing as using too much cologne, this shaving cream&#x27;s for you.  The smell is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream itself is thick and somewhat difficult to get to lather.  On the positive side, it does provide a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got any sensitivity to smells, or just don&#x27;t like being around people who think using a lot of body spray is just as good as showering, avoid this at all costs.  If you&#x27;ve had your sense of smell burned out in an industrial accident, this wouldn&#x27;t be a bad choice when looking for shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Good cream and good smell.  Those who complain about it being too fragrant must have have sensitivities because its not that strong and, it doesnt stay with you.  This is especially true if you use after shave and lotion like I do.  I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the product does settle to one side of the bowl which makes lathering a little more difficult.</li>
    <li> Too keep this short and sweet, the sandalwood aroma is pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily nor does it dry out my skin, I&#x27;ve never experienced razor burn in the two years I&#x27;ve been using it (technique is important regardless of cream), and it lasts me about 6 months while shaving 5 days a week. I used a real badger shaving brush and fusion power razor with it. No aftershave, follow it up with a little face lotion when in dryer climates. My only complaint is that when I first used it, I made the mistake of dipping the brush directly in the bowl to mix it. This made the jar last about 2 months. Now I just scoop out the right amount with my finger and mix it in my palm. Who needs a bowl anyway? Good cream - try it!</li>
    <li> Bought this with my new safety razor and am really impressed. It creates a great lather and I really like the scent. I plan to purchase this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Amazing cream, great feeling &amp; lather. The scent is nice, but I believe a more citrusy or minted may be better, more refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream that makes a good lather and a GREAT scent!</li>
    <li> Love the way this stuff smells. Lathers up great and one jar of it lasts forever. I have seen some reviews that say the container is only part full. It isn&#x27;t filled to the max but one jar will last you months.</li>
    <li> This is really good soap, wifey loves the sandalwood scent. I have previously used cheapo shaving soaps available at local department stores, and they don&#x27;t come close to comparing to this Taylor of Old Bond Street soap. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just switched to this from another brand - just to see what all was out there, and WOW! I really like this shaving cream.  Nice thick lather, and smells great.  Only reason it did not get 5 stars is that I really prefer the tube over the Jar, but I would definitely recommend this product!    Product Update:  After using this for a few months I can STRONGLY recommend this product.  It lathers well (I use a Vulfix #2234 super badger shaving brush - also recommended). No reason I can see to switch to another brand.  I also like the sandalwood, but would not be opposed to trying another scent.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  Great lather.  Leaves skin feeling stripped and dry, though.  I&#x27;d recommend trying their soap instead of this cream.</li>
    <li> Just got this and  also have Caswell Massey , taylor makes a great lather using only half a much as the Caswell Massey ,I also have  Truefitt &amp; Hill which also makes a great lather but it cost twice as much. So after trying all three, I am going to stick with the taylor of old Bond Street. A little goes a long long way. I use it with the Caswell Massey  pre shave oil. The two work well together for me.</li>
    <li> Debating about whether or not to get this? Stop. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it. I tried this one day after getting sick of the normal canned gels and my shaving life will never been the same. Without question the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. You&#x27;ll need a brush,  and everything can add up to be a bit costly, but it lasts forever and when you&#x27;re done you&#x27;re going to want to buy more.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream, always have a great shave, lathers up nicely.</li>
    <li> I really loved the sandalwood smell, smells like a barber shop....... The product also makes a fantastic , rich, thick lather. It is really easy to lather and to apply. It also won&#x27;t dry up immediately after applying. It is a great product that can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
    <li> This stuff is toxic.  After using it my eyes and sinuses burn for the entire day.  It shaves well, but otherwise all around it&#x27;s a terrible product.  It also smells absolutely nothing like Sandalwood.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels and smells great.  You get a nice lather with little effort from the brush.  I recommend using a little less than you think you need for your beard...i whistled through my first jar being too liberal, you don&#x27;t need much...it lathers!</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood Shaving Cream has quite simply made the task of shaving an enjoyable and anticipated event, something that I have NEVER experienced in my nearly 60 years. The quality of the lather is fanastic, so much so that I typically let it linger before begining to shave.  The aroma is wonderful and always noticed by my lovely wife....also a new experince after 36 years of marriage.  I suggest that the shaving cream should be used with a top quality brush ( I use a silver tipped badger) for maximum effect.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Cream and you might even enjoy your morning shave just a little more!!!</li>
    <li> A great scented shaving cream in a large, easy to use tub. Tight fitting lid. Don&#x27;t use too much water in your brush!</li>
    <li> The positives are clear, I cannot but agree with the positives reviews here.  BUT (a big, capital letters but), the fragrance is much too strong. This might be great for smokers (to cover some of the tobacco smell).  It is not too bad for me either, as it helps masking offensive odors during my morning commute on the NYC subway. But my colleagues still notice it when I get in the office.</li>
    <li> Positive:It lathers very well. Just a small amount of it provides a very rich lather. (I lather twice, there was enough left over)     Negative: It does NOT smell like Sandalwood. Sandalwood is a fragrance I am quite familiar with - I am from India where Sandalwood products abound. So, I know what sandalwood should smell like. This shaving cream does NOT smell anything remotely like sandalwood. It infact smells like cheap Barbasol foam. I am quite disappointed.    I see that a few here share my view and many who do not. That could mean that the quality is not well controlled. I just got a bad batch? If so, I need a refund :)</li>
    <li> This was the first type of soap/cream I&#x27;ve bought other than aerosol shaving creams and I&#x27;m never going back.  The shave I get is just a lot less irritating.  I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and can barely tell I&#x27;ve used any.  The package is a nice durable screw-top plastic that seals well in my bathroom.  I just unscrew the lid, give my brush a whirl and about a minute later, I&#x27;ve got a nice rich lather.  The smell is pleasant and not overpowering, though it may not be exactly my style.</li>
    <li> Gives a rich, smooth, thick lather that makes shaving easy AND my wife loves the aroma.</li>
    <li> Take it from a woman, you gotta try it!  Because of all the great reviews, I bought this for my husband.  It really is FANTASTIC!  Great, clean smell that is not too overwhelming.  Provides a luxurious shave that makes wet-shaving worth the extra effort.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that this stuff is so cheap-even with daily use it will easily lasts 6 months.</li>
    <li> If you have never used a real shaving cream like this with a quality brush, you are missing out.  Taylor shaving products are the absolute best.</li>
    <li> I never thought anything would take me away from the awesome Proraso Italian shaving products, but this English shave cream is wonderful.  Great scent,  rich lather, close shave.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Okay, one buyer says it doesn&#x27;t smell ENOUGH of sandalwood, another says it&#x27;s too strong. I guess quality control at the maker is haphazard, because my jar has a nice mild fragrance (the fragrance is \\&quot;released\\&quot; better with hot water), which is JUST FINE by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not shaving with a brush and razor for the olfactory euphoria. I want a clean, comfortable shave. A great shaving cream (or gel, or soap for that matter) serves dual purposes: keep the beard wet, moisturizing, and provide a nice gliding surface for your razor. Taylor of Old Bond&#x27;s sandalwood shaving cream does just fine. Unlike a cheap variant, only a pea-sized portion is needed in my shaving mug for a rich, creamy lather. (Don&#x27;t waste yours by dipping your brush right in the cream; you&#x27;ll get too much, and you&#x27;ll dilute your jar by introducing moisture.) Add hot water and a full badger brush, and this product does quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want perfume or aroma, use a room spray, or slap some cologne on your chest before shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this in my quest for the perfect sandalwood shave.     I purchased this after my great dissatisfaction with Caswell and Massey&#x27;s sandalwood soap&#x27;s lather. This other sandalwood classic, Taylor of Old Bond Street, is much better, for me, than Caswell and Massey&#x27;s. The Taylor&#x27;s goes a long way, with only a bit on the brush being needed to give a thick lather, that recharges quickly and easily.     I would say that it does not provide as smooth a shave as I&#x27;d like. Not that I&#x27;ve been cutting myself, and I&#x27;m not sure that I don&#x27;t need a few more shaves with this product before I say unequivocally, that the Caswell and Massey actually provides a more lubricated experience than this cream, although Taylor&#x27;s cream lathers much better.    However, it is very thick and doesn&#x27;t rinse from the razor so easily: you need to shake it and re-rinse it to clear the blade. Of course, my experience is a little subjective, but Taylor&#x27;s isn&#x27;t the best shave to be had, though I do prefer it immensely over the Caswell and Massey, which is just stupid as a shave soap.     Also, Taylor&#x27;s sandalwood smell is not so awesome as the delicious smell of Caswell and Massey&#x27;s. Taylor&#x27;s has a more perfumey sandalwood smell than the very (to my nose) natural and woody smell of C&amp;M. That said, the smell of Taylor&#x27;s reminds me of the old cheap William&#x27;s sandalwood soaps I&#x27;d buy when I was a kid, and that was all the store stocked other than the C&amp;M. I have to admit to liking the smell, the way I like the Old Spice, or Avon: it&#x27;s classic and working class and a reward for the shave. The smell lingers well, and I was catching whiffs of it mixed in with the Clubman aftershave. It smells pretty good after its been on you a while, versus the immediate scent as you&#x27;re using it.    In the tub, this cream is much more concentrated than, say, Trumper&#x27;s, which is my next Sandalwood cream purchase. This is like a shave paste, somewhere between a soap and a cream. My Trumper&#x27;s almond cream is far and awaysuperior to this, so I&#x27;ll give their sandalwood a shot. I&#x27;m using this Taylor&#x27;s exclusively this week, but I&#x27;m already looking forward to using my almond Trumper&#x27;s instead.     So, I am still shopping for that perfect sandalwood shave....sigh. Maybe one that combines elements of this with the C&amp;M. Funny, but I think this and the C&amp;M are clearly in the same league, each with pluses, each with drawbacks. The American soap&#x27;s smell is ass-kicking, the British lather, while thick, not very lubricating. Which side of the Atlantic wins here? Well, you say potato, and I say poetahto!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor for a little over a year now and have only used this product since day one until, recently, it was confiscated from me at the airport. I didn&#x27;t think it was that big of a deal and went to a local shop and bought a similar but cheaper (cheaper in quality) product. Biggest mistake ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this product, it smells great, lathers beautifully, lubricates my skin and hair perfectly and lasts a while. It isn&#x27;t harsh on my (sensitive) skin and leaves it very smooth and undamaged. Even if you don&#x27;t use a safety razor or straight edge, you will love using this shaving cream. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I LOVE it. Taylor&#x27;s makes for a great shave and I love the smell of this product! The lather is slick and silky, just perfect. It is like going back in time to an honest to God barber shop and &#x27;getting the works&#x27; as opposed to the &amp;#34;modern, idiotic sports crap ESPN screaming TV shops that kinda cut hair&amp;#34;. Can I go some place and not be assaulted by TVs!?! But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fairly strong smelling, however not a bad thing. I wash my face with a hot wash rag AFTER shaving, duh, because I am civilized, and let&#x27;s face it, that is good technique. It leaves just a trace smell that does not &#x27;collide&#x27; with my cologne. Fellas, let&#x27;s not be the guy you can smell before he comes into the room. Can we all agree on that? And my chick loves the scent of this - need I go on...?</li>
    <li> I shaved at night before going to bed and the scent was unbearably strong. The odor kept me up all night. No matter how much I scrubbed my face I could not get rid of the asphyxiating aroma. The product creates a wonderful lather and I would not hesitate to order again if only Taylor&#x27;s would offer an unscented product. In the old days possibly the strong aroma covered the smell of ones horse. But alas I drive a Honda. I guess they do not make men like they used to!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for almost 6 months now, but I had always used the standard gel creams. With only 3 swirls around the dish with a wet shaving brush, I have a great shaving cream that far exceeds others.    And after letting a friend smell the jar, she closed her eyes, went silent, and finally said, \\&quot;I&#x27;m getting really turned on right now.\\&quot; So, ladies love the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately you should not order shave creams in the summer if you live in the south.  When it arrived it was a mess and I sent it back.  The vendor returned my money with an apology and I mentioned to him that it was poorly packed.</li>
    <li> After reading how we butcher our face every time we shave with good old Gillette and Edge, I decided to see what the fuss was over these creams. Shaving cream, check. Tweezerman badger brush, check. Single edge razor?, I like my Mach 3 razor. This was the only difference I chose, from the \\&quot;proper way of shaving\\&quot;. This took me a few times to get use to, using Edge &amp;  Gillette all my adult life, spray it into hand and apply to face, it would foam and shave. Not that convienient with this cream. For me, get the water nice and hot, rinse brush until brush was moist. You need to \\&quot;whip\\&quot; the cream why the brush is moist and hot. The very first time, I don&#x27;t think I did it right, so the shave was ehhh for me. I was thinking going back to old faithful Gillette/edge. But I told myself to try it a few more times to decide. I ask you to try it a few times before thinking abandonment. I am happy to say, I chose to stick with it. With practice, I was able to get the \\&quot;whipping\\&quot; technique to work and lather up the brush with just the right amount of shaving cream. I apply the shaving cream with the brush (maybe I am doing it wrong) with an up and down movement. The shaving cream isn&#x27;t thick and foamy; it&#x27;s a thin even layer on your face. And after the shave, my face is smooth and \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; the glycerin definitely helps glide the blades on your face. Now I am nearing the end of the jar, so I visited Amazon yet again. The sandalwood scent is not over powering, but I would like to try another scent maybe. Disappointed that the sandalwood is the only that qualifies for free shipping. I was eyeing the avocado one, or maybe just go back to the sandalwood. I don&#x27;t see myself going back to Gillette/edge. It definitely is not a quick process, but I think the results will be worth the extra time. This is my experience with it; hope yours is just as good.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve used Taylor products for several years, I wanted to be cheap about the next purchase and got the Sandalwood b/c it qualified for Prime shipping!  I was a little worried because others commented on the overpowering scent, but I took my chances.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a week now and I can say that the scent is really strong when you first apply the cream. The scent is actually quite pleasing, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  However, if you are worried about it when you shave, the scent diminishes quickly after shaving and it is barely noticeable after a 1/2 hour or so (i actually wish it would stay a little longer!).  Other than the scent, it lives up to the Taylor tradition of a smooth shave.  You use only a tiny amount per shave, so the premium you pay up front is paid back by the fact that it lasts 4-6 months.  If you are a first-timer for real shaving creams, trust all of us when we say, \\&quot;you&#x27;ll use this once and never go back to drug store brands again\\&quot;!  You may experiment with others like Proraso, Art of Shaving, Truefitt and Hill, etc. but you won&#x27;t go back to Gillette!</li>
    <li> Greatness. It has made my beard amazing.</li>
    <li> The Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream has an excellent feel to the lather. In addition, the fragrances are excellent. I particularly like the sandalwood and the lavender, and a slightly more unusual scent, known as &amp;#34;Shaving Shop.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> All my lady&#x27;s love the scent!</li>
    <li> Real review. This stuff it the sh*t! I love it. Haven&#x27;t tried Porasso yet, but so far, this is it. Great product.</li>
    <li> It lathers well and has a fresh clean scent that both my wife and myself enjoy. It arrived quickly and I would gladly buy this again. I&#x27;ve been using it about 1 1/2 months of 5 days a week shaves and it is holding on strong, with maybe half the container still remaining. Be sure to invest in a good barber brush to do this shaving cream justice.</li>
    <li> This was the very first cream that I used when I switched to DE shaving.  I was eager to try other creams and soaps (and scents) so I have been through many.  I recently switched back to this because I finished other creams that I had and didn&#x27;t want to buy more with this container still sitting around - and I was very surprised with just how good it is compared to other creams.  My technique has greatly improved since I&#x27;ve used this last and I can say that it is just about the best cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I am awaiting delivery of a Trumper&#x27;s Sandalwood and I think that should be at least as good as this - but this is an excellent cream.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap.  if you get a good brush, makes awesome lather.  Light smell is nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Art of Shaving sandalwood scented cream for a year now. Decided to try something new and less expensive and followed the good reviews here on Amazon.     First impression upon opening the container was, whoa! Stinky stuff! There is a pleasant sandalwood aroma hidden in there somewhere, but you have to endure the strong chemical smell that surrounds it. Other reviewers have said the scent is strong, but I was skeptical. They weren&#x27;t exaggerating. Its overwhelming. I used to enjoy shaving with my safety razor, badger brush and Art of Shaving cream. The smell was subtle and pleasant. This stuff is offensive, and very unpleasant to shave with. I find myself avoiding shaving because of the noxious odor. Worse, the smell lingers on my face.     I&#x27;ll give this cream a star for good lathering and another for value. But I can&#x27;t go any further because of the offensive smell it gives off. Endured it for two weeks, now I&#x27;m ordering Art of Shaving again.</li>
    <li> Large and you don&#x27;t have to use much of the soap, this amount will last a year.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream.  Rich,  great scent,  protects my skin and easy to lather.</li>
    <li> From the recent reviews it looks like they are sending out the wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received The wrong product. I ordered the sandlewood and got the regular. The package is almost identical. The only way the I knew it was wrong was the smell: no sandlewood just that generic shaving soap smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really bothered enough to return it, but I ordered and would have preferred sandlewood.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great lather, what more could you want?</li>
    <li> Fantastic shave soap &amp; a little goes a long way. Great scent that does not linger so long as to interfere with your aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a solid soap puck but rather a creamy soap with a frosting like consistency. Dipping your brush in should give you enough soap to lather up your cup.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bowl, the first one lasted me through about 8 months of daily shaving with an occasional lazy weekend.</li>
    <li> It seems to me that it is nearly impossible to write an objective review for this product, because the experience of using it is largely subjective, just as one&#x27;s experience might be with, say, brussels sprouts:  you&#x27;re likely either to enjoy them or positively despise them.  I&#x27;m in the latter camp as regards those little green demons, but an aggregate of subjective responses proves useful to most, even if an individual&#x27;s preference ultimately runs contrary to collective opinion.  So, this shave cream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than shaving performance, criteria against which all creams, soaps, and lathers should pass respectably, the scent is what makes or breaks a lasting relationship of product loyalty.  Personally, I enjoy the aroma of this shave cream.  In the bowl, the aroma that comes to me first is mildly soapy, with a gentler background of sandalwood.  The initial soapiness isn&#x27;t off-putting to me as, to be honest, I expect that in most shaving creams that share common ingredients - and this is true across a broad spectrum of quality and price.  What lingers, though, is the sandalwood aroma... which I rather like and don&#x27;t find it overly strong.  I find it to be masculine without being overpowering and indeed, as some reviewers have put it, slightly evocative of &#x27;old-guy.&#x27;  Now, as I am currently in apprenticeship to old-guy-ness, I don&#x27;t find that unappealing.  I think it&#x27;s rather a nostalgic thing, bringing back memories of father, instead of being stale, musty.  The strength of aroma also depends largely on how vigorously I rinse and also whether I splash on witch hazel as aftershave.  It is worth a try, I think, as many will not find the scent as strong as some have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, this shave cream works well for me.  I&#x27;ve got a tough, fast growing beard and sensitive skin and while I usually shave only every other day and while I must also take care to soak my beard in hot water, this cream does very well to protect my skin and produce proper glide for my double-edge safety razor.  My skin feels nourished and smooth as it should with any high quality shave cream.  A little goes a very long way and it produces a mass of thick, luxuriant lather for my usual two-pass shaving routine.  Care must be taken, as with any other shave cream or soap, to get the proportion of water to shave cream correct.  Too watery, and the lather will slide off your face; too dry, and your razor will drag... painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first began using this, I felt that it could have rinsed off the razor a bit better.  As it was, it seemed to leave more residue behind than some other products I have used.  It has never felt heavy or gummy on my face, however, and I have decided that it&#x27;s not the negative it first seemed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this to also be a very good value, reasonably priced and long lasting.  This bowl should last me six months plus the way I am going.  Everyone&#x27;s shaving habits are different and individual&#x27;s mileage will vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good value, then, that performs well and lasts a good long time.  Perhaps the best thing I can say ultimately is that I&#x27;ll be buying this again.  Five stars.ble-edge safety razor.

    <li> This smells great!  It provides a very smooth shave like all the TOBS creams.  It is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried sandalwood shaving cream.  It lathers well and I like the scent.  I don&#x27;t find the scent to be too strong.  The cream does have a dry effect on my skin, so if you have problems with dry skin this may not be the shaving cream for you.  I really like this product and will buy more.</li>
    <li> This is the one I keep purchasing. Half as expensive as Trumpers and enough to shave every day for a year!</li>
    <li> July 2016 - Update several years after my initial review, this remains the only shaving cream I use.  Great lather, texture, and scent.  Just feels so much better than either shaving creams or gels.  Will buy as long as its made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feb 24 2012 update- sent a note directly to the manufacturer.  They sent me a new to of cream.  Far better than the most recent batch, but not as good as the original.  Still great, just not as much.  The ingredients listed have changed and there is a mention of the removal of some ingredient that some group believes is probably radioactive, mutant producing, and some other things.  Bottom line is that the cream is no longer as firm or long lasting.  Still good stuff, will buy more, but it is a shame when great products slip a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dec 2011-This is an update to my prior review.  I eagerly opened my yearly Christmas gift of this shaving cream, only to find that the formula has changed.  No longer does it have the great smell, and the firmness of the cream has been reduced to something like frosting.  Have written complaints to the manufacturer, but in the meantime, I have become disappointed in this product.  I am saddened by the downhill slide of this once great product.  Earlier review is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; with your shaving, this is the way to do it.  First, my wife loves the smell it leaves on me, and I have to agree.  I am not one for colognes, and this has a great, masculine smell (do not agree with the claims of it being too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; as some review have stated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have a beard, I do not shave every day, only a few times weekly, and this small tub of cream lasted from one Christmas to the next.  You do not need to go so far as a the straight edge, or single edge razor as I have, as this works well with any razor type I have found.  What you do want to do, however, is to get a good badger hair shaving brush and drying stand for it.  The brush is an absolute must.  Got my second bowl of this cream this Christmas, and will continue with it.ream this Christmas, and will continue with it.</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure this tub will last me a lifetime. I just barely dab the tips of my brush bristles in and I have full lather for my shave AND the followup shave, with tons left over.  It smells a bit strong fresh from the tub, but once you rinse, it leaves just a slight hint of sandalwood that stays with you all day.  I think I have found the brand I&#x27;m sticking with and I cant wait to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> Over the past year I have been experimenting with safety razor shaving (results: amazing) and was looking for a new cream. I had previously been using a shaving soap, but decided to give a cream a try. This stuff lathers great, smells great, and gives a nice, smooth shave. The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering at all, and leaves you smelling good. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Thick Cream. rate 9.5 / 10&lt;br /&gt;fregrance. Rate 9.5 / 10&lt;br /&gt;Performance 9.5 / 10&lt;br /&gt;Getting a bit dry while shaving which needs to add a touch of water and this is the only observation as I read on some of the saving site that &amp;#34;Proraso&amp;#34; won&#x27;t be dry. I use L&#x27;occitan before TOBS and it get me tired by putting the touchs of water every time. while with TOBS I need only to add it ONCE. maybe I am not experienced yet.&lt;br /&gt;Once I open it I want to eat it ;)</li>
    <li> Great lather and beard lifting shave!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product ! And my wife says she loves the smell ! That is a bonus! Good rich shave cream ! Only takes a little !</li>
    <li> Although it is usable, it smells like a wet sock. I expected a richer sandalwood scent. Also I find it does not lift my morning shave as much as the products from The Art of Shaving, and I do not get as close of a shave.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream on the market. This is the only cream I use. Buy it</li>
    <li> Love the smell, excellent quality, for really great shaving.</li>
    <li> My favorite shave cream, hands down.  Rich, creamy lather and a great scent - five stars!</li>
    <li> Product smells great and feels great on the face. I would buy this product again as it foams up with the easy.</li>
    <li> Has a good smell, keeps the wife away for a while as it &amp;#34;smells like grandpa&amp;#34; but as long as I like it I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Never again will I buy a cake of soap for my cool Burma Shave coffee mug, I&#x27;ll have to start drinking coffee out of that thing. I love this stuff and am about to purchase my second. Don&#x27;t know/care if I&#x27;m saving any money over cake soap because everything about this is so much better. I never mastered the water ratio with cake shave soap, with this, I soak my brush in hot water after thoroughly wetting my face/neck and the lather is always spot on. Going with a safety razor 3 years ago was the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made. My beard grows too thick/fast for electrics, and the cost of disposables, not to mention the plastic in landfills aspect, makes it a no brainer. All costs considered [buying blades in 100 packs, changing ever couple days for smoothest shave], I&#x27;ll probably save enough money over 5-7 years for a RT airline ticket to Hawaii or Europe. I won&#x27;t get rich, but I&#x27;ll have a better/smoother shave, be more inclined to shave on weekends when not necessary, and airfare to boot every half decade is a tidy little bonus.</li>
    <li> nice old school scent. makes my razors glide around my face. I love this product as i dont get razor burn because of this cream.</li>
    <li> This shave cream beats Gilette or anything else in a can. It smells great! It feels terrific and the texture of the cream is rich and luxurious. It makes the task of shaving more pleasant. I might even go out and by a brush and shave cup. That is what this product does to you. Good stuff. Brits got it right</li>
    <li> The fragrance might seem too strong initially but the lingering sandalwood aroma after the shave is just right. And women notice! Just a bit on the brush (with some Col. Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum soap worked in first) and some hot water produce lots of thick lather. Keep the brush handy and reapply often during the shave. After shaving, I again reapply and wait a few minutes before washing off - I find it soothes the skin enough so that I don&#x27;t need aftershave.</li>
    <li> I have used several creams from TOBS and they all have a tremendous lather. I got a great shave but the scent reminded me of the powdery smell of my great grandmother. I ended up throwing it away and going back to their Eaton College scent.</li>
    <li> This came split in the mail and half of he contents leaked out of the container. I might have froze on the truck or something. Be prepared to smell this all through your house after use. I almost absorbs in your skin.</li>
    <li> This cream lathered up really fast which was nice and it only took an almond size to get more than 3 passes worth. The downside for me was the lather seemed a little thin no matter what I did. The worst part though, is how strong the scent was. This is of course, personal taste, but my wife couldn&#x27;t stand it and I didn&#x27;t like it much either.</li>
    <li> Granted I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, but this stuff is great. Easy to build lather, smells great, gives a nice smooth cut, and leaves my face feeling baby soft. I used to have to put on face lotion but not anymore!</li>
    <li> My husband has me order this for him every time he starts running low so I guess I likes it. Also I love the way it smells :)</li>
    <li> I can see why it sells so well, this is a great product. Good feel, easy lather and manly scent.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is great!  The key is to only use a tiny bit, you only have to lightly swab your brush through it and it will easily lather up enough to cover your face twice over.  It has lasted me a little over a year with every other day shaving and I still have a little bit more to go.  The scent isn&#x27;t quite sandalwood, it smells a little too strong and I think it is a artificial fragrance.  However, it smells fine and gets the job done.  The cream is a little thick so it easily clogs up those 2 and 3 blade razors but it works great with a DE razor.  This is best used with a badger hair brush like this one -[[ASIN:B002RJC1HC 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor]].  Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and plan on purchasing another container when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> My review is from the female perspective and after years of buying shaving products for the hubby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;WAY too fragranced. Typically I adore the smell of sandlewood products. This is terribly &#x27;perfume-y&#x27; for a male and not a classic sandlewood scent. It&#x27;s sorta the Old Spice of higher end shave creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to take an awful lot to achieve the desired lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced v. how quickly you&#x27;ll go through it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The built-in soap dish is a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatively creamy v. similar brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, there are far better shave soaps in a market now inundated with &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; shaving options. The scent and consistency make this &#x27;paying just for the name&#x27; soap more of a miss than a hit. Just because it&#x27;s been around for years doesn&#x27;t make it desirable.</li>
    <li> Great lather and LOVE the scent. The wife can&#x27;t stand it though, so I mostly use the coconut scented version more often than this one.</li>
    <li> Before this I used only the can shaving cream, both the gel and the foam.  This stuff is by far, the best smelling shaving cream I have ever used.  The shaving cream provides minimal irritation.  The razor used is dependent on the results.  With a mach 4, very smooth, slight irritation. With a safety razor, smooth, and the irritation is divine.  Don&#x27;t forget a brush.  I do shave everyday for my job.</li>
    <li> As lame as it might sound, researching a good soap is not easy.  A good shave soap should help the hair on the face become more brittle and help the blade cut the hair more efficiently.  I was amazed at the difference this soap makes when shaving.  I have always used the cheap soap I found at the general store.  Something like &amp;#34;Edge&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Fusion&amp;#34;, and thought they were fine.  I was wrong, so very wrong.  Buy this soap, and you will be amazed at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really strong though.  Also this is A LOT of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Awesome sauce.</li>
    <li> Smooth, creamy, and dreamy! Has a very strong scent that is subtle and manly.</li>
    <li> Great foamy lather and will make your face smell like a MAN!  None of that &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; Axe Body spray garbage for frat boys and skinny jean wearing hipsters.  If you want your face to feel fresh and clean and smell like it was shaved back in the 1800&#x27;s with a straight blade to your neck, this is for you.</li>
    <li> My goodness, after 50+ years of shaving I find this stuff on Amazon!  Buy it, you haven&#x27;t felt a smooth shave until using this cream.  I can not speak to the quality of many of the brands in reviews here, but at this price I can say beyond a doubt this is the best shave I have ever had!  I also bought the brush and one 5.3 oz bowl will easily last 6 months.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it. It smells really good (like a man should!) and seems to help soften his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for any guy looking to class up his scent and shave routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shave creams and soaps, Taylor of Old Bond Street is tops.  And the sandalwood is a very clean, manly scent, that fades quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Thick, creamy and great glide on my razor.  Love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love the smell but my wife likes the lavender smell better. Both are great shaving creams! Taylor will be the only one in my house.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap and the ease with which you can create lather. The bowl also lasts for quite a long time. I used it for almost a year.    However, I&#x27;m not going to buy another because ultimately, the other bar shaving soaps that I&#x27;ve used give an equal level of comfort during the shave. It isn&#x27;t any more slick during the shave.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers say it smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or like a soap their grandfather may use but I think it is fantastic and I&#x27;m a young feller. To me it smells classy and creates a thick rich lather. If you want to feel like you&#x27;re going to the barber every time you shave in your bathroom this is the soap to achieve it.</li>
    <li> The amount of lather this TOBS produces is much more than what Proraso does, in my humble opinion.  Maybe I used too much (7 or 8 swirls of the brush), but I used it for the first time only this morning with my 24mm knot badger and Merkur 180.  The fragrance is not really sandalwood, it just pretends to be. On the whole, my first impressions were very positive, and I like the consistency of the soap.  I also like the fact that the tub is sturdy.</li>
    <li> very good. smooth lather. great smell.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband. He loves it. It smells fantastic and creates a very rich and luxurious lather. We will continue to purchase the Taylor of Old Bond Street brand.</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a gift and only recently bought a replacement.  This smells good and is one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s extremely luxurious and comes partially whipped.  If you&#x27;ve tried a variety of shaving creams and gels in different formats (aerosol, tub, bar, pump), you know that aerosolized gel tends to be the best for actual lubrication.  This product isn&#x27;t aerosolized, nor is it gel, but it gives even better skin lubrication for shaving than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a high silicone (or something) content in a luxurious semi-whipped &amp;#34;pudding&amp;#34;.  Using a shaving brush it doesn&#x27;t require much on the end of the brush to be able to whip it into a slightly lighter froth and apply it thickly and evenly.  Shaving with it then provides a significantly better and irritation-free shave over any other product.  I&#x27;ve tried products claiming to be luxury shaving creams from other companies and I&#x27;ve been nothing but disappointed after using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a variety of scents available for this, though I&#x27;ve only ever used the sandalwood.  It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent, and it&#x27;s nicely masculine rather than the incense like smell I normally associate with sandalwood essential oils.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried any of the other sandalwood scented products from Taylor of Old Bond Street, it&#x27;s consistent across their entire product line (shave lotion, shaving cream, pre-shave oil, and after shave gel).</li>
    <li> smells nice and works well.</li>
    <li> First of all one tub of this shave cream will last me 6 months. Just a tiny dab is all you need. This shave cream smells manly and fresh, creates lots of thick rich lather that helps that blade glide over the face. I use a metal shaving bowl and transfer the cream from the tub to the bowl. I let it sit up and harden. Let the brush get hot with water and run some hot water into the shave bowl,mix it around and walla you have a hot shave cream. You will be astonished at how long it lasts. Don&#x27;t let the price scare you away. This is the most economical cream shave around!</li>
    <li> I have been using a straight razor, a WS Prince Silvertip brush with Bluebeards Shaving cream for about a two months now. I bought the Taylor of Old Bonds Street cream more to see what all the fuss was about with respect to this brand of shaving cream. I was not disappointed. The tub is larger than that of Blue Beards Revenge, lathers better and produces a luxuriant creamy lather. The sandlewood scents is exceptional. It is light, fresh and makes you feel clean without clinging to you like some strong perfume. The delivery happened ahead of schedule and the product arrived well packaged and free from any damage. All in all a great purchase that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the good ol&#x27; canned gel shaving cream ever since I started shaving. I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 star rating because it really does smell good and it applies very evenly. I felt the product has the right amount of thickness or viscosity to it compared to a canned gel that basically foams up and sits on top of your skin. I never really felt like those gel&#x27;s were doing anything! This stuff, on the other hand, feels like its pasted on the skin.    I felt the scent was very strong when I opened the container, and I expected this as several other reviewers have mentioned. Don&#x27;t be alarmed though, when I rinsed my face off, most of the scent went away, leaving just the right amount of fragrance. I got NO nicks or cuts. I did get razor burn though...BUT I blame that on myself for having just starting using a safety razor for the first time ever (might have been using too much pressure and not using a pre-shave oil). I will likely buy more of this in the future. The amount in the bowl looks like it will last a long time.     Thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers who help us all make more informed decisions!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! I think this product is such a great value. It is kind of luxurious, but will end up saving you money over most off-the-shelf shaving creams. I will never go back to an aerosol brand!</li>
    <li> This went to a friend who enjoys shaving.  Has a collection of razors.  He loved it.</li>
    <li> Will try a different scent next time</li>
    <li> Love the smell and lather of this soap.  Well worth the price and makes shaving a pleasure</li>
    <li> This and the Proraso tube shaving cream really work well. This takes a little more effort to create a good lather, but once applied, it gives a nice comfortable, close shave. It has a nice smell to it, and it feels good on your skin. I find it performs as good or better than any of the current aerosol creams or gels currently on the market. This type of shaving cream dates back many years, and professional barbers still use many of these types of concentrated, thick shaving creams on their customers. There is a reason for that. Other than convenience, the aerosols don&#x27;t offer any better of a shave. Stick with what works!</li>
    <li> This is  my favorite scent from TOBS.  It lathers better than any other creams I have used.  TOBS is by far the best shave cream.</li>
    <li> The smell when first opening the tub is spot on of what you would expect of a classic sandalwood, and it holds true after using. The scent stays very close to the skin, and is not overwhelming. It wears off to just a faint undertone after about 30 minutes. The cream also creates a great lather, and since switching to taylor of old bond i no longer get any irritation as opposed to the art of shaving which left me red and completely dry. My only real complaint is that it is a little soapy still and dries the skin just a little bit more than i feel it should, and keeps it from being a 5 star.</li>
    <li> This soap has a great strong sandalwood smell, and it lathers up really well.  I have great shaving experiences with it.</li>
    <li> Works well, but be careful when washing it down the sink, it can clog your drain.</li>
    <li> Great product speedy delivery !</li>
    <li> Loving the old school vibe of this product. This is what I imagine shaving cream  from the old days feels like.</li>
    <li> God this stuff smells anazing!</li>
    <li> I usually use V.D.H. or Williams Mug Soap but had read about Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood on a message board and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Here are some of my thoughts:    - Just as other users have posted, \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;, only a tiny amount is necessary to whip up some good lather and I&#x27;d imagine this bowl lasting for 6 months at least.    - Fragrance does come on strong, but eventually fades away and does not seem overpowering.    - Can be applied with hands/fingers or with a brush.  A tip:  I initially used a brush that I had recently used to lather some Williams Mug Soap, the combination of the 2 gave off a pretty wicked smell, be warned!  I&#x27;d suggest either using your hands/fingers or a dedicated brush.    - Moisturizing qualities are excellent for Double Edge Shaving, have not tried it yet with my Straight Razor.  Skin feels very conditioned and cleansed after shaving.    - As for other users who have complained of burning sensations and/or allergic reactions, I did not experience this at all, BUT, I also did a \\&quot;patch test\\&quot; to be sure I&#x27;d have no reaction.  Before shaving, I took a very, very small amount of the cream and rubbed it into an inconspicuous area of my face and left it on there for a few hours.  I had no skin reaction so no problems.  Never know if you could have an unknown allergy and better to find out with a patch test than having your entire face turn red!    Overall, I&#x27;m enjoying this product and scent so far and feel it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I first found this on a trip to London in 2011 when I wandered into the TOBS shop on Jermyn street. I loved the smell of it and bought two travel tubes. It hydrates well and gives a good shave. I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive to smells, but the scent of this sandalwood was just right (it doesn&#x27;t smell like real sandalwood, but that&#x27;s OK with me). This is a great winter cream, or even to shave with if I&#x27;m having a bad day. This and the TOBS Almond are my faves.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is a little strong but very wonderful.  It took myself and husband back to the the days of our grandfathers and how they shaved and smelled.  good quality and nice on his skin also.</li>
    <li> Very nice thick lather with very little product. This tub will last a while. The smell is great, very manly and lasts well after shaving. Got this to replace the Col Conk glycerin soap I received in my kit which seemed cheap and just wouldn&#x27;t lather despite my best efforts. This shave cream took very little effort to produce a thick creamy lather.</li>
    <li> Just as described and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars for overall comfort and smoothness, but 1 star for scent (unless you don&#x27;t mind smelling like you&#x27;re poor). It smells like goodwill in a tub.</li>
    <li> the product wasn&#x27;t in its original package, the cream was spilled obviously an opened product and not the same shaving cream as it used to be...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He loves the smell and how it lather.</li>
    <li> When you use a brush with a small amount of this stuff it makes a ton of lather. Smells great; little old manish but I like it. Be aware the scent stays with you most of the day.</li>
    <li> TOBS makes extraordinary &amp;#34;croap&amp;#34; products all the way around, while remaining at an excellent value. This sandalwood fragrance is hands down the best I&#x27;ve experienced thus far. Excellent texture and a badger or boar will respond well to it whether face or bowl lathering. I give this a 10/10. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> OK but I prefer old fashioned shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream based on its great reviews. But I am not as impressed as the other reviewers. I have to use a lot of it to get sufficient lather. Secondly, I do two coats when I shave. The lather never lasts more than one coat, so I have to use even more of it.</li>
    <li> Although it lathers well, the scent is extremely strong, even using a very small amount. Even after a hot shower, the scent is overpowering. The ingredient list and front don&#x27;t say \\&quot;natural scent,\\&quot; so it&#x27;s probably a chemical compound, but I&#x27;m not absolutely sure about that. I will probably throw this tub out...  Of course, the scent itself and its level are subjective judgments. I will probably never purchase this again, but might try some of Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s other products as it did lather well.  Other reviews have noticed the persistent after-shave level of scent. I can validate that.   Way too much scent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good brush on shaving cream and this is it! Lathers well, smells great and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> Smells like victory. My wife approves of the scent.</li>
    <li> V nice lathering, doesn&#x27;t require much soap on a good brush</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought two similar cakes for a refill and they lacked the volume of lather and the fine odor. Not too strong, just right. My third purchase of this specific product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! The lather is great and we both like the scent.</li>
    <li> The cream delivers a clean shave.  My only complaint is its aggressive  (for me) sandalwood fragrance.</li>
    <li> It is a nice thick lather, and works well  either applied right on to the brush  or bowl. Like the sandalwood smell as well!</li>
    <li> Smells good and you&#x27;ll get a nice thick lather and good shave but overpriced.  I recommend Prorasso for a good smell and good shave.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cream. It&#x27;s like the smell of an old barber shop your dad would have taken you to.  It&#x27;s very pleasant smelling. I find results are better when applying a tiny bit of pre-shave oil first.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap but too expensive for me to continue buying. Now I just use it as a soap tub for my less expensive pucks.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is really good and i have a few others. I use them both, different days. This shaving cream makes my skin feel good after shaving. i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely and provides a comfortable shave. The container doubles as a mixing bowl and the scent will make the ladies swoon. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I tried this as a replacement for another (more expensive) brand that I&#x27;ve been using for about a year.  First I&#x27;ll say that shaving with a brush and this type of shaving cream has been a great change.  I used to get razor bumps on my neck, and it occasionally required medical treatment.  Some products work for that (tend skin is one), but since I&#x27;ve started shaving with a badger hair brush to apply shaving cream, and pre-shave oil, I&#x27;ve had very few razor bumps.  So if you are considering this shaving method to help razor bumps, it works for me.  Now back to this product.  I found it to be reasonably priced, and great cream. It lathers up much thicker than other brands I have used, which gives me a more comfortable shave. The smell is a little strong but it washes off.  This is good stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this shaving cream and think it is taylor&#x27;s best.  Have tried to buy again but had shipping issue.  Will buy when need to replace the lavender I bought to replace the damaged ones.</li>
    <li> It smells so great and makes a very thick lather which I really like. Simply put, this is the best shaving cream in the world!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to really like TOBS, especially this masculine scent. It lather quite easily, and supplied an exceptionally slick shave. I really enjoy this particular scent of Sandalwood. I felt like the price is good, because I know this tub will last me over a year. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying TOBS other scents, and they certainly won me over as a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My only complaint was that the side of the lid arrived cracked.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with TOBS creams.  I love the sandalwood scent.  Some people complain it is too strong, but I must disagree.  I think it is the right amount of scent, without being too overdone.  TOBS creams lather well, with little effort on my part.  Just a quick whip with the brush and a little water, and I am set for multiple lathers.  The amount of cream needed is minimal, literally a dime sized dollop.  That&#x27;s perfect, b/c this tub will last for months (4-6) at that rate.  I need to shave everyday, and with this cream it is a pleasure.  I moisturize afterwards, but this cream doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like other creams/soaps do.</li>
    <li> This will last you many shaves, and feels great on face. Smells manly too which is an added bonus. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smell like a man, shave like a man. Reminds me of my grandfather (in a good way). Keeps my face nice and smooth and smells great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaving cream. He has tried so many, this is THE ONE! It applies nicely, works well, and smells great. I like the smell too!</li>
    <li> This is my new go-to shaving cream. I have tried Williams, Art of Shaving, the beloved Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat, Taylor, and Proraso. TOBS is definitely the one that I will buy again next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all those soaps/creams, here is how they rank:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: TOBS and MWF. Comparable in how well they soothe your skin and enable a gentle, almost slippery, shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease: TOBS...takes just seconds to get a cloud of delight smothered on your face. It just never felt so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Mitchell&#x27;s, with TOBS a close second. Mitchell&#x27;s just has a refreshing clean smell that perks you up every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Container: TOBS. Solid little bowl. I use a mug to lather in, but this stuff can be applied directly to your face too. Probably not a good idea though, because just a little goes a long way, giving you a heap of cool whip to smother on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bang for Buck: TOBS. The bee&#x27;s knees cream without breaking the bank. Lasts a long time...longer than Proraso but not quite as long as MWF (which is a hard soap).</li>
    <li> This was the first shaving cream I tried, and I like it a lot.  The smell is quite strong, and lingers for hours afterwards.  I am always reminded throughout the day what cream I used.  I only gave it four stars because although this is a great product, there are other shaving creams that are slicker.  Great for the price!</li>
    <li> I gave it a four star rating because it is very good cream. Lathers up very nicely with my badger shave brush. Little pricey for me therefore the four star rating. Yes I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> After first use I post my negative feedback with one star but I don&#x27;t want to wast it so I continue using it and end up the best shaving cream I ever used! you only need tiny bit! this going to last me couple months or maybe a year! my skin is very sensitive and gets very irritated after shaving but with this cream helped me a lot. I also going to buy it for my dad and I am sure he&#x27;s going to like it because the smell which remind me with my grandpa &amp;#34;rest in peace grandpa&amp;#34; I highly recommend it.  Thank you Taylor of old bond street</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m admittedly a bit of a \\&quot;noob,\\&quot; to the straight razor/real shaving product world, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to.  Having said that, it smells great, works up an easy lather on my badger hair brush with only a smudge of product. Not the products fault, but on arrival in the mail the cream had all melted and re-formed lopsided in the container on an angle.  Asthetically unpleasing, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have bothered the function!  Would buy again, perhaps try out a different scent next time too.</li>
    <li> So I just bought a straight razor a couple months ago and thought some decent shaving cream would be appropriate... well gentlemen, if you want a great shave, you need this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great (kind of like an old school barbershop), and from my experience helps make my shave just that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that if you use a brush (or don&#x27;t), you create the lather in a separate bowl. Duh, right? Well you&#x27;d be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I shave about 3-4 times a week and this stuff has lasted me for a couple of months (just trying to give you an idea of how much you may or may not need for all you subscribers out there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I do love the smell, I love what it does for my shave, and definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I haven&#x27;t reordered it is because I want to try the &amp;#34;Eton College&amp;#34; (same brand, different smell) out.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic lather with a rich smell and a convenient container which let&#x27;s you soap up right in the bowl, no shaving mug needed. I do fear, however, that it may have clogged my pores and given me a bit of an acne breakout, but this is probably due to me not rinsing thoroughly enough.</li>
    <li> silky smooth. try it for yourself</li>
    <li> It just arrived - opened box to find the cover of the cream loose and 1/3 of the cream gone. No leakage in box - and it looks like it was &amp;#34;scooped&amp;#34; out. I haven&#x27;t used it but it smells amazing. Just wish I had all the product. Not due to product settling - this is beyond that.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice lather (very dependent on the user and how much water is added) and a nice shave.  Much better than shave soap I was using before, though I tend to make up too much, will take some getting used to.  Definitely doesn&#x27;t dry my face out as much as shave soap did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, I find it pleasant.  Doesn&#x27;t seem too strong and I&#x27;m fairly sensitive to scents.  Might be different for those who are highly sensitive to scents or allergic to sandalwood&#x27;s scent or something though.</li>
    <li> Good product love the aroma.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about this sandalwood scented shave cream before settling on this brand. Most folks seem to be happy with it, including just about every review video I watched on You Tube. The scent is not overpowering and is softy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the negative reviews I think, are overly harsh...one that I recall specifically said that &#x27;it smells like old lady&#x27;. That couldn&#x27;t be more wrong if you tried. One thing not liking or having different expectations but it&#x27;s a different issue when you go over the top in that manner.</li>
    <li> There is nothing to say. Taylor of Old Bond Street is an excellent cream, protects your skin and its scents are fantastic. Just ask the ladies. Sure you can try as many creams as your heart desires, but ultimately TOB will be on your short list if not the only brand you use.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just wow. I recently took up wet shaving after using electric for years. I bought three different creams/soaps to try them all out and get some variety into my shaving. This was the first I bought, and will likely be my only going forward. I also bought Proraso and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat soap. The Taylor cream is my favorite. The smell is like something out of a Lois L&#x27;Amour novel. It&#x27;s masculine, full, old school, but not musky. I can&#x27;t stand musk. This cream leaves a great scent in the bathroom and on my brush, but once rinsed it does not overpower my face. But that&#x27;s only the smell! Let&#x27;s talk about how it shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I get the best shave with the Taylor cream. It whips up to a nice full foam, goes on very smooth, and the razor just seems to slide across my face. There are times when I have to look closely in the sink to make sure I&#x27;m actually cutting hair! I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for only about 3 months, but RARELY do I nick myself using the Taylor cream. I get more nicks when I use the other two. This cream is so good that I kind of feel like I need to save it for Sunday mornings when I really want to enjoy it. I also want to just use up the others so that this is my only cream going forward. I suppose there may be better creams out there, but I will never find them because I won&#x27;t be looking. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Purchased this cream as part of my switch to the traditional wet shave, and have been very pleased with it and the entire process.  Has a great small, but not overpowering, and really facilitates the shaving process.  It does not lather up as much as I expected, as much as canned creams, but that could be normal for these types of creams or it could be my methods.  Its difficult to get a really thick coat of lather on my face with this cream.  However, it still shaves great and seems to still do a great job.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews on Amazon.  I used proraso shaving soap previously, and I love the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.  It lathers very well, you only need a small amount on a brush, and its so slick that I was able to shave once with my double edge safety razor, featherlite blades are super sharp, compared to shaving twice with the proraso using the same blade.  Very impressed and I like the smell.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is incredibly strong smelling.  After shaving I wipe my face on a towel and proceed to apply aftershave.  My fiance commented (negatively) that all she could smell was the sandalwood and, admittedly, it&#x27;s all I could smell too!  Two days later that same towel still smelled strongly of sandalwood.    I understand that some people may really enjoy the scent, but as someone with a strong sense of smell this was just way too much.</li>
    <li> So this cream is definitely of the highest quality. It performs well and works itself into a thick and slick lather. The reason for four stars instead of five is the scent. It&#x27;s a very nice scent, but it&#x27;s nothing like sandalwood. I guess every company is different. But if you are used to Proraso sandalwood or Art of Shaving sandalwood, Taylor&#x27;s is nothing like that. Its still worth buying though.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, glides smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Really good. Exactly what was described and would definitely order again. I&#x27;ve only used the shaving cream out of cans before and i don&#x27;t think i will go back after using something like this.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  It works well and has that Barbershop Smell.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Explodes with lather. It&#x27;s the best cream I used so far</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on an article I read off of (artofmanliness.com) I have used Trueffit &amp; Hill 1805 for about 5 years and was looking a less expensive alternative so I decided to give this one a try. I enjoyed the scent and it protected and lubricated just as well as my favorite brand. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product works fine, but the smell is not the sandalwood I was looking for.  I like the Art of Shaving Sandalwood, smell, this is more like an old man smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of the name brands in shaving cream and it seemed worth a try. The lather is rich and provides a well cushioned shave.  The sandalwood is mild and not overpowering or artificial smelling but nice and masculine. This is a classic shaving creme and highly regarded for a reason. I recommend it for any wet shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream from Amazon...I am honestly not sure if it&#x27;s an original one as it doesn&#x27;t have any sandalwood fragrance in it. I being from India, I have been using sandal wood products all my life and trust me there is no sandalwood in this cream. Moreover I have to use a lot of it to get a proper lather using a silver tip badger brush though a dime size should be enough.  I am not buying anymore of the shaving products from amazon as it&#x27;s better to buy directly from the company. Next time I will be London, I will take this cream and will show to the company shop there and will find out the truth behind this cream I got from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several TOBS creams, the latest being Sandalwood.    As with the other TOBS scents, it&#x27;s easy to whip up a nice lather with very little effort and very little product. More than enough lubrication to provide an irritation-free shave on my face.    Scent is a very subjective issue, but I found the sandalwood scent a little lacking. Yet, a few people have called it overpowering. Make of that what you will. Perhaps oddly, the scent lingered on my hands for a few hours even though I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it while shaving.    I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy the sandalwood again, but will continue to use TOBS lavender (my favorite) and Eton College creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with this several times now and don&#x27;t have any major complaints.  It lathers well and allows for a close shave.  A small, dime sized amount is enough product for multiple passes.  I found the scent to be pleasant, but a little too strong.  The scent isn&#x27;t too much of an issue if you throw some cold water on your face afterwards and use unscented aftershave lotion.  I think I&#x27;ll try other products by this company, but will not purchase this scent again.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream smells amazing.  I have bolth the Sandalwood and Rose from TOBS with this being my go-to daily shaver.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but ineffective for me in comparison with a variety of other manufacturers/brands at facilitating a cut-free shave with a straight-edge.  Less viscous than its competitors.  I need couple it with another product.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaving cream and nice fragrance, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great product. Provides a perfect, close  shave.plus has a very nice, lingering odor. I will continue to use  this product.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice and it provides a nice surface for shaving on without cuts and irritation.  I like that I can reuse the tub to if I want to try soaps that come in a puck form.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain alcohol (which it does) so be prepared for a tingling sensation that you don&#x27;t get with shaving soaps.  I loaded up my brush once and was able to lather up for two passes with some left in the bristles so it should last a while.  I would recommend that you get a moisturizer to put on before and after you use this product.</li>
    <li> I use it with a shaving brush and a Fusion razor in the shower and get the most amazing shave day after day. I love the smell as well. And, I cannot go without mentioning that one of the things I love most about this product is the container; the lid spins/glides effortlessly off and on—it&#x27;s very well made. It&#x27;s the small things that make me smile and spinning the lid off this shaving cream makes me smile every time.</li>
    <li> My entry into the single safety blade experience started with reviews on Amazon.  I went with Taylor of Old Bond Street based on many positive reviews (also I&#x27;m a fan of Sandalwood).  The product  is a good value as a premium product compared to the standard grocery store brands.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to put it in a bowl and create enough lather for a shave.  The sandalwood scent is only strong enough for someone to smell it if they are in your personal space.  It stays on your face the whole time and provides good lubrication.  It also rinses off easily.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I highly recommend it. Just a dab will do youand the sandlewood is a great sent.Happy shaving!&lt;br /&gt;  D.S. Sinclair</li>
    <li> This was my first venture into wet shaving. I was initially attracted by the price, which is exceptionally low, especially considering the quality. What everyone else says is true; the scent is very strong. Personally, I love the smell and have no issues with the strength, I just use an unscented aftershave.   It lathers very well. It&#x27;s very easy to form a nice layer of foam on my face. It&#x27;s fairly slick, too. It does dry my face a bit, but I have trouble with acne so I actually appreciate it. Sometimes it gets a bit harsh in the winter when the air gets drier.  Overall I would say this is a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells like feet. Nothing like Art of Shaving&#x27;s sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Sooooooooooo easy to lather, even though it was my first time using a brush.  This stuff smells fantastic, goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry out too fast, and is worth every penny.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shaving cream. Get a decent brush, and it foams up wonderfully. Looks like I&#x27;ll have enough in here for a very long time. Smells good. Would strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who lived in the UK a long time recommended this to me and I am glad he did!  A shave takes just a small amount of the soap but it lubricates incredibly well.  I get the smoothest shave I ever have except for the full barbershop ritual.  The sandalwood smell is soothing.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Most products made by Taylor of Old Bond Street are hypoallergenic! they prevent allergic reactions which are commonly done by cheap shaving creams!</li>
    <li> Let me first start off with the fact that I like the shaving cream in and of itself.  I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times, but it gives a nice lather and good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why, you may ask, did I give this shaving cream a measly 3 stars?  It gets seriously dragged down by the scent.  I&#x27;ve used the Truefitt and Hill Sandalwood shaving cream and loved the scent.  Being unable to justify the cost of that cream, I decided to give this a shot at half the price.  Like I said, I like the shave I get, but not the scent.  You can smell the sandalwood scent buried in there, but it is overwhelmed by an almost medicinal soap scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some of the other scents by TOBS aren&#x27;t overwhelmed, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll give them a try.  For now, I&#x27;ll stick to switching between this and my Col Conk Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my shaves feel so much smoother! It foams up very nice with my badger hair brush (N-ICE Home). My skin is sensitive but I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet with this cream.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shave cream. The sandalwood scent is really great and lasts quite long, well into the day.  Inferior products are like shaving with wet watery soap where this cream creates a nice rich lather. Just so you know, when you open this up you&#x27;re not looking at a bowl of hard soap, this is actually a tub of very creamy lotion. All you need to do is just dip the tip of your badger hair brush in the lotion (I like to wet my brush first with very hot water) and then lather it up in your other hand if you wish and then apply it to your face. A bit old fashioned routine maybe, but still great and pleasing way to shave.</li>
    <li> Thought this Sandalwood Cream was great.  I tried the Avocado, and it&#x27;s great too.  This is just a good, man scent.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, lathers up easy with little cream, and makes my face feel great while shaving.  This is the cream I recommend to any friend who is thinking about shaving with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I actually meant to buy Shaving Soap when I ordered this, but wasn&#x27;t paying attention to what I bought.  As it turns out, I really like this shaving cream.  There is no comparison with the cans of shaving cream you might buy at your local supermarket.  This stuff smells great, but the best part about it is the amount of protection it provides for your face.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Pro: lasts quite long, have had mine for a few months and use almost daily, still not half way through it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, and makes a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Not very slick. Some might like that its not very slick but I however dont.</li>
    <li> I only used Art of Shaving Sandalwood but when they were out of stock I decided to try Taylor of Old Bond Street. It left a nice aroma on my face.</li>
    <li> This lathers great and the scent lingers all day , it&#x27;s not overpowering , more of a fresh scent . I will continue to use this .</li>
    <li> What else can I say? This stuff is great. Haven&#x27;t had a bad shave when I use it. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, excellent quality. I&#x27;ve never used better</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the only shaving cream I now use. It smells great-it has a very strong sandalwood aroma which some purchasers do not like, but it&#x27;s the reason I first bought it. It lathers up very well, too.At $15-$16 for 5.3oz. it seemed expensive. I purchased my second bowl over a month ago as i thought I was about to run out. I have not yet opened the new bowl. The first bowl looks like it will last me into January which means the product lasts me for one year. By the way, I shave my entire head and face daily.</li>
    <li> Use a boar hair brush and a little dab goes a long way.  Has a manly scent with just enough lather to do the job without foaming your face with wasted bubbles.  Good for several months of shaving so worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This product works so well smells so good, you want to put a spoon in it and eat it, great product happy customer will return again</li>
    <li> This product is great, the best I have used so far and fairly priced. Smells great, it has a rich lather with a smooth shave performance.</li>
    <li> This product whips up an amazing lather, and it smells excellent. It has that kind of mystical old fashioned barbershop type smell, clean, manly, sophisticated.   It also leaves the skin soft and supple without any of the burn that the minty type oils tend to give.  This product ends the quest for the best, yet paradoxically most economical, shaving lather I have found. This tub lasts forever...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new a the whole DE shaving thing, so when I got started I decided to not ony try several brands of blades, but sample several creams as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I&#x27;ve tried two: The Proraso (in the squeeze tube) and the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream (in a jar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are much nicer than anything at the drug store. Both have their pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proraso gives a nice, tingling sensation, and a fresh smell, but is runnier. That said, getting the proportions right for a lather are dead simple - an almond-sized dab in my shaving mug, wet the brush, and lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marginally prefer the Taylor of Old, etc. for it&#x27;s full, thick foam and the good lubrication, but it is a bit drier. It&#x27;s also a bit harder to judge how much water to add for lathering as I prefer to pick up some cream on my brush and use that in my shaving mug with some water added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as scents - the proraso wins out on this round. While I LIKE the sandalwood scent with its overtones of incense, etc., it is much stronger, and I can see where people would dislike it. I look forward to trying the eton college and other scents in the Taylor line.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff and I do too. He used to have a big problem with razor burn and bumps but no more.</li>
    <li> Proraso and Musgo Real are good, but Taylor of Old Bond Street is amazing. The tub lasts forever and the cream doesn&#x27;t get hard as quickly as others do. I really like the sandalwood scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering at all. Creates a really thick, rich lather.</li>
    <li> lots of lather, but for price dont see that much difference than cheaper soaps, so save your money and go with the cheaper soaps.&lt;br /&gt;kinda like wasting your money on a Dyson, over a Shark vaccum. More over pricing from overseas!</li>
    <li> Folks, there is a reason this product is a #1 Best-Seller. I thought I had discovered the Mecca of shaving when I switched to a double-edged safety razor. I spent about $50 on a new razor, bought an $18 stand, $13 brush, the best blades, and the CHEAPEST shaving soap. It took me about 4 months to use up my first round of soap (it wasn&#x27;t Taylor of Old Bond Street). I had some of the best shaves of my 20-yr shaving career. Then it was time to order more soap. I read the reviews, contemplated this one and that, and finally decided on TOOBS Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve read the reviews, you&#x27;ve seen plenty of questions about whether or not this soap requires a separate mixing cup. My first soap I bought did not require the cup. It was mixed directly in the container it came in. After reading these reviews, I decided against buying the cup. So, can this be used without a mixing cup? Yes, probably. However, this soap is relatively &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; compared to the solid state of my first soap. Upon using this soap for this first time, I realized it&#x27;s slightly different than using a true solid soap. I decided to get a coffee mug from my kitchen for mixing. Good decision! I can honestly say that due to the very small amount of soap required to produce a rich lather, this 5.3 oz size will probably last me an entire year, or more. It&#x27;s amazing how smooth and soothing this stuff is. It smells AWESOME too. It doesn&#x27;t take much. It&#x27;s mixes really well and provides a very clean, irritation-free shave. Unless the second coming of Christ happens before I die, I will continue to make this my go-to soap forever!</li>
    <li> I bought this taking a chance never having smelled it, but it is a great classic smell. My wife loves it! Will definitely keep buying this scent!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as an alternative to my usual Sandalwood cream from the Art of Shaving to see if I could find a more cost effective substitution.  I learned 2 things from this purchase: I really enjoy this type of shaving cream and the scent from the Art of Shaving is one of a kind.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this cream.  The scent is a bit musky and definitely has an old time feel to it.  It smells like something that my grandfather would use, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  The container is solid and works well as a bowl.  Though not always recommended I just got my brush wet and used the container, though some say to take some out and use another bowl which will make the container last longer.  I shaved about every other day using this container and it last about 3 months.  It may last longer if you shave less often and only use a dollop rather than using the container as a bowl.  While I prefer the scent of the Art of Shaving sandalwood cream, I would definitely recommend this to any guy who wants a great shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Forget about the super easy loading (from boar to synthetic). Forget about the easy lather production (either bowl - my standard, or face). Forget about the silky smooth shave. WHAT A SMELL! Now this is what a man should smell like. I have to get TOBS Sandalwood AS, just so I don&#x27;t take away from it. Great price for a reliable performer, and you smell like a man should smell. No other Sandalwood smells this good. Go ahead and try to find one. Closest is the AOS soap, but a distant second, in my book. I like to use soaps and creams, from other makers (and different scents), but I At least, without fail, crack it open, just to get a whiff.</li>
    <li> It works like you&#x27;d expect it too. I have very sensitive skin and this really helps to minimize the razor burn and pimples caused by shaving. I use it with a badger brush. Great scent, smooth shaving. The razor glides over the skin much easier.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lather is okay. this was my first purchase so it is difficult for me to compare it.</li>
    <li> Tried several other sandalwood brands. IMHO this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works well, lasts a long time. Expensive compared to shaving soaps, but it goes pretty far for the money.    It is strong enough that it softened the bristles on my boar hair brush after a few weeks of use use... If it can do that it can certainly soften my beard.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great smell too.  I want to buy more scents, but since it takes such a small amount to generate cream, I worry about the shelf life.  I&#x27;ll wait a few months to buy more.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance. Lather is superb and makes shaving a pleasure!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about two months now and my face feels nice and soft. I like the scent it leaves after I shave.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving cream. For reference,  I use a DE Merkur long handle razor and Astra SP blades. I was going to give this 5 stars as it holds moisture better then my Proraso shaving cream, but I recently tried the TOBS Eton College cream and it was a little slicker than this Sandalwood cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, you can&#x27;t go wrong here and the scent is pleasant. For the price, the TOBS brand is my go to cream. I will keep this one in the rotation as it&#x27;s nice to have some variety. This is the second time I have purchased the Sandalwood scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 01/28/14**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have upgraded my rating to 5 stars. As I have gotten better at building lathers, I have found that this shaving cream is just as slick as the Eton College mentioned above. You really need to focus on shaving techniques before reviewing the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am now using the EJ DE89LBL with this cream. Best shaves I&#x27;ve had to this date.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving cream...it&#x27;s like butter....it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized and has a pleasant musky scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Grandpa&#x27;s secret was passed down before all the grandpas died.  This stuff makes you smell like sexy, sexy sandal wood.  This is what allowed Grandpa to reproduce and make your parents.  Sandalwood always gets you laid.</li>
    <li> Performs very well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is what I call a REAL shave cream.  Not only does this smell terrific, but it sure does the job of nicely lubricating the face for the shave. I also just ordered the pre-shave oil from Taylor here on Amazon. Want to give it a try. The whole wet shave experience! Also nice that this is in it&#x27;s own bowl so you don&#x27;t need anything extra except your badger brush.  5/23/16 - Wanted to update my review. Just ordered another one. This lasted a long time. A little bit goes a long way. Still find it amazing how much better than a canned shave cream this is every time I use it. BTW the pre shave oil works well too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a head shaver so I use a lot of shaving cream.  This stuff works very well, feels great and lasts a long time.  I take a dab the size of a marble and put it on my head then I take a badger brush and wet it under the faucet then use the brush in a circular motion to create a lather first on my head then face and neck.  That marble size amount goes a long way so a jar of this will last 6 months or more without any problem.  I also like that since it&#x27;s a soap, my head feels clean and not oily afterwards and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell or feel.  It feels like you washed your face with soap and water.  It also has a great manly smell as do all the Taylor Sandalwood products!</li>
    <li> I come from canned shaving creams. I&#x27;ve since moved to this cream using a beaver hair shaving brush to apply. What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I get every bit of cream as opposed to canned creams that would run out of air.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very manly and it stays with you for an hour or so without being over powering.  I just smell clean.&lt;br /&gt;(My wife loves it.)&lt;br /&gt;The Shave just feels smoother and there&#x27;s less bumps and irritation around my neck where I had issues before.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I just love going back to a traditional style of shaving. The smell and thick lather makes me feel clean and well groomed.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have tried. Great lather, great scent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling dry like some others.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best.  It&#x27;s the best fragrance, and it makes a great lather.  You don&#x27;t need that much and it will last a very long time.  Highly recommended for wet shave enthusiasts.    There are also other scents which are great as well, however, I prefer the more masculine scent that this one provides.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. Still I can use a barbasol or a gillette gel no issue. This stuff burned my face seriously. I had to wash it off in seconds and never used it again.&lt;br /&gt;If you ever have issues with skin irritation avoid this.</li>
    <li> I shave with a straight razor, and this is by far the best shaving cream I have ever used. It creates a perfect lather with small amounts of cream. Plus, it has natural ingredients just like in the old days. So your skin feels amazing, not dried-out or otherwise irritated. You could probably use this cream with regular crappy razors, but if you&#x27;re still using disposables or &amp;#34;Quattros&amp;#34;, etc. then you don&#x27;t deserve to use this shaving cream anyways! Upgrade!!</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a shaving set, the husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Allows for a great close shave and creates a nice light fluffy cream when applied with a shaving brush. I just ordered my second one, the first one lasted me a few months of daily use.</li>
    <li> I shave with a straight razor, so a good shave cream is important to me. This is the best cream I have ever used, it only takes a little to work into a rich cream and a few minutes later you have the best shave you&#x27;ve ever gotten. On top of that, as my partner put it, you smell like a man of man after your done shaving.</li>
    <li> Very creamy, easy to make a lather. Good product .</li>
    <li> This shaving cream smells good, is easy to create a good lather with and works well.  My wife who is sensitive to smells likes it.  So I have to give it a good rating.  Unfortunately my skin is sensitive to this cream.  I should have known better. The cream itself is a good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my son.  He said he can&#x27;t even believe the comparison with the regular shaving cream he&#x27;s used for years.  This product offers an entirely new level of shaving.  This product smells great, lathers wonderfully (especially with a badger brush), and gives the most luxurious feeling he&#x27;s ever had in shaving.</li>
    <li> Quite a good shave, but like most real shaving products, it requires careful use. When used in moderation, it has a distinct, moderately strong, pleasant odor that dissipates in a short while after shaving. The cream froths up quite nicely, and lubricates the face well for a hot water shave. If too much is used, the odor can become overbearing to the point of inducing a headache and scaring away children a block away, but moderation will result in a pleasant experience. If you&#x27;re the type who doesn&#x27;t shave with a throwaway razor and an aerosol can, you can handle a little moderation, eh?</li>
    <li> smell very nice like old shaving cream of old days, fells great and make blades glide well</li>
    <li> smells amazing, the scent lasts all day and is simply perfect!</li>
    <li> Not bad.  I love the smell, it reminds me of stuff my grandfather used.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream as it lathers up very nice and it compliments my stephan shaving conditioner very well.</li>
    <li> This is my first go at shaving creams and soaps. I will say that, now that I&#x27;m into this tub about halfway, it is SOOOO much nicer than soap!! First, you use only a FRACTION of what I thought it would take. Each time, I use less and less, and STILL am coming up with loads of thick cream. Second, the amount of effort it takes to whip up to a lather is SOOO much less than soap it&#x27;s not even a contest!! In fact, it&#x27;s so efficient, you really only need to dab, wet, and smear on your face...it&#x27;ll lather up super easy!</li>
    <li> The scent is not nearly as strong when you first get it, as it is as you progress through it. The faint smell on your skin is very subtle, and smells clean. You just need a small pinch on your brush, and even less water, to really work it up. I always have more than I need from a small amount. I truly enjoy shaving with this, with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. I don&#x27;t know how in the world anyone can stand to use canned shaving foam when there are amazing products like this. Practically a microscopic amount creates a thick, rich, smooth lather, and my single-blade saftey razor glides right across better than any other cream, soap or gel I&#x27;ve tried. It looks like this can is going to last forever. Plus it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> I love the shaving combination I have put together. I can now shave daily with a new blade without going broke on disposables. Initial cost for the handle and brush was under $45. Cost per shave with a new razor each day 30 cents. The process is very quick and it gives me personal time to plan on the day ahead. My sons age 9 and 2 like to use the brush to cream their faces on occasion. My wife has even started to use it for her legs! Talk about a win win. Her legs are silky smooth and we do not have to put out money on even more razors and canned cream. The resulting shave is closer with far less irritation than canned cream and disposables. Everyone in the family has come to love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;B000NL0T1G&lt;br /&gt;$29.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush:&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;B00LDYFGFQ&lt;br /&gt;$12.95&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades:&lt;br /&gt;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count&lt;br /&gt;B0077LAJT2&lt;br /&gt;$13.19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream:&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;B0007MW2ZW&lt;br /&gt;$17.17</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the fragrance thing is all about but it really has no strong fragrance. Lathers well and lasts a long time. My head feels real cool after I&#x27;m done shaving too. This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street creams for about 4 years now and love the way they lather and shave!  I usually use a brush but even just lathering up in the palm of my hand with my fingers this cream works wonderfully--far better than the mass-market gels and creams you buy at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, by far, my favorite scent Taylor offers, it makes my mornings so much more enjoyable!</li>
    <li> works good smells really good</li>
    <li> I actually received this as a mistake when I resupplied my Eton College cream (I am a creature of habit). I thought of sending it back, but I haven&#x27;t used anything but Eton College in years, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and ended up loving it.  The smell of the cream in the tub is a bit stronger than what I&#x27;m used to and definitely hearkens to an old scent memory I have, only I cannot for the life of me remember what the scent it reminds me of is. Once you get it on a brush and lather with it, it&#x27;s great. Just strong enough. It gives a bit of a warming feeling to the face (which I&#x27;ve since heard other say is an \\&quot;awful burning sensation\\&quot;), but I have really sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Kind of invigorating.  Anyway, it&#x27;s great stuff. Lathers well, makes your skin feel awesome, and has a scent that sticks around but doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
    <li> Ordered my second tub of this stuff, love the smell and the product itself.</li>
    <li> Pros: Thick creamy (fast to make) lather (better than Col Conk&#x27;s, and various tube creams including Alba, Avalon Organics, and Kiss My Face IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small dip of the end of your brush into this will go miles, it really is a good value when you consider a Col Conk cake costs you $5 for half the weight - and a far less satisfying lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Will gunk up your razor so you&#x27;ll need to rinse frequently (doesn&#x27;t bother me though. I find that if I rinse with piping hot water every couple swipes the razor (a Merkur 34C) cuts like butter through stubble. Heat makes a BIG difference!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit strong while you&#x27;re shaving, but that&#x27;s a good thing once it&#x27;s washed away if you&#x27;re looking for some lingering aroma.</li>
    <li> It whips up into a beautiful silky lather that feels great on the face and the shave is lovely for sensitive skin.  The only drawback is that you smell like an 80 year old man out on the prowl when you are done shaving.  Perhaps that&#x27;s what a gentleman is supposed to smell like.</li>
    <li> Foams up quickly with water and brush. Smells clean &amp; fresh. Nice lather for shave with single blade razor.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Just amazing. Although, company: please ensure they the items are completely closed before shipment. one of my items was partially opened and I lost about 15% of product. (measured by weight of other container.)</li>
    <li> Awesome scent when first opened. Very manly. It seems to have changed after a while. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. It also doesn&#x27;t last very long. Wish it was a little stronger. I&#x27;m going through the cream much faster than a soap i am trying which makes this a little expensive.</li>
    <li> Buy if you love the smell of Sandalwood</li>
    <li> Great soap and scent. I like this soap a little better than the hard soap both give a great lather but for me this in a shaving bowl allows the scent to be more prevalent. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Living the dream over here in Afghanistan and, decided to upgrade my toiletry kit.  This stuff is great, smells great, makes for a clean/smooth shave and skin cleanser.  Multiple compliments from my fellow soldiers concerning the product too while in the LSS.  I used to use Gillette shaving cream but, not anymore.  Seemed like the Gillette product would dull my razors quickly and, would never provide a clean/smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need a brush to apply this stuff though.  That&#x27;s not a negative though.  You grow to like the brush.  I usually put on one coat, shave, and, then apply a second coat, leave on for 2-3 minutes, and, then, rinse off.  Makes your skin feel awesome.</li>
    <li> Lathers up great, smooth comfortable shave, but oh, the aroma. My wife couldn&#x27;t stand to be within 3 feet of me and had to open the bathroom window the next morning when she took a shower because of the smell of the soap sitting on the vanity. I threw it out. The smell lingered on my face for hours and hours. Just way to perfumey for me and especially my wife. I just ordered Pre de Provence to replace it since the vast majority of those reviews say that it&#x27;s basically just a clean soapy smell that dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had AND I smell great all day! My wife loves the smell and closeness of shave I get from TOBS sandalwood scent. Not going to use anything else, I&#x27;ve found the holy grail of shaving creams! I can&#x27;t wait to try some other TOBS shave creams.</li>
    <li> What a great cream!!!!  I have eyeing TOBS for a while but was hesitant about the smell as I am sensitive to strong smells,  but I have to say this sandalwood smells amazing. It&#x27;s mild,  and yet it has some lasting power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the the shaving qualities this is an amazing cream,  some of the PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-easy to lather&lt;br /&gt;-very thick lather&lt;br /&gt;-very slick lather... Allows the DE to just glide effortlessly through the face. Also It allows to pass the DE a couple of times over the same area without needing to reapply (within reason).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only CON to this is that it&#x27;s a clear in a tub.... But I&#x27;m just not picking here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Proraso white soap,  Proraso green cream,  and B&amp;M sample pack (great soaps but I live in a hard water area,  so getting them to lather well is a xhallenge),  and I really like the TOBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using either feathers or Personna Lab Blues with this cream and the shaves are amazingly close with no razor burn. I follow it by Geo F Thrumpers Lime skin food... Best shaves of my DE life....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband when I got him his first safety razor.  I bought it due to all the rave reviews.  Personally, I thought the sandlewood scent was terrible, and my husband wasn&#x27;t too fond of it either.  However, the husband liked the texture of the cream and it was easy for him to whip into a nice lather.  His happiness with the lather quickly faded after it made him break out badly.  Not sure if he&#x27;s allergic to an ingredient, or if it doesn&#x27;t provide enough lubrication to the skin while shaving.</li>
    <li> The smell is intoxicating; old and regal. Only a bit is enough to lather enough for a good shave. After 9 hours outside, I can still smell the sandalwood on my face! I will definitely buy more after I ran out. Since I have to shave everyday, due to my occupation, this is an invaluable product to have.</li>
    <li> Product smells like it should be used on an old man, it may be out dated or the cold weather did something to it but the one I received is not good smelling in the least. I will have to agree with the other reviews and especially the one gent from London who has used this brand for years over there and purchased it here and opps its not the same quality. Now I have not been able to compair this brand or supplier to another just yet but unfortunately the one I have is not something I will buy again from this company. The delivery was fine thats not any issue here just the product itself. My wife and daughter did not care for the scent of the item that I received and I am going to try a different brand of this scent from another company to do comparison. My recomendation read all the reviews, I do but the majority likes for this one didnt work foe me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product with a nice lather, pleasant sandalwood scent and it only takes a touch to get a great, rich lather.</li>
    <li> I have never used this type of shaving cream before. My wife gave me a shaving brush as a gift so I needed some shaving cream to go with it. I took a chance with this one, not knowing the difference, but I will say that I really like it. A little bit goes a long way. It creates a nice thick lather and I really like the scent. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite shaving cream by far! The beachy smell of great and it makes his face baby soft so I love it. Definetaly would recommend for all men.</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time today and expecting that woody sandalwood scent. Masculine. Understated. Instead the scent is chemical and artificial. Kind of like that dryer sheet smell I do not like. My wife complained that I smelled of cheap aftershave. Wish I could return it as I doubt very much I will use it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream for a year now and have had nothing but success. Taylor creams give you a comfortable lather and aid in a smooth, close and comfortable shave. I shave regularly and a 5.3 ounce bowl will last me around six months. This particular product smells great and works as well if not better than several other brands, including the Art of Shaving, for almost half the cost. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The container is rather small, and initially I was worried that the tub would be a poor value for what I paid.  Not the case- I just dipped the tip of my brush into the cream, and rubbed into my moistened facial hair with repeated circular strokes.  After a few minutes, the little bit of cream lathered my entire face with extra lather still on the brush.  I probably could have shaved twice with the little cream I used.  I like the fragrance- my fiancee also likes it.  She said she can usually tell when a sandalwood fragrance is imitation, but she noted that the quality of the scent is quite good.  Face still feels soft and silky after about 12 hours.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is what I decided to try first and haven&#x27;t compared it to anything else, but not sure I will even try because my wife loves the fragrance and the smoothness of the shave I get with with this shaving cream is amazing.  This the kind of thing that is the essence of switching from cartridge shaving to shaving like a man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my brush in a mug of hot water while I shower and then shake off the excess water and spin it in the cream a few times and that is plenty for a nice full 3 pass shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say be careful with Amazon pricing, as shown at the time of writing this one bowl is $17.00 US or $85.99 for three making each bowl in bulk cost $28.67!  Really, so you buy in bulk and you pay $11.66 more!!  Come on Amazon, that makes no sense at all!!  I didn&#x27;t take a star away because I don&#x27;t think that has anything to do with the product itself, but making sure you are aware of the pricing scam here.  I think most who try one bowl will want more so logic says buying in bulk is cheaper, not here!</li>
    <li> I have really grown to love the fragrance. Just an almond sized amount will lather perfectly for a shave. I will buy this again, but after about 50 shaves, it&#x27;s only half gone. This product will last me 5 or 6 months.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and not overpowering.  It whips up a thick lather fast and give a great smooth shave.  I was going to purchase shaving soap, but I am glad I went this direction instead.  It is better to have a separate shaving bowl so you can mix a good lather without watering down the shaving cream comes in.  I will never buy shaving cream in a can again.  This purchase was paired up with a Merkur safety razor.</li>
    <li> This is a first rate product. It lathers up nicely. Good scent. Not much needed per shave. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> First time using a brush and shave cream. Decided on this from the reviews and would buy again. Using it with the Escali badger hair brush and works up great.</li>
    <li> Update:  Well I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now and I think it is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. I&#x27;m hoping all TOBS lather up the same way because this is absolutely excellent and much, much better than Art of Shaving..and more affordable.  I lather up in a cup and keep it submerged in hot water so the lather stays warm. My Feather blades just glide over my skin now. I think it prolongs blade life for another shave or two. So I would rate this now at 5 stars. I have ordered the Eaton College again. Hope that&#x27;s what I get, because TOBS is, by far, the best. I no longer use a straight now, just my Merker DE and Feather blades. Extremely smooth!  Original Review:  I received this Sandalwood by mistake when I ordered Eaton College (still have yet to try Eaton College). I like it and my wife loves the scent. I&#x27;m good with the scent, very nice. I had been using Art of Shaving Lavender, whose scent I like better. The TOBS Sandalwood is just as good performance wise as the Art of Shaving but is much less expensive. So I will try other TOBS scents and lay off the Art of Shaving which I&#x27;m starting to think is a bit overpriced.  My favorite shave creme however is still Proasso. You can&#x27;t beat it for shave performance, scent and economy. It will out last a tub of TOBS and that is saying alot. I think the menthol in it numbs the skin a bit in case you overdo it, which I find nice. But lots of folks don&#x27;t like the menthol and that&#x27;s fine. I find it most refreshing in the summer months. I also use a tiny dab of Prorasso after the shave for comfort and healing. But that is my own preference. When I&#x27;m completely done, I brush a little Clubman talc on to take the shine off and leave my face smooth and dry.  Shaving is a wonderful experience now. I use a Straight and DE in combination (DE for last pass). It&#x27;s pamper time every morning now when it used to be the most horrible slip/slap/chop job in less than 5 minutes on the way out the door to work. Little things like TOBS Sandalwood Shaving Cream ( as opposed to that horrible grocery store stuff) good prep, good blade, good post shave make shaving something I can&#x27;t wait to get to after that nice hot shower in the morning. I have a much more positive and relaxed attitude in the morning at work nowadays. It pays to pamper yourself a little, especially at such economical prices. And believe me, one tub will last a year for me.</li>
    <li> The cream itself is great, but I found the smell to be overpowering and awful. To the point where it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that I have not figured out how to warm it up before it goes on my face...</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thing. He got into straight razor shaving lately, and this is something he uses regularly.</li>
    <li> This is a very moist and lathery shave cream. When applied with a brush it is hard to beat. I have bought this for my friends as well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice pleasant smelling shaving cream. I have not used other shaving cream extensively so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others. This is a step up from can shaving cream though</li>
    <li> Amazing scent.  A little dab will do you.  I feel like a man.  Smells like a man ought to smell.  *catches own eye in mirror* damn you&#x27;re handsome.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shaving cream. Just a small amount on the brush yields enough lather for passes with and against the grain with plenty of cream to spare. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll re-order later on.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream lathers very well, perhaps even easier than a shave soap, and the scent is great, masculine without being too musky. Some reviewers complained that it is too heavily scented, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case. Overall good price/benefit on this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different shaving soaps and creams but this one has been the best.  Easy to lather, works great and smells good.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, rich lather, fantastic scent. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different creams, soaps, but this one has become my favorite. The Sandalwood has a pleasing smell that&#x27;s pleasant and not overpowering. Pair this with a good brush and a solid blade and you&#x27;ll be looking forward to your morning shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase this shaving cream. It lubricates very nicely and does everything I would expect of a shaving cream. Because it&#x27;s not foamy, it forms a more protective layer than the spray-type products. Plus, you cannot beat the smell of sandalwood in the morning!</li>
    <li> Too strong and a little bit strong smelling.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t usually like the smell of sandalwood, but she said this stuff isn&#x27;t too strong, and its just the right strength for a lingering smell. I think she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a nice lather, which i wasnt expecting from a cream.</li>
    <li> Makes you smell like an old man.  If you or those close to you don&#x27;t like fragrances, stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> Functionally this does what one would expect. I did not like the overly strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> I went with this cream because of the raving reviews, and I have to say that they are all true!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my Merkur Futur just slide so easy, and does not create any type of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I personally love the smell so much that I like shaving just to get that smell all over my face, I noticed that people claim that the smells goes as soon as you rinse, whoever that is not my case, and I can still smell it after hour have passed.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfying cream, this has been my first and will remain using this one.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a soap like the other wet shaving creams but this works a lot better.  My fianc&amp;eacute;e loves the sandalwood smell.  Always a good thing.</li>
    <li> Aahhh- the fragrance!  I really liked the Sandalwood aroma.  The shaving cream lathered up well and did its job. Who knew shaving could be so pleasant?</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely awesome. I love the smell. It is my favorite smelling soap/cream out of the 20-something shaving soaps and creams I own. Yes, I might have a bit of a shaving cream problem. Don&#x27;t judge me, review reader. Just listen up and be ready to fork out some bucks because you want this shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite scent is actually Bay Rum but this Sandalwood smells so good that this is my favorite cream. I wish I knew a Bay Rum that left the lingering, wonderful scent that this Sandalwood does. When I use this cream I spend the rest of the day sniffing myself. I try to avoid this in public to avoid the stares. The scent stays with you all day but is light and won&#x27;t make you smell like the night-club d-bag that bathed in Axe body spray. When I take off my undershirt in the evening I can still faintly smell the sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;This scent is classic. It has that deep, calming old-school barbershop kind of smell that is retro-grandpa-style awesome.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the performance of the cream goes, it lathers up SUPER thick and easy. You don&#x27;t need much! This is a thick cream so avoid wasting it by just getting the tips of your brush loaded. You can always add more. I knocked off one star for the sad fact that it tends to dry out on my face by the time I get to the last section of my neck. I have sensitive skin so I am not a fast shaver. I take my time or I pay the price.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is spendy compared to some of the other soaps and creams out there but is a nice luxury for your face and will make your whole day more pleasant. I will definitely buy again before my first jar runs out.</li>
    <li> I basically like everything about this except that it is almost too creamy...I want to try their soap instead as those seem to work better for me.  That being said, I have Cade soap (Smells too girly) and Proraso Cream (Smells too medical) and this is by far my favorite.  It lathers and shaves well and the scent is perfect.</li>
    <li> Real nice jar .Great for travel.The wife loves the scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. If you shave your head, try this with a badger hair brush. Wow.</li>
    <li> This cream has an amazing scent and rich lather. Helps with a smooth, irritation free shave every time.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a strong smell based on the reviews but this is so strong it is literally sickening even after washing my face several times.  It would be a nice smell if it was toned down.  Only used once and it seems to lather nicely and make for a good shave but one star because the scent makes it unusable.</li>
    <li> Smells great, luxurious lather.</li>
    <li> One of the best creams available and for the price.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping. strong scented</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is the reason I switched from terrible cartridges to quality double edge and single edge razor shaves. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years and have never been disappointed when I get a new bowl in the mail. Along with great performance, the sandalwood scent is by far my favorite. It leaves me feeling as though I just sat up from a professional barber&#x27;s chair as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Do your face a favor and try this shave cream out if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> Lather is thick, smell is great! It might be pricier than Col. Conk&#x27;s glycerin stuff, but it&#x27;ll last me well through a year.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my first hard shaving soap ran out. I was a little worried at first because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect out of the creme, as I had only used generic hard shaving soap before. Well, its wonderful. The consistency is like frosting, and the container is larger than I expected, think... a medium sized grapefruit. Some people said the smell was too strong, but I found it just right. I think it lingers about the same as regular can stuff. I use it by swirling my shaving brush around on the cream, then whip up a lather in a separate bowl with a little bit of water in it. The whole process adds a minute or so to the daily routine, but it is worth every second. I was also worried about the price, but a little goes a long way. I think this will last me very long time, so it is probably not much worse than buying the can stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I am one of those gals who uses a double sided safety razor and this is pretty much the only shaving cream I like to use!&lt;br /&gt;It foams perfectly, smells wonderful and moisturizes well so your blade slides smooth and clean!</li>
    <li> Great shave cream. Unfortunately, reeks of colonialism.</li>
    <li> Smells great...lathers well with the badger brush I got my husband for Christmas. Definitely happy.</li>
    <li> Very nice lubrication and scent.</li>
    <li> I decided I wanted a change in my morning shaving lineup and went with TOBS Sandalwood. When I received the package I opened up the box and placed the jar on my coffee table. Later that evening my wife opened the jar and took a sniff without a comment. I noticed she did this about 4 to 5 times and I asked her what was wrong. She apologized and said she couldn&#x27;t help it because it smelled so good. That gains this product a star all on it&#x27;s own. The following morning I gave it a go and WOW.. seems like this stuff will lather if you just give it a piercing glare.. a full, rich, keep your brush upright in the bowl lather.. that earned it a second star. It took the smallest dab of cream to make plenty of lather so this should go quite a long way.. 3 stars. I found myself rubbing my face throughout that whole first day. My face felt very soft, supple and moisturized.. yep 4 stars. I found it improved my shave experience greatly. It stayed wet throughout my shave (The Proraso tends to sort of dry quickly and need a little more water incorporated into it by my third pass.).. 5 stars. The very pleasant scent does stay with you throughout the day. I only notice it when my body temp suddenly increases, but like I said it is very subtle and barely perceptible. I don&#x27;t use any scented aftershaves or colognes but I don&#x27;t think the cream would interfere with one should I chose to.  Quite pleased with this product and would definitely purchase again as well as try other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Happy Shaving everyone!</li>
    <li> have been using proraso shaving soap and liked it a lot, but this is perfection.  Smooth, smells great, gives me the best shave of anything i have ever used.  grab a tweezerman badger brush and enjoy</li>
    <li> Seems like it will last  along time, makes a great lather and doesn&#x27;t drip all over.  Great product (I use a brush to apply)</li>
    <li> Great product!  My husband loves this!  The sandlewood scent is very clean and handsome.  Leaves my husband&#x27;s face feeling smooth and fresh!</li>
    <li> Great Lather.  Only a small amount needed (will last forever).  I love the scent.  I am very sensitive to strong, perfurmey scents but I find this very pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Opened the container and was punched in the face with the very strong scent. Reminds me of Moth Balls. Not a fan of the scent and it lingers for a long time. Wife said she could smell it when I walked into the living room after i had shaved. It lathers up nice and a little goes a long way. It dries out really fast once on the face. It gave me a nice shave but left a white film all over everything. Had to wipe down my razor really good after use. Usually i just have to rinse it off. I hadn&#x27;t experienced problems with a film with previous hard soaps. Not sure if i received a bad batch. It ended up irritating my skin pretty bad. I will not be using this shaving cream again.</li>
    <li> Product has great lather, the scent is just not for me. But that&#x27;s just personal taste. Will try again with a different scent.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream. My wife loves it also. Lathers up real well for a close shave.</li>
    <li> ITEM SHOWED UP WITH THE LID UNSECURED AND OVER HALF THE PRODUCT LEAKED OUT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first shaving cream that I&#x27;ve purchased to use with a safety razor.  The aroma is manly, which I like.  I think I&#x27;ll try others to see if I can find another cream that will sooth the skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may be my own issue (skin) which you may not have that issue.  For the price, it&#x27;s worth the buying risk.</li>
    <li> I swear by this cream. I have recommended this cream to many friends who have gotten into the good old ways of shaving. Every single person has come back and thanked me for the recommendation.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream smells wonderful. My husband said its the best shaving cream he has ever used</li>
    <li> Smells incredible and works great!</li>
    <li> I must be in the minority here because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this, I think it&#x27;s a bit over-hyped IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells too spicy and almost dirty. It&#x27;s got a bad musk to it, I like my Sandalwood smelling a bit more sweet with a hint of spice. But this is the opposite, all spice with a hint of sweet. But some like it like that. But personally it&#x27;s almost old man-ish and not in the good way. Like a dirty old man. I prefer Mr.Taylor, that smells a bit more like the Sandalwood that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but just not my cup of tea on the scent side. Otherwise of course like most ToBS products this performs very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He really likes it. He says the texture is great and the smell is not overpowering. It does not irritate his skin.</li>
    <li> I mix a dash of face soap to the brush mug, dip my brush in the shaving cream, and get an amazing lather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving but this has gave me the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to make lather with a soft shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for about 50 years and started with shaving cream in a tube and a double edge  safety razor.  I was young and had sensitive skin.  Now that I am older I could not find the &amp;#34;Old Style&amp;#34; razors and shave cream.  I have seen some videos on the internet about how to shave the &amp;#34;Old Way&amp;#34;.  The new &amp;#34;old products&amp;#34; are much better than what I have been using and, in fact,  I enjoy shaving every morning.</li>
    <li> Pros:   Lathers very well.  Cons:  I like sandalwood, but \\&quot;ashtray\\&quot; is the perfect descriptor for this smell. It&#x27;s really heinous. It&#x27;s a little better on your face after shaving, but not pleasant during.  And for me personally, some ingredient causes an allergic reaction that makes the whole experience one of intense burning.   If neither of those are an issue for you, this might be a decent product.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of shaving soap for my first attempt at &#x27;real&#x27; shaving. It is stored nicely with a plastic gasket-like thing under the screw off lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it like a guessing game to find the right soap to water ratio to achieve a good lather because this doesn&#x27;t seem to be too thick of a soap, unless you go way heavy with the soap and light on the water. Also in between passes of the shaver I will completely rinse my face because if this soap dries it tends to make my razor glide less easily even with a fresh layer of soap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a clean face and a fresh layer of soap that is mixed well, I experience no razor burn and a very smooth and close shave. I have used this on thick hair and light stubble and it does equally well on both fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints would be the slightly tacky film this leaves after shaving regardless of how well I rinse and what seems like soap scum on my stainless razor and bowl, however it rinses out of the brush very well.</li>
    <li> Great creamy lather and feel. This could be my favorite judging by my repeat buying. Mild, pleasant smelling. Nothing off-putting or citrusy.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream smells awesome and lathers well.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> My first time using the cream I had a hard time mixing it right with water and the right amount.  Thankfully I learned from sharpologist that you need to wet the brush thoroughly.  I like to heat up the cup with hot water - oooo nice.  Then I swirl the brush once around on the surface of the cream.  Sharpologist says to get about an almond size of cream in the brush.  I didnt know what sandalwood smelled like before purchasing, but for those that dont know, this is exactly what you would expect an old 50&#x27;s barber shop experience to be like, smells and all.  The first day the smell lingered way too much, so I learned i had to wash my face pretty good after the shave. Now I love the smell.  I wish that I had a different smell to mix in with it though for variety.  I am going to buy this one and a lime or avocado smell to mix up the monotony a bit and I will absolutely be happy with both.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the shaver, stand, shave cream and brush!  The closest shave I&#x27;ve seen on him in 38 years.</li>
    <li> Love the way they lather and shave!  The smell is succulent and allows for a close easy shave.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this stuff, I was overwhelmed by the smell. It just seemed so strong and overpowering. But I have a slightly sensitive nose. After a few weeks I was very much used to it. I use this with a brush and it gives an excellent lather. You barely need any cream on your brush to work up a great lather. This is, without a doubt, the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used. Once I&#x27;m done with this tub, I&#x27;m going to try some of the other Taylor of Old Bond Street scents to see how they hold up as well. Because while I don&#x27;t mind the Sandalwood now, it&#x27;s not my favorite scent in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primarily based on recommendations for those with sensitive skin who often get razor burn when shaving. This stuff is excellent and definitely helps in those cases.</li>
    <li> a very nice lather, a little goes along way and the smell is strong but i like that about it.</li>
    <li> This sandalwood shaving cream smells wonderful and is very creamy and smooth to use.  It is in a nice container that keeps it fresh.  Feels good on the face and helps give a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream, rich and thick lather. The scent is not overpowering, and it smells great. It&#x27;s in my shaving rotation, along with Proraso and castle forbes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about a year now, using a Van Der Hagen luxury soap puck. This was my first attempt at a shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The scent of this stuff is amazing. Very manly. Strong enough to smell for a couple hours after your shave, but not obnoxiously scented. Very manly scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I put a tiny dollop about the size of my pinky nail into a bowl and started to lather it. In about 1-2 minutes I had an entire bowl of quality lather the likes of which I&#x27;ve never witnessed. This tub will last a long time, and provides a fantastic lather each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. When using it for the shave, I experienced the least amount of irritation of any shave I&#x27;ve done. There was no irritation going with the grain, across the grain, and across the opposite direction. I decided to go for the dreaded straight against the grain shave, and was able to do it with only minimal discomfort. That pass has always been pretty wicked for me, and is one I&#x27;d only do once a week with a shave soap. Since using this product, I go against the grain 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to anyone who prefers this style of shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a relative newcomer to wet shaving, been doing it for about 2-3 months now. Canned shaving cream is terrible, every wet shaver will tell you that. But what about the multitude of choices for soaps, creams and those in between?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve tried the Proraso White in a soft soap, the Proraso Green in a tube, and TOBS cream. TOBS cream is so much better in quality, scent and lather. The TOBS lathers so much faster and thicker than the other options, it also feels more slick on my face as well. The packaging is also nice as the bowl it comes in screws on tightly (the Proraso white soap bowl just snaps on lightly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this one. The cost is low and it&#x27;s really luxurious. I&#x27;ll be trying some of the other TOBS scents in the future.</li>
    <li> Received my order a week or so ago now, and this is probably the best stuff I&#x27;ve used.  The sandalwood scent is quite pleasing, neither too subtle nor overwhelming, and when a brush is used, this lathers up VERY well.  I actually use the lid of the jar to lather up.  I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any, looking in the jar - a single jar ought to last me a very long time, I&#x27;d think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I started using a Safety Razor just over a year ago ([[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]). I loved the weight and the feel. I started with a boar hair brush from the local Wal-Mart. It just didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;right\\&quot;.    I also was using the $1.00/package safety razors in my grocery aisle, results were horrible!! I thought maybe it was my learning curve since all my research and the testimonials stated this was THE way to shave, especially if you have sensitive skin (like me).     So, I got a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] (Badger Hair)...WOW what a difference!!! At the same time I splurged for the [[ASIN:B002OXPYWA 100 Double Edge Shark Super Stainless Razor Blades]] here on Amazon after some research.    Well, I thought my world was going to change now that I had all the right equipment...it didn&#x27;t.... :(    I was still using the crappy shave soap from the shave aisle in the grocery ([[ASIN:B000WNCD32 Williams mug shaving soap - 1.7 oz]]), I felt like I was ripping my skin still....shaving was still not the joy I kept hearing about...    A couple weeks ago I ordered this product....THAT WAS IT!!! It wasn&#x27;t just ONE of the elements..it was ALL the elements!!! This shave cream is FANTASTIC!!! I have NEVER had a more enjoyable shave...EVER (been shaving for 25 years now).     This cream, the brush, the blades and the razor all worked together in harmony to give my thick black stubble a mowing!! I felt as if my razor was a knife gliding across butter across my face...just beautiful!!! The scent is very nice as well! Reminds me of my barber shop or my Dad.     I have NEVER written a review before for any of the numerous products I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon...I did now...that&#x27;s how great an experience I had!!</li>
    <li> Guys, this is a great shaving cream.  I decided to start wet shaving last November after trying an electric (Braun) and hating it.  I&#x27;m 31 years old and have been shaving since about 9th grade (yes, you may call me Teen Wolf).  I always hated shaving.  Always.  Until now.    I still have about a quarter of this can left after 10 months of use, and I think I use too much per shave.  I smells a bit strong, but that goes away quickly after rinsing and apply aftershave.    I have decided to try a different flavor (Truefitt &amp; Hill), but will definitely come back to this in the future.      One last thing, the girlfriend still comments on how good it smells while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers up really well and lasts a long time because a little goes a long way. Kind of expensive, but I will buy more will buy more. My wife loves the smell!</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well.</li>
    <li> Smells to soapy for me so I don&#x27;t Even want put it on my skin. :(</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Love the light, pleasant aroma. Lathers very nicely with just a small dab. Well worth the price for a qaulity shave.</li>
    <li> It works very well and has a very nice low key aroma - that my wife likes- and no one else seems to notice  This has become my everyday shave cream</li>
    <li> I wanted to be able to say I like this shaving cream but I just can&#x27;t do it.  The scent is over powering I&#x27;d compare it to having a swarm of old ladies glued to your face with no way to remove them. The shave with this product is middle of the road but the cream quickly loses its slickness and becomes tacky.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product based on my experience.  I shave both my head and face daily so I get to experiment with alot of products</li>
    <li> this product is very easy to use and it lathers up very rich and fast. smells wonderful and glides perfectly.I&#x27;ve tried a few others and this one goes un matched. a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this after reading all the reviews, however, I was disappointed. The scent was just too strong for me!  Maybe I just don&#x27;t like sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Almost no effort required to get a great lather and the sandalwood scent is fantastic. Makes shaving an absolute joy. Don&#x27;t hesitate with this one.</li>
    <li> Good shave quality - I use it to shave my head. However, the fragrance is NOT sandalwood. I am quite sure as I have sandalwood oils, sandalwood incense, fresheners in the house and this is not even close. It&#x27;s mostly cedar and some other notes.</li>
    <li> Very good shaving cream. You will need to test the water to cream ration, but this thing will last a while!</li>
    <li> The scent is a little strong but lathers up very well.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this product it worked great and I fell in love with the scent.  I just received my repeat purchase and it smelled awful and had a completely different consistency.  Not sure if this is from the manufacturer or if it was expired at the retailer.  Either way, I am returning the product, but willing to try again given that I enjoyed my first product so much.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell, very manly! Lathers up well. Exactly what I needed for a good shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... needed more words for the review. Thanks Amazon for making me write an unnecessarily long review. Maybe I can just say what I need to briefly, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t think so. So verbose it is!</li>
    <li> Great lather, easy to work with and seems to love the badger brush as much as my face loves having its easy lather applied. been shaving with this cream for about one month, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have used even 1/4 of it</li>
    <li> Im a newbie to the shaving world and after much research and reviews from old school shavers, I was told this was one of the best companies in town. The product shipped fast and I only had to put a little dab on my badger brush to be able to get a nice thick lather. So though it might seem expensive, getting the most out a little dab is well worth it. Another thing to keep in mind is that before you brush on the cream you should oil your face up to get a smoother shave. When you are done, wash your face with cold water and use an Alum stone to close up any nicks (I used osma which works great!)</li>
    <li> Great creamy soap. Good lather, nice lubrication and a pleasant smell. One of my preferred soaps.</li>
    <li> great foaming and a classic smell</li>
    <li> Im a barber and I choose this product for use on my clients for the straight razor shave service . The scent is great but performance is better, allows you to go against the grain w ease and leaves the skin very moisturized. I defiantly recommend</li>
    <li> Fantastic product gives a nice close shave and smells like an old time barber shop. It was delivered fast and packaged properly. I will be buying this regularly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care about the odor, but I just tried this for the first time, and it was terrific!  Went on smooth, and gave me the smoothest shave with a safety razor i have ever had.  Did not require hot water to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want to get into safety razors for whatever reason - environment, sensitive skin, economy - this is the shaving cream to use!</li>
    <li> I recently changed to an old fashioned \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; from Merkur that I found here on Amazon and decided to try this Taylor shave cream.  It is very rich and provides excellent protection for your face.  I have a heavy beard with sensitive skin and this cream gives me a good close shave with no nicks or cuts...as long as I don&#x27;t rush through the process.  The cream has a nice clean scent but is not overpowering and makes shaving a pleasure.  Say good-bye the highway robbery of the modern cartridge shavers!  I bought a whole year&#x27;s worth of blades for my Merkur for less than the price of a 12-pack of Mach III&#x27;s and with this shave cream...you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> A great classic smell that makes shaving truly enjoyable, almost aroma-therapeutic.  Very little cream is needed for each shave&#x27;s lather, so this container will last a while.  Once you&#x27;ve optimized the amount of water to shaving cream ratio, you&#x27;ll find that you get a wonderful and un-irritated shave.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to DE Shaving but immersed myself into researching and comparing different products. After reading the reviews for Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood  Shaving Cream, I decided to give it a try although I was happy with the Art Of Shaving Cream which I was using. Here is the set of products which I used for this particular comparison:  Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream  Perfecto Long Handled Safety Razor Apollo Stainless Steel Shaving Mug Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blade Art Of Shaving Pre-Shave Oil Jerdon JP7506N 8-Inch Wall Mount Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification Art of Shaving Aftershave Balm  A small amount of warm water in the shaving mug and just a dab of Taylor of Old Bond on my brush produced a surprisingly large amount of lather, much more than the Art Of Shaving Cream would. However, the Taylor lather was  more &amp;#34;foamy, soapy&amp;#34; and not as creamy smooth as the AOS Shaving cream lather.  To begin the shaving process, I applied a generous amount of AOS Pre-Shave oil to my scalp and neck. When applied to my head and neck using the Escali brush, the Taylor lather felt soothing on my scalp and with the Feather razor, I obtained an incredibly smooth shave. I had to reapply lather to some areas and make several passes to get some spots which I missed with the Feather razor but the shaving experience was a very pleasurable one and not a chore. The lather stayed moist in the shaving bowl throughout the entire shave and I added a few additional drops of water to replenish the lather.  Incidentally, I choose to shave at the bathroom sink rather than in the shower. I cannot visualize shaving in the the shower as I use my main bathroom mirror together with the Jerdon mirror to see  the back of my head and  use the 5X feature to see my neck area close up. The Sandalwood scent of the Taylor cream is much stronger than that of  the Art Of Shaving and I do prefer the milderscent AOS cream. Since I shower AFTER shaving, the stronger scent is not much of an issue. I finished off with an application of AOS Aftershave balm to calm my scalp. I found that the Taylor is not as creamy as the AOS and while I achieved a smooth shave with the Taylor, I personally prefer to use the AOS Shaving cream. I will continue to use the Taylor but again, AOS Cream trumps Taylor&#x27;s. A good product, just not as good as the Art of Shaving Cream.</li>
    <li> It smells great, works up a good lather and helps avoid irritation. Definitely would recommend it. Also comes in a nice size, about double what some other brands I&#x27;ve used give you. Lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> First I wash my face with Kirks:  http://www.amazon.com/Kirks-Natural-Castile-Original-Ounce/dp/B001D4YDKU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436396335&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;kirks+castile+soap that I buy at my local market.&lt;br /&gt;Then use the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.&lt;br /&gt;A pleasure.  Used to use Prorasso.  Good stuff!  I know you can shave after only washing your face with Kirks but...I tend to like the Taylor as an addition.  This soap whips up a greater, thicker lather than the.  I&#x27;ll be using this for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the premium cost in my book.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells amazing! And it gives you that old school feel and way of doing things if your into that kinda thing. But even if not, your in for a great shave. Hard to really put it all into words. Try this stuff!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband &amp; he is delighted. Exceeds all expectations. He is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is especially nice after a shave and you only need such a small amount for an abundant lather.</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving this 2 stars because it&#x27;s certainly superior to canned foams.  But I was rather disappointed with this after having tried the TOBS Coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, as others note, the smell is very artificial.  People describe the smell as &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m confounded as to how &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; somehow became correlated with cheap chemical fragrance.  My spouse didn&#x27;t like it and neither did I. To be fair, their coconut is clearly artificially fragranced as well, but it&#x27;s one note: coconut.  This, on the other hand is just sort of a mishmash of synthetic, mostly antiseptic odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up as well as the coconut. (And no where near as well as Trumper Coconut)  I felt like I have to get use more on the brush to kick up enough good lather for three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, better than canned but I&#x27;d recommend going with the Coconut or better yet, the Trumper Coconut (which has a much manlier, not exclusively coconutty smell, IMO.)</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit worried about this, as the &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; smell is overpowering and a bit off putting at first compared to the more mellow and in my opinion refined smell of the Art of Shaving sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was all lathered up with it though overpowering it was not as off putting as I first expected.  The shave was just as good as I remembered with the AoS product and at the lower price point I was very happy.  Once I was finished and rinsed off the overpowering smell mellowed out substantially and with a bit of after shave proved to be quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get over the initial shock of how artificial this cream smells it is a worthwhile choice for your morning routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for no other reason than to begin my transition to DE safety razor shaving. The fact that I had read somewhere that it could contribute to re-creating the smells of an old-fashioned barber shop played no small role in my selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use of this shaving cream was my first safety razor shave since the first, and until now, only time I tried to use a safety razor 14 years ago. That was an experience that I dearly wish I could forget and don’t understand why I have not repressed that memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, a series of events have occurred lately that led me to try and overcome my fear and I have to tell you that as a first time DE shaver, I absolutely love this shaving cream!  Oh, sure, there may be better products out there but I found this to be creamy, smooth and, along with a bit of pre-shave oil, an incredibly close and comfortable shave. The scent is terrific! I enjoy it as I shave and it mixes perfectly with my other acquisitions for my “Barber Shop” atmosphere at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are interested, those other acquisitions were:&lt;br /&gt;Pinaud Clubman aftershave and their talcum powder,&lt;br /&gt;A bar of bay rum soap and,&lt;br /&gt;(yes, I did it) a mid-size glass Barbicide jar for disinfecting my razor before or after use. (I am prone to irritation and this seems to lessen that significantly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have recently started down this road, I am looking forward to trying other Taylor of Old Bond Street products as well as others.</li>
    <li> I saw this cream recommended on a shaving instruction video and I thought I would give it a try.  I have a tough beard and the cream really made shaving with my DE razor a breeze.  I find it only takes a little bit on my brush to get a nice lasting lather built.  The fragrance is subtle and does not overpower you.</li>
    <li> Was never able to get a good lather from the tub I received. Still smells fantastic, just with the lather was better.</li>
    <li> Want to feel like you&#x27;re at the beach sitting next to John F. Kennedy drinking a Scotch and smoking a cigar? Buy this cream. It not only feels like heaven as you lather it all over but it smells great too. And if you&#x27;re like me and saw &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; and thought, &amp;#34;ain&#x27;t no way I&#x27;m creaming my face!&amp;#34; Well, brother, do yourself a favor and cream it up. Once I did I couldn&#x27;t believe I had been without it for all these years. Cream for life.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this soap, probably one of the best smelling shave soaps there are. One thing i do dislike, however, is that it feels like it dries my face much more quickly than proraso, and often times this results in a shave that is not so great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different, and took me a while to really appreciate it. But after a few months of use, and half a tub, I&#x27;m ordering more. I love how it smells, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it what so ever. Took a bit to get the ratio of water to soap just right for the perfect lather...just experiment, you&#x27;ll find what works for you.</li>
    <li> privides a very nice and smooth shave, leaves you feeling fresh with a great scent for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to traditional shaving and have found this product to be outstanding thus far. It smells very nice and lathers great.</li>
    <li> Not quite the level of Trumpers but still is a fine product.  Nice scents and rich lather make shaving less of a chore.  Note:  a shaving brush must be used to prepare and apply.  Applying by hand will not produce the same results.  A good brush will last a lifetime with proper care. In order: silver tipped badger, best badger, badger, boar...</li>
    <li> I like to use a product for a while before I leave a review. Kinda forgot but two years is a solid test time. This bowl lasted me just over two years and I have to remain clean shaven for work so I shave a couple times a week. It doesn&#x27;t take much on the badger hair brush to get a nice lather. Feels and smeels good. Not girly smell. My wife loves the way it smells on me also.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he enjoys the thick creamy lather.  I enjoy the scent as he is shaving.  This is my husband&#x27;s new favorite shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream as a gift for my dad. It arrived promptly and he loves it. My mom does too, sandalwood is her favorite scent.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product.  It&#x27;s creamy, makes loads of lather from just a dab on the brush, and lasts for a long time.  I use this product regularly now.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with amazing lather, the only reason I knocked a star off is because the scent isn&#x27;t strong at all. Some people may prefer this, but I expected to smell a little something. Nonetheless, amazing product.</li>
    <li> This cream gives an excellent shave. It is very slick and the razor glides nicely over it. It lathers quickly and easily. The scent however is not to my liking. It does not smell bad, but to me it smells like old Avon soaps. I use the \\&quot;Mr. Taylor&#x27;s\\&quot; scent of this brand of shaving cream. The shave is slightly better than the sandalwood and the scent is an excellent low-tone cedar/musk/spice scent.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading on the reviews. I found that this product has NO Sandalwood scent. Even had a few other people smell it as well as smell me after I used it. It has a very strong soapy like fragrance that lingered for a long time. I could not really take the smell on my face after a while.  It does whip up a good lather and it did not dissipate as other shaving soaps did after you lather up your face. So that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the while shaving my hand holding the razer became slippery and it was hard to grip the razor to continue shaving. I had to always rinse off the handle every few swipes to gain grip again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not buy this again, but I will use it up since it was expensive. i will just had to wash off the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; that this soap has.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after using Proraso for the last year and, while I liked Proraso, I wanted to try something new. I&#x27;m glad I did. First, the scent is light and appealing. Second the lather is full and think and provides a smooth shave. Last, the cleanup is actually easier than Proraso. I used to have to rinse my brush for several long minutes to try and get the residual lather and cream out of it with Proraso. With Taylor of Old Bond Street, my brush rinsed clean in half the time. I figure if it rinses from the brush easier, than it must rinse from my face easier leaving less residue and poor-blockage. The sensation on my face is also different. To go from the cold (and it can be referred to as refreshing) menthol feel of Proraso, to this warm-buttery feeling on my face of this Sandalwood lather was a big seller for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set-up: I use a tongue depressor (Popsicle-stick if you like) and extract a small, almond-size scoop of cream from the bowl and place it in a water-warmed mug. I then take my warmed and wet badger bristle brush and begin to agitate the cream into a lather. Sometimes I have to add a bit of water to help achieve a good wet, thick lather. After Applying this warm lather to my moistened face I start hacking away (kidding). I used a single blade razor for about 6 months, but after trying a wet shave with the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor, I found the multiblade razor actually felt better for me. I know that is the opposite for some, but for me it is what works best. I actually enjoy shaving and find it a zen time for me to relax and listen to some good music or a podcast as I shave.[[ASIN:B003983HZK Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge, 8-count Package]]</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, it lather very well and makes for a very comfortable shave. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby and I am soooo glad.  This smells so amazing on him.  It helps him get a super close shave with no irritation.  Ever.  A small dab covers as well as a palmful of canister shaving cream, but works 10 times better.</li>
    <li> This is not a &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; soap.  It is a thick cream.  So it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the harder soaps.  But it produces good, thick lather.  Nicely subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Great smell, clean shave</li>
    <li> Unbelievable, great scent, lathers with a very small amount, 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,, best shaving experience,</li>
    <li> works great smells great</li>
    <li> Taylors is the best.  I love it.</li>
    <li> First real (non aerosol) shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  With my Kent BK4, I&#x27;m able to build a thick and hydrating lather.  I notice considerably less irritation vs aerosol offerings and I will never use them outside of travelling.</li>
    <li> Smells great, easy to use for a shaving brush novice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving cream for my husband.  He likes it very much and says that the cream is rich and gives him a comfortable shave.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Makes LOTS of lather and that marvelous sandalwood scent!  Remember the &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; is to add more WATER to the brush to work up the lather -- not more shaving cream.  So a little cream goes a long, LONG way.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Smells awesome, feels great, and has a natural cooling effect post-shave!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and creamy consistency of this product.  When I apply it, it spreads very nicely and allows me to shave very easily.  It seems to have a build in lubricant that helps provide a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on the brand and will try other scents from Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> I am glad I found this.  Great shaves, great smell, great skin.</li>
    <li> TOBS is one of the top makers of shaving soaps/creams. The sandalwood is one of the first I bought and it&#x27;s a permanent fixture in my rotation. I have about 20-30 that I use and this is one that I come back to frequently. A small amount, about the size of an almond, makes a huge amount of thick, creamy lather. It&#x27;s paraben free, if that&#x27;s important and leaves a light smell of the sandalwood behind. If you want to try wet-shaving with a real razor, this is the cream for you! Plus if you don&#x27;t like it, there&#x27;s always someone looking to buy it on websites like Badger and Blade.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for those new to the art of the brush. Much more forgiving lather than a harder cream, which is to say it is easier to get a good lather consistency which is thin enough to lubricate, and thick enough to protect your skin from the blade. Smell is nice, not at all overpowering, and only lingers for 20-30 minutes after shaving. The only dock on this item is the consistency. It is sticky. Think toothpaste. A tiny dab will do ya, but a tiny dab is hard to get. This results in going through the product too quickly. A tub of Proraso lasts me 1 year. That is shaving every other day, rain or shine. Looks like this product is going to last me about 5 months (though it isn&#x27;t gone yet, so I can&#x27;t be sure). Maybe that subtracts from the overall value a bit, maybe it is insignificant...Great product, someday I might buy it again, but for now, I want to try something else.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Makes a nice lather. My girlfriend can&#x27;t keep her hands off me she loves the smell so much. Very masculine.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant fragrance and amazing lather.  Much better lather than I have found with other products including \\&quot;Art of Shave.\\&quot; Gives me a great shave, I love everything about this.  The tub is a bit larger than competitors and not particularly handy for travel.  Otherwise, A+!</li>
    <li> For a long time I have been looking for a shaving cream that smells like the one my Dad used and this is it!  The scent smells great and is very strong, leaving a scent on your skin after you use it that lasts quite a while (but in a good way). It is reminiscent of Rise shaving cream (which is the one my Dad used) but with a more potent aroma. The shave is smooth and silky and it lathers up your brush perfectly. The package arrived quickly and before the due date.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Just got my Taylor Of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream. First, I&#x27;d like to say that the smell was not as strong as previously noted by a lot of reviews. Just to test the shaving cream out I lathered a small amount on my hands and then rinsed it off. The smell left behind is no stronger than my Proraso Sandalwood shaving cream. I also want to point out that this TOBS shaving cream smells nothing like sandalwood, to me anyways. The scent is kind of hard to narrow down, but if I had to narrow it down I would say it smells like an old school barbershop with a soapy finish. The scent is not bad, but not my favorite. As of right now I prefer the scent of the Proraso Sandalwood. *Will update once I shave with TOBS.*</li>
    <li> This shaving soap is so thick and rich.  It improved my shaving experience and I now shave as soon as I see stubble growing just too feel that lather and smell that sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving cream! Lathers up quickly to a thick, rich creamy lather. Im a slow shaver and it hasn&#x27;t dried out on my face yet! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the tub I recieved wasn&#x27;t full. It looked like somebody took s tablespoon and scooped out some before it was shipped.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! Great shave results.</li>
    <li> I have been DE shaving for quite a while now. Have used innumerable products since then, shaving creams and soaps. This was my first Taylor purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is spicy sandalwood, I didn&#x27;t find it synthetic at all. Nice and not over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t swirl my brush in a cream tub, I prefer to scoop some out with my index finger. I used about 3 fingertip&#x27;s worth of cream, dabbed it on my badger brush. With about a tsp of water in the shave bowl, went to work. The cream immediately made a thick creamy layer which upon adding a bit more water, exploded into very well hydrated lather. One note here, I could have used a bit less cream since it lathers so well. The cream is a bit water hungry so keep adding a few drops of water to the bowl until the desired lather consistency is achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin but experienced absolutely no irritation or burning sensation when I applied the lather to my face. The cream provided excellent cushion and glide for the DE razor. The lather had good longevity and retained water and form well through the four passes and provided a great and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product at an excellent price. I highly recommend it to serious and beginner classic shavers.</li>
    <li> Great scent, smooth shaves, and long lasting. A little dab forms a nice lather with a brush or just in your palm. Works great with straight, double, and even cartridge razors. Leaves a nice subtle scent afterwords. Makes shaving more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Maybe mine was melted a bit?  I loved the smell and the novelty of using this with my new DE safety razor.  Then I tried the Avocado and it (only somewhat) diminished my enthusiasm for this scent.  Still good stuff tho!</li>
    <li> Whips up a rally nice rich thick cream, especially since I bought a shaving bowl. The smell is great, I love it.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff. Great Smell, great lather.</li>
    <li> great soap. Gives a great shave and truly adds to that man factor. In case you fellas were wondering most chicks find it a huge turn on when a guy whips his soap into a lather and shaves with a straight or safety razor. Not the reason why i got it but a great perk.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because I heard that it worked well and smelled wonderful. My husband&#x27;s face feels so silky and smells so sexy! Ahh...I love this scent.</li>
    <li> This product is the best shaving cream you can get. One container last almost one year. Great produce. Thank You, Bob</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, this is an excellent product. A penny size drop in a lathering bowl, a couple of swirls with a shaving brush gives you a thick rich lather that helps the razor glide over your face. You get a great shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> A new scent for my husband. We both love it. Clean, masculine and not over-powering.</li>
    <li> This is on strong smelling shaving cream. After shaving I feel like a 90 year old British army officer who just stepped out of &#x27;Gandhi&#x27; for hours afterward. If you&#x27;re looking for a subtle scent, this one to avoid (I suggest Coconut instead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is pretty good but not the best I&#x27;ve had. For whatever reason, my razor glides more smoothly with the Coconut shaving cream instead of Sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of reviews have said, the scent is really strong. I was a bit taken back when I first used it, and didn&#x27;t like how over-powering it was. But it only took a few days to get used to it, and now I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t remain over-powering after the shave, and it foams really well, just as good as the $30 stuff you can buy. Definitely found a winner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I ever bothered with that over the counter stuff they call shave cream. Just two uses of this with a straight razor and my shaves have never been the same (coming from a veteran Marine). Razor bumps gone, Ingrown hairs gone, neck finally cleared up after years of fighting. No razor burn, No issues. Best shave I have ever had. Honostly that other stuff shouldn&#x27;t be called shave cream. This will also make your bathroom smell like a barber shop! My wife loves it. Says it smells like a &amp;#34;Gentleman&amp;#34;. Hands down guys get this with a badger brush, you wont regret it! BTW lasts so much longer than normal shave cream does. Months longer...</li>
    <li> Great strong manly smell.  I love it every morning and can&#x27;t wait for the next shave.  THis is a must for the new Safety Razor person</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes it easy for a new guy to shave with a DE razor and leaves your face smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> First use of this shaving cream and new convert to DE shaving. I am using an Escali brush and Edwin Jagger razor. The odor of this cream is classic barber shop all the way. If you want metro blah blah blah there is something out there for you too. I stick with what has been proven to work. Rich lather and smooth shave. I will soon be trying Tabac and Wool Fat as well. Looking forward to my next shave, and snubbing my nose at cartridge shaving companies viscous cycle of bad shaves and expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a few months of using this product I want to paint it on everything. The smell is so enjoyable.  The lather is thick and silky like whipped cream. I can perform a 4 pass shave with just a dab. Yes 4 passes! Each one as smooth and enjoyable as the last. And it is very rare that I experience a nick. Never have I had a razor burn. I would like to find another product that could challenge this shaving cream. Maybe some could equal it but none could beat it. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband to oh with his shaving set.  Very nice scent. Lathers well, for a close shave!  He loves it will buy more!</li>
    <li> One of my personal favorites.  The scent gets the wife aroused, so what more could I ask for...</li>
    <li> Great shave.  A little to fragrant for me though.</li>
    <li> I was using Art of Shaving Sandalwood, and I was quite satisfied - rich lather, rinsed well, provided very good lubrication, nice scent (though a little strong). But, I wanted to see what else was out there. Enter Taylor Old Bond Street Sandalwood. Either I got a bad one (in which case, QC is a problem), or it&#x27;s just not as good as AoS. Though it lathers up nicely, it seems to go on the face much thinner (yes, I&#x27;ve tried different amounts of water), and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as AoS, requiring me to re-lather a few times, where with AoS, it&#x27;s not needed. It rinses well - almost too well, leaving the skin a little on the dry side, leaving no moisturizer behind. I feel AoS leaves my skin a little smoother after rinsing. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just not sandalwood as I know it. To my nose, it&#x27;s almost identical in scent to Ivory bar soap. Not that that&#x27;s bad, but it&#x27;s not sandalwood. Your mileage may vary .... Next stop - Proraso Sandalwood</li>
    <li> This is a great product in a great price point. After trying out multiple shaving creams with my safety razor, this is definitely my favorite. The scent is a bit strong while shaving, however after a quick rinse it smells great. I have had trouble in the past with razor burn from other products. With Taylor of Old Bond Street, shave is smooth and feels great on my skin. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent</li>
    <li> A little bit will go a long long ways. The scent is good and not overpowering. Wife likes the smell and so do my kids. Much better than any canned chemical shaving cream. I used to fear shaving with a disposable since it tore my face up pretty bad and the shaving cream in a can caused some dermatological issues for me. SInce switching to DE shaving and Taylor of Old Bond Street I dont have the problems that i did was the canned chemicals and it is much smoother of a shave. I look forward to shaving now.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. No need for cologne.</li>
    <li> smells like old fashioned barber shop cream, smoothest lather i&#x27;ve ever felt, and leaves no razor burn. if you have a 3-or-fewer-blade razor, don&#x27;t hesitate to get this cream.</li>
    <li> I am female and therefore do not shave my face :) however I want to tell you how lovely this shave cream smells on my Hubby. This cream has a sophisticated subtle scent which is hands down 10 times more sexy than any of those you find at the common grocery. Also, his face feels smooth, soft and clean. Great gift for your man and yourself.</li>
    <li> It arrived upside down and had leaked out onto the papers within the box.  It&#x27;s true that the fragrance is quite powerful, however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some people say... once I&#x27;m out of the shower I (and my wife) can hardly smell it.  It foams up well using my badger hair brush and keeps a good lather.   The shave is smooth (no smoother than the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; stuff I was using before) enough and keeps the bumps away so I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> I have never used a shaving cream or gel from an aerosol can that lets me shave as closely as this does. It makes a creamy, smooth, even lather very quickly with a decent brush. It smells great. Only tip: if the delivery of it is on your doorstep when you get home from work and it&#x27;s 100 degrees out, be careful opening it...it may be a little runny until it cools down to room temperature.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Highly satisfied with the scent, texture, and rich quality of lather.  I would highly recommend this product to any man looking to improve his shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The smell is fantastic. Dont even put aftershave on when I am finished just so I can enjoy the smell for a few more hours. The shave itself is pretty good too.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream for the price. I am no wet shaving expert but this is the first time that I did not cut myself and this cream has a great fragrance.  Goes well with a \\&quot;Tweezerman badger brush\\&quot; and \\&quot;Merkur razor\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. good smell and takes very little on the brush to create a rich lather. should last me a long while</li>
    <li> This shaving cream has a nice smell but it is not overwhelming but pleasant. Reminds me of an old fashioned barber shop. It lathers well with just a small amount.</li>
    <li> Got this along with several other manly items for my honey as stocking stuffers and it was a huge hit. Also got a shaving brush so between the two, it lathers really nicely (and smells good).</li>
    <li> I stopped using shaving cream in a can and started using this brand of shave cream about a year ago. I had a glycerin type of shave cream and it was okay, but after shaving with Taylor of Old Bond Street, you will never go back to glycerin based shave cream or that stuff in a can. The fragrance of this shave cream is mild and reminiscent of getting a barber shave and that associated fragrance. The lather is great and best performed on the brush and not in the soap. The soap is actually a cream and once on your face and using the brush, you can make quite a lather in no time at all and it stays that way until you are done shaving. The razor will glide over your face like that stuff in a can will never let you do. This shaving cream is great!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and smooth texture!</li>
    <li> Smells good, but there are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good and my husband loves the shave he gets when using it. Will def buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use with the Merkur safety razor and it&#x27;s incredible! I love how it smells after he shaves and I can&#x27;t stop kissing him!</li>
    <li> What can I say . . it is my favorite!!</li>
    <li> Is far better than expected.  Gives really good lather and an excellent shave! I have not used Shaving Cream that much, was really surprised.  I am a soap and brush single edge razor man.  But this leaves my face feeling cool and soothing after an excellent shave!  Highly recommend this product!  Try it you will like it.  Beats foam in a can lather hands down and is neck and neck with my soap in a cup.  Old habits die hard!  but this may be a game changer for me! Really like the cream.</li>
    <li> I love it.. great aroma and smooth feel after using.. wonderful thick and rich lather  I would recommend this one of the best.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second container of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood. It lathers like crazy - just touch the tip of your wet shaving brush to it and you will pick up more than enough product for a luxurious shave. I get a closer but nick-free shave with this product - my best shave ever. It costs a bit more but you absolutely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my BF for Christmas along with the Escali Badger brush! He has a very heavy beard, and he says it works like a dream, plus it smells divine! We both love the results! This was a perfect choice!! I&#x27;m getting the TOBS Sandlewood After Shave for Valentines day!! Shhhh ;))</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. He loves shaving and this was perfect for him</li>
    <li> It lathers just about as well as any other shaving cream. Really strong perfume smell, almost overbearing; next time I&#x27;ll go with the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; sandalwood cream - lathers my face just as well and has a much more mild scent.</li>
    <li> incredible scent and excellent shave. use on face and scalp every day!</li>
    <li> Classic scent, the best can of shaving soap on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the first time trying this product..saw on Amazon that it was # best seller so I bought it. I really like it. It smells good.. Old school kind of smell but really good. Use small amount on my badger and I&#x27;m good for like two-three lather depends how much but you don&#x27;t have to drench the brush with this lather to get a thick amount. Great product..</li>
    <li> Two things that I dislike about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1) Price: You have to admit the price is a little on the high end side. I recently switched to wet shaving so enough with the Gillette foam w/ aloe vera nonsense. I decided to try the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; stuff, but the price is a little ehhh.&lt;br /&gt;2) Amount: Upon opening the product it seemed as if some of the cream is missing. It might just be like that, and if it is then I don&#x27;t know why they cannot make the tub smaller. It is misleading, but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;About the actual product, its really good. Like I previously stated I used to use the can foam, but decided to try something new. In all honesty, there is a huge difference. The quality and texture is great. The smell is average. All you need is a small amount on a badger brush, add a bit of water and make a rich lather and you are set.</li>
    <li> Did not like the scent</li>
    <li> Smells great, easy to lather, and makes shaving very smooth.  I definitely recommend this product especially for people who face lather.</li>
    <li> It takes much less to get a good lather than you&#x27;d expect. I normally use hard soaps, but I have the TOBS Sandalwood Aftershave Gel that I like, and I got this to complement it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is what I expected, although my wife calls it &amp;#34;old man smell&amp;#34;. Lathers good (boar brush), shaves good. Not sure what else I could say. I know that I have several artisan hard soaps collecting dust now....</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the shave.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and is fairly thick. This is a quality shaving cream at a budget price. It smells pretty nice too and is easy on my face with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream also works up a nice lather and compares favorably with far more expensive creams.</li>
    <li> Great scent and lather. One of my favorites. Especially like plastic container for travel.</li>
    <li> Great product even though I have nothing to really compare it to except for shaving cream out of a can which isn&#x27;t a true comparison. I have no clue the proper way of using product but put a few drops of water in the wooden bowl, dab my brush in the shaving cream, and lather everything together in the bowl. Very nice product. Doesn&#x27;t disappear if you let it sit on your face for a few minutes. The smell is great and has really grown on my girlfriend. It&#x27;s a shame that I usually shower right after shaving because I like the scent that much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this one</li>
    <li> I have tried between the proraso and the art of shaving and this is my favorite thus far. So glad I gave this a try. Anyone who is starting out wet shaving should def get this as one of your starters. Great Buy!!</li>
    <li> Great product, lathers well, smells great.  But, my only negative and for rating 1 star less, is the product takes a lot of work to be washed off your razor.  I usually fill the sink with hot water (as to not waste water and of course, my electric and water heater) and after every shave rinse my razor off in the water.  I had to use a tissue to wipe off the extra that did not wash away in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my only negative, other than this, awesome product.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPMENT OF ITEM AS DESCRIBED-----GREAT MANLY SMELL AND GREAT TEXTURE FOR SHAVING&lt;br /&gt;BEEN USING VARIOUS SHAVING CREAMS VIA BRUSH FOR OVER 50 YEARS</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I had previously used only locally available shaving soaps.  This cream lathers up with only a little on the brush and along with the new brush gives excellent shave.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream I have mixed feelings about. It is supposed to be &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; and fun to use and pamper yourself. Instead it just out being a big pain in the butt. Here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the cream comes in a pretty much non-diluted state. It is more like a thick paste or cream. Almost pomade like. Obviously the correct method is to use a dollup (nickel size) and mix it with an already moist shaving brush and mix until you get the right consistency while adding very slight amounts of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it is very difficult to get the correct lather, and by the time I could have gotten a good lather going, I could have shaved already. Sometimes I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to waste on shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the smell is just too much. If you&#x27;re using scented aftershave to boot then good luck - you are going to walk into work smelling your grandpa before an Elk&#x27;s pinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the stuff is just too time consuming and the overwhelming scent (which is good mind you) becomes too much. At the end of the day, I just use Crew Precision Shave Gel which goes on easier, lubricates better, and smells batter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be biased as I&#x27;m more of a gel kind of guy and not a cream / lather. But still, I know there&#x27;s got to be better creams out there. You can&#x27;t even really mix the shaving cream in the bowl that it comes in so get ready for the whole deal, bowl brush etc.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Lathers wonderfully. Amazing scent! Would definatly purchase again! Tobs is a absolutely wonderful company that makes great products!</li>
    <li> I am trying out this brand in place of one which costs double the price. Thus far it works just fine. I enjoy the old fashioned method of brush and bowl to create a lather rather than the canned variety or an electric razor. My advice is to use a shaving brush and swirl it in a bowl for at least a full minute before smearing the lather on your face. That full minute creates a thick lather that works better under the blade than a quick swirl around the bowl.</li>
    <li> There was no overwhelming smell to me.  I really enjoy using this shaving cream.  I would definitely recommend.  Get it!</li>
    <li> this is the third container I&#x27;ve bought of this shaving cream I love it and my wife loves the smell too :-)</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Incredible smell and very luxurious!</li>
    <li> Smells great, provides a close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Based on other positive reviews, I gave this a try. I used to use a pre-shave lubricating cream prior to Proraso shaving cream. With the Taylor of Old Bond, I don&#x27;t need the pre-lube. Just dip the tip of your brush in the cream and lather up in your shaving mug. Works great!</li>
    <li> I began using this product in the early 1970s, and have never known it to be based on tallow.  Users should know that it is easy to use.  Dip a moistened brush into the cream to pick up a small amount.  A heavy lather is created by brushing that small amount on the face..</li>
    <li> WARNING: Do not buy this if you have sensitive skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and this shaving cream/soap burned me up bad. It literally sucks up every ounce of moisture in your face, which gave me tons of little cuts and at the end the worst razor burn I have ever had. I use a Merkur 180 and use pre-shave balm to get my face ready for a shave, and this stuff smells good, but leaves you with harsh burn during and after the shave. If you dont have sensitive skin then I suppose it would be ok but if you do, do not spend money on this but get some Proraso Shaving Soap, which is the best in the market and also cheaper than this stuff.</li>
    <li> TOBS makes an excellent lather, but I personally do not care for the scent. I was hoping for a Sandalwood similar to the The Art of Shaving, but this is more of an old man&#x27;s smell in my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Smells like an old school barber shop! Lathers up nice. I use an exfoliant first, shower, then use a preshave conditioner and than this product. I have very sensitive skin and this works best for me (I use a double edged razor).</li>
    <li> Best.  Shaving cream.  Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes such a little amount to produce a nice thick lather.  Buy yourself a good quality badger hair brush and grab a mug.  Wet the brush, shake it out, dip just the tips of the brush hairs in the cream, and start making your lather in the mug.  You will not be disappointed.  The sandalwood scent is awesome (smells just like the barbershop)..  I have very sensitive skin, but this shaving cream does not irritate my face at all... Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving cream. Has a nice smell and works up into a perfect lather. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best shaving creme I have found at any price!&lt;br /&gt;You will only need an amount of cream about the third the size of a dime, so one container lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves the smell, just like an old barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;Use a Boars head brush and good razor (I use a Mekur long handle safety razor, and Astra platinum blades, change once a week) and you will get a babies butt shave and no bumbs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG TIP!!! Don&#x27;t bother with a shave cup, the palm of your hand is the best receptical for mixing your creme, just a few drops of water.</li>
    <li> Best. I wet the brush in warm water, dip in this cream, and lather up right on my face. This is, self well being.</li>
    <li> Simply a fantastic shaving soap. Best I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results from the sandalwood shaving cream, but the scent was just too much for me. When it was time to renew, I opted for another flavor from Taylor Of Old Bond Street, and am happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I am in the army and shave daily.  Using different products throughout the years I could never find the perfect shaving cream.  I am particular to Zirh products and Art of Shaving products, but Taylor of Bond Street Cream puts thoose a Far second and third in my book.&lt;br /&gt;  I use a shave brush and just a small amount on the tip of the brush is enough to have a thick lather to cover my entire face and head (I shave my head daily as well).  The scent is amazing and lasts the entire day.  I do not feel dry after using it and my blade slides easily during the entire shave.  I hvae not tried any other products by this company but if this is a example of thier line, I am going to try other products they sell.  I am just sad I just ordered one tub!  Great Shave, Great Product</li>
    <li> I taught a man how to fish once. It was the worst mistake of my life. Now my favorite fishing spot has no fish.</li>
    <li> This stuff provides a great shave hands down. Beyond that it has a very unique, clean shave smell (best way I can describe it) that lingers subtlety. When my wife hugs me she comments that I smell so manly and fresh without having an aftershave or cologne chemical smell.  Does not last as long as I would hope for the price and I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> The only shaving cream I dare to use with my straight razor.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and performs well.  This canister will probably last 6 months and I shave 5 times a week.</li>
    <li> Based on recommendation and other reviews I purchased this and used it for my first-ever safety razor shave. It&#x27;s wonderful. Lathers great, produces a slick glide and the fragrance is relaxing and wonderful. I love sandalwood and I noticed that this subtle, pleasant smell lingered for about 24 hours. If you are expecting the aroma of this cream to fade immediately after you shave that won&#x27;t be the case, but it&#x27;s nice in that if you use a neutral after-shave balm like Nivea, and you don&#x27;t feel like putting on a cologne, this will leave you smelling and feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the fragrance is not over-powering as some reviewers have suggested and could easily be muted by cologne or another product.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, great product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a wet shaver for a long time and only used shaving soap. I decided to try a shaving cream for a change; I&#x27;m glad I did. I have seen Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) advertised for a while and decided to try out the grapefruit scent (which I really enjoyed with a citrus after shave). Following that experience I decided to try out the Sandalwood shaving cream and was bowled over! I was really impressed with the quality of the product (GREAT smell, easy to lather, very slick soap).  This aroma is excellent plus you get 5.3 ounces.  With these shaving creams you need VERY little to get a full compliment of lather. All I do is lightly &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; my Omega boar bristle into the shaving cream (use very little) then whip the soap for about 5 seconds in my shaving bowl and I have plenty of lather to easily last through three shaving passes.Do not attempt to use the bowl the shaving cream comes in; you must use a different bowl. This cream is &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; so don&#x27;t use a lot of water or you&#x27;ll get shaving cream soup.  Try it Mikey, you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and the product lather up well, softens my beard, keep my face moist for shaving and has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I just went baxk to wet shaving and this is my first experience with the cream. I had always used a mug with the soap before. This has a great scent and works well, but you will need to purchase a bowl to lather in or use your hand. I will continue to use this, but have ordered a hard soap and stainless steel bowl with a lid.</li>
    <li> My Husband absolutley loves this shaving cream.  He also smells good after his shave and his face is super smooth!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. Great aroma.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality shaving cream</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping for a better shave. The biggest problem I have with this is the sandalwood or something in the soap leaves a residue on my face and brush. Because of this I have to reapply more in mid shave, getting more cuts while shaving, and my shave brush stopped absorbing water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks I had to stop using it and switch to a different soap.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhhmazing!  Best I&#x27;ve found and I have searched.  A small dab on a good brush, the size of a pencil eraser will give you a thick lather and more.</li>
    <li> I switched to this traditional saving cream after using several bars of Taylor of Bond Street shaving soap, and canned cream before that.  This format fits the best of both worlds by compromising the quick lather time of an aerosol can with the more sophisticated smell and feel of shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began shaving with a cartridge razor about ten years ago, I used canned shaving cream.  These come with artificial smells and a decidedly unsatisfying experience.  However, they are quick (instant foam) and don&#x27;t require a shaving brush.  When I abandoned that undesirable experience, I went all the way to the other end of the experience with a bar of shaving soap in a wood bowl.  The trouble with that was the time it took each morning to build up a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream quite happily ever since.  It lathers much better and has a smoother feel than tube shaving creams and you can carry it in a check on bag at airport security.  The smell is subtle and pleasing.  I won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a while and it works great. Very strong smell, may be too strong for some.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was cream and not soap, but that&#x27; my fault.  Regardless, I will plan on keeping this for a long time.  I really like it.  I read some of the other comments about the smell but obviously those people don&#x27;t know what sandalwood is and have never been in a real barbershop.  It says sandalwood right on the cover (along with cream), and that&#x27;s what it smells like.  It works great!!  One pass shave and done.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Art of Shaving Sandalwood shaving cream until I discovered this product which was 45% cheaper, and a much thicker quality. Highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Did you ever really look forward to shaving?  I am still in the experimental stage but I really love this product.  When I walked outside (not much fun in Maine!), I could smell Sandalwood.  Wow!!  I still have to learn the ins and outs of lathering and using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shave Cream.  That will come!  The feel after shaving is wonderful.  I have ordered the after-shave and hope it will be a wonderful companion to the Shave Cream!  I heartily recommend this product.  And, that comes from a man age 71, so I have had experience shaving!!</li>
    <li> Smooth shave and smells great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have three and I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Like the way the cream performs; keeps me from getting Razor burn</li>
    <li> If you like this scent, buy it. Quality is good as their other products. I bought this for my brother and he loves it. Personally, I&#x27;m more of a coconut fan. If someone is using it, you will definitely be able to smell it when they&#x27;re shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell myself. However, I&#x27;m not a fan of any shaving cream smell. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just strong and it lingers. Some people might find this to be a good quality in a shaving cream. Regardless of the smell, I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because my husband loves this shaving cream and really seems to enjoy shaving now. He says it rinses off of his razor easily, better than anything else he&#x27;s tried in the past, including soap. It also goes on smooth and silky. I know his face has been extra soft since he&#x27;s started using this shaving cream. Glad I purchased this, I just hope it comes in scentless for future purchases.</li>
    <li> first time buying shaving cream... the thing smells great, lathers up really well with a just a small amount... i mix a pea size amount with a lil shaving soap and makes a great lather... highly recommend and i would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this brand and I must say that I am already in love. I wiped just a tad from the underside of the cap when I first got it and probably could have got like 6 passes from it. For $16 I have never found a better cream. I am guessing this tub will last me a year or more mixed in my rotation.</li>
    <li> SMELLS SO GOOD. My entire bathroom smells amazing after using this stuff, and my face feels equally amazing. Worth every penny. And I imagine it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I recently made the switch from canned &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; to traditional shaving methods with a quality cream. I could not be happier with this product, it works wonderfully, has a pleasant scent (not too overpowering), and is a great value for the money. My order arrived a couple of days early, although some of the oil had seeped out of the container which made for a messy unpacking experience. Not a big deal though, it was easily wiped off with a tissue.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shave cream. The smell is divine, lathers very well. I&#x27;m so incredibly happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Lasts a long time. Great smell. Great lather.</li>
    <li> I have a thick, gruff, sand paper type beard.  I can&#x27;t go two days without looking like a mountain man.  My beard has coarse hair running in multiple directions and if I don&#x27;t shave in the shower with the hottest water available I look like I got in a slap fight with Freddie Kruger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I upgraded to boar hair brush &amp; a single blade old school razor.  I have been trying various soaps to see what works for me, for my beard.  The razor and the blades do a much better job than the disposables I had been buying.  But canned creme, even the \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; ones still didn&#x27;t give me the kind of shave I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Sandalwood Shaving Cream based on the reviews.  This stuff is just like being back in the barbershop when I was 5, the smell taking me back to the day!  It&#x27;s amazing!!  I put about two fingers worth into my shaving mug, add a little hot water and hit it with the boar brush.  Amazing shave!  The resulting creme is very thick, very smooth and I experienced zero nicks or cuts in my first two shaves.  A feat not accomplished since I was 14.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like liquid ball bearings that smells good too.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not stopped my search yet, and I have two more variants on the way, so I will be posting more as I do more testing on my own face.  But suffice to say if this stuff can shave my beard without incident, I can safely recommend it to just about everyone else out there who isn&#x27;t a Card Carrying member of Wookie International.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JD</li>
    <li> This is probably the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased and/or used. I like it much better than the stuff I got from the Body Shop. It&#x27;s not quite as thick so it does not overly congest your razor. It is just thick enough to provide a super-close shave, yet you will not spend the entire morning trying to rinse your razor off.  People have complained about the smell.  I, and my wife, think that it smells great!  It does somewhat remind me of the barber shop shaving creams/balms.  Great stuff!  I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this shaving cream I was inspired to write a haiku.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Painful shaving is long&lt;br /&gt;forgotten skin now soft&lt;br /&gt;as baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
    <li> this is hands down the best cream I have ever used and will always be my favorite. Lather is great, smell is wonderful, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. But a tub last me 3 months with every day use. YMMV</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how awesome this shaving cream is. The smell, the feel, the consistency....its all great. I naturally have very dry skin and use lotion on my face normally. Before switching to using Taylor of Old Bond St. shaving cream, I used the standard shaving foam/cream in a can with all the propellants. I would need to use lotion on my face after every shave to ensure that I didn&#x27;t have dry patches on my cheeks. Since switching to Taylor of Old Bond St. I don&#x27;t need to use lotion at all on the places that this shaving cream has touched. My skin feel soft and smooth and nourished throughout the day. I also love the way the sandalwood smells. Its a very refreshing and natural smell and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like I&#x27;ve heard of sandalwood shaving creams have. I might try some of the other scents after I use this up but its going to be hard to beat this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a pretty cheap badger brush and have no problem getting a nice lather with it. Don&#x27;t expect a huge foam like you get out of a can but its easily thick enough to provide for a smooth shave. It took some time to get used to using the right amount of water with it as in the beginning I was new to this stuff and didn&#x27;t use enough water. The key I&#x27;ve found is to get some nice hot water on your face and leave your brush wet but not dripping wet. I lather this right on my face rather than use a bowl and it works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> This stuff creams up amazingly quick and smells great.  My wife loves the scent that it leaves after shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of shaving creams with my double edge razor and this Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood shaving cream is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> this jar is about a year supply if you use it right.  I have to shave everyday for work and I&#x27;m about half way through after 6 months.  A little of this stuff goes a long way and it smells like an old time barber shop (that&#x27;s a good thing).  I&#x27;m actually saving money by using this stuff</li>
    <li> This is the first shave cream I used after switching to wet shaving several years ago - so there may be some bias there since smell is one of the strongest memory triggers. It lathers easily, provides a clean-feeling slick surface for the razor, and has a very nice aroma. A little stronger smell than other sandalwood products I&#x27;ve used (Proraso, etc.), but still nice IMHO. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> You could lather this stuff with a $5 brush (and I have).  With a decent boar, you&#x27;ll get a ton of slick lather to work with.  I start a little on the dry side and add drops of water till I get the right consistency.  I like the scent.  It&#x27;s a bit strong in the tub, but mellows well once you whip it up.  You should like sandalwood though.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the TOBS creams.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but after using it , I&#x27;m sold on the quality of this stuff . Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had hands down and a little goes a long way! I will probably try other scents just for the heck of it but this stuff is the real deal !!</li>
    <li> I had been using the Art of Shaving products for over a year, but Taylor of Old Bond is the best. It lathers up very nicely and the scent is really good. Even though is a little strong, it can bother people with sensitive nose, it does the job right and it&#x27;s more affordable than the Art of Shaving products. My only tip would be that don&#x27;t leave the brush with too much water. Leave the brush moist, squeeze to take the excess of water. And in your shaving mug, add a few drops of water and you will the magic start. And don&#x27;t grab too much shaving cream with the brush. You don&#x27;t need too much, because it lathers up nicely and very quick.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream out there..</li>
    <li> Really, the best shaving cream I have ever used.  It absolutely leads to a smoother and more pleasurable shave than the old gillete stuff I used to use.  Less skin irritation, and fun to use.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff. I usually use soaps, but when I feel the need to switch it up and give my face a bit of pampering, I grab my silvertip and a tub of TOBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandalwood has an amazing, classic sandalwood scent that lingers throughout the shave, but won&#x27;t last to interfere with any aftershaves or colognes you might use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG LONG way. almond or less size to get a slick, thick, decadent lather that your blade will LOVE and will protect and cushion your face. Did I mention that I LOVE TOBS?!?!?!</li>
    <li> Smooth and smells good</li>
    <li> The smell is nice without being overpowering, and the actual container does a great job at keeping the cream moist. It is a little on the expensive side, but you only need a little bit each time you shave and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cream for beginners and old hacks alike. The fragrance is lovely, it creates a very rich lather, and it fills the brush to keep you going through your third pass. I feel like sophisticated like James Bond when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews complain about the price, but I have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about. A little dab will do, and this amount is sufficient to last you plenty long. True, it is more expensive than a soap cake, but this product is one of those things that turns the daily labor of shaving into a daily luxury.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gives a great shave! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The lather is awesome, almost butter like moisturizing effect, thick and creamy. The smell reminds me of the incense of days gone by, i.e. college. Not overpowering but a lovely flashback to simpler times</li>
    <li> Decent product, has a distinct barber shop fragrance to it. Lasts a while because you use very little.</li>
    <li> This is the product that made me fall in love with TOBS. My wife loves the smell as much as I do. It lathers easily and quickly. Gives you a slick layer of protection without the need for pre-oils. I now use the TOBS sandalwood aftershave, talc, shower gel, and cologne. I admit that it is pricy, so I don&#x27;t use it everyday. But it is certainly worth the money and is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice masculine fragrance and whips up into a generous cream.  I wish that I had this 30-years sooner!  Hands down I would recommend this Sandalwood Shaving Cream to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving cream. Lathers easily and the fragrance is really good. Only reason for not giving 5* is after comparing with Art of shaving, which is a bit better in moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Lathers up richly and thickly, smells amazing, and provides an excellent shave. I can&#x27;t get over how clean and refreshing the scent is.</li>
    <li> Just started using the brush and shaving cream.  I really love the scent, and feel of the lather.  I use it for both electric, and razor, and find the the shaving cream gives great protection and no irritation with either shaving instrument.  It makes my skin feel smooth.  My skin is somewhat sensitive and I have had irritation develop with other shaving creams, but no problem with this.</li>
    <li> Even on city water (soft water) it lathers nicely. As others have mentioned the scent is quite strong and will serve as a cologne/aftershave well into your 8 hour work day. I like it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> A little goes a LONG ways. Lathers up nice and rinses clean. The scent is a delight. Those who say it is too strong are just overly sensitive. After using it for 2 weeks, I barley notice the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars? One star off for poor packaging. I don&#x27;t know if it was a change in air pressure (on a plane) during delivery or what but a good portion of the creme was all over the inside the delivery box. I tried to salvage what I could, but most was lost to the garbage. This was not an isolated case. The same thing happened when I ordered the Almond scent.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street cream is just in another league from anything I have ever tried. A little goes a long way and your skin will love it. I shave every other day typically, and it lasted me over a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving and switching from [[ASIN:B002JKKPDG Col. Conk Almond Glycerine Shave Soap]] to this made a big difference in the comfort of my shave. I&#x27;m not particularly in love with the scent, but it&#x27;s certainly not offensive in any way, I just really liked the almond scented Col. Conk. My next purchase will probably be the some almond scented TOBS. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Received this stuff 2 weeks ago. Had to buy it after reading all of the great reviews. After using it for almost 2 weeks, I can say that this is BY FAR the best shaving cream I have ever used. At this price level, the value is tremendous. Also, I found that you only need about a dime size of the cream to create a nice, thick lather. At this rate, I see this cream lasting me at least over 3-4 months...at least. Also, I read some reviews that mentioned a unique odor. Maybe some might not like it, but I love it. It&#x27;s manly, reminds me of a classic barbershop, and in the words of the great Andy Bernard from The Office (US), it \\&quot;smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan smells like\\&quot; (The Office (US), NBC). Do your face a favor and get this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever used! Fell in love moment I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes great with made German made &#x27;Merkur&#x27; traditional blade,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant believe a product with this quality is made in England... They must of stolen the recipe from the French or something..</li>
    <li> I have tried several popular creams/soaps and after using this product the first time, I honestly cannot wait until I have to shave again. Lubricates, lathers, and smells great. Good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells as great as people state. Nothing like sandalwood to me.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Really giving off a scent of gentlemen. Will order again soon.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream smells amazing. I absolutely love it. It also lathers very well and lubricates for a perfect shave. I have absolutely no complaints about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before deciding to buy this fairly expensive shaving soap. BUT, after using it now for a week, it is everything folks say it is. It takes very little soap to get a lather up. I mean VERY little. It also seems to leave your face exceptionally smooth. The lather does not &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; while you are shaving either. It stays full coverage until you are done shaving. I&#x27;d readily recommend this soap for the discriminating shaver.</li>
    <li> Great cream...much much better value than Art of Shaving cream. I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because Art of Shaving costs more, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;. This Taylor is just as good and smells great. You&#x27;ll get a damn good lather and a clean, close shave, assuming you have a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, don&#x27;t let those higher prices fool you. This is top notch stuff!</li>
    <li> Good scent but did not lather as good as expected. After quite a while of trying there would still m\be multiple clumps on my brush but it still did its job nicely</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, lathers well, and seems to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture the average amount of toothpaste you use on a brush and times that amount by two.  That&#x27;s about how much shaving cream I use in my mug every time I shave.  It doesn&#x27;t take a day and a half to make a good lather when mixing it up.  That amount provides plenty of soap to brush onto my face.  And once it&#x27;s on there, it doesn&#x27;t dissipate or run away with the water.  It stays put, providing a smooth shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That it smells good is icing on the cake.  I like to picture a potential date excusing herself to the bathroom, peeking into my medicine cabinet, and opening this stuff up and smelling it, only to be blown away by my manly taste in shaving cream.  Then she comes back from the bathroom and we have a vicious makeout session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but this is pretty good shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Delivers a smooth, comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is strong and manly.  My wife loves how I smell after shaving.</li>
    <li> Was okay, but I had to use more product than normal to produce the lather I&#x27;m used to. As another reviewer posted, either this product is very watered-down or it is not the original product and may be a knock-off. Since I&#x27;m not familiar with Taylor products, I don&#x27;t know for sure about the expected quality. I love sandalwood shave cream (Truefitt and Hill is the BEST!) but this particular product did not seem to have much of a scent at all. Overall, I wasn&#x27;t completely disappointed, but not impressed by any means. If you can get this very cheap then go for it.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using shave soap for decades now but this may have changed my life.  The creamy lather whips to peaks unheard of outside the Himalayas and its creaminess makes the Happy Cows in California wrought with jealousy.  My razor hums with happiness as it slides effortlessly through the unfortunate stubble that has certainly met its match.  The scent....how to describe....it&#x27;s what every man wants a good shave to smell like....I imagine Sherlock Holme&#x27;s study on Baker Street smells of this lovely soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, life is too short, check off your bucket list the best shave of your life and buy this.</li>
    <li> This is expensive and also the best shaving cream I have used.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase.  used traditional shaving creams before but this gives you a different sense of being when you lather your face up with it.  has a soft whip cream like texture to it that makes you feel like your in a professional barbershop.  only thing i&#x27;m not too fond of is the odor but its very negligible.</li>
    <li> Great scent!&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up really nice and goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> FOR THE PRICE YOU GET A GOOD LATHER SMOOTH SCENT AND A GREAT SHAVE.WILL ORDER IT AGAIN. MAY TRY THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> Really not better than billy jealousy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a mug and brush shaver for about 5 years and ordered this thinking it was a hard soap refill for my mug.  This is totally different from hard soap that you put in your mug - it sort of a thick cream/paste and comes in a screw sealable tub. You still use your brush with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I really like it. It has a nice &#x27;masculine&#x27; fragrance (I hate fragrances normally) and provides a real smooth shave.  I plan to bring one for my father-in-law on my next visit</li>
    <li> Brilliant!! I have been using Art of Shaving and this provides a better lather and smoother shave.  And the price point is far better.  The sandalwood has a great manly scent without being too much.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It feels great, smells great and works a treat! Definitely a must have for shaving enjoyment.</li>
    <li> As a newby straight razor shaver, I was looking to load up on product without breaking the bank.  I decided to try Taylor of Old Bond Street first, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m sure other shaving accessory manufacturers make great product too, but I love both the feel and performance of this product.  It whips into a lather very easily, with very little water, and smells fantastic.  More pricey than buying gel in a can, but the experience can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but my wife thinks its a bit too smelly. To alleviate this I simply wash my face again after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise very nice product and allows me to build a very nice lather.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream for my father on his birthday.  He loved it from the moment he opened.  He told me that the scent brought him so many memories that he was overwhelmed with joy.  He uses it everyday of course (and he smells good).  Very good product.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and the quality of the foam produced but the soap is so soft that you end up using an awful lot of it per shave, making it quite expensive. I prefer a harder soap that goes further.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I love it...</li>
    <li> I bought this cream as it came recommended by many straight razor shavists.  I am new to straight razor shaving but I can see why it comes so highly recommended.  I dab a finger&#x27;s worth of this into my wood shave bowl, then lather it up with an Escali Badger hair brush.  Makes for a great shave straight razor or multi blade razor.  Leave skin smooth and conditioned, helps reduce nicks, cuts, and razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Maybe just me, but this does not smell anything like sandalwood should. Maybe it&#x27;s my sense of smell since it is such a popular brand.</li>
    <li> Excellent foaming, nice fragrance, works well with my safety razor. however, don&#x27;t use too much or the thick foam will clog the razor.</li>
    <li> In a quest to do a little throwback shaving, I purchased the TOBS sandalwood-scented shave cream. I like the lather and glide it provides, but I felt the scent, while oozing manliness, was rather overpowering. I used it a few times in earnest, but the smell just got to me. I think I will go back to eShave products.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest creams that I have tried.  It is by far the thickest lather and provides a wonderful aroma.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Lathers great, smells suberb, and lasts if you use almond sized amount.</li>
    <li> I just recently started the wet shave and decided to try this based primarily on other reviews I read. I was not disappointed. Truly a pleasure to use and hands down superior to the canned junk. It provides a smooth, rich lather that lubricates very well. I especially enjoy the fragrance as it&#x27;s not overpowering or so faint as to not be noticed. It&#x27;s economic as well since the quantity needed to produce a beautiful lather is minimal, about a nickle size. If you are just starting the wet shave do yourself a favor and use a high quality shaving cream or soap it makes all the difference in the world and, in my opinion, this product is well worth a consideration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the slightly more expensive and invested shaving experience (i.e., anything but disposable razors and cheap shaving cream). This stuff is awesome - the texture looks and feels like a nicely whipped cream and goes on nicely with a brush, it feels great afterwards and enables an awesome, smooth shave. I&#x27;m immediately a fan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great smelling and effective shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;It comes as a cream, not a bar of soap that has to be lathered, which I assume means you get fewer uses out of it. It&#x27;s tough to wash off of your blade and face, but that means that it&#x27;s more effective at lubricating and soothing your skin. It also means it doesn&#x27;t run off in a light mist or steam if you shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;ll buy it again or go back to using a cheaper bar-of-soap-in-a-dish. The price is the only factor.</li>
    <li> Just buy it , it&#x27;s hard to beat</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. It goes on the brush well, and on my face evenly.</li>
    <li> I think if you really want a good close comfortable shave, without irritation and a great not too over whelming scent, then this is it.&lt;br /&gt;On your first use the scent my overwhelm you but after that it softens in subsequent shaves. I use a heavy razor (Merkur Futur) and it glides smoothly with this cream. Other creams I have tried the glide is not as smooth and it feels like the razor hesitates, if you know what I mean, but this is the only cream that you don&#x27;t even feel the razor on your skin, and get a very close shave without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a big can and should last you a long time. Mine lasts me about 6 to 7 months.</li>
    <li> The smell is a pleasant old fashion aroma, along with its ability to quickly lather makes this a great addition to your everyday shaving gear. This jar lasted me approx. 9 months using it six days a week.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have always more than satisfied with it. I am additionally happy that I can get from Amazon in lieu of buying it direct from England.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I&#x27;m new to safety razors and never used a cream like this.  It is so much better than the canned stuff.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream. I&#x27;m a loyal customer now.</li>
    <li> Just get a little fingertip full, and up that in the bowl, and then soak your brush, and that should be just about the right ratio. Use the brush like a wisk and it creams nicely. I also recommend preheating your bowl with hot water, as well as using warm water on the brush and to rinse the razor. Really steps up the experience.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I got so far. I tried a dozen. Let me put it this way. If TOB would be able to get the Proraso sandalwood fragrance to replace the one they got, then, I would buy a caisse of it, and stick with it until I croak. My next purchase will be to try the TOB almond. I use a merkur 37c and a 33c with a weber bulldog handle, and a 200 carton of Feather. I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I am not experience enough with creams to give a great opinion, but I have no issues with this one.</li>
    <li> best shave I can every remembering having  I used way too much the first time a small dab will do  really small dab on your finger tip them brush it to a thick lather that stays    this 5 oz can should last 6 months  #1 selling for a reason</li>
    <li> The price seems a bit high, but this is a quality product. You don&#x27;t need that much to work up a great lather. Smells great &amp; gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> For the last six months, I&#x27;ve been using a single cake of the Taylor of Old Bond Street lavender shaving soap.  While I was quite pleased with this shaving soap, I wasn&#x27;t prepared for Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving cream.  I&#x27;ll explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to travel for work.  Traveling with my porcelain shaving cup with the shaving soap in the cup wasn&#x27;t an acceptable option, so I decided to buy a bowl of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream out of convenience.  When it arrived, I tossed it in my travel bag and went on my trip.  I pulled it out in the hotel the following morning and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how richly it lathered up.  My goodness!  It&#x27;s a totally different experience compared to the shaving soap.  While I like the shaving soap, I had no idea the shaving cream would be as rich and slick as it is.  I found the slickness to be vastly superior to the shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained of a stinging feeling from this shaving cream.  This cream contains a chemical called triethanolamine.  Triethanolamine helps create the rich lather produced from this shaving cream.  Triethanolamine is also a very irritating chemical to some people, which is why it is used sparingly in this shaving cream.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to triethanolamine, you&#x27;ll want to avoid this product.  There are a number of other chemicals in this shaving cream that could cause problems for those with sensitive skin.  I, personally, have no problem with this cream.  I do feel a slight sting, but it&#x27;s very mild and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  The quality of the lather and the slickness it provides is really amazing, so I overlook any sensations provided by the cream.  It kind of reminds me of eucalyptus added to other skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have complained about the perfume potency.  I would have to agree with them; this shaving cream has a very potent smell.  I think this falls under the category of personal preference.  If you&#x27;re bothered by a strong scented shaving cream, then this is not the cream for you.  I like not only the strong scent, but how long it lasts.  The lavender shaving soap I used before had a mild scent that disappeared in about an hour.  I always wished it would last longer.  The scent from this shaving soap lasts for most of the day and even gets on my shirt collar, which I like.  It&#x27;s made to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shaving quality, what can I say--it&#x27;s outstanding!  I have far less nicks and bleeding, and I can go over problematic spots without any concern about irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice the bowl of shaving cream doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving soap.  Some of this may be my getting used to how much cream to use.  You don&#x27;t need much cream at all.  A little bit goes a very long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this shaving cream for its rich lather and superior slickness.  It offers me a superb shave with no razor burn.  The scent is strong, but I enjoy that.  Due to the ingredient makeup of this cream, I have to be sure to rinse thoroughly.  It contains a potent blend of ingredients that is very effective for my shave.  Without question, this is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.bothered by a strong scented shaving cream, then this is not the cream for you.  I like not only the strong scent, but how long it lasts.  The lavender shaving soap I used before had a mild scent that disappeared in about an hour.  I always wished it would last longer.

    <li> Not the same kind of product as the Proraso tubs I&#x27;m used to, but one you dab your brush lightly into or use your finger and extract about an almond sized dollop out of the bowl.  You can use a bowl/cup or just put the soap in your wet brush and go to town.  Great lather that doesn&#x27;t quite last in the brush between passes.  While you get great lather on your face, it&#x27;s not the most lubricating lather.  After the blade passes, the skin feels dry.  Some other soaps leave a little lubrication behind that can actually be useful when using a &#x27;brushing&#x27; type of stroke on the chin and jawline.  I like the lather, scent...just not the level of lubrication.  Given that it&#x27;s twice as much as Proraso...I can&#x27;t bring myself to ordering this product a second time.</li>
    <li> Nice, but I don&#x27;t notice much difference in the shave between this and a using plain old Barbasol shave cream.</li>
    <li> This has a very strong scent.  Too strong for me.  Great lubrication for your face but the scent is just too overpowering for me and my wife.</li>
    <li> Damn right!  Smell is fantastic, lathers better than anything I have ever used, protects, hydrates, a little goes A LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;Will use time and time again.  I will teach my son to shave with this product.</li>
    <li> Luxurious lather, smells great and delivers a smooth shave!&lt;br /&gt;That says it all. ~ The Boss</li>
    <li> Love the Smell, you really notice the difference when you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
    <li> Smells like a barber shop and like I am a man. works well and makes a great foam.</li>
    <li> Great product.Nothing less than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream that I have ever used.  Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is superior to others that I have tried.  I am not a fan of the gel type and needed something for my Dovo straight razor.  This hardly needs water to lather nicely in my badger hair brush.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming odor to it either and leaves a nicely finished feel to my skin after my shave.  The container has a nice secure lid that would save itself from my clumsy wife from knocking off my side of the counter space in the bathroom.  I also have highly sensitive skin and this does not bother me one bit!</li>
    <li> Love the lather and scent of this shaving cream. The Sandalwood scent is great and it is slick for shaving. Get the aftershave gel to pair with it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on the smell. Also leaves my face very smooth.</li>
    <li> Beautiful goods !! Thank you !!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this shave cream. Lathers up great and very concentrated. A little goes a long way. Plus a great scent.</li>
    <li> It is a pretty good product.  Certainly decent for a semi cheap shaving cream if you are just starting out.</li>
    <li> Left me smelling like a man but as smooth as a baby.</li>
    <li> I like the shaving cream but when i opened the box it had spilled out of the container. It was in the box and all over the container. Will not be ordering again</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this cream.  It&#x27;s smooth, easy to use and smells great.  My shaves have never been better and my skin is left with feeling fresh and moisturized.  I won&#x27;t use the cream from a can again unless there happens to be no other option,  As in I stay over at your place and I forgot my own shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Really gentlemen, you owe it to your face to give this a good try if you&#x27;ve never used this style of shaving cream before.  Your face willl thank you and those who get close to you will too!</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the sandalwood scent is quite strong. If you want everything to smell like shaving cream all day then use this cream. I prefer [[ASIN:B00278JYNW Geo F. Trumper Soft Shaving Cream in Tube, Sandalwood]] as it&#x27;s more subtle.</li>
    <li> This cream not only smells great it is super easy to apply.  It is nice and soft and allows you to shave perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love bond street products, manly scent and quality porduct.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Cream prepare your beard for shaving and moisturizes your face&amp;#34; &#x3D; true, tested a dab...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Rich woody blend of exotic sweet scented Sandalwood and Cedar, with Lavender and Rosemary for subtle floralcy and Jasmine and Rose, for a vivacious, enticing, confidently masculine bouquet&amp;#34; &#x3D; I did like the smell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Included bowl makes the lathering easy&amp;#34; &#x3D; could not find the included bowl...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl&amp;#34; &#x3D; I guess referring to the plastic cup filled with cream? First you have to empty the cream to get to the plastic cup, certainly not a bowl. And the dimensions are much smaller than 8x8x6.</li>
    <li> very good lather and lubrication, I&#x27;ve been using baby oil under it.  Smell is a little lackluster and certainly could be better,  I would buy this again but will make an effort to try some of the other stuff out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this stuff burns my lips and will irritate my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also really hard to keep a good lather as it dries out on my face even with liberal amounts of water. Not super crazy about the smell either.</li>
    <li> I am not a person who much likes sandalwood but, I like this shave cream a lot. Nice fragrance. The product arrived timely without any problems. I recommend.</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite scents, and it lathers very nicely. This was the first TOBS cream I purchased, and I bought 4 more - they all lather great and do what it needs to do for my face :)</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. Like if you died and went to heaven, this is what would be in the bathrooms to shave with. The smell is fantastic, and lingers well after the shave. Highly recommended and well worth the price. You don&#x27;t use much, so this will last a long time. Probably about the same as 4-5 cans of foam, so well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving with little investment, and that meant using the &amp;#34;puck&amp;#34; shaving soaps from local pharmacies.  After a while, I improved my shaving implements and that included bettering the quality of my shaving cream.  Reading strong reviews, I went with the Taylor product and it has been fantastic.  It really sets a nice lather for shaving and helps the blade glide over your face.  It really helps to condition the skin and leaves a nice fragrance when you&#x27;re done.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Newbie to wet shaving of about 1month. Have bought 6or 7 creams of various scents. Almost all are great. However my bride pretty much tells me this TOBS sandalwood is ME. It lathers great and smells better. Give it a try if you haven&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff. Foams up great, smells great and all at a reasonable price. I&#x27;m on my second tub of Taylor and will continue to use it. Every bit as nice as the fancy stuff from the store at the mall.</li>
    <li> Been using their shaving products for many years, Smell good, Look good, No small trick for me to meet the world.</li>
    <li> I purchased the TOBS Grapefruit shaving cream and really liked it. So I decided to try the Sandalwood for a change to see if it was a good as the Grapefruit. Well it was......so I have no complaints. I think about anything by TOBS will do well. The next time around I&#x27;ll try another one of their scents to see how well it&#x27;ll do against the previous two. As of today.....my top favorites are the Proraso Green and the TOBS Grapefruit which are tied for first place with the Sandal wood being a very, very close second.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried this product. Compared to reguler store bought shaving creams, far superior.</li>
    <li> but I love this soap. Since I began shaving with a safety razor I have tried 2 other soaps. The first very good, the second, horrible. I was a bit worried that the scent would overwhelm. As a kid would pour on English Leather, and if I never smell it again I&#x27;ll be quite pleased. I thought the scent of the soap might be similar to English Leather. The majority of reviews were so positive I thought that I would take a chance. The second I started to lather the brush and apply the soap my worries were over. This is a rich, creamy, moist soap that really makes a magnificent lather. I put shaving oil on first, wait a minute or two, and then brush the soap. The two products combined, and with the Feather blade, which allows zero margin of error, the only other time I&#x27;ve had such a smooth shave was at the barber. The sandalwood is a very pleasant scent. I do not like sweet smelling cologne. I rarely wear cologne, and if I do it&#x27;s a very light cologne. Nothing worse than having your cologne enter the room before you. After the shave I went to a party at the hotel where I&#x27;m staying, so not much time had passed since I shaved. I was aware of the scent. My test was that if anyone said, &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34; I would know that the scent was too strong. After all of the usual air-kisses and hugs, not a single person mentioned the scent. I would like to think it&#x27;s because it didn&#x27;t bother them if they got a whiff, rather than it was so horrible that they were embarrassed to say anything. I suspect it was the former.  The scent may not work for everyone. I don&#x27;t know if they make an unscented soap, regardless, let me repeat; I love this soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because both him and I got new DE safety razors recently. He likes scents like pine, cedar, you know woody smells. I tried it too and the smell is wonderful, it lathers great and leaves that wonderful scent once done. And guys, here&#x27;s a hint, if your lady likes that smell of this cream, she&#x27;ll live to be snuggled into your neck and breathe you in. I can&#x27;t get enough of it after my husband used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more more than a year now (ever since I switched away from the Gillette razor I had earlier to a safety razor), and it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to lather on, is decent smelling and helps in a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> love the scent, love the shave and slickness. Great product and wonderful sandalwood.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this shaving cream simply because of the number of positive reviews.  And they were all correct.  This product feels great, and the scent is amazing.  I will be purchasing Taylor of Old Bond Street from now on.</li>
    <li> Tobs makes some awesome products and this is one of my very favorites. The Sandlewood scent is pleasing but not overpowering and the lather from this cream is the best I have ever seen. If you are a wet shaver you owe it to yourself to try this product!</li>
    <li> Great lather!  Smells wonderful and very creamy.  GIves you a great base to shave and leaves your skin smelling awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple other Sandalwood scented shaving creams but this one appears to be the most true-to-scent of them all. Great scent that took a couple days to get used to but works very well as an undertone for my aftershave. Fine lather and fits easily in my personal hygiene kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this recently as I have started shaving with a DE Safety Razor.  Since Purchasing this I have purchased several other TOBS Creams from other sources.  TOBS is a great value as it is easy to lather and very high quality at an affordable price.  Sandalwood smells great!  Reminds me of going to a barber with my dad when i was young.</li>
    <li> The bottom line is, I love this stuff.  When I started wet shaving I used hard soaps, mainly Proraso.  Nothing wrong with them, they get the job done - but the difference is dramatic with TOBS.  I get a closer shave with fewer (virtually zero) nicks and my face feels conditioned after shaving with it.  Scent is a very personal thing, and I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviewers who say this makes you smell like an &amp;#34;older gentleman&amp;#34; and therefore don&#x27;t like it.  Personally, I love the scent and so does my wife; I&#x27;m in my mid-fifties, so make of that what you will.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of experience with different types of shaving cream but it whips up great, feels and smells good going on.  A little dab goes a long way, it whips up great and leaves the skin feeling good.  All in all I like it.  Maybe after I&#x27;ve tried other brands I&#x27;ll change my mind but for for now I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Gotta go online and order some more.</li>
    <li> My expectations of what sandalwood smells like and what TOBS thinks sandalwood smells like are two different things. This smells like noxzema cream. Nothing like that fresh scent of your mom on your face to wake you up in the morning. Would not buy again. If you want sandalwood, go with the Art of Shaving&#x27;s sandalwood cream, smells much better than TOBS. Would have rated 1 star, but it does work for taking the fur off your face. I just think its stinks.</li>
    <li> Nice product. A bit on the pricey side, but it&#x27;ll last you forever and then some. It doesn&#x27;t hold water as much as I want. This causes the lather to start to dry out towards the end of the shave. Then again I&#x27;m not using a brush so that might be the problem. This product definitely helps with my shave. The smell is a manly smell, however, I got mixed reviews on the smell from different people. Some people like it, some think it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
    <li> I liked my first bowl of this cream a lot. I ordered again - What I got was not sandalwood scent. Since I used it once, I did not return. Now I ordered a third - but the item that arrived was just like the second one - did not have sandalwood scent - rather, it is the original cream. This is not appropriate.</li>
    <li> Product does the job. It&#x27;s a good cream. However, the scent is a little too strong for me. Otherwise, this would be four stars.</li>
    <li> But so much better - you do get what you pay for here.  The scent is strong - be prepared for that.</li>
    <li> The only thing better that this cream is the TOBS shaving soap  I find the soap has a better longer lasting scent</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd order of this cream and the last one I got smelled trouble.  The first two were great and smell like sandalwood but this one I even can&#x27;t describe what it is.  Smells like old/moldy stuff.  I am sending it back and hopefully I get a good one next time.</li>
    <li> I just switched to the single blade safety razor and picked up this Sandalwood Shaving Cream at the same time and I really like it. It smells and works great. I would recommend getting a shaving bowl also since I find it best to take a little, add a little water and mix it until foamy - a small shaving bowl would be ideal for this.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is amazing. It&#x27;s sandalwood and I&#x27;d describe it as classy, manly, and just the right amount of &amp;#34;scent.&amp;#34; I know I want to smell nice, but not smell so much that people 5 feet away can smell me! Besides the great smell, this product lathers very well. A good lather is key for a comfortable shave and the fact that this lathers very easily is great. I have very hard water, but that doesn&#x27;t stop this shaving cream! I&#x27;d recommend trying it out if you are looking for a new shaving soap/cream.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, not to overpowering and you don&#x27;t need a lot of cream on the brush. Great product for the price and leaves you feeling like you just got out of the barber&#x27;s chair! Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas this year, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The cream smells amazing, and does an excellent job of lathering up. It might seem a little pricey, but it will last a long time. As the old saying goes, a little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
    <li> This cream has a strong smell, which I like, but others seem to find overwhelming. It lathers great on the face with just a little cream. I recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good foamy and smooth base for shaving.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is the best I have used.  Little product is needed on the brush to obtain a great lather.  This makes the tub go a long way. The blade runs smoothly over my face with this shaving cream.  The smell is quite nice and leaves a nice aroma after shaving.  My skin feels soft and refreshed after use.  Recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I like the lather, it serves its purpose. But the smell is very very strong. If you would rather not smell like an old man, then I suggest you get a different shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Great lather and great scent! Love it and will be buying it again</li>
    <li> Amazon has always been our family go-to place for almost all of our stuff we get on line and this purchase was no different.  Everything went smoothly, it came on time and well packaged.  The shaving soap itself was a pleasant surprise, it has a very pleasant smell and lathers up nicely.  Thanks Amazon for having great vendors with great products!</li>
    <li> Foams up nice, and I love the smell. Feels very soft against the skin and helps with a smooth shave.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> General statement: This was the first cream I ever purchased and is still my all-time favorite. The sleekness you get from this cream will greatly help you in preventing cuts, just as long as you take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the cream can be a little runny, depending on how hot the packaging and delivery vehicle is. When I opened the box, a small amount of the substance was present on the container; however, I don&#x27;t know if this was from the actually product itself, or from another product at the Amazon warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it was a small, trace amount and didn&#x27;t deter my enjoyment and experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: subtle hints of sandalwood that linger after the shave. I shaved around 5:30 yesterday afternoon and I could still smell a little of the sandalwood the following morning. I&#x27;ve never experienced that with a cologne, let alone a shaving cream. The notes are distant, but distinguishable, slightly fleeting but consistent in the fact that you now what it is. The best example I can give is imagining yourself walking down a hallway and catching a whiff of a slightly woody cologne/parfume from a room as you walk by. That describes the level of intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathering: an almond-sized amount is more than sufficient. I did three passes and still had enough lather on my brush if I wanted to do for a fourth. The sleekness of the cream is exceptional too. I shaved with a new Feather blade and didn&#x27;t cut myself once. The &amp;#34;after glow&amp;#34; feeling of the cream lingers too. Not like to the degree of a lotion or oil, but of a moisturizing agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: While expensive, the trivial amount of cream needed for each shave really makes this product last a very long time. Depending on how often you shave, expect anywhere between 4-6 months of usage before repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Nothing natural or traditional about this junk.  It is full of chemicals and contains no sandalwood whatsoever.  Fragrance is kinda interesting but definitely nothing like sandalwood.</li>
    <li> When I received it, about half of the product was missing.  If they&#x27;re going to charge so much, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d spend a little money on quality control.</li>
    <li> I was buying the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; balms and creams for my hubby and the Taylor of Old Bond Street: Foams up just as good, smells great, is less expensive and lasts just as long.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this! For traditional wet shavers, this stuff is tough to beat. It lathers so well, you can just dip the tip of your brush in it, and work it into a lather for your entire face! The scent is a little heavy for summertime, but it dissapates fairly quickly. It would be nice if it came in a nice light citrus or something for summer.</li>
    <li> Awful. Very little soap.  A rip-off. Not worth the price. Basically paying for an inexpensive cup with a bit of soap in it.</li>
    <li> Great price, great lather, great cansiter, not so good smell.  My wife likes it but it definitely takes getting used to.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago when I was in the corporate world, and slacked off shortly after leaving. After using all types of other soaps and creams, I am now right back to this. Use a beaver shaving brush and a safety razor, and you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> Got the shaving cream right away and the stuff is great. My son and wife both think it is the best shaving cream I have purchased. I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> Works well and I like it, but the smell is a little to old for me. It reminds me of something my grandfather would use. Wished it had a lighter scent, but this scent kinda smacks you in the face.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have used, smells great. As in other comments the smell is stronger than most and will leave you face smelling all day long. I personally like the smell, others don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for over a year now, love it. Pleasant fragrance and easy to work with. Not oily or greasy at all. Lathers easily.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream lasts a *long* time.  It just takes a tiny amount.  You can make it last even longer by putting it on the brush and making your lather in a bowl with inexpensive shaving soap in the bottom.</li>
    <li> Great scent, Lather builds up well, holds moisture well, VERY slick, rinses off quickly, easily, and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;  My Simpson&#x27;s Premium Silver tip Badger hair brush likes it a lot also...&lt;br /&gt;  A little goes a long way, use about the size of a small almond and have plenty left over for a full second pass of head &amp; face.</li>
    <li> While I will say that I like the product, I had the misfortune of receiving a damaged product. Upon arrival, the shaving cream had leaked out of the container resulting in almost half of the product winding up all over the contents of my order. Although I am not overly concerned about the mess on the packaging of the other items, since the outer packaging of the other items were being thrown away anyway. Luckily those items weren&#x27;t ordered as gifts, or I would have been more upset. The bottom line is, after contacting the vendor about the damaged product, that they originally offered me a fifty percent adjustment to the price of the item &amp;#34;for my inconvenience&amp;#34; I suppose. They later reneged on their offer of an adjusted settlement and told me that they weren&#x27;t going to recompense me since the order was fulfilled by Amazon, and that they weren&#x27;t responsible. Well, after receiving that message, I decided that the whole debacle just wasn&#x27;t worth all the headaches and aggravation for a lousy fifteen bucks. They can all play &amp;#34;Pass the Buck&amp;#34; with someone else. I will never order anything from them again. This is one of the crappiest customer service experiences I have had. Like the cream, hate the service!</li>
    <li> I love the cream but I do not love this particular scent. In my opinion, this is far superior to Bigelow. Very nice lather. Very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I have never been a great fan of shaving; loving it almost as much as shoveling snow. Having this product has changed my mind considerably. I had no idea the process of shaving could be so easy, comfortable and enjoyable. The cost of this item is incredibly small in relation to the change it can make in the JOY OF SHAVING.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream.  It smells fantastic and works by far better than any other cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Puts out a nice lather, really like the smell. Doesn&#x27;t last very long but that&#x27;s what aftershave is for. Would reccomend this even though it&#x27;s slightly pricier then other options.</li>
    <li> iv had this for about 6 months now and I&#x27;m just about half way done with this product. it works great and a little big goes a very long way. i shave 2-3 times a week and its been great if i ever run out ill order another one lol. just a tad bit gives like 5-7 passes.</li>
    <li> Smells great, better than the more expensive soaps around, and leaves your skin feeling great. Love it. Easy 5 stars...</li>
    <li> Great cream. My wife immediately complimented the smell when I shaved. I was using a cheaper solid puck soap that had a menthol scent to it. This stuff is very slick and produced a superior shave. Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. Smells great too. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have loved TOBS.  I am giving this one a 3 star just because it doesn&#x27;t smell like any of the other sandalwood creams I have used... This smelled like a strong perfume and had to send it back.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of a wooden ship pier, or maybe fresh sawn lumber, then, this is the shaving cream for you!  Of course, Sandalwood has traditionally been a very manly scent.  At first I thought I would get sick of this but it&#x27;s blended nicely.  One thing I&#x27;ve noticed, believe it or not, is that this has a therapeutic effect on me.  It&#x27;s a very calming scent, and it&#x27;s fragranced strong enough to last with you for a few hours if you combine this with the matching aftershave.  For the price, this is a no brainer!  You can spend much more on the other English brands.</li>
    <li> I am almost at a loss for words for how incredible this product is.  It seems strange to say that about shaving cream but nonetheless it&#x27;s true.  I recently ditched my various cartridge razor (TRY THE NEW XL10000 87 BLADE XXXTREME SHAVER!!! SO MANY BLADES!!! RAWRRR!!!!!) setups for a Merkur 38Hd, a badger hair brush, and this brilliant shaving cream.  Never again will I be dealing with the likes of Gillette or Shick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave this product helps to give is fantastic, but what really gets me is the smell.  It is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve stopped wearing cologne because nothing smells as good as this (though admittedly I have a bottle of Aramis on the way to try).  I&#x27;m going to start using every Taylor of Old Bond Street product.  If you&#x27;re looking for a new shaving cream don&#x27;t hesitate to try this.</li>
    <li> When used with Great razor, Great blade, Great Boars Brush, and hot towel, Hard to BEAT!!.  The Fragrance lingers and I have received many coments on how smooth my skin looks.  Thanks Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product, but the consistency is way too thin.  Very little product needed to lather but using the brush with the product this &#x27;creamy&#x27; makes too much, I feel like I&#x27;m wasting it.  Had a previous tub and it was a lot thicker, easier to load on my brush.  This must be a different recipe.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Feels great, smells great!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Lathers very well.</li>
    <li> Now this is authentic shaving cream!  It&#x27;s not one of those you get from a spray can.  You literally need to scoop out the cream by hand/finger.  Yes, it&#x27;s inelegant compared to a spray can but this is how gentlemen shaves!  With a single blade razor, shaving brush, and some real shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a great smell well after shaving.  It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell but it&#x27;s certainly pleasant.  A lot of lather can be made with just a finger tip scoop of the cream.  The shave is smooth and silky as a expected from a shaving cream.  Depending on how often one shaves, 5.3 oz. should last for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it would be cool if the cream was packaged using tin or wood material instead of plain boring typical cheap environmentally unfriendly plastic, but costs would skyrocket if it were.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product yet but please read this warning before ordering!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned if you live in a hot climate before ordering this product. I&#x27;m from Vegas, ordered this in July, by the time it sat in the mail truck all day 100+ degrees, and then my mail box for maybe only an hour it had turned completely liquid from the heat and probably 1/4 to 1/3 of the product oozed out and covered all the other items in my box. (Thankfully they were all shaving related). I rinsed the container off in cold water and put it in the fridge, i will give an update as to if the product is ruined or not, It looked pretty coagulated and separated from the heat when i opened the lid. I don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to just look like a uniform paste or what, so i have no way of knowing if it is ok back at normal temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells nice, though. I will update on if it can be saved.</li>
    <li> Best shave soap I have ever used</li>
    <li> I cant wait to get up in the morning and shave just to use this product. It has an amazing scent to it that makes you feel like you are at an old school barber shop. It creates a perfect lather. Its also shaped so you don&#x27;t need to mix it in another bowl which takes up less space in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> Not much else to say - a good thick lather, lasts a long time.  I&#x27;m not a fan of scents, but sandalwood is ok by me and it&#x27;s a subtle enough one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell all the much.</li>
    <li> Great product! I like the strong scent and the close shave I get from it. I will purchase more when the time comes.</li>
    <li> You are mentally minuscule if you pay the Art of the Shave price after trying this product.  Scent is kinda strong buuut at $15 clams a jar it is great by me! Lathers great...one can lasts me about 2-3 months!</li>
    <li> So far the best soap that I have used. There are a lot of good soups out there this one is one.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff; it&#x27;s all I use, smells great, treats my skin well and I love lathering up with a brush!  Customer for life.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving cream puck.  Works great, wife loves the smell.</li>
    <li> My boyfriends best friend introduced him to this shaving cream. He&#x27;s used it with and without a shave brush, but I think it was made to be used with a brush.  He&#x27;s not even out of it and wants me to order more!!</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving cream after being introduced to shaving brushes and I love it. It lathers extremely well, only need a little bit - I can see this lasting 9 months or more. I love the sandlewood scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering but makes you feel very confident.</li>
    <li> What I like about it is that a little bit on a badger brush goes a long way. You just need a smidge and it creates a robust lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about it is the sandalwood aroma that lingers on my face for hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mmmmmmmm</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaving cream.. it is soft and you need very little on your brush to get a great lather up..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over twenty years and have never found anything better.  Just a tiny dab on my wet shaving brush creates a tremedous and soothing lather for an excellent shave. And I do mean over twenty years...</li>
    <li> This is truly a fine tub of shaving cream. Great fragrance, excellent cushion, smooth glide. Everything you want in a shaving cream. This is my fourth tub of Taylor&#x27;s Sandalwood. Without a doubt, my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It smells excellent. creates a really thick, rich lather. I am really happy with this product</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams are some of the best.  I have tried their avocado, lavender, and sandalwood scents.  I switch between those three for variety, but the quality of the product never waivers.  Typically, a 5 ounce tub of shaving cream will last me 6-8 weeks.  I shave 3-5 times a week, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;Ease of building lather&lt;br /&gt;Small amount goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> Although the cream is very smooth, the jars (I purchased several) are never anywhere near full.  They are less expensive than the same size jars of The Art of Shaving jars of cream, but I think one gets more shaving cream in each jar of The Art of Shaving brand.  This is only an opinion, since I did not actually empty the jars for each brand and weigh the contents.  I changed my rating to one star because my last jar was actually HALF EMPTY!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  I recommend it to others. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some others shaving creams similar to this one.</li>
    <li> I went on a whim and purchased this product. The smell is fantastic and it lathers very well using very little on the brush. I will definitely recommend this product to a close friend and my father since he is a barber.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers up well and has a nice subtle scent.  I wish they sold this as just the soap in different packaging.  Feels a little wasteful to get a new plastic tub each time.</li>
    <li> I love using all the Taylor of Bond Street shaving creams in my barber shop. Good lather and moisturizing. I particularly love the Almond Sent.</li>
    <li> I love smell this stuff while I shave it gives off a cooling feel on my face and does a great job with a boar brush and safety razor. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I used to use The Art of Shaving before, but this I is something else I really loved it. I will buy more of this.</li>
    <li> This makes using a straight razor so much easier</li>
    <li> This is a cream and not a foam, it&#x27;s beautiful stuff. It&#x27;s the cream and not the blades.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, great shave, rinses well.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers great. Nicked myself a couple times and upon lathering it sort of burned, but other than that it&#x27;s an amazing product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year and like it very much. A little bit goes a long way. Just ordered more last week.</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of shave products over my lifetime and this is my favorite.  I used it with a shaving mop and mug and sometimes just the bush and the palm of my hand if I&#x27;m pushed for time.  Great smell and provides a very comfortable shave.  I&#x27;m on my second tub and will order again when that runs out.  A tub last for months.</li>
    <li> &#x27;nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, I received a tub of TOBS Sandalwood Shaving Cream as part of a gift set that included one of TOBS&#x27;s middle-of-the-road badger brushes.  I fell in love with the smell and have since ordered the TOBS Sandalwood Afterhave Lotion (also very good, though I&#x27;d caution any prospective purchasers that the TOBS Aftershave Lotion does not smell the same as the Shaving Cream - it&#x27;s not only stronger, but contains different sandalwood tones).  It lathers extremely easily and generously.  I prefer face lathering because I feel that the lathering process forces me to carefully hydrate my entire beard) and this Shaving Cream is a breeze to whip into a beautiful leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an unsolicited word of advice, if you have sensitive skin, go for the Jerwyn Street Collection.  Through multiple experiments with different razor blades and shaving techniques, I can unequivocally state that the JSC reduces post-shave irritation with virtually any razor blade.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. The old one I used made my skin dry and flakey. This one doesn&#x27;t so I guess I&#x27;m sticking to it...</li>
    <li> You shave with this, and the whole house smells of sandalwood! The wife loves it, I love it! Provides lots of protection, is easy to whip into a nice lather - will buy again! Use with a badger brush - dip your saturated brush tips in the cream and you&#x27;ll be amazed at the lather you get in your bowl - doesn&#x27;t take much cream at all. This will last several months and is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great lather at a good price.  Sent is nice and not overpowering too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sampled 9 of Taylor&#x27;s creams, and the sandalwood scent is definitely my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews are helpful, and all of Taylor&#x27;s cream perform very well, but I would suggest sampling these creams first because of the scents.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream lathers great and doesn&#x27;t require much soap per use (a few dabs on your brush should be good enough for two passes).    The scent is earthy and reminds me slightly of incense. The fragrance will linger lightly after shaving so this could present a problem if you intend to use a different scented aftershave.</li>
    <li> The performance for all TOBS creams is great. But their sandalwood, despite being the most popular, isn&#x27;t a scent I like; too much patchouli. I recommend Eton College instead</li>
    <li> This is the most effective shaving cream I have ever used.  It has an almost lanolin creaminess and, when applied with a brush, produces an incredibly moist, protective lather.  I have not nicked myself once  in a month of daily use.  This will be my only choice from now on.</li>
    <li> Best smelling shave cream I&#x27;ve tried , everyone loves the scent I&#x27;m told.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I love the fragrance on it and I wish it came in a cologne.  The ladies love being around this fragrance.  The cream is rich and lathers well.  Softens my beard for a very comfortable shave.  I highly recommend this stuff.  I guess if there is a down side for me it is price.  It&#x27;s kinda pricey for my budget.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, don&#x27;t even need after shave or cologne even though I never wear it. Lathers nicely with a very tiny amount applied to my badger shaving brush and leaves skin soft and moisturized. I suspect this container will last me several years. Never going back to canned foam again.</li>
    <li> 3 Months, and more than half left...this container has lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cushion ability is great, whips in no time, and the scent is amazing! Price is right for a top brand like Taylor of Old Bond!</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great. I have this four stars because of price. There are SO MANY brands that you can buy that work just as well for a lower price.</li>
    <li> Never owned any shaving cream other than Barbra Sol or the gel Gillette junk. This is way better as far as later and feel. Also, the smell is milder but better to me. Kind of a outdoor &amp;#34;mans&amp;#34; smell or whatever. I like it anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this to check out the different shave soaps that were available.  The product is whipped and was used very fast.  It did what it was supposed to do but not a very good value.  It did smell good, and the jar is great to put another soap in for a travel kit.</li>
    <li> THat&#x27;s what I look like.&lt;br /&gt;I look stirred not shaken.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp not dull&lt;br /&gt;Smooth not red.&lt;br /&gt;Amazin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t I buy this at the store?</li>
    <li> This was a large tub of shaving cream. The odor is not as pleasant as I would have liked. Good shave cream overall. Nice value.</li>
    <li> an excellent cream at a decent price</li>
    <li> The sandalwood scent is amazing! Brings me back to the good old days when shaving were done properly with a straight razor. Try it and you will never go back to those drug store shaving creams.</li>
    <li> Great Shave. Have been using it for at least 3-4 years. Seems to last 2-3 months each container.</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice scent in the morning!</li>
    <li> Its very good with a strong lingering fragrance of sandalwood which is pleasant in the morning.  Compared to other shaving creams which leaves the skin dry, this sandalwood cream is soft and creamy. I love to shave with this cream.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling shaving cream a little goes a long way and softens the whiskers very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loved it.</li>
    <li> The only soap I use. The wife loves the smell, and it is about the slipperiest thing you can imagine.</li>
    <li> classic product smells so good, every morning I&#x27;m looking forward to shave my face. my skin is sensitive and this product makes it feel really good.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favourite and well as being the favourite brand of my sons and son-in-law</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell of this one. Going to try the other cents. Cream has good body and is smooth thought. Seems like quality, just don&#x27;t like the smell of this one.</li>
    <li> I shave just about every other day and have been using this product for the past 4 weeks. I&#x27;m a big fan. Not sure I can ever go back to Edge Gel or anything canned. (Hated how the gel seemed to ooze out when you aren&#x27;t using it.) You don&#x27;t need much cream on the badger brush to lather this on. I typically take a healthy dab of the cream, add some water and I get at least 2 lathers out of it. Which is nice if I think I need to touch up a few of those rascal whiskers. At this pace, it will last me well over a year. I believe it&#x27;s worth the price of admission based on scent alone, but for those that don&#x27;t want to buy shaving cream more often than 6 months at a time, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the most sandlewoody smell, but it works great. Skin is smooth, not irritated, no complaints. Used in conjunction with pre-shave oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality you get for the price. Good lather, helps you get a smooth shave. I am still up in the air in the scent...not bad but I&#x27;m not crazy about it either.  While this cream does not stack up to say, art of shaving products you will be hard pressed to find better value. Oh hey Amazon - STOP PUTTING YOUR LABELS ON PRODUCTS!</li>
    <li> I shaved for the first time with it this morning. I was amazed at how much it makes with a little amount of cream with my badger brush. I got a smooth shave and I shave my face and head.The smell is manly and gets a thumbs up from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving with a double edge razor a year ago and have been trying different creams and soaps. AOS, Proraso, TOB(lavender) and misc. ones. This is one I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think it smells too floral/perfumy (if that&#x27;s even a word) -- my wife comlained that it stunk up the bathroom too.  She never com;lains about my proraso eucalyptus and menthol.</li>
    <li> The best shave cream ever.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years, and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Still using my disposable with this cream. It makes my shave so much closer!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells Good - Tastes Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this stuff already. Coincidentally I now have a staph infection on my face in the beard area. I think I nicked myself and it got in there. Regardless, this stuff tastes good but don&#x27;t forget its probably toxic.</li>
    <li> It is everything I expected. Great lather and excellent shaving experience. Wonderful aroma, love it</li>
    <li> given as a gift to a &amp;#34;first-time double blade razor man&amp;#34;....loves the product.....would absolutely buy this product again!!!</li>
    <li> whips up a fine lather holds a lot of moisture  I use a bowl from the kitchen  even though my daughter yells at me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three years now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a fantastic lather which does not dry on my face during my shave.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is excellent and I pair it with the aftershave and cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you have sensitive skin the sandalwood oil used in this may be too strong.</li>
    <li> it lingers...the entire day...seriously.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is a great shaving cream, but the smell is too strong.  8, 10 hours later..still strong.  If you like sandalwood, then go for it!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I am embarrassed to admit that I was wrong about my initial (one star) review of this product.  I have used it for several months now, and it is my favorite shaving product to date.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: An infinitesimally small amount of this product (3 swipes of the brush around the container) produces voluminous, creamy, slick lather; even with hard water.&lt;br /&gt;I quite enjoy the scent, although it is still quite strong.  The fragrance is pleasant once it is diluted by creating a lather with the very small amount of product needed for an individual shave.  It does smell like the barbershop where I received my first haircut, but that is now pleasantly nostalgic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Buyer beware! I have mysteriously begun enjoying early 20&#x27;s music such as Annette Hanshaw and Ruth Etting, and I cannot definitively determine whether or not there is a causal link to the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREVIOUS REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I touched this cream lightly with my finger to see if the overwhelming old man aroma was just due to a hardened layer on top of the cream, and now the scent is following me around the house despite washing my hands thoroughly.  I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t put it anywhere near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells like the old barber shop where I had my first haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the product so I cannot comment on the quality of shave.</li>
    <li> I always loved the smell of the barbershop in town that I frequent. When I opened this tub, the first thing I thought was &amp;#34;it smells like a barbershop!&amp;#34; I actually just finished that first tub (took a year as my most used cream) and my wife bought me another as an early birthday present. This stuff makes some of the best lather I&#x27;ve ever had from any product, and it&#x27;s cost effective too!!!! If you use that goo in a can, you&#x27;re out after maybe a month or less. This little baby can be your only product, and still go at least 8 months if not longer in my opinion, and I probably use too much. This product is worth every red cent and then some!!!!</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with this product. Have been using this product for week, smells great, does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> hard to beat sandlewood  soap is  good</li>
    <li> Works well and smells amazing! Hubby loves it and so do I!</li>
    <li> Some folks don&#x27;t like the scent, but I do and so does my wife! This is a cream rather than a hard milled soap. You will find you don&#x27;t need a bowl, just a little water on the brush, load the brush right from this self-contained bowl and go to town. One brush load should allow one or two full shaves with two passes. You do use it faster than the milled soap and it&#x27;s a tad pricey, but I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is absoulety incredible! Compared to other name brand creams I have to give Taylor the edge (hehe) It lathers up thick and quick, protects your face on the most aggressive of shaves (merkur futur setting 6 anyone?) and as an added bonus smells great (however it doesn&#x27;t linger) Overall im psyched to try other Bond street scents and products! I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll enjoy the smell, as well as the shave.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this shave cream with a badger brush and Futur razor.  This shave cream works great and a little goes a long way...</li>
    <li> I have never had a closer, smoother shave in my life!  The scent is pleasant and understated.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Don&#x27;t wait. you will be amazed too.</li>
    <li> Great product builds up a rich foam.&lt;br /&gt;lubricates the face  to aid a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Pity the perfume is so mild.</li>
    <li> nice smell and works really well</li>
    <li> The scent of this stuff took a little getting used to for me. Otherwise it&#x27;s a fantastic bargain on a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d ordered a few samples of TOBS, but not in this scent. They were so awesome I decided to try this one, so I went for the full jar because I&#x27;ll definitely use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was not quite what I expected, but it&#x27;s surely grown on me. Now I sometimes smell my badger brush just to get a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of this stuff is out of this world, and maybe the next few worlds. I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving, but I&#x27;ve used several samples of various brands and this is absolutely my favorite. Good lather, no resistance when shaving. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s hind end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff if you want to enjoy your shave.</li>
    <li> Best shave cream I have ever used!</li>
    <li> very nice low key odor, great shaving cream, very smooth texture, great foam, my skin is very sensitive and this particular product really goes a long way to protect it.  Great!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this product and keeps asking for it when it&#x27;s running low to make sure it does not run out. With that said, this little tub lasts a long time.  It really helps him soften his coarse facial hair for easier shaving.  This is a man who was previously adamantly opposed to razor shaving because of shaving bump problem. With this cream he no longer fears the razor.</li>
    <li> I really recommend the TOOBS line across the board. As far as scent goes, it&#x27;s a highly personal choice. I personally prefer the sandalwood, and I have to say - it gets a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has it for as good a price as I&#x27;ve ever found. Occasionally I&#x27;ll see it on the sister site MyHabit for a little lower, but you never know when it will pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After having used foam, tube cream, this one was just great. Good lather. Good fragrance. And this removes, to some extent, the burning sensation. A shaving cream, a after shave lotion (only half true) in one.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and is rather easy and quick to get a rich latter. Price is very attractive as well</li>
    <li> 3 years of wet shaving and this is definitely my favorite cream.  great lubrication, nice light scent and lasts quite a long time.  best price per volume too.</li>
    <li> Just a little dab will do you!  This cream, used with a Badger brush, will last forever!  I use a large bowl and whisk the very smallest dab of cream with the brush and end up with a really thick lather that smells terrific and provides a really smooth shave.  Much nicer than using a shaving soap...and won&#x27;t even mention the superiority to the canned push button soaps.</li>
    <li> While I really love this product the scent is overpowering and it gets int he way of any cologne I might want to use. I really like the close shave I get with this Shaving cream and its easy to build a good foam with a brush. I would purchase again but only if they sell one that has no scent.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is smoth on your skin, an makes shaving a pleasure, I recamend this product as a replacement to regular shaving cream</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best shaving cream ever!! I have used a lot of creams to get that perfect shave with no irritation. Look no more this is it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have not tried Taylor for years use to buy it when I was in Ireland years ago for 2 years, I forgot how great is is.  Nothing better than a good cream, nice as it was in 1975-1977</li>
    <li> Arrived unsealed, and the cream appears...used?  Maybe it melted.  But it smells terrible!  I just finished my previous jar of Taylor of Old Bond St (which smelled great and had an excellent lather), and this crap is NOT the same.  Will not buy this online again.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent. I just wish it would stick around longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of the price I have been using the Art of Shaving for years I find that the Taylor product is too watery it drips off of my brush. Lots of water that&#x27;s is why it was cheaper</li>
    <li> Great stuff, lathers well, smells good</li>
    <li> fast shipping ...very little needed on shaving brush....cremes up really well...has a great scent...makes shaving a breeze ..using a slant bar and straight razor.already ordered 2 more</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I previously used the normal Edge type products and they worked ok but I always struggled with my sensitive face...finally gave this stuff and the badger brush a try and Wow!  I could not have told you what Sandalwood smelled like before and I am indifferent to it now...don&#x27;t really love the smell and don&#x27;t dislike it but after I shave and wash my face the smell is gone therefore not a big deal either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value with this stuff is incredible...one of these jars will last 9-10 months!  I think there is some benefit to either the ingredients or the badger brush stimulating your skin as I have had very few issues after making the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try...so inexpensive even if you disagree you have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap. Smells like an exotic baby powder. Shaves close, keeps skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
    <li> I will have to concur with many of the other reviews here.  As is expected of Taylor of Old Bond Street, this is an excellent shaving cream.  It lathers up very well, and without using much product at all.  It is smooth and slick, provides excellent protection while shaving... but the only complaint is the scent.  I saw a lot of talk about how it reminds people of old barbershops and is manly and sophisticated.  It smells like \\&quot;old man.\\&quot;  There&#x27;s really no other way to describe it.  The smell is very strong, and lasts for hours and hours.  I realize that&#x27;s a personal preference, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell and will end up giving this jar away.  So far, I haven&#x27;t found anyone else that can tolerate it either.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just over a week now and I am very happy with it. I love the scent. The cream lathers up very easily both in a bowl or if applied directly to my face and whipped with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this again and plan on trying some of the other available scents.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this stuff smells. I tried Truefitt &amp; Hill Trafalgar for a while. It was a nice product but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell. I bought their sample pack to see if I would like any of their other fragrances but none of them were that appealing to me. So I went back to Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood. The Sandalwood was a little strong at first but now I&#x27;m used to it and like the smell a lot. I should mention that this product should be very soft in the container. When I received my first container, it was hard on top so I was using it like a hard soap, mixing lather in the container. Only until I broke through the hard top layer did I realize that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be that way. My most recent container, the one I&#x27;m reviewing now, was perfect. The consistency was a nice fluffy paste, as it should be. You only have to use such a small amount to shave with. I didn&#x27;t realize how little you can get away with using. By just dipping the very tips of my Synthetic Beauty Strokes H.I.S Shaving Brush, I can complete a two pass shave without issues. (That&#x27;s a great brush if you don&#x27;t like killing badgers for shaving.) I would advise you to really experiment to see how little you can use to shave. Again, great product.</li>
    <li> excellent produce ...gives a closer shave...wil buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells like an old barber shop.</li>
    <li> I found the product very useful and lives up to the expectations. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is great, just a vey small amounts goes along way, and makes for the very best lather and is so smooth on the face and really makes shaving a pleasure. Not to mention that the plastic unit that the cream comes in is very strong and the perfect travel case bar none. The best cream I have used yet and well worth the money that you will spend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now, and have been very satisfied with the shaves I get. Well worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought it for my fiance for the holidays and he can&#x27;t get enough. Its such a subtle pleasant smell very sensual... only I can smell it when im close to his face. He can&#x27;t wait to shave now! Highly recommended it. Great service and fast shipping. Will be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> Just getting into better shaving products. Still a cartridge razor guy. Will never step up to straight razor. This stuff is great. Smells clean and  gives a great shave. The learning I mentioned is on how little of the product is needed. I am sure some guy somewhere has completely covered his face with a handful of this straight out of the jar. I am not that guy. I did prep it with a brush but still used too much. It continues to lather. Absolutely no complaints. It is OK for sensitive skin. I used C.O. Bigelowe&#x27;s green tube as well. Which is same as Proraso I understand, and the eucalyptus is too much for me. It doesn&#x27;t break me out or anything but it is too &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; for me. This product gives same lather and smoothness but just feels better. I believe Avacado is next flavor I will try.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers like crazy, leaves your skin smooth, and the tub will last years, the last shaving cream I will ever buy, period.</li>
    <li> I like how it smells and that I can put on however much I want easily with a scoop. It gives me a nice shave and it smooth on my skin. It&#x27;s a little more watery than I expected and I would wish it was more lathery and foamy. It&#x27;s still my favorite shaving cream so far and I plan to keep using it as a brand loyal customer.</li>
    <li> While more expensive than a traditional shaving soap, I consider this product to be a worthwhile luxury to have.  It smells great without being overpowering, and gives an amazing lather when used with a badger brush.  One thing to note though, however small of an amount you think you need to use, you probably need even less.  I find that barely touching the tip of my brush gives more than enough for a full rich lather.  Given that, this small container will last a surprisingly long time when you only use as much as you need.  Experiment with it when you get it and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond reminds me of the time I went with my grandpa to get his hair cut and straight shave. I used to go with my grandpa when I was six years old all the time when he needed a haircut.  I always remember the scent that came from the barber shop the exact same scent Taylor of Old Bond produces.  The cream leaves it mark on your face through its scent. I love this cream!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried both the leading creams and this one is considerably better. The scent (personal preference) and the foam are much better. I have moved on to soaps but this is a very good buy!</li>
    <li> This product works fine. Goes on smooth and rinses off my razor easily. I would recommend this product. The only downside is that it is strong scented but I disagree with the one reviewer when he calls the scent &amp;#34;ashtray&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Just started the classic shave with the sandalwood shaving cream. This cream with a decent badger hair brush lathers incredibly easy. I love the scent and it does last a long time, so I smell fresh and clean for a long time. I would disagree that it is an over bearing odor as some other reviewers have shared. My wife loves the smell and likes to snuggle up after a fresh shave. I guess if your single and grew your first peach fuzz you can stick to your disposable razor and shave cream that you got in a puberty class. Again this shave cream lathers great, makes a smooth shave, and my lady loves the masculine scent. As long as she is happy I&#x27;m happy, and I&#x27;m very happy! Man up fellas, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I started using a brush to lather up last year, after 30+ years of using canned creams.  Started off with Art of Shaving, which was great, but just a little pricey.  Saw reviews here on Amazon for Taylor of Old Bond Street and I&#x27;ve got to say this product is awesome.  I think the Art of Shaving Sandalwood scent is a little more natural (this one doesn&#x27;t smell very Sandalwood-y), but it doesn&#x27;t matter: I love the smell.  I&#x27;ve seen comments here about the scent being too strong, but - dude -- you wash it off when you&#x27;re done.  My wife can&#x27;t even smell the shaving cream when I&#x27;m done and I put on a splash of lightly-scented aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - great lather, great price, great scent, great product.  Buy it without reservation.</li>
    <li> Great sandalwood smelling shaving cream, lather&#x27;s really easily.  I know it seems a little bit pricey for this little tub, but you really need barely any at all to get a good lather going.  I have to shave every day I work and one tub lasted me a long time.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from block soaps to cremes, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I went through a tube of Prorasso&#x27;s sandalwood, and it was great, but this is better. It&#x27;s thicker and requires less creme to build a good lather, and the lather (for me at least) is superior as well. The scent is very nice. I&#x27;m considering getting a tub of a different scent and mixing it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem a bit expensive, but a dab&#x27;l do ya and this tub will last me a very long time. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> The Tobs cream works great for shaving gives a slick clean shave  and the scent to me is fantastic. This Tobs cream is very easy to lather and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the lather you need. I&#x27;m going to purchase more plus I&#x27;m going to try Tobs Mr. taylor.</li>
    <li> Broke out in rash after first use. Thought it might be a fluke or straight razor burn (which I&#x27;ve never heard of), so I switched back to my regular lather for a shave. Tried again and rash was even worse! Looked at the ingredients conveniently hidden under the sticker and was alarmed to find a long list of chemicals. Picking just ONE of them to lookup, found that it was a boat paint ingredient. Nice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware. I gave two stars because the lather was awesome and I love the smell of Sandalwood.</li>
    <li> I mean come on, I&#x27;m paying so much for it and is smells like **** . The soap itself it good and the jar is pretty big for the price. It works great with my badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to go with some other brand next time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who don&#x27;t care about scent and just want to get a great soap get it. I have nothing against it just smells awful...</li>
    <li> I always thought I was more of a lavender scent type of guy, but after trying this cream out it quickly became my favorite. The scent is simply amazing. The quality is what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Taylor of Old Bond Street: Smooth, creamy, produces a lot of lather, and feels amazing on my skin every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really sells me on this is the smell, though. I just can&#x27;t get over how much I like it!</li>
    <li> This is worth the money. Nice lather and the fragrance is not too strong as some have said.  The shaving results were excellent and a vast leap from the cut price creams.</li>
    <li> I have always used shaving gel from a can.  This was my first experience with this type of shaving cream, and I am glad I tried it.  You only need a little bit, and it lathers up great.  It smells like you&#x27;re in a barber shop, and it provides great moisture for my face.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my shaving life?!?!?! I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Creates a great lather, as long as your water isn&#x27;t too hard. Smells great, but isn&#x27;t overpowering. Only have to use a little bit to get a good amount of lather, so it should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Great smell and lathers well.  Container seals well enough to use while traveling!</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing, the lather is great, and it promotes a fantastic shave. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I love the smell.  I use it with a cartridge razor and my safety razor.  Fantastic with both.  Very surprising.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product. Loads well on the brush, lasts a very long time, and quality sandalwood scent that isn&#x27;t overly strong.  Most importantly, it drastically improves all types of shaving. I use it with my straight razor, but at times have needed to use it with a normal razor.  The difference is extraordinary. It&#x27;s a very high quality product that lasts a long time and makes it easy to create a quality lather.</li>
    <li> This stuff is all I use now.  Great smell and leaves your skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Smells great and greats and lathers up well. Unlike other shaving cream I&#x27;ve used hasn&#x27;t caused any problems at all.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, Not too strong, yet very fragrant. It is very thick and lathers MUCH better than soap. I you like sandalwood and a good lathering cream, look no further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little dab will do ya!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great. Has he consistency of lanolin cream.</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice thick foam and tasteful perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the sandalwood and the lavender.  The sandalwood has a good smell.  It lathers nicely and lasts a long time.  The lavender I don&#x27;t care for.  I will use it up and go back to the sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality cream. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Recently started wet shaving. This is the first cream i bougt and thoroughly enjoy using it. Smells great and more importantly lathers up real nice. Just ordered a Proraso soap as well. Threw my can of Edge in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product, creates a great lather and is soo much better than any of the canned gels you get at the store</li>
    <li> This is great stuff and brings back some of the memories of when I actually enjoyed shaving (think being a teenager in the Army). It&#x27;s remarkably rich and a good deal considering how little of it you need to use. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to shaving cream. Lathers really well even when I don&#x27;t prep much, perfect amount of a terrific scent. Price is reasonable and the tub lasts me seemingly forever.</li>
    <li> I like shaving with cream and a DE blade when i have the time.  Kids really dig when dad does this.  Cream creates a nice lather and doesnt leave my face feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I use this combined with a hockey puck in my cup. Works fine. Good shaves.  Haven&#x27;t found a shaving cream that I find head and shoulders above all others. This is a very good product and value.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shave cream that produces a rich lather. I have a few of their scents, avocado is my favorite . My wife thinks the sandalwood smells like a &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; but I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband. I love the scent and a smooth, conditioned and well-groomed face!</li>
    <li> Really good stuff.  Goes on well and leaves wonderful after fragrance for a good while.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from shaving with expensive cartridge razors to using a single-blade safety razor.  It&#x27;s a far better experience and makes shaving pretty enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing the research before making the switch, one of the things I learned is the shaving soap or cream is very important.  That blue or green or foamy stuff you buy in your local grocery store or warehouse store is just chemical junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any blade shaver, you want a good-quality natural soap or cream, a mug and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream now for several months.  My first impression was the scent... it&#x27;s a clean, masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with your cologne.  My lady loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was how much better my face felt after shaving.  It feels like this cream lubricates my face better than the gel I was using before and everything just feels better.  I can&#x27;t say why... it might just be a mental thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I noticed (mainly because I didn&#x27;t remember what I had read until I had been using this a while) was that you really don&#x27;t need to use much of this stuff at all.  Get a good badger hair brush and a mug.  Put a little water (very little) in a mug, put a spot of cream on the brush about the size of a nickel.  Use the mug and brush to build a nice lather and then use circular motions on your face to get it covered and then against-the-grain strokes to make sure it gets under the beard... this will also create a nice thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I don&#x27;t have to use much, this bowl is going to last me for a long while, so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> Greatest Of All Time. If you manage to cut yourself with this shaving cream, you should consider Nair. This stuff creates a smooth shave and leaves your face smelling manlier than it had 10 minutes prior. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving cream I have tried since I started wet shaving, and I can&#x27;t believe how much I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves the scent of it when I shave (even if she is nervous that I don&#x27;t use a Mach 3 or some such) and I want to try the rest of the scents to see if there are and I like even better.&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on Taylor of Old Bond Street, and I will be purchasing fr them again.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood smells great, the shaving cream lathers up nicely, and I get a great shave. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> has to be one of the best shave creams ive used</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. My first purchase was in London at their store and I had to carry it all back home.I bought a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other similar products,but, nothing even comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Applied with a brush, you will even use less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their brush line is excellent,expensive,but, they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Sandlewood &amp; the the St.James Collection.</li>
    <li> This was my first time not using a canned cream and i like this much better. I fell like it is alot smother and got a loser shave because of it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, and has a rich and dense lather that spreads evenly. This has led to much less shaving irritation which I really haven&#x27;t been able to avoid till now. Taylor of Old Bond Street is like the 007 of shaving creams. It is not only the best, but also the most sexy.</li>
    <li> This soap works well. I haven&#x27;t used any other shaving soap so my review is just how this stuff works. I get a nice lather with a badger bristle brush in a mug and a couple drops of water after soaking and shaking out the brush. Smells very nice, similar to Safari cologne. I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor, was unhappy with those mega blade refill cartridges, this is working much better for me thus far. Still trying out new blades to see what I like.</li>
    <li> I have wet shaved for too many years to recall primarily using shaving soap.  Not truly happy with the results I was getting I began looking at some alternatives and after looking at a number of alternatives and reading their reviews, decided to try this. I have not had one single regret! The difference has been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the same razor (a multi-blade schick) but I am getting the most comfortable and smoothest shave I have ever experienced.  Not oince, but every single day. The difference has been unbelievable. It is not often a product impresses me enough to write about it. This did, going beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a regular order from now on.</li>
    <li> Ordered this cream on the recommendation of my barber. Regular canned shave cream drying out my face and I don&#x27;t care for gels. Being an advocate of traditional shaving I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;The shave it amazing! Skin left feeling smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Has a manly, &amp;#34;Old School&amp;#34; scent which leaves me feeling as though I just walked out of the Barber Shop.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product with a Tweezerman boar hair brush and my trusty Gillette safety razor (same razor for 15 yrs).&lt;br /&gt;A very little goes a LOOONG way.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on ordering some other fragrances just for some variety.</li>
    <li> Smells good, and works better.  I&#x27;ve tried many shave creams and this is right at the top!  Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> It smells great but its not a cologne. Does not create a foam or lube my face. Pretty disappointed. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is fine project for us old time shavers....&lt;br /&gt;lasts a long time too - get a good brush too.</li>
    <li> Very nice, less irritation when using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for approximately 1 month now and I love this product.  I previously used gillette shaving cream and my skin would feel burned after shaving and my neck would get especially red.  I saw this product recommended on the Art of Manliness and decided to try it.  With this product, I do not have the burning sensation nor is my neck red after I shave.  I have seen other reviews that say the smell is overpowering but I have not found this to be the case.  It does have a strong smell but by the time I am finished shaving I do not notice it and my wife thinks its smells good.</li>
    <li> Dad seems to like it and he likes the case for traveling- no more can of shave jell in the nasty ziploc back in his luggage.</li>
    <li> The shaving cream is very easy to lather up. The smell is not overbearing, and I had no irritation from using it. It lasts a very long time. Not much is needed to create a perfect lather.</li>
    <li> I tried this shaving cream twice just to make sure I didn&#x27;t like it. I found it dried quickly on one side of my face while I was shaving the other side, which made my razor gum up. It doesn&#x27;t rinse easily from my razor, and isn&#x27;t as slippery as stuff I can buy in the drugstore. It also gets weirdly stringy, like some kind of melted cheese. Overall I don&#x27;t like it, it doesn&#x27;t prevent razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like is that it has a nice odor.</li>
    <li> With a great smell and easy use this is a great cream to work with.  Be mindful of the amount you use, as you can easily waste it.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD CREAM.  HARD TO USE WITH THE&lt;br /&gt;BRISTLE BRUSH.  I SUPPOSE WE NEEDE INSTRUCTIONS&lt;br /&gt;ON PROPER USE OF THE CREAM.  LIKE THE SMELL AND&lt;br /&gt;THE CONTAINER FOR THE CREAM.  THANKS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream for a couple years now.  Much better than the harsh stuff you get in spray cans.</li>
    <li> Well...what can i say....When I opened the Amazon box, the room istantly filled with music from the 30&#x27;s. The cream itself smells nice but it seems to have a heavey after smell that instantly makes you think..&amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;. Also, the tub was about half full when it arrived. Perhaps the heat of shipping caused the cream to condense?? Who knows. Not really for me I guess but was worth a shot. And hey...if you have an evening lined up that includes bingo at the rec center than this stuff is for you.</li>
    <li> Lathers wonderfully, and has a delightful smell.  When I used to go to barbershops as a kid, this is what I smelled, and it really takes me back.  Fantastic, rich, soft lather that feels very nice, and gives a nice protection when shaving.  I found my new permanent shaving cream, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....slick with good post shave results........and scent last a long time</li>
    <li> This is the fourth scent my husband has tried. We both prefer the Eton College scent by a hair, but this is a great option as well. If you like sandalwood, it&#x27;s spot on. Same great quality as all the other scents. Easy to use and perfect consistency. My husband won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and it is excellent.  The consistency and lather making ability are perfect, and the bowl seems to last a very long time. You only need a small dab, as ling as you&#x27;re using a good quality brush (Badger hair...there is no substitute).  I shave in the shower, and leave my tub of shaving cream covered on a small shelf in the stall. I generally wash my face briskly and thoroughly, grab my brush and lather up.  I actually shave twice...once with the grain, and the second time against the grain.  The Sandalwood always provides excellent lubrication, and leaves my face smelling and feeling wonderful.  My wife likes it as well, always stroking my face and saying it is as &amp;#34;...soft as a baby&#x27;s bum...&amp;#34;  The seller is also prompt.  My order is always delivered on time and intact.  I usually order two at a time.  I keep one in my travel case, one in my shower, and always have one in reserve.  I was once told that men are fortunate, because daily shaving is like a daily exfoliation that women pay for as a pampering.  I think that we men should pamper our faces in the same way, and Taylor Sandalwood Shaving Cream does it for me.</li>
    <li> great shaving cream smells good lathers well for smooth shave</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this for me for my birthday. I use it every day and love it.</li>
    <li> A great shaving cream! The scent is nice, but not too strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I just love the smell.  It will leave your skin very smooth and silky feeling.</li>
    <li> Like everything about this especially the scent.</li>
    <li> Builds up just the right amount of lather to shave with, plus it lubricate r your so well that you don&#x27;t even feel the blade on your face.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving cream I ever used not from a can. It was a gift with my new straight razor and after much bloody trial and error, I learned to use it efficiently. After my initial supply ran out, I tried half a dozen other lathers. None compared with this. None even came close. I am not a man of extraordinary means, but this product is infinitely worth the cost and one that I have become immensely fond of. Highly recommended both by myself and anyone who gets close enough to enjoy the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells funny, works great!</li>
    <li> Do you want to smell as manly as the day is long?  Then grab some of this, brush it on your face and shave it off with a mans razor.  Kick your Edge Gel and 4 bladed monstrosities to the curb and start shaving like a man does, with some Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream and a safety razor.  As an active duty military member I need to shave every day.  Every freaking day. So as much as I want to grow a beard and let me hair grow enough to cover up my ever growing bald spot, I can&#x27;t.  I spent far too much time looking for something that will not irritate my sensitive skin, and I finally found it.  This stuff, combined with the proper razor gets your face so smooth a blind man would mistake you for a prepubescent boy.  Provides a thick lather, much better than the pale imitation the Art of Shaving will give you, and protects your face as you try your best not to cut it.  Plus, new research shows that your skin has scent receptors and the smell of Sandalwood oil increases your skins ability to heal itself.</li>
    <li> The shaving cream lathers well and comes in a convenient bowl limiting handling. It softens the beard to provide a close comfortable shaving experience. It makes shaving a pleasant way to start the day; what more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving and was told by many many people to try this brand out.  My goodness am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great, it lathers quickly in hard water, it will leave you feeling nice a smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is just awesome, it smells so nice.  For the guys: After using this, I have had two girls tell me that I smelled sexy, and asked what cologne I was wearing, then I told them that it was my shaving cream!  Be sure to pick some up, boys!</li>
    <li> I was looking to an alternative to the Art of Shaving Sandalwood Cream. While I like that cream, it&#x27;s price was just too much. Thought I would give this a try an was shocked. It feels much smoother, with better glide. I also feel like you can use less to create the same lather, so it should last longer.  And the cost was much better. Really liking this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great smell and lathers up very nicely. I wish it had more natural ingredients but it does work well.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have thick facial hair I think you will do just fine with Gillette brand, but if you have thick hair and it grows from all different directions look no where else. I tried all sort of brand, Neutrogena, Clinique etc but nothing like Taylor of old bond street. All you need is small amount in a bowl and work it that is all. I won&#x27;t never go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> The tiniest amounts makes the fullest, richest lather.  And it smells fantastic--masculine. Just a great shaving experience</li>
    <li> This is one of the best choices I ever made for my shaving comfort. Just by switching from the chemical goop to this I improved the closeness of my shave and reduced razor burn noticeably. It smells fantastic, however it is quite strong so I recommend an aftershave that smells similar or at least complements the sandalwood fragrance in this cream. I use Pinaud Clubman (nice old school aftershave that won&#x27;t make you smell like an old man) and that complements the scent in this cream very nicely. Will definitely be buying another tub once this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Nice cream and lathers well but it dried out my skin.  Had to return.  Might have worked with a  follow up aftershave balm.</li>
    <li> Smells over engendered. And works for crap. Proraso is what I use now.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; provides great slickness and cushion.</li>
    <li> This is likely the best shaving cream ever devised. not only does it prepare you for a good shave it actually ups your level of sophistication for about six hours. You gravitate towards polo matches and in the store you go to the wine section instead of beer. If you use it regularly you run the risk of developing a Sean Connery like British accent so you may need to rotate it with another product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely and you don&#x27;t even need a bowl. Love the clean smell afterward. Gives a good shave. Reminiscent of a bygone era.</li>
    <li> Smells manly and last forever. Helps give a great shave.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving cream!  Much better than other shaving creams that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of this product however it is significantly better than a brand I got at Target called African Black Soap Shave Butter Creme. This Sandalwood Shaving Cream is a few dollars more expensive, but it lathers up with significantly less effort, and lathers up to a far more rich foam than the cheaper brand I bought when I started shaving with my safety razor. I almost thought that I was destined not to be one of the people to get a lather, but this works wonders and lathers. Before I had to soak my shaving cream throughout a shower with hot water. This one applied to a soaked brush only and I don&#x27;t feel like I used any different amount. Way better and I look forward to months of great shaves from this one!</li>
    <li> I wish I could link the Taylor of Old Bond Street line into this review, because the whole sandlewood line of pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and the aftershave is phenomenal. They cost more than some other products, but you can tell right away that they are a higher end line. Everything from the scent, to the rich lather of the shaving cream to the soothing coolness of the aftershave makes shaving a joy. Though the initial cost is a bit more, the products seem to go a long way. For example with the aftershave, a pea sized dollop on the finger is enough to cover your whole face and then some. Very impressed. Also, the ingredients are all things you can pronounce which separates this product line from the typical drugstore stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes great lather.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s honestly just the best stuff a man (or woman?) can put on her face to shave with. It works extremely well, but honestly my favorite part is the smell.    The scent is just perfect. It is a classic, manly smell and makes you feel like your face probably smells like David Beckham does all the time; great, but in a classy way that says, \\&quot;I&#x27;m not a douche, I just happen to smell really awesome right now, but not in an overpowering way that some other shave cream / aftershave might cause.\\&quot;    Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good! It&#x27;s the classic, masculine smell that you probably are already looking for if you&#x27;re reading this. Using a brush, I get a really good lather with very little effort. The tub is also considerably bigger than I expected. I was so impressed with this product that I have just ordered the same brand but with a different scent. I go into stores like the Art of Shaving and they charge three times as much for their cream. I&#x27;ll stick with this brand now for sure!</li>
    <li> Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street makes the best shaving products, IMHO.  I&#x27;ve tried the others but the Sandalwood and St. Charles Shaving Creams and After Shaves are the best smelling.  Helps me get started in the morning and always gets a nice comment from someone I run into.  The store in London is a lot of fun (and a great place to get a professional shave, btw) but it is a long way from me.  Glad that I can get this product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very good shaving cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks now. Using a badger brush and a mug with this product produces lots of lather, very little cream is needed to cover your face several times and my girlfriend loves the scent of it.    Several reviewers said the scent is bit on the strong side, but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to the aerosol odor you get with canned gels and creams, and it serves a nice, invigorating start to the day. The sandalwood scent stays with you most of the day, but isn&#x27;t overpowering.    I used this with both a Schick Hydro 5 and safety razor, and it performs well with both setups. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re a classic kind of guy or someone who likes the brush, but not the blade, it&#x27;s refreshing and luxurious after a hot shower.    Take some me-time with this stuff. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve got at least another month out of this tub, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily since it arrived. It&#x27;s a good buy all around.    I&#x27;m giving this four stars because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try other shave creams like this, with the exception of a tube of C.O. Bigelow shaving cream. That also works well with a brush and a mug, but I feel like this performed better all around.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nice, and smells great.</li>
    <li> Best lather ever!&lt;br /&gt;I tried Proaso and that cannot compare to the Taylor!&lt;br /&gt;They are like night and day and I will only now use Taylor Old Bond!</li>
    <li> The smell is not that strong I guess some people have sensitive nasal passages, I love it, creates an easier lather with my badger brush then a hard soap, smell is great, leaves a nice smooth feeling on the skin, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different soaps and creams, I keep going back to this one. It has a very pleasant scent, and produces a great lather.  This soap seems to make my face more slick during shaving as well.</li>
    <li> This produces a great fragrance and a nice rich lather, It&#x27;s my first time buying Taylor but I was convinced to try it out after the many positive reviews on some popular shaving forums.</li>
    <li> Throw out all of your aerosol shaving creams!  Step back in time and get a great shave without irritation.  I despised shaving until I went back to using a safety razor and this cream.  The sandalwood scent is very nice and not overpowering.  My wife approves :)</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend along with a Merkur 180. He loves it, and it smells awesome. The jar broke and he had to scoop it into a tupperware container, which was a little unpleasant. Don&#x27;t know how common that is, but it shouldn&#x27;t really deter you anyway.</li>
    <li> Bad smell. Like others have said..&amp;#34;old man smell&amp;#34; Too much perfume.</li>
    <li> Oh dear.  My husband has just started getting into this old school shaving thing and this shaving cream smells divine.  It is masculine and clean smelling, not to strong.  Very sexy.</li>
    <li> A shaving soap with a pleasant masculine aroma and well lubricating ingredients.  suggest you use it with a quality shaving brush</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for two years now, and I have developed quite a collection of shave soaps and creams.  I have now been shaving with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream for about a month, and it has become my favorite shaving cream.  Normally, I like to rotate through about 5 of my favorite soaps and creams, but since shaving with TOBS I haven&#x27;t used any of my other stuff.  TOBS smells great and provides a nice, slick shave with absolutely no irritation.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just wow. This stuff is of a whole different caliber, truly a magnificent product. I feel like such a gentlemen after using this stuff. The smell is borderline addictive and lingers on your face, adding to the clean feeling of a fresh shave. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Best Sandalwood scent of them all. Robust yet not overpowering. My wife lover it. Nice thick lather and easy to load on brush. It&#x27;s a cream after all. Nice lather. Leaves skin soft post shave.</li>
    <li> Good cream, much cheaper than using shaving gream from aerosole cans.  I&#x27;ve been converted, and will never go back.  Havn&#x27;t noticed any problems with the scent, I actually like it.</li>
    <li> That old man smell will stick with you all day and most of the next. Wish they had samples</li>
    <li> I purchased this shave cream for myself and one for my best friend as a gift. The lather is amazing and I have yet to have a better shave with another cream. My girlfriend loves the scent and the best way I could ever think to describe it is this is what Clint Eastwood smells like in my mind. Don&#x27;t hesitate, pick this up and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> Love TOBS shaving creams. This one is strongly scented and will probably interfere with your cologne or aftershave. I personally love the scent, but my kids tell me I smell like Grandma&#x27;s house. She happens to have Sandalwood soap in the bathrooms at all times, so not necessarily a bad thing. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will most likely try another scent next time around until I find my favorite.</li>
    <li> Purchased this the first time in London at the Bond Street store - glad to find it here.  Great shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells great. Whenever I smell this it makes me look forward to shaving, something I&#x27;ve never done before.</li>
    <li> My wife said that this shaving cream reminded me of her grandfather&#x27;s aftershave. I can see why because it smells like an old school barber shop because it has that old aftershave smell. I love it and the wife loves it so it is a keeper. Nothing has to be said about the quality of Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving creams, they are the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic. Creates a really nice lather that works very well for safety razor use. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Makes a great lather, comes in a really nice reusable tub and the lady loves the smell of it.  What&#x27;s not to like!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for several months as a replacement for the Art of Shaving cream. He likes it and enjoys the $ savings!</li>
    <li> smells great, easy to use, but lacks the suds of other brand(s).</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I have ever used.  I have been using shaving creams since 1977, when I first was stationed aboard a submarine.  This shaving cream has a great fragrance and it will last a customer for a couple of years or more.  It only takes a small amount (about what I get when barely touching wet bristles to the surface of the soap) to make a thick and aromatic lather.</li>
    <li> This is the first shave cream I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using shave soap and this creates a rich, thick and smooth lather.  The razor glides over the skin like nothing I have experienced before.  The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t linger for very long, a good thing in my opinion.  This tub will last a long time since it doesn&#x27;t take much to make enough lather to complete three or four passes and not feel much, if any irritation from the shave.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and leaves you with an A+ shave.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using the product for years to come.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my man without knowing what I was in for...GREAT smell and it left his face VERY smooth!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the number of positive reviews, but I should have heeded the earnings about the dated odor. I agree with many of the reviewers that this will make you smell like an older gentleman, which may or may not be what you want. Be warned though, that whatever Sandalwood scent there is in the product is fleeting, and you are left with a rather musky base which sticks around like an unwelcome house guest. Even at 24 hours, I was smelling this stuff strongly when I woke up, and by that point, it was making me a little sick to my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I really wanted to like this product, as it lathered and shaved well, but the scent is just not for me, and if you are below a certain age group, I would exercise caution before buying this tub. I&#x27;m wising up and ordering a 14 scent sampler pack so I can figure out what works for me.</li>
    <li> I like this product, have used it before. It won&#x27;t be for everyone - what could be? I like the lather, the creaminess and the smell. I just need the smallest amount to create a great lather too.</li>
    <li> What more can I say? I am a repeat customer. Smells good. Rich and thick lather. I prefer it over the Poraso (which I also have). One good thing with this cream, you don&#x27;t actually need a bowl - it works fine lathered directly to the face or beard.</li>
    <li> There are quite a few options, and quite a few reviews when looking at the real-deal shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on the fence, but pulled the trigger on the Sandalwood and have no regrets. I absolutely love the smell. It does have an &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; smell to it, but I like it. I think it goes with the whole &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; style of the safety-razor I use along with it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy with shaving cream.  I only have to use a little on an Edwin Jagger 1ej946sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush and it works up a nice lather.  It feels good on the face and creates a slick environment for a double edged safety razor.  Every time I open it up I enjoy the smell of the shaving cream.  Even the wife says she likes how it smells.</li>
    <li> This is as good as anything I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried most all of them.  Works best with a brush, but does an acceptable job without as well.</li>
    <li> First off, this is an excellent shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Dip the tips of a brush in and enough lather for two shaves is whipped up in no time.&lt;br /&gt;The lubrication&#x27;s good enough so that I can glide right over the same spot more than once without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent though?  I get not a hint of Sandalwood, to be honest.  It smells more like my mom&#x27;s old aerosol hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;Not terrible and it doesn&#x27;t stick with you after a good rinse at least.</li>
    <li> Great manly type fragrance, nice thick lather, this one container will probably last me a lifetime since it requires very little cream. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works great-smell of product is fantastic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I really like the Sandalwood scent&lt;br /&gt;2. It creates a great lather.  Silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;3. It seems to have a moisturizing affect on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you really dont need to use much of this for a single shave.  Just swipe your finger in and get about the same amount as you would get toothpaste to brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave much in the way of after-scent, but just a hint to compliment your aftershave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap?...&lt;br /&gt;Again, it smells good and makes nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;No cons... It does its job... Well, it&#x27;s a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it.</li>
    <li> I have tried the grapefruit and now the sandalwood.  I really like the sandalwood best and see no reason to change.  The grapefruit lasted me almost 10 months so I am pleased with the longevity.  I shave in the shower with brushing directly to face.  I only swirl a few times with a wet brush and get more than plenty of lather for two passes.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this soap 1 star is because it lathers amazingly, as all TOBS creams do.  -1 star for the scent. It is absolutely not sandalwood.  There may be a drop or two in there somewhere, but there is way too much other floral garbage in there that makes it smell more like shelf brand deodorant.  -1 star for the fact that, whatever that floral garbage is, made my face light up like a tomato.  I looked like I had been standing in the sun with a short brimmed hat that only covered my forehead and nose for about 6 hours.  -1 star for the consistency.  Normally, TOBS creams are very creamy.  This one looked like it was starting to separate or something.  Oily splotches that didn&#x27;t exactly go away as I tried to stir it all up.  I wonder if maybe it was exposed to a heat source somewhere that caused this.  Either way, I had been looking forward to this cream for a long time and was very disappointed when I got it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but other shaving creams are more convenient with tubes.  I continue to prefer using soap with a badger brush to shave when I can.</li>
    <li> Cant fault how it works but the smell is definitely not the best if you are in your 20s/30s.  It has that old man smell you know your dad/grandpa used to have and you know you are going to give off that vibe when you shave with this product</li>
    <li> 5 stars, no more comment needed.</li>
    <li> much easier to use and works better than a can, takes up less space but seems to disappear. the women seem to like it for shaving their legs.</li>
    <li> Great scent and very good lather</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great. I love it!</li>
    <li> This shaving cream does what it&#x27;s supposed to - lathers well and smells good. No residue or slimyness after. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we both love it. It lathers nicely, doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin, and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for my father to try.  It smells truely amazing.  It lathers up nice and thick in the bowl with only a small amount of product, so I feel that it would last for a very long time.  I only marked it as 3 stars because I have pretty sensative skin and this just does not provide as comfortable a shave as the soap I currently use.  That being said, I have read on several shaving sights that people with sensative skin usually prefer soap over cream for this very reason.  If you usually use shaving cream you will probably love this.</li>
    <li> Great product from TOBS. A little on the pricey side but it should last a long time (a liitle is all you need). I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like it, works well. fast shiping</li>
    <li> Great smell and good lather.  I always liked the old British touch (Yankee envy of my better cousins, don&#x27;t you know).  But I have to admit, good old Barbasol (a little shot out of the can and into the shaving bowl), foams up much faster, better and presents a much more substantial cream, applied with a brush - than any of the excellent but more expensive imported shaving soaps.</li>
    <li> Terrific fragrance and great lather.  I will not hesitate to purchase again!</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great, soothes the skin. This stuff is some the best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used (DE shaver).</li>
    <li> Very nice scent - I use this with a Feather razor and Feather blades for a great shave</li>
    <li> I honestly had no idea just how big a difference the right soap could make in straight razor shaving. This stuff works up a great lather (especially with a good brush) and made shaving 100x closer and more comfortable. It&#x27;s got an incredibly classy scent too.</li>
    <li> Just as I ordered and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> The most moist shaving cream ever.  It takes less than a fingernail amount for a full lather.  Will be ordering more when I finish this.</li>
    <li> Holy shnozbot this is great stuff. I am very glad I read reviews and found this shaving cream. It really hits the sweet spot between smelling great and not being overly &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fancy.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been shaving with a brush for the last few years and I&#x27;ve tried a few brands - this is def my favorite. Reminds me of a classy, old-school barber shop where they put hot towels on your face. I&#x27;ll be restocking with the same brand.</li>
    <li> The difference between this product and cream-in-a-can from the drug store or grocery store is like the difference between an off the rack suit and a hand tailored suit.  I ordered this as my second &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; cream during my transition from wasting money on razors every month to the more sustainable and less expensive life long habit of shaving with a straight razor. I&#x27;ve since ordered a couple other creams but this is still by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the straight razor and this shaving cream I realized what I&#x27;ve been missing out on what it comes to shaving for almost four decades now: I&#x27;m supposed to enjoy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to go to a barber to get my head shaved with a razor once in a while; taking time to shave with such a luxurious product feels a bit like that but I&#x27;m in my own home. A little dab of this stuff on a brush will cover your entire head so I&#x27;m guessing the one package I bought will last at least three or four months of every day-ish use. If you don&#x27;t shave your head then it will last you even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not surprisingly, this higher quality item will actually end up costing you less money in the long term. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Just having this container of shaving cream in my medicine cabinet has made it the whole cabinet smell wonderfully. In fact, I&#x27;m wondering if I couldn&#x27;t scent a whole room with one of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, as a shaving cream? Works perfectly. If you&#x27;re new to shaving cream and badger brushes, here are my simple instructions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wet brush in warm water. Ring out excess water.&lt;br /&gt;2. Add small dollop of cream to the center of the brush. Push it down into the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;3. Start with very light, sweeping strokes to get streaks of cream on different areas of your face.*&lt;br /&gt;4. Now start brushing over your face in circular strokes and the cream will foam.&lt;br /&gt;5. Shave.&lt;br /&gt;6. Smell manly good.&lt;br /&gt;*(don&#x27;t be alarmed if the badger brush pokes your face. It feels like that. In fact, you&#x27;ll come to welcome it. Think of it as a man&#x27;s exfoliate.)</li>
    <li> To those who love a proper shave and want a classic example of an Old Style English shaving cream, look no further! I am a fan of sandalwood and Taylor of Old Bond Street does a lovely job at blending Sandalwood with a slight floral undertones for the discerning gentleman. Keep in mind for the scent will be stronger in creams than soaps. Upon receiving it you can smell it even before opening the container. It produces a great lather with just a dollop the size of a silver dollar which will last you around 4-5 passes of the brush and will require very little water. With this in mind a little does go a long way and this will hold you for a while. Bottom Line: I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. 10/10</li>
    <li> The smell is a little strong and I like it but this is a soap I would buy every now and again</li>
    <li> I am loving this shaving cream. And my wife likes the smell as well so It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Has good shave lubrication, but the scent is way to strong and lasts for hours afterwood.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Super. I have been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> While this product works great and delivers a wonderful shave, the smell is just way, WAY too strong!&lt;br /&gt;It is incredibly strong for hours after you shave.</li>
    <li> A1A smell like a beach wood man so good</li>
    <li> Good smell, doesn&#x27;t lather up all that well however.  I tend to stick with my Truefelt.</li>
    <li> My only problem is I couldn&#x27;t find where to put SIX stars.  This stuff is the.......  The lather just explodes, and can&#x27;t wait to use it each morning.  Some have remarked on the smell, to each their own.  I think it&#x27;s great, and my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet, so that could be a good thing too.  Wears in nicely throughout the day as well.  Good price, lasts a long time, fantastic product, put it in the cart already.</li>
    <li> Shaving Cream Bowl-Smells good.</li>
    <li> Great shave cream! Love the scent and one 5.3 tub lasts me 2-3 months. Great shave and well worth the money! Reordered and will continue. Also recommend the aftershave balm.</li>
    <li> Super rich cream with zero effort. Not the greatest smelling sandalwood scent I&#x27;ve ever whiffed, but a classic. One for your collection.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! lasts forever as well. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> It works, just like all the other TOBS, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent. I will definitely not be buying this scent again.</li>
    <li> Does a very good job with a close shave.  Easy to apply with a good brush.  Leaves skin feeling very good.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff. I have several creams and pucks. They are all great. Probably one of the best for their price. Great for DE and Straight shavers</li>
    <li> This product brings back old memories!  I just recently started wet shaving and I was looking for a good cream that made a good lather.  I am glad I found this product and this scent.  When I was in the military years ago, I would come home on leave and hit the local barber shop before I would go back to duty.  The barber would use the straight razor and sharpen it on the leather strop on the chair.  He was an old school barber and used this same scent as I can still remember the smell when he applied it to my face.  I am glad I found it.  I was so happy, I ordered the aftershave as well.  t has an old school smell with a good lather that provides a good close shave.  I am very happy I ordered it and will do so again.  Again,  Glad I got this particular scent.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!!</li>
    <li> this sandalwood shaving cream is outstanding! it smells good and with a nice hot lather leaves your face feeling free and clean, it lathers up really thick for a nice clean shave</li>
    <li> Although I imagine shaving soap would last longer than a cream the ease of lathering from a cream add sense for this newbie.  Ample, easy lather and subtle scent. I&#x27;ll purchase again when I need to replenish my supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several creams and soaps so far (still expanding my collection), but TOBS has been by far the best value I&#x27;ve run into yet.  It lathers very well and very quickly, and it provides a smooth glide for my razor that has yet to be matched by any other product I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YMMV, but I think a lot of people will be pleasantly surprised by this cream.  Its price is pretty modest (not cheap, but it&#x27;s not $30-40 a tub either), and its performance is equal or superior to those pricier products.  I&#x27;ve just ordered a couple other TOBS scents to try out to add a little more variety to my rotation, and I recommend that you all do the same.  If sandalwood&#x27;s not your thing that&#x27;s fine because they have a pretty diverse variety of scents to choose from, and you&#x27;ll definitely find one that suits you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different brands and have always ended up coming back to TOBS. The sandalwood scent is great, and the cream lathers very well. Price is reasonable and it lasts for a really long time. Best shaving cream out there IMO!</li>
    <li> First splurge since starting to shave with a DE. This lathers very quickly and very well. I used a little too much the first time using it, but it really only needs a little bit loaded on your brush. As for the scent, I can&#x27;t get my girlfriend to stop sniffing my face, so that is a plus for me, and her!</li>
    <li> This is one of my first shave cream purchases since wet shaving.  Based on the good reviews for Taylor&#x27;s, I figured I was give it a try and I am very happy that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather this makes is fantastic!  It&#x27;s a nice thick consistency after about a minute of mixing.  It applies well and doesn&#x27;t dry out on one side of your face while shaving the other.  My skin actually feels much nicer after shaving with it (aside from the obvious clean shave), and the sandalwood scent is very nice and lasting, though subtle enough to not be overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be keeping Taylor&#x27;s as one of my regular shave creams.</li>
    <li> I look forward to shaving every day because of this cream!  It lathers nicely and smells wonderful! A little goes a long way (use a bit of water in the lather) so it won&#x27;t be replacing it any time soon!</li>
    <li> Get a badger hair shaving brush, too.  This stuff lasts a long time that way.  Using just your fingers is wasteful.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, shaves great and comes in a screw top secure container so you can take it with you. I highly recommend this product for anyone who likes a good wet shave.</li>
    <li> That says it all.  This is the most delightful shave you can imagine.  The Sandalwood aroma is aromatic and hypnotic. Thank you, Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers nicely. I get a great shave and really enjoy the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried many other creams or soaps but, I really like this one!</li>
    <li> Been using this since early December and am still nowhere near close to finishing the tub (probably have 1/2-2/3 left, shaving every other day)! Smells fantastic without being overpowering, lathers well, lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, looks great sitting next to my shaving equipment... what more could a man ask for!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the texture and fragrance of this cream for shaving. I do prefer this shaving cream over my previous cream by The art of shaving. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream for the safety razor crowd.  The added bowl is a nice addition. You just need a brush to go with this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at protecting my face when shaving with a de blade. I like the smell it reminds of the stuff the barber used to use to shave with a straight blade. The smell is not over powering but does last for a while. I can shave at night before bed and wake up in the morning and still smell it. A small dad goes a long way. If using a brush to mix it up a dad about the size of an almond is plenty to give you enough lather to apply two or three times during a shave.</li>
    <li> I no longer shave with safety razors, but that is no fault of this cream.  It works well, smells good, and is just enjoyable to use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful old timey smell. Lathers and protects well. If you have a thick beard you may need a pre shave oil. Did I mention the smell is wonderful?</li>
    <li> Great smelling shaving cream. Makes a nice rich lather with my Parker brush.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift (requested for Christmas) &amp; recipient is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and have been very pleased. My latest order of it showed up completely melted/in liquid form. To be fair I live in Georgia and it&#x27;s 100 degrees outside today. Hopefully when it solidifies it&#x27;s still a quality product. Note to self... bulk order in the winter.</li>
    <li> I am never going back to a can. And I like the smell the smell is strong.when you are shaving but fades quickly</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  A little bit pricey but of very good quality.  Provides a rich and abundant lather in a very short time, with fine lubrication and skin conditioning. The sandalwood scent is strong, but not overwhelming in my opinion --however, I believe that at the same time that many will be inclined to love it, some will be inclined to dislike it, since the smell is quite distinctive.</li>
    <li> Its exactly what I wanted. Works well, my face feels nice and smooth and smells good</li>
    <li> This cream is a great product!! I have a shavette blade and am still relatively new to straight razor shaving. My old soap bar was rough on my neck, since I have sensative skin in that area. This cream feels fantastic to me! It lathers really well, and smells great, not particularly strong but smells manly, plus as I said before I have sensative skin, and it makes for a great shave!! Definitely recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Just received mine in the mail. Unfortuneately the container was cracked half way around and was leaking. Still able to use it but I have to patch it up. This product is okay. Not my favorite but its way better than what I&#x27;m used to. I don&#x27;t know what to rate it really. I guess 4 on the product and 2 on the preservation via mail.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and has my face super smooth after a shave.</li>
    <li> A classic scent that is refreshingly old fashioned. It does not linger and simply fades away as the day goes by. It makes a perfect lather and is a good deal for around $15-20 considering that comparable brands (Geo F. Trumper and Truefitt &amp; Hill) sell for around $30. Buy it if you want a serious shaving upgrade. Check out the soaps if you want a thinner lather. The Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood aftershave is fantastic as well and pairs well with this cream.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream works well. My biggest complaint is the scent as I have been told it makes me smell like an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;. Other than that it works very well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I won&#x27;t be going back to either soap or the can anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different shaving creams over the last couple years.  This cream lathers very easily.  I get far less irritation with this than I have with other creams and I think the sandalwood scent is very nice.</li>
    <li> This cream lathers exceptionally well even with a lackluster brush, and smells fantastic. The lather also provides one of the best shaves I have had, and can even mask the imperfections of shaving with a sub par blade. A must have for any newcomer to the art of wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy, smells like an old barbershop</li>
    <li> Clean shave and smells great!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of shaving cream and have found this lathers up well, provides good lubrication and is easy on the shave.  As opposed to some comments, I don&#x27;t find the smell too strong.  I use a badger hair brush, soak the brush, shake off excess moisture then use about a dime square portion or less to mix up in my bowl.  Provides enough lather for three passes and have found my shave to be exceptional.  Wet shaving with a good quality razor is very luxurious, although it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to shave, but it is worth it.  Best move I have made for personal grooming.</li>
    <li> The lather and value of the product is very, very good. The smell is refreshing and clean ... but I smell this as &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;sandalwood.&amp;#34; I waited for quite some time to leave this review, and have used nearly half the product (in ~9 months of ownership), both in an effort to see if my thoughts on the scent would change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My container is indeed marked &amp;#34;sandalwood,&amp;#34; yet other sandalwood products smell like sandalwood to me rather than soap, so I believe one of two things has happened here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I received a &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; scent shipped with a &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; lid;&lt;br /&gt;2. The &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; scent of the product line is too subtle for me to detect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given other reviews, I&#x27;m leaning toward #1 at this point. I&#x27;ll buy another tub--because the product is otherwise solid and exceeds my expectations--but will just expect it to smell like &amp;#34;clean soap&amp;#34; and perhaps end up pleasantly surprised with &amp;#34;sandalwood.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this brand of shaving cream.  It has excellent lather, smells great, is parabens free, lasts a long time and is at a great price.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Started shaving with a shaving gel but still had razor burn. The Taylor shaving cream smells great and keeps my sensitive skin protected from razor burns.</li>
    <li> great smell, it does a great job, whips up to a nice foam. i love it. will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving cream.  It&#x27;s incredibly easy to lather, provides good shaving lubrication and leaves my face soft.  However, as others have said the sandalwood is a bit intense for my liking.  My wife calls it my &amp;#34;english man whore&amp;#34; shaving cream cause its quite potent smelling.  I am sold on the Taylor of Bond street brand, but I would pick a different scent if you or others are scent sensitive.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, but dislike the sandalwood fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a grandma house smell on your skin, it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical woody scents.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was just me, but the ladies hate the smell too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and makes my face squeaky smooth.  I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth my skin was after using this cream.  The quality is top notch.  Even the container is made of some fancy thick plastic.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years.  It gives a thick generous lather and one bowl lasts for 6 months.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I had used a shaving cream. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. Applies with either a brush or your fingers and gives a great shave. Also has a very pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> It lathers real easily.  It smells great and makes your whole bathroom smell like a quality barbershop, which I like.  It&#x27;s obviously thick, fine stuff.  I&#x27;m a beginner in fancy shaving and I get a good shave with it and am totally satisfied.       It&#x27;s not a five star review because it&#x27;s not a five star product.  This is day in day out use stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a month and feel good about my shave.  But it&#x27;s not the fancier whipped shaving creams like the Kyoto or the True Gentleman.</li>
    <li> This product produces mounds of fine long lasting lather.  The amount of lather seems to reduces the amount of soap required for each shave.  The sandalwood scent is strong and seems to linger a little longer than I like. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a brush and almost scentless mug soap since 1967.  I tried this product at the urging of my brother-in-law, ugh, bad sign?  He was right, it is very good.  I am waiting to try the \\&quot;unscented sensitive-skin formula\\&quot; next.</li>
    <li> Once this arrived, I immediately went to work on the three day beard I&#x27;d been cultivating since I ordered it. This gives a thick lather, providing a wealth of cushion.  And the scent...it&#x27;s just what I was brought up to believe a man should smell like. It&#x27;s a clean woodsy scent. The tub will probably last me at least a year (triple pass, 3-4 times a week), but I couldn&#x27;t help myself afterr reading more reviews of the Taylor of Old Bond products.  I bought 4 more types just to give them a go.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to shave the old fashioned way.  He loves this shaving cream and I love the smell.  Great buy because it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love all of the TOBS products.  I have tried different TOBS scents, but keep coming back to Sandalwood as my favorite.  Smells masculine without being over powering.</li>
    <li> The scent of this stuff is wonderful.  To me, the scent is a combination of sandalwood and old fashioned soap - just like the old time barbershops!  I absolutely love it.  It lathers quickly and easily.  I&#x27;m a face latherer and I don&#x27;t have any problems whipping up a good lather directly on my face. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and barely scratched the surface.  I expect this tub will last me for months.  5 stars!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shave cream in its price range and compares favorably to others that are twice as much. I like the scent, does not overpower the olfactory senses and has a nice moisturizing affect which lasts most of the day.  It also requires very little to achieve enough lather for several passes and touchups.</li>
    <li> feel good on your skin</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream I have purchased. Light sandalwood smell. This shaving cream enables the razor to glide over your skin.</li>
    <li> Best shave cream ever.  Not cheap and worth every penny.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been shaving like a real man for a little over a year.  Thus, I&#x27;ve tried several different types of everything; creams, soaps, blades, aftershaves, etc.  I keep coming back to this shave cream.  The smell is magnificent and I get a better lather with this than with any other I&#x27;ve tried.  There are others that I like, but this is my favorite.  Worth the money!  Great shave, great scent and will last for months.</li>
    <li> Luxurious shaving cream which reminds you of the old days when shaving was not a &#x27;rushed&#x27; job and definitely not just another chore!</li>
    <li> This is the first brush applied shaving cream I have purchased so I have little to compare it to but I have nothing but positive to say about it. It goes on very smooth and allows the razor to glide comfortably across my face. The smell is great and my wife agrees. I only wish that I would have followed it up with the aftershave to keep the smell going throughout the day. The only part that was unexpected but I suppose thoughtful from the seller / manufacturers perspective was the fact that it comes in it&#x27;s own bowl rather than having to put it in a shaving mug or bowl. I have a nice mug but was unable to use it, but I was also okay with it.</li>
    <li> I had read several reviews regarding various shaving cream products and kept coming back to the Taylor of Old Bond Street.  There was such genuine enthusiasm for the product I thought I would give it a try.  It is absolutely fantastic product -- it lathers extremely well, you don&#x27;t need to work the product like some shaving creams to build a thick, rich lather.  Really makes for a smooth and comfortable shave and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like some of the more generic brands out there.  Sandalwood smells great all day too.</li>
    <li> As per my review of another of Taylor&#x27;s shave soaps, this is the same, (excellent,) with the exception that the fragrance is not one about which I am wild........ smells like the fragrance I have for years associated with the bar soap of my youth; as you know, fragrance, like the looks of a woman, is a personal preference, so don&#x27;t reject any soap cause someone says blah blah bla.... about the fragrance, it may be just the thing for which you are looking......smell wise</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many shaving creams, but when I found this product, it instantly became my favorite.  Lathers beautifully with such a small quantity of product, and the sandlewood scent is light but very nice.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This shaving cream works well. It will load to you brush and creates a lather quickly. I agree with others the scent is on the strong side.</li>
    <li> This product rates right up with more expensive brands.  It has a very nice scent and produces an ample amount of cream for shaving even tough growth.</li>
    <li> I just received this cream and was eager to try it based on all the rave reviews. Indeed, it comes in a great sturdy container (I had to wash it off thouroughly as it got cream all over during shipment), it makes a great foam, softens the hair nicely and in general is a pleasure to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat for some folks, and it&#x27;s a matter of taste, would be the overpowering effect of sandalwood fragrance. It fought through my aftershave balm and chased me for hours. I am not sure if some colgone would help or make it worse. My only hope is that this smell will wear off after a while, otherwise this aspect of the product alone kills it for me.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving soap I have used. Smells really good, very manly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give you the summary right upfront: Lathers easily and profusely. Provides very good glide and is very economical. A fingertip full will give you enough lather for 3 passes and touch up. Moisturizing is not all that and the smell is quite strong and seems chemical to me. I prefer my 3 times more expensive T&amp;H Trafalgar and don&#x27;t find myself reaching for Taylor&#x27;s very often. I have over a dozen creams and soaps. TOOBS is very good except for the smell and it does not moisturize very well. You may like the smell better and if you have oily skin this may be a great shaving cream. Anyway, you won&#x27;t go wrong with it. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, premium shaving creams, whether from England or the U.S., can get very expensive. If it&#x27;s value you&#x27;re looking for in a quality shave cream, you need look no further than Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS to the cognoscenti). This sandalwood has a great \\&quot;manly\\&quot; smell and produces large amounts of creamy, thick lather with very little effort. I&#x27;ve tried many shave creams  (and soaps) and found none better. At this great Amazon price, TOBS represents for me the best value in shaving creams.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t praise enough. A tiny bit goes a long way for a daily shave of at least 2 complete and 4 passes under the chin. The best part is the scent, which for me persists for most of the day. Per wife: \\&quot;simple, pleasant, none of that ornate, flowery crap.\\&quot; Seems to lather better in a cup than directly on the face, but this may be true for all creams. Seriously considering stocking up on this stuff.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream lathers rather nicely and the scent is a reminder of the old vintage barbershop&#x27;s of yesteryear. After a good shave the fragrance linger&#x27;s on a bit giving you that clean and well groomed feeling. Used with a good razor it leaves my face feeling as smooth as a babies bottom as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream for my husband for Christmas. He really likes it and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I think that this shaving soap is far better than other shaving creams that you use it with a brush.  Smells nice, but not too strong and the smell wears off quickly so you can still put on your aftershave or cologne without the fragrances competing.</li>
    <li> I just ordered another one of these because I finished the 1st one I ordered. I am new to the world of Safety Razors and Straight Razors. I can say that I have used a cheap shave soap from a starter kit I purchased and was impressesed with the closeness of the shave I was getting. After purchasing this product I got an even closer shave. This stuff lathers up a hundred times easier than either one of the shave soaps that I have tried before coming accross this amazing product. The scent is absolutely amazing. It leaves you smelling manly and fresh all day long. It also leaves my face feeling moisturized and clean after I shave. I will absolutely be purchasing many more of this product in their different scents to keep my options open.</li>
    <li> Foams up with no problem and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood is a bit of a classic smell I like however my wife complains it&#x27;s a bit strong.  The only problem I have is with the brushes I use you usually have to rinse it several times and most creams vs bars have a quick rinse required. Over rinsing can take life off those expensive brushes. With that being said you can always skip the brush but I prefer not to.</li>
    <li> Wow! just wow! This cream is amazing! I have never used a cream that is so durable, creamy, rich, and luxurious as this. The fragrance is lasting and not overbearing. Left my skin feeling amazing! It&#x27;s hard to go back to my puck. I use this as a guilty pleasure or reward for a hard week at work or to calm my nerves when I had a bad day. It&#x27;s that amazing.</li>
    <li> old school smell and a good shave. a little goes a long way should last a long time</li>
    <li> Great stuff, smells amazing</li>
    <li> Works well smells great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the $1 can of foam, but after using Shaving cream I can say this is one of the biggest differences in a quality shave.  The cream gives your face a little of a numbing for shaving.  It smells like a classic barber shop and leaves your face smelling fresh for hours.</li>
    <li> Works up a lather very easily, great scent!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Taylor of Old bond Sandlewood cream after reviewing many different sites. Finding a product before testing, for me anyways, can be a pain. It takes me days if not weeks to make a decision. My wife hates that about me. I am new to the DE world and want to start off right.&lt;br /&gt;So, after reading article after article I finally decided to try this cream. As soon as I opened it up the smell was incredible. I remember reading the ingredients to my wife and she made a comment about how it does not sound appealing. I am happy I didn&#x27;t listen to her an so was she.&lt;br /&gt;Lathering it up was not difficult. I applied about a dime sized amount to the center of my brush and started mixing. It created a nice thick foam and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered the pre and post shave products to to complete it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes a great lather.  Love the sandlewood smell, too.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It works well and has a great smell.  My wife likes it too.  Sandalwood is the way to go</li>
    <li> Very strong smell which i like.  The cream does dry rather fast if you&#x27;re shaving slow.</li>
    <li> Great lather and the smell is pleasant if you like sandalwood. A bit pricey though for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  This should last me a long time.  Way cheaper than that stuff I buy at Wal-Mart, as I will get a ton more shaves from this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used, I put a little on my shave brush, it really lathers well, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other TOBS shaving creams and this is by far the best.  The sandalwood scent is really awesome, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to the shaving creams in a can....can&#x27;t say enough about this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;•  Wonderful lather, use a dollop about the size of an almond in the palm of your hand or a shaving mug/bowl, and a few seconds with a shaving brush gets you a rich lather.  Comfortable shave with a pleasant but never overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;•  100x times better than any standard shaving cream or gel, once you use this you will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;•  Glycerin shaving soaps are nice, but this is far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;•  None, other than completely ruining your ability to use standard shaving cream or gel again.</li>
    <li> This is a classic shaving cream and very wonderful smelling for a man.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and am impressed with the amount of quality lather it produces.</li>
    <li> Great smell great product but pricey that&#x27;s why j gave it four stars</li>
    <li> great stuff , great transaction :)</li>
    <li> Not bad but the smell is very short term and it is very soft. Does not last as long as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not good at writing long paragraphs about how amazing it is and what have you, but honestly, if I&#x27;m looking to perk up my day with a perfect shave and smell like kings, I&#x27;m swirling my brush in this tub</li>
    <li> Smell is strong, but wears off quickly if you wash your face thoroughly or use aftershave. Stays wet for a while, hard to get a really good lather that doesn&#x27;t dry on your face, this is a good buy. I would recommend it to those who want to smell like old people for the first 15 minutes of the day. On a more serious note: there really is a lot in there, and it is very nice that you only need a dime size amount with water and a good brush, and you can mix it in your hand. It is a very good cream.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the smell and pretty easy to whip into a lather with a brush in your hand.</li>
    <li> Great scent, not too strong.  Fantastic lather with just a small amount.</li>
    <li> Very nice product that lathers up nicely and does a great job giving a good close shave.  Leave skin nice and soft too.  Never going back to those canned aerosols again.  Pleasant scent.  My wife has commented repeatedly how she loves the smell.  Recommended to all.</li>
    <li> Large container. Good foam. Really silky. Not a huge fan of the scent. But really good shaving cream!</li>
    <li> The first and second time I bought this product it was 5 stars. The product was a thick cream, it caught well onto the brush and I could whip up a good lather. The third one I bought was similar in appearance to its predecessors but I could tell it was like a cream as it spread very easily. The fourth however was like a old cream that was very watery. In general it is horrible for swirling a brush into as it pick up the creamy goo that I think was suppose to be. The four purchases I made were over the span of 2 years (a cup lasts about 6 months with daily shaving) and they seem to be going downhill in quality. I intend to buy one different scent and if it turns out like this past experience I will be switching shaving cream brands.</li>
    <li> Lathers really well, makes shaving really smooth and close. I also love the scent...</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream, this was my first venture away from typical drugstore shaving creams and I am a total convert now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Scent - Great] This shaving cream has an amazing masculine scent. It lingers on my face for most of the morning post-shave (it even transfers to my dog a little when I snuggle her).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Value- Great] I have had one bowl for a while now and it has lasted for a long time. You just need a little bit to get a good froth for your entire shave. I generally put it on and let it set on my face for a little bit before I start shaving. Because it last for a while, it is vastly cheaper than drug store canned shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this shaving cream, will buy again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I have been wet shaving with a badger brush and and Merkur slant bar razor for years, and this is my go to shaving cream.  It whips up into a great lather with very little effort.  The sandalwood scent is great.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, nor does it have the chemical smell that so many other creams seem to have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m newer to shaving with a safety razor and have tried a couple products. This is my favorite by far. The lather is rich and appears to be very high quality. The scent is great and find it hard to understand how some may find it too strong. Shave has been the best I&#x27;ve had thus far, with no irritation and much more consistent swipes. Only a little dot is needed to do the job. This should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various Taylor of Old shaving creams over the years and absolutely swear by the stuff. It&#x27;s amazing. The tub I received from this vendor though (DependableResource) seemed less than dependable. It was missing a fair amount, and it appeared to be melted (it&#x27;s low 70&#x27;s outside) or was cut with water. I&#x27;m leaving it out in the open to see if it&#x27;ll firm up, but I have short hopes.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It seems impractical at first if you have decades of modern razors as your only experience but trust me this works and is a pleasure to use.  Makes shaving better...hands down.  Worth every penny.  I will use a badger brush and shaving cream for the rest of my life....period.</li>
    <li> The only shaving cream that&#x27;s husband will use!</li>
    <li> I would describe it as melted down bar soap. It does the job very well but you will smell like bar soap for hours after words even if you save before the shower as i did and i still smell like bar soap 12 hrs later! So if you wanna smell like bar soap not sandalwood all day go for it it is strong...To describe this smell i would say ivory bar soap wife says the same thing..</li>
    <li> Fragrance, lather, lubrication and economy... these four properties make Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly: the smell. It&#x27;s perfect and will remind you of what grandpa smelled like after a trip to the barber. Some say it&#x27;s too strong, but I disagree. I think the fragrance it spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream lathers quite well, but I&#x27;ve found it makes a fantastic lather when used in conjunction with a soap. I load my brush with Williams&#x27; shave soap first, then grab a dab of Taylor. Together, these products whip into a shaving lather to beat all others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once you&#x27;ve lathered, you&#x27;ll find this cream creates a smooth layer to keep your face protected during a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use so little Taylor&#x27;s for each shave, that I&#x27;m quite confident I&#x27;ll get at least 6 months out of the 5.3oz tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue buying it as needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream! I keep trying to order other variations, but I always end up reordering the same one.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and love the richness. I just wished the scent lasted longer but what the heck, it is not cologne</li>
    <li> I like the lather and the texture, but I hate the smell. It smells very &amp;#34;perfumey.&amp;#34; It also makes my nose itch, so maybe I&#x27;m allergic.</li>
    <li> i have ordered it but I have not used it as of yet.  I do plan to incorporate into my routine in the future.  I like a lot of it.</li>
    <li> My mom bought me this shaving cream together with a beaver hair shaving brush. I like to shave in the shower, which combined with the cream and brush provide me with a most luxurious shaving experience. The cream is so rich, that one only needs to dab a trace amount of it onto the brush to get a high quality lather after applying it with the brush for a mere 10 seconds or so. As for me, I so love the combination of warm shower water, beaver hair brush, and this cream, that I spend up to a minute massaging it into my beard for the pure enjoyment of it. After shaving, the cream leaves a nice cooling minty effect. My dad also loves it, and the two of us will be using our respective bowls for over a year, as it should last that long if only using the required trace amount with each shave.</li>
    <li> Shaving is something we guys do for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me into my 60&#x27;s to discover that there is shaving, and there is really shaving!  I got turned onto using a brush and another brand of shaving cream and discovered that the stuff in the spray can was not really lathering my face so well.  Learning to whip the cream on several Youtube videos, I learned how to better prepare beard for shaving so I did not get any razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the first brand of shaving cream, Art of Shaving, is more a whipped product that you end up replacing pretty quick.  The consistency is more like Noxema cream.  This Old Bond Cream comes in a much thicker consistency, almost as hard as a bar of handsoap.  So, a little dab with the badgerhair brush goes a long way!  Much cheaper to shave and still gets great shave leaving face feeling great.  The Sandalwood smell is nice too.</li>
    <li> I love TOBS shaving creams for their lather, their ability to work with sensitive skin, and the fact that they give me a good shave that is  fast, easy, and smooth.  This one is no different. The reason that I only gave it three stars was because of the scent. It is absolutely overwhelming - to the degree that I may have to toss this one out.  I happen to like sandalwood as a general scent, but even this was way over-the-top.  Try TOBS avocado shaving cream. It is the best.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the shaving cream and we both love the scent.  Delivery was prompt and as promised.  Very satisfied with both the product and the service provided.</li>
    <li> Good Product, works very well, great lather, smell is how it should be, real manly Barber shop smell. Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving cream.  I have very sensitive skin and this works really well for me.</li>
    <li> Great Shaving Soap and the container is perfect, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product for people with normal skin. I have very sensitive skin, especially on my neck. After I applied this with my brush it burned and stung pretty bad. Smells a little &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; like to me. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Yes it did, my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Easy to lather. Smells great. Huge improvement over the canned stuff. Almost makes shaving fun.</li>
    <li> Rich in almost-exotic emollients, this shave cream&#x27;s scent easily evokes a nostalgic time of long ago. I started shaving at 15, some 52 years ago, and this thick shaving cream harkens me back to a better age and time. It works up to a consistent lather rather quickly and it coats the skin luxuriously. The blade glides over your face and leaves you with a wonderful aroma that transcends time to the old barber shop shaving experience of days past. A tub should last a good long time; I heartily recommend it!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.  I get a much better shave with &amp;#34;the real shaving co&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;the Art of shaving&amp;#34; products.  My review is based on using Edwin Jagger safety razor and a boars hair brush.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this is labeled sandalwood as there&#x27;s no sandalwood smell in this product. It comes out to an okay lather but with the hype for this product just doesn&#x27;t live up to it if you want a real sandalwood shaving cream try Art of shaving Sandelwood.if you walk into an old-school barber shop this is exactly what this cream smells like</li>
    <li> Lathers insanely well!</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream I have ever used and I&#x27;ve been using a brush for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ll never go back to other creams.</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used. Great lather and a great shove for both NY head and face. I am sold.</li>
    <li> This shave cream actually makes shaving enjoyable. Use it and you won&#x27;t go back to whatever you were using before.</li>
    <li> I need to keep this product arriving at my door every month! It feels great when I use it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my Hubby love it!</li>
    <li> This shaving cream makes a wonderful and thick lather that gives your razor a really smooth glide on your face but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the scent. The scent is strong and it has a powdery smell to it that reminds me of an old ladies perfume. I would have given it five stars but the scent is why I didn&#x27;t. I like the performance of this cream and I will be trying the coconut scent next. I recommend this to anyone but get it in a different scent because you probably won&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> The smell is extremely strong. I had been using The Art Of Shaving Sandalwood previously and this smells nothing like it. It&#x27;s a sharper/stronger smell. I don&#x27;t really care for it. It does lather well, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving cream for my husband, who had previously been using something basic and generic, and after using it for the first time he told me he had forgotten what it was like to get a really great shave with a really nice cream.  He absolutely loved it... and he smelled great, too!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite,and my second order...just remember to soak your brush in hot water and do not dip it again...what you have on the brush will lather up two or three times,does not dry out like other soaps..</li>
    <li> Only rating at 4 stars on account of the scent. I know that scent is highly subjective, but I&#x27;ve tried different versions of sandalwood and the TOBS version just smells a little different. As far as lather and performance, all my TOBS creams are 5 star products. They are absolutely fantabulous - rich, creamy, slick and luxurious lathering. Loads easily on my boar, badger and synthetic brushes. I use a mentholated pre-shave treatment and the sandalwood scent lingers just enough - not overpowering at all. My only wish is that TOBS would sell a variety / sampler pack so I could try all the scents rather than buying a full tub of something I may not like. I&#x27;m curious about some of their floral scents, but not sure I&#x27;m ready to try them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves the consistency of it and the smell is wonderful. Has a nice earthy masculine scent that we both enjoy. He likes the way his skin feels when he uses it.</li>
    <li> works up to a good lather ,smells great, not  overpowering, just clean. Does a good job lubricating the blade.</li>
    <li> I use this shaving cream with a brush. It feels great on my face, and it makes the shaving experience very smooth with my safety razor.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about getting this for the price.  That was dumb.  It is worth every penny!  Opening it there is more than I thought.  The smell is awesome I just open the container from time to time to get a sniff.  It lathers in no time at all and requires hardly any water.  This feels smooth and creamy on the face.  A little goes a very long way this should last for quite some time.  I think it is one of the best at helping the razor do its job and protecting the face.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Smells great, lathers up great, and there is enough here to last a year.  Comes in a nice little &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; too so no loose soap floating around to deal with or leave in my mug.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers well, and last a very very long time. Definitely beats the store shelves. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase</li>
    <li> The cream is good I just didn&#x27;t realize that I don&#x27;t like the Sandalwood scent.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I whiffed it in the &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; to see what it would smell like, and the smell would not go away. I had to snort water, wash my nose out. had a strong chemical smell. someone said they smelled like an old lady at a funeral parlor, which sounds close. horrible pomade type smell. perhaps gentlemen from 1910 might have used this, but such a horrible perfume smell, so artificial. was taken in by a sales pitch when I should have just bought my Merkur razor and didn&#x27;t realize you can use a modern, natural shaving cream without the silly ostentatious brush/making a lather, etc.</li>
    <li> Apparently I&#x27;ve been using some lousy shaving cream before (you know the kind in a bottle?), and this is so much better. For one, it&#x27;s slick enough that after the first round of shaving I can just add a little water and lather up my face a bit more for the touch-up round. And secondly--or maybe I should have listed this first?--not only do I love the sandalwood smell of it, but my wife goes crazy for it, too! This will be a repeat buy I&#x27;m certain of it :D</li>
    <li> I have used this several time and love the lather, smell and its just a really good item to have on hand for those days you really want a good shaving cream.</li>
    <li> TOBS is a great shave cream!  It has a regal, old fashioned barber shop smell that is very satisfying while you are shaving. For me, a guy who is not into cologne, the scent lingers a tiny bit too much afterward.  It does have a terrific sandalwood scent (so feel free to consider this darn near perfect if you are someone who wants a noticeable sandalwood smell for several hours afterward).  As far as the shave goes, a tiny fingertip full whips up into a very generous lather, more than enough even for a second pass.  With my job requiring my face be clean shaven, I have a five to six day a week shave necessity.  That said, this tub will last several months at that rate.  It is significantly more expensive than the economy aerosols or cheap mug soap pucks, but is longer lasting and made from obviously higher quality ingredients.  I use, and kind of recommend a brush to achieve the best quality lather, but when time constraints have kept me from enjoying my shave, I have lathered in my hands and TOBS still is superior to most all other creams and soaps.  I have tried many shave products, from low to high end and TOBS is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great product. Actually it&#x27;s way bigger that I tought and it last forever. I love the unintrusive sandalwood scent. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> My very first non-shaving foam in a can product. I am very impressed with the scent and cushion of the product but right now I am leaning towards Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Violet as my favorite! TOBS Rose scent is heavenly, it is the most non-artificial rose scent I have run across, it actually smells like a florist!</li>
    <li> While the shaving cream lathers well and offers an excellent shave, I found the scent to be too overwhelming. After my first shave my wife commented that I smelled like an old person. After I finish this bowl I&#x27;ll be looking to move on to a cream with a more subtle scent.</li>
    <li> To start this cream lathers like a champ very easily. It is probably on par with proraso in the tube or tub as far as lather production goes; definitely beats cheap soaps like arko and williams for example and provides about the same lubrication as all soaps/creams I just listed (let&#x27;s be honest most all soaps perform about the same shave wise, its just how easy they lather that matters).  Now the subjective part: the aroma is a mild to moderate sandalwood that to me does not linger too long, which is good. YMMV. I love the smell of this in the morning, but its not so strong that my eyes are still watering at noon.  The lid can be slippery if you have wet hands, and its kind of a pain to have to dollop the product out with your finger (vs squeezing out of a tube), but I still give it 5 stars. Would recommend to pro or novice.</li>
    <li> First time I ordered this product, I had to send it back because the box and container somehow exploded or someone decided to open up the container and take half of the shaving cream because the container was open, half empty and shaving cream smeared all inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the product, after ordering it again, it was pretty good for its price. even though I don&#x27;t mind paying more for something better, I would still recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is great-just touch the shaving brush to it; brush the face to work up a lather and then squeeze the brush to work out the foam and apply.  It is great.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream. It&#x27;s got a great scent and was really easy to work into a lather. I&#x27;ll absolutely choose this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I only use a very small amount and lather on my face without a brush and bowl. It works really well and my skin feels great. I don&#x27;t find the scent to be overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughters 1st birthday and although she loved it the packaging was awful! I was expecting it to be in the packaging like at Walmart but it was literally shoved into a small brown box with the hats and I wasn&#x27;t too happy as I was giving it for a gift. The product on the other hand is very fun but loud! Wish it had a volume control!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and it lathers nicely, I could get addicted to this product.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave &amp; makes me smell like rich old people.</li>
    <li> The best shave with this shave cream.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaving cream, smells great and lathers up quite easily.</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t require very much to make a good lather.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my husband for Christmas. We&#x27;re both hooked. He loves the way it lathers and makes his face feel. I love the way it smells on him. Win win!</li>
    <li> Great product will definitely buy again.smells really clean!</li>
    <li> I was looking for some sandalwood shave cream or soap. The price on this seemed fair. To the point, this is a very good product. Generates wonderful lather with a brush and bowl. Probably good for face lathering. The scent (everyone has their own expectation of sandalwood) to me was very pleasant. My wife likes it. It doesn&#x27;t stick around for long (that&#x27;s not its job). Your mileage may vary, but for me it&#x27;s a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other shave creams that produce a (for me) better lather, but cost a good deal more. This product hits the sweet spot on both price and quality.</li>
    <li> excellent product, I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of Shaving Creams with some being better than others.  This Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream is by far superior than any other shaving cream that I have ever tried. It lathers up rich and just a little goes a long way. My Parker 24C, Parker 99R and Merkur Long Handle Safety Razors glide smoothly through its rich lather, guaranteeing me a close shave on the first pass.  This cream leaves your skin awesome afterwords too. I hope to never use another brand again, this is it for me. I highly recommend this cream for both men and women.</li>
    <li> Fist of the scent of this shave cream is fantastic.  I really enjoy using the cream over a shave soap because of how fast and easy it is to get a good lather.  You really only need about a nickle size drop and a little water to really get this stuff going.  I have a feeling this 5.3 Ounce is going to last quite some time.</li>
    <li> Packed well and arrived on time.  This is the second time that I have purchased &#x27;Taylor of Old Bond&#x27; shaving soap,  It is a great product with a really clean smell!</li>
    <li> Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I did not care for the smell.  It is old time barber shop.  The product is good but the smell doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  One star off for the smell but it works great.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap.  Lathers well and only a tiny bit on the brush is needed so it lasts a very long time.  Mail service is the best.</li>
    <li> Classic smells and texture, wonderful lather and incredibly smooth application. No more than a finger dab is needed for all three passes on one shave. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great and will last a long time. Will buy again</li>
    <li> A great sandalwood scent, although it didn&#x27;t quite agree with my face. I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, however I felt a certain &amp;#34;drying out&amp;#34; that I didn&#x27;t experience with any other shave soaps I&#x27;ve tried- even the TOBS Avocado. Definitely worth a try though, for any wet shaver.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice scent. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Good value and quality shave. I mix with a few drops of glycerin.</li>
    <li> Nice pleasing scent. Lathers well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome!!! None better..</li>
    <li> This coupled with Astra blades has given me the smoothest most comfortable shave. I could do without the odor, but it performs too well to look for anything else. Using a brush to apply you need very little to lather up. Leaves my skin and brush feeling moisturized. Can&#x27;t see anything else working much better.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap is great. My hubby says that it is very moisturizing, plus I love the smell</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband, he really enjoys this shaving cream and I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great. Works very well. Lasts for months - as you can use a very, very small amount each day.&lt;br /&gt;( better  and lasts longer than some other similar , well-known shaving creams...there&#x27;s more thickness and volume to this cream, so you can place a  very small &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; on your brush - and it takes care of the entire shaving area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic. I also recommend the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Cologne, available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It you like the scent of the shaving cream - you&#x27;ll like the similar scent of the cologne.</li>
    <li> Works good but the smell is a little off putting. Truly opinion only.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVE. THIS IS ALL I USE.</li>
    <li> Not quiet as impressed with the lather this cream provided with a badger brush. I enjoyed the smell as it reminded me if the barbershop I grew up going to, however my wife thought u smelled like my grandfather. Just for reference I am 28, so I guess I will try a different brand and scent next time.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Love the smell and the lather it makes is so good.</li>
    <li> First the positive... It foams really good...  &amp;#60;crickets&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the rest of the story...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever this is, it is not a quality sandalwood.  I think this was brewed in a witches cauldron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells way too floral, with major chemical overtones.  My lady HATES the smell!  It seems to irritate my skin a little with a burning sensation and my skin does NOT irritate normally.  Upon reading the ingredients list I could NOT pronounce 95% of the chemicals in it.  Here I thought I was getting something natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for now I am going to stick with my Harry&#x27;s Shave cream, at least I can pronounce 50% of the words! And I can see that some of it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, not this one.. I am looking for a great NATURAL sandalwood shave cream/soap for my wet shave.  I am a head shaver so I need something GOOD!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product.  It gives me a smooth and clean save.  It sets me up for a close shave too.</li>
    <li> I used to despise shaving, just another chore. Now I shave every day, even on the weekends. Shaving is now my favorite moment of my morning ritual. This has a great aroma (esposa loves it), and your blade slides smoothly, and is gentle on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Of course get a nice brush. (I bought the Escali brush.)</li>
    <li> Got my bowl of soap and I used it for the first ti me today. It made great lather and the save have it I got were great not to mention the the wonderful scent, it reminded me of when I used to watch my Grandfather shave. This is a reat product and cant wait to try some of the other products.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product..The aroma is great. It is soft and easy to use.. Will&lt;br /&gt;order more in the future..</li>
    <li> I love it but the wife said it made me smell like an old man.  So I gave it to my dad.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my spouse.  He uses it every day and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream!  Amazing fresh woodsy scent that lasts but is not overbearing.  The lubrication properties are superb.  It does take a bit of learning to get the perfect lather however.  I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll warn you right now, the first time you use this cream, all you&#x27;ll be able to smell for 6 hours is Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood. Its almost downright awful. I was worried I&#x27;d have to send it back because it was so strong, or that my partner wouldn&#x27;t like it. However, after the first day my nose seemed to get used to it and the intensity of the smell really lightened up. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I can say I really enjoy the smell, as does my family and my partner. Its not too strong and doesn&#x27;t stay in your nose, unlike the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lathers up really well. I&#x27;ve been using shaving gels all my life, and switching to this cream was night and day. Even shaving with my standard cartridge razor I still got a much closer shave than with my gel. This cream also let me go against the grain for the first time in my life without tearing up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving cream after being underwhelmed for months with Proraso. The first day I used it I could tell I was going to love it! A tiny, tiny dab of this cream on your brush gives you enough lather for three complete passes. The scent is subtle but still lingers for hours after shaving. Definitely my favorite shaving soap for years to come. One container should last you a minimum of three months of heavy use!</li>
    <li> I love how my husband smells after using this product! He loves using it!</li>
    <li> New to the safety razor game, this shaving cream lathers great, smoothly, smells manly and is very easy to use.  The supply seems like it will last a very long time</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and lathers quite nice!</li>
    <li> First time using Amazon and Taylor of Old Bond Street. Everything cold not have been more perfect.</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell of this. My spouse is quite happy with it too. I can always smell when he&#x27;s shaved and I LOVE this scent. Highly recommended for those wanting to please their female counterpart... what a sexy scent!</li>
    <li> We were tired of having to pay so much for so little blades.  My Husband wanted to go back to the double edged razors and blades.  I read the reviews (usually do) and the raves about this shaving cream had me ordering it immediately.  It is a very masculine scent that stays with him most all day.  And different than what he can buy in the stores.  And if I&#x27;m with him, I tell people that it is an old English product.  We LOVE it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this to replace the bar that came with the shaving kit i bought. I am extremely pleased with this cream. Very easy to get a good lather and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all on the brush to cover your whole face. I have used the same tub for about 8 months and it&#x27;s just now starting to get low. The sandalwood scent is plesant and not overpowering at all. Will be buying again as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street is, without a doubt, my favorite shaving soap provider.  Only caveat is to use LESS soap than you are accustomed to as a little goes a VERY long way.  The Sandalwood cream tames most &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; blades such as Feather and even Shark - giving an extra smooth, nik-free shave.  It just doesn&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving cream and I simply love it. I don&#x27;t know how but it helps to get a closer shave, I just need to apply a very tiny amount directly on my face and it creates a good amount of leather. And the sandalwood scent is wonderful, I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good.  But even if you&#x27;re a fan of Sandalwood, like me, I think you will prefer the &#x27;Eton College&#x27; Taylor brand.</li>
    <li> The overall quality of ToOBS sandalwood is top notch. Good foamy lather when using a brush. Good lubrication for a smooth shave. My only complaint is the smell is distinctly \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; with that musky, leathery, tobacco hinted type of smell. My wife says it smells like a grandpa, which isn&#x27;t something I want my wife to be thinking at this point in my life, so as a 35-year-old this isn&#x27;t really the \\&quot;modern\\&quot; type of scent I&#x27;m looking for. It would make a good incense smell, but perhaps not something you want your face to smell like for most of the day. That being said, it is still a very popular scent and a good quality product. Smell is a personal thing, so if you like the smell, you will definitely like the shaving quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Gerat lather. Very nice scent. Not over powering in any way my favorite shaving cream great buy for a great price!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream.  The scent is fantastic and the product is lubricating enough for a one pass shave on a double edge razor. I have been double edge shaver for many years and I still could never figure out why as Americans wet shaving practices have faded off.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you shave with a medern razor you should take a shot with wet shaving (Brush and this cream with plenty of hot water) with this product. For price versus amount of shaves Taylor of Bond Street is a great value.  I know some people are price sensative versus using a can or gel. This product will last at least 9 months to year, shaving with a brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted something warm, woody, and spicy for the wintertime.  I have a tub of the TOBS Jermyn Street which is fantastic so I decided to give this a try since it got such positive reviews.  As expected the lather and protection is grade A.  Unfortunatley the smell is overpowering and not like sandalwood at all.  Sandalwood is a scent that is hard to nail and can range from very sweet to very dry and woody.  I was expecting something at least in the middle but the scent is incredibly perfumey, almost old lady like in a way.  I&#x27;m rather surprised because it gets such good reviews.  I was unable to detect any wood scents so that is why I&#x27;m giving this a 3/5 overall.  Sorry TOBS!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Rich lather&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Stings&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this cream, a little goes a long way. You can use a small amount to make a rich lather on your entire beard.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have sensitive skin, be warned. I think whatever is used to make this smell so good is stinging my face. Also, my face feels really dry after using this shaving cream and it stays dry the entire day.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and old timey.. Lathers incredibly,skin feels awesome after</li>
    <li> I get this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! Personally I think it smells sooo good!</li>
    <li> Has met my expectations. Small amount lathers very well. However, as others have commented the scent is rather strong and chemical in nature. It  is not unpleasant but for some may be irritating.</li>
    <li> Until purchasing this product I had used only gel shaving creams such as Gillette. I was pleasantly surprised when I received the product and tried it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the product is how far just a tiny bit goes. I am sure that 1 5.5oz container will last me at least 5 months while shaving every day. I understand that these creams are usually applied with a brush - I just used my fingers and some elbow grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great, while providing a smooth shave at the same time. All in all: it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Such a fantastic smell, makes my skin feel smooth and the wife approves so what more could you want, hmm?</li>
    <li> Love it. Great lather, protection, and moisture.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it just like the lavender version. Same wonderful smoothness- another beautifu fragrance! Another happy birthday for my husband.</li>
    <li> My husband says how much he likes this product every time he shaves. I love the smell of his face after he shaves! Highly recommend it. 5 star from me!</li>
    <li> My son loves it. His favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers well, gives a really smooth shave.  What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. My razor glides right over it.</li>
    <li> Strong scent, it has this &#x27;old man&#x27; scent feeling to it (but in a classy good way). I like it. Clearly a high quality cream, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it to whip up a solid amount of lather. It works well. The scent might be too strong for some people, but I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> What a great product for the price. It lathers well, smells nice and is rich and thick. I think its a no brainer to buy this with your safety razor.</li>
    <li> Lathers up very easily and thick. The sandlewood scent is *very* strong and lingers. I happen to like this, but beware, in no way is the scent subtle.</li>
    <li> just as promised. smells great. thank you</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving cream to be applied with a shaving brush and I can honestly say i&#x27;m NOT DISAPPOINTED. This stuff goes on very easily with a badger hair brush and works up into a nice lather. It&#x27;s very economical given how many shaves you get out of a container. Remember you only need to get a LITTLE on your brush and work that into a lather. A little goes a lone way once it&#x27;s into a lather. I probably use less than 1cc of this stuff per shave. Having a good badger hair brush is important though. It doesnt have to be expensive, just good quality. I recommend the Escali brush with pure badger hair. Works great.  A little seems to go a long way and it&#x27;s got just the right level of slickness. I&#x27;ll eventually get around to making my own soap, but if i weren&#x27;t going to do that I&#x27;d probably be a customer for life with these guys. Oh, and it smells AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Trumpers and The Art of Shaving and liked them both. I thought I would give Taylors a shot due to the price savings and positive reviews. As soon as I opened the lid, the heavy, artificial smell overwhelmed me. I can only liken it to the smell of a woman&#x27;s cheap perfume.  It may not bother some, but when you come from a shaving cream with a more elegant, sophisticated smell, the difference is instantly evident. Maybe this where some of the cost savings come from. Not sure. I wanted to return it, but I really needed shaving cream right then. It did lather nicely and worked quite well, but the smell would keep me from buying it again.</li>
    <li> I only recently got into wet shaving and slowly accumulated my gear -- DE shaver from my grandparents, Badger knot from The Golden Nib (and wood to make a handle), styptic pencil, and lastly, shave cream. The cream was the last thing I needed to start my new experience and I read and read about various types. Conflicting opinions abound on cream vs. soap, though it seemed like cream might be easier for the beginner, so I went with that. My parents used to have sandalwood incense and it sounded pleasant, so I narrowed my choice to sandalwood creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed quite well known and mostly liked, which helped build confidence. The primary complaints I heard were that it 1) doesn&#x27;t provide sufficient lubrication and 2) doesn&#x27;t actually smell like sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title of the review indicates... whatever I say needs to be framed within the boundaries of noob-ness. I find that it lubricates fine, though I couldn&#x27;t tell you if another does better. It lathers fine as far as I can tell as well. I&#x27;m still experimenting and often find that I need to use more water than I think I need. I&#x27;m sort of a conservationist as well, so I&#x27;m not creating heavy thick mugs full of cream. With a damp brush I simply swirl for about 10sec and then start frothing in a shallow mug. I quickly pass my brush through running water and re-whip until things look/feel about right (again, based on my noob knowledge and YouTube video watching). For this process, the cream seems to do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the smell... I&#x27;ve never smelled actual sandalwood, so I don&#x27;t know what to say about it. It smells \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and pleasant to me, and my wife likes it. That&#x27;s all that really matters to me. The scent stays with me in a mild/background way for many hours. To describe \\&quot;mild,\\&quot; I&#x27;d put it this way: it&#x27;s not strong enough that I feel embarrassed at all to be in a close quartered meeting at work as if it&#x27;ll overpower and gag the room. I think the people to my sides could smella slight fragrance and that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s also a good quasi-neutral fragrance as well as opposed to something fruity or cologne-y smelling that can irritate some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about all I&#x27;ve got to say about that. I&#x27;m very pleased with this as my first cream and it appears it&#x27;ll last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I use the lid as my bowl and it works great! Great lather and I like the sandalwood scent.</li>
    <li> Nice lather. Great scent. Truly a gentlemens shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street makes the best shaving cream and soaps a person can buy, hands down. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and this is by far my favorite. I do prefer the cream bowls over the hard soaps. The fragrance is masculine and complex without being overpowering. I liked it so much I ended up buying the pre-shave oil, aftershave, cologne and a couple other products in the Sandalwood scent from ToBS as well. A little of this goes a long way, and a bowl will last a person a few months with a daily shave. Builds an excellent, slick lather, and leaves the skin soft and conditioned without dryness. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It comes in a screw top plastic bowl, which is a little large if you&#x27;re considering it for travel.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shaving creams, but I truly have to say that fell in love with this one, the Sandalwood. One more reaason to love this thing is becuse it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice shaver, but as soon as I opened the jar of this, I knew I had made the right choice. The smell is really nice and is not overly strong by any means, which probably has to do with the smell being just plain good. There is also something about the smell that is just manly even though it smells very fragrance-y and nice. It lathers up VERY well and it able to hold its lather for a long time during shaving (a little of this stuff goes a long way - it will last a good amount of time!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaving cream to both the beginner and long-time shaver - you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, and with it&#x27;s very affordable price, it makes you feel like you spent at least $50 on a top-shelf shave cream.</li>
    <li> The product seems to keep my skin smooth. My favorite part is that the scent is very pleasant and not overwhelming. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have used a great many different shave creams and gels.  None were really bad but rather just OK as I would always get little nicks and my beard would re-emerge by the late afternoon.  Then I stumbled upon Taylor of Old Bond Street.  This is my new favorite by a large margin.  I find its scent pleasant but it&#x27;s best features are closeness of shave coupled with NO nicks or skin irritation.  This is the first time in my life that I can almost skip a day of shaving.  I only wish I had discovered this product a long time ago.  I have a coarse beard and always though I had to live with skin irritation after shaving.  Not anymore.  If you are trying to decide just click on the order button, wait for delivery and prepare to be impressed!</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Great smell, easy foaming , firm, fine foam &amp; long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: pricy</li>
    <li> Works well- foams easily, and provides a comfortable shave. It&#x27;s a bit more fragrant than the Art of Shaving Sandalwood cream, but whether that&#x27;s good or bad is subjective.</li>
    <li> I have this time on Subscribe &amp; Save and for months now they have been sending me messages that this product is not in stock. Why then did I get an email today saying it is out of stock by when going to the seller&#x27;s page they have it available for purchase!!!!?</li>
    <li> Tried out this shaving cream after previously using Proraso.  This shaving cream has a rich thick later that lathers up very easily. It felt like \\&quot;gourmet soap\\&quot;, for sure.  Very pleased with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it is strongly (but pleasantly) scented and something in the product irritates my skin. So I will be searching for an unscented version to try.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! It&#x27;s easy to get a good lather, smells great, and leaves my skin feeling smoooth.</li>
    <li> Learned a secret about this stuff from Geofatboy. Get some colonel conk&#x27;s amber or bay rum, and load your brush with that stuff first, then top it off with this stuff, and it is EPIC. Will probably buy this stuff many times from now on.</li>
    <li> I am a 24 year old man with a full, thick, dark beard. Gillette fusion proglide cartridges do not get close for me and only cause razor burn and irratation. This past Christmas, my brother bought me a double edge safety razor with murker blades for Christmas. I used it with Mugg shaving soap from a convenience store,&lt;br /&gt;It got close however left me all nicked and cut up with razor burn still. After a little research, I bought bic double edge blades for their sharpness and Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream for protection and a smooth shave. Boy did it not disappoint! For the first time in my life I got a close, painless, comfortable shave with no burn or razor bumps! The sandalwood smells like an old barber shop and it lathers up real nice. The tub looks like it could last for months. Way better then anything you can buy in a can. I highly recommend this product with a good safety razor and sharp blades if you have coarse, thick, facial hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will ever run out of this stuff. I use a tiny amount each time to shave, each batch gets me at least the 3 passes that I am used to (when not in a hurry) and the sandalwood aroma is mild and refreshing. I would definitely buy it again if and when I ever need it.</li>
    <li> Received this product yesterday and used it this morning. Using g a boars hair brush I applied just a little of the shave cream, after washing my face of course, and it lathered up nicely and provided a subtle barber shop shave scent.  Shaving went without a hitch nor a nick and even after taking a shower and washing my face again I could smell the subtle scent for several hours.  I&#x27;ve found my new shave cream.</li>
    <li> This is our shaving soap. Lathers well. Need very little per shave (of course we have beards). Subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> I only recently started wet shaving (about a month ago) and I have this and a single puck of solid shave soap.  While there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the solid shave soap this stuff is just so much easier to get a really good lather going.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it has a good feel going on.  Basically no skin irritation to go with it.  This is one of those &amp;#34;can&#x27;t go wrong&amp;#34; purchases.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers great, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have repeatedly purchased this for my father who really adores it and is hard to buy for.  He tells me that he uses it &amp;#34;sparingly&amp;#34; so that he can make it last.  But I think it&#x27;s a testament to the product that you can use it sparingly, and it still performs well.  It has a great scent and lathers really well when used with a shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Art of Shaving sandalwood shaving cream for years and LOVE the smell of it, but thought I&#x27;d give something different a try.  The TOBS sandalwood smells horrible in comparison.  The AoS cream is a nice soothing scent, while the TOBS has a much more pungent odor. I&#x27;m not even sure if its a sandalwood scent.  The shaving part of it was great.  No irritation and a nice clean shave, but I can&#x27;t take a whole tub worth of this smell.</li>
    <li> It smells great, and you only need a very small amount to get a facefull of lather.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT.  My Favorite cream of all time.</li>
    <li> Very nice one. I like this.</li>
    <li> This stuff lathers great and smells outrageously good!</li>
    <li> This is a great cream.  It needs quite a bit of water though.  It took some time to get the balance and the proper cream, otherwise it will dry out on your face.  I will be ordering this again when it runs out in 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is great. It looks like just a small jar of cream but you only need a very little cream on the brush to lather up. I think this jar will last for years. The shaving cream also has a wonderful fragrance. I highly recommend this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic - works great, smells amazing, and lasts a really long time. A tiny dab on my brush turns into a massive amount of shaving cream. I haven&#x27;t tried the other scents, but the sandalwood scent is awesome.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce, is the best shaving cream I have ever used. It&#x27;s very smooth, lathers easily, and has a wonderful fragrance. Other than emergencies, I&#x27;ll probably never use a different shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and their storage containers have been sub-par. Leaving me with some dried out no good cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far (A quarter of the way through this container) this cream has been a treat. It lathers up better than others, certainly better than any shave soap I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is rather enjoyable as well, it is the same as often found in a lot of barber shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t much to this, just use a nice badger hair brush and lather it up and shave away.</li>
    <li> Received this item in the mail a few days ago.  The packaging it shipped in was in bad shape, but the product arrived unharmed.  Next morning I turned on the swing music, started the hot water, pulled out the razor, and got on with my morning shave.  The smell of the soap is very pleasing, reminding me of going to a barbershop.  A lot of reviews complain of a strong scent, but I don&#x27;t think it is overpowering at all.  The smell does tend to associate oneself with that of an older generation, but that is one of the characteristics that I like about it.  It doesn&#x27;t take much on the brush to generate a nice lather, but it does take a bit of work with the brush in the bowl to get it there.  One drawback is that I wish the lather was a bit thicker, but perhaps I am just adding too much water.    Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is the first true shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I love the scent and I loved the shave.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not making lather very well yet and I still enjoyed the experience.  I suspect it will only get better as I get better using it.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a DE razor for several months now. I bought the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream after having read several favorable reviews.  The soap lathers quickly, and easily with my badger brush and mug. The lather is very thick, and provides excellent lubrication during shaving. The scent was, at first, a little old-time for me. However, I&#x27;ve started to like it more and more as I&#x27;ve continued using it.  It&#x27;s not a very strong scent, but it lingers throughout the day. I didn&#x27;t know what sandalwood smelled like prior to ordering the cream - but I really like it. This cream is an excellent product - smells great, is easy to use, and greatly enhances my shaving experience. Best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  UPDATE: It&#x27;s been a month or two since i&#x27;ve been using this cream.  I still really like it a lot; however, after having used it for a couple of weeks I started noticing that I was getting headaches on a rather frequent basis. Apparently, the strong scent from this cream was giving me a headache. The scent is fairly strong, and could even be somewhat overpowering (even though it smells great). So, even though this cream is great - be warned that the scent is fairly strong, and could potentially be overwhelming. I have since tried the Mr. Taylors Shaving Cream for Taylor of Old Bond Street - I love it! It doesn&#x27;t have a strong a scent.</li>
    <li> I thought that I was ordering solid soap in a bowl. After receiving this Shaving Cream in a bowl I was really annoyed at myself for not reading this product&#x27;s name carefully &amp; for not even knowing that soft shaving cream is available in a bowl. This disappointment changed to favorable enthusiasm for this Sandlewoow Shaving Cream. I love it. The lather is generous &amp; full bodied, the fragerance is pleasent, yet subtle &amp; most importantly, the shave is smooth, close &amp; without any discomfort.</li>
    <li> Rich lather, shaves well, classic packaging, shaves well.  I wish them all the best!  You do have to love the smell of Sandalwood though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve never used a better shaving cream. It smells great, lathers well, and gives a good shave for a good price. Way to go, TOOBS!</li>
    <li> I am new to the whole shaving brush idea and tried some products from the Art of Shaving store.  While those work well, they are a little pricey.  This shaving soap works just as well and smells great for a fraction of the cost of the Art of Shaving product.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this shaving soap if purchased.</li>
    <li> I bought this after going halfway through a tub of Poraso shaving cream, so I was comparing the two products.    Other reviewers have complained about the scent, and if you don&#x27;t REALLY like the way that sandalwood soap smells, you need to stay away from this.  The scent is very strong, but you&#x27;ve got to remember that you&#x27;re brushing this right under your nose.  The scent is pretty much washed down the drain when you rinse your face, and I think that&#x27;s a negative.  I like the way sandalwood smells, and the whole point for me was to have a little of that linger on my face so I don&#x27;t have to wear cologne.  No luck with that here.  On the plus side, though, it does work up a great lather.  The shaving cream is much softer than the Poraso, so the first shave, I really dug the brush deeply into the bowl and got way too much for one shave.  That problem was quickly recognized.  If you have any whiskers at all, all you need is a dab on your brush to get a rich lather.  At the end of the day, I probably won&#x27;t buy this one again, though.  Just \\&quot;meh\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time five minutes ago....&lt;br /&gt;I am incredibly prone to ingrown hairs, and can NOT use Brylcream, or any of those other crappy canned gels.  The literally TEAR my face up.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I started using specialized shave creams and they have made a world of difference.  I&#x27;ve used e-shave, Art of Shaving, Lucky Tiger, Jack Black, and New York Shaving Company.  So far NY Shaving company has the best product...I love the smell and it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;Until now.  I can tell from one shave if a product is good or not, and this is amazing (granted, I&#x27;ve only used it once).  It is definitely more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than the others--not much, but it isn&#x27;t as thick, so I found I needed to use a little more.&lt;br /&gt;However I used it on a dry beard (the true test of a good shave cream.  You should generally use it on  a softened beard), but I wanted to see how it did on a non-softened beard, and it did amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE SMELL:  It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;, and hence, the strongly perfum-y smell.  I don&#x27;t mind the scent at all, I will say it is NOT a typical sandalwood smell (Art of Shaving is ALL sandalwood, and I love that smell); it is a mix of fragrance with sandalwood in it.  Because of this, I was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is certainly at the top of my list of best shave creams on the market.  I think I rate it as #2, as I overall still LOVE New York Shave Company&#x27;s product (which you can&#x27;t buy on Amazon?????)</li>
    <li> Does the job and lubricates well for shaving with my safety razor.  It also has a nice fragrance and is a good price.</li>
    <li> I have used Taylor of Old Bond Street for several years and really love their product.  However, I can&#x27;t recommend the Sandalwood unless you want to smell like my grandfather.  They should give you a forewarning that it makes you smell like the 1930s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams-- this one is my new favorite!  The Lavender and Avocado scents have been my go-to creams, but nothing has topped this Sandalwood scent.  My fiancee loves the smell and admits, it&#x27;s a very attractive and manly smell.  No, it&#x27;s not an Old Spice \\&quot;musk\\&quot;, it&#x27;s unique wood smell: earthy, soft, and refreshing.    As far as texture, I love this stuff!  It lathers up easily and has enhanced my wet-shaving experience for two years now.  If this is your first time wet-shaving, I recommend using a badger hair brush, a small cup, and a dash of hot water to get some premium lather action going!</li>
    <li> Man this stuff really raised the bar from what I expect from shaving cream. Please note this is not a hard shaving, but rather a very thick cream. Dab a little on the end or your brush and you&#x27;ll have plenty for a thick lather.</li>
    <li> Received some of this shaving cream as a Christmas gift.  When I opened the container I was not immediately impressed with the scent of the soap.  It starts as a woodsy, spicy scent (I am not great at describing scents) but after loading the soap on my shaving brush and adding a little water the scent becomes sweeter and milder.  I love the scent of this soap!  The scent of sandalwood will stick around in your bathroom most of the day after shaving with this.  Scent is one of the most subjective aspects of shaving.  What I love, you may hate so take all of what I have said so far with this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more important aspect of this soap is its performance during the shave.  It lathers exceptionally easy and has a pretty big sweet spot for water content.  The lather it produces brings a very decent cushion for a shaving cream and it brings very good glide or lubrication for your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this cream provides a great performance for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> For years I had used a different cream -- Prorazo -- which was pretty good, but when I received this Sandalwood cream made in the UK, I started enjoying shaving on a completely different level. I love the smell, the texture. The scent stays for a long while after shaving. If you you a good brush -- and you must use a good brush, like Rooney -- you need to barely dip a tip of the barely wet brush, and you can&#x27;t help but work up a really rich and thick leather. I would have given it 10 starts if I could! :)</li>
    <li> If you like a subtle scent you will like this cream. Great lather and consistency, the only reason I gave it a 4 star is because if you&#x27;re like me and you like sandalwood scent you want it to be noticeable...I find this one to be too subtle .</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap I have used.</li>
    <li> best i&#x27;ve ever used - look no further&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the scent is not too strong, but also its not too weak.  very thick and luxurious - excellent lather.&lt;br /&gt;Havent used any other brands since I found this one.</li>
    <li> Very strong and caused a burn on my neck combined with a new razor.  Perhaps a little too close of a shave.  I will try it again with a different razor blade..</li>
    <li> I love the earthy sandalwood scent of this product. It is one of the first shaving creams that I purchased and I keep going back to it.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite shaving cream along with the Proraso sensitive stuff. I&#x27;ve tried a good many of both TOBS and the excellent line from Proraso. Very creamy rich lather, and a very nice scent. Definitely a top favorite, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had my first DE razor shave yesterday. It was a fun experience and today I notice my face is still mostly smooth. Very close shave. My only issue was the scent of this cream, it is awful. This is a purely subjective matter and some may like it. I figured with the number of positive reviews that is must be great. If you are in your 20&#x27;s then the sandlewood scent probably isn&#x27;t for you</li>
    <li> Being new to DE wet shaving, I went solely on reviews on Amazon to put together my &#x27;starter kit&#x27;. Every time I went looking at another shaving cream, I kept coming back to Taylor of Old Bond St (Sandalwood). It just seemed like this was highly suggested in reviews everywhere, so it made sense for me to try it - and I sure am glad I listened! This shave cream is the way you&#x27;re supposed to smell in a barbershop - a great musk smell! It lathers well, I didn&#x27;t find myself needing to use a ton to get the desired lather for three shave passes, so to me this is a win-win. Great value, top shelf quality and a highly desirable smell that my wife loves! Thanks Taylor of Old Bond St!!</li>
    <li> Terrific shave cream, love the sandalwood scent.  Whips up into a nice lather.  I would not expect anything less from TOBD.  I shave about four time a week and one of the jars last me about four months.</li>
    <li> my fiancé loves it and I LOVE the smell.  I did a lot of research on this, you can&#x27;t find better.</li>
    <li> This product was my first step into a better shaving experience and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  It smells so good and works a decent lather.  Way better than the canned shaving cream you buy.  My wife loves how great it smells too. Can&#x27;t wait to try others by this brand!</li>
    <li> Lathers up really well and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I like it better then some of my more expensive (triple$) creams.  I think it will become my daily cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff lathers up really good, smells really good and will last quite a while. My shaves are very smooth while using this and safety razor.</li>
    <li> Another wonderfully scented Taylor product.  It has a wonderful sandlewood aroma that lingers for a while after shaving.  I use a wet badger brush for face/head shaving.  A little goes a long way, a bowl will get me 4-5 months.  I can&#x27;t say for sure, because I use several different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; and rotate between them.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood - This is just plain the Finest Shave Cream on the planet !!  I have to say the scent of the Sandalwood version here is just incredible as other people have said. Below is a fairly lengthy explanation of the use and application of this Excellent product.  I hope that other guys who have never experienced this product and its application and use will read through my explanation below and experience for yourself one of life&#x27;s very fine pleasures! This product coupled with Musgo Real Lime Glycerin Oil Soap simply provides the finest shave possible. First of all it really is best to acquire for yourself a Badger Hair brush for use in creating a lather from the Taylor Old Bond St. product. You can experience the Product without a brush; Yes a good quality brush can be costly, but they last a long time and you really cannot appreciate the full effect the Brush provides in both creating the Lather as well as the application onto your face of the lather. We all spend a lot of money on things, just break down and do yourself a favor and get a brush. Don&#x27;t feel too distressed by spending $50.00 for one, It&#x27;s well worth it and&lt;br /&gt;the benefit of using a brush is pretty much invaluable through its ability to create a wonderful lather of the cream. It just cannot be effectively created and experienced in any other way. Here is the process to follow in the use of Old Bond Street &amp; Musgo: Run a good quantity of HOT water into your sink and place your Badger Brush into the Hot Water, this will Heat up the bristles of the Brush, Next Acquire a wash cloth and place it in a sink of HOT water, wring it out somewhat and then warm your face with it for approx.1 minute, place the wash cloth back into the HOT water a couple times as needed. The purpose here is to soften whiskers and warm the skin., Next lather up a small amount of the Musgo Oil soap with HOT water a spread around your face with your hands, this will pre-lubricate the skin and whiskersand provides the basis for a very smooth, gliding surface for the razor. Next retrieve the Badger brush from the hot water in the sink and shake out most, but not all of the Hot Water, then dip it into the TAYLOR of Old Bond St. and get a small quantity onto the Badger Brush. Next lather it up in a small bowl or cup, (you don&#x27;t need to go out and spend much money on a cup or bowl) it will take about 30 sec. to 1 min to create a nice lather, and it will likely be necessary to add a little water to the bowl as you &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; up the lather. The point is to create a somewhat fluffy lather. If you use too much water, the lather will be runny and will pretty much just run off of your face when you place it onto your face, on the other hand not enough water and the product will not lather up much in the bowl, so there is a bit of a fine line here. When you are finished, shaving, I like to apply a small amount of water across my face and then reapply the remaining lather from the brush to my face and then shave once again in a different direction or pattern. Whiskers tend to grow in a certain direction on your face, and everyone&#x27;s face is different so shave a second time in a different pattern or direction. Finally, rinse your face with Warm Water, and pat it dry with a towl, don&#x27;t vigorously wipe your face with towel. You want to keep your face moist as you next apply an aftershave or lotion.  May I here recommend one of my favorite aftershave cream which is NEUTROGENA RAZOR DEFENSE. This product will not sting or burn your face, it also moisturizes the face, and is so silky smooth.  NEUTROGENA Razor Defense is simply the best. Give it a try!!  Here is my summation of everything above. The process of creating a lather with the brush takes some practice, but stay with it and by and by you will get the hang of it. Once you familiarize yourself with the process of everything described above, it all becomes fairly easy and does not take as much time as in the beginning ifyou are new to this. Use of the products noted and the effort of skin preparation and application of the lather simply produces the finest shave you will ever experience!! There simply is nothing better!! Canned Shave cream does not even come close to this. People who have not tried this or experienced a shave as described are simply missing out on one of life&#x27;s GREAT Pleasures. Your skin will feel so wonderful when you finish.  Lastly I have to say the scent of the Sandalwood version of Taylor here is just incredible as other people have said. You will experience the masculine scent of this superb Product and feel invigorated and ready to Tackle the World in the day ahead of you. Shaving becomes a pleasurable experience you will look forward to and not a drudgery. Don&#x27;t deny yourself one of life&#x27;s simple pleasures any longer.  ENJOY !!</li>
    <li> The tub is larger than I expected, which is nice. It should last me quite a while. I love the fragrance and so does my wife!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, lathers great and lasts forever. I don&#x27;t shave often but damn its been over a year and i still have about some left. I have sensitive skin and have had no issue with irritation or drying of my skin. I use it with my phillip norelco razor it works great, doesn&#x27;t gunk anything up.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers and smells great.</li>
    <li> solid shave cream at a terrific price.  the smell is strong but not overwhelming and helped me get an excellent shave.  did not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this product.  Great balance between quality and price.  I will buy another when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve used yet (AoS is next on my list).  Great lather, coverage, and protection.  Only wish the scent was a bit more sandlewood-y or stronger.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells fantastic</li>
    <li> When I received this in thw mail it had opened itself and was all over the box, on the plus side the room I opened the package in smells nice and manley</li>
    <li> This shaving soap lathers well and is soft and pleasant to use. It wicks right up onto the badger hair brush, and you don&#x27;t need a ton of it to get good lubrication. Just make sure to reseal the top after each use, or it will dry out. You can restore some of its softness should this happen by adding in a few drops of water, sloshing it around, and then resealing it for a while. You might have to repeat this a few times.</li>
    <li> Works great, feels great, but it stinks!  The Amazon package stunk up my office all day when I opened it up.  A tiny bit had leaked into the box.  I shaved when I got home, went to my girlfriend&#x27;s house, and she immediately asked, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34;  She could smell me from 5 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said it made me smell like someone going to an inner city &amp;#34;club.&amp;#34;  I am a middle-aged professional guy.  I don&#x27;t need to smell like that.  Don&#x27;t know if I got a particularly strong batch or what.  I don&#x27;t know how other people stand it.  Maybe the smell lessens over time or something.  I can&#x27;t use it as it.  I am ordering another kind....</li>
    <li> This creme is good. Just slightly wet brush and circles inside to get some creme. Lather on face not in the bowl itself. A little strong at first but get used to it after 2 to 3 shaves.</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave. This Sandlewood scent is not for me. Pretty strong scent. Overall this is a good cream to use if you like the scent. Will probably order the avocado next.</li>
    <li> Well, Taylor of Old Bond is a masterpiece in men&#x27;s grooming and shaving. Has been for years and will be for a very long time. These guys take facial hair removal seriously. The scent is certainly for men and not boys, and reminds of the my father standing in front of the mirror 40 years using exactly just that. Silk smooth, incredible scent, foam like it should be and just entirely gratifying on every level.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t a really &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; Sandalwood smell.  That&#x27;s subjective so take it for what you will.  But it does lather well and quickly(ever spent 2 minutes just getting a good lather?).  Seems like it should last 6 months+ shaving twice weekly(!).  I&#x27;ll probably get a bar style shaving soap next time, but don&#x27;t get me wrong this stuff is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The scent is so awesome and nostalgic (just like classic barbershop shaving cream but not too strong) and it forsma a thick lather which I really like when shaving. It&#x27;s very easy to use coz it&#x27;s ready to use and for the price, you really get a lot of shaving cream that&#x27;s good for up to 3 months.</li>
    <li> Got this the other day. Only shaved once with it, but it gave me a good lather, and it smells awesome. Definitely worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and lathers very well.</li>
    <li> It lathers quick and full. You get a lot of cream for the price. Smells great! I will order this again.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is nice because it lets you get a lather going quickly and just get to shaving.  The great thing is it doesn&#x27;t have that astringent bracing quality of standard canned shave creams.  I really liked this product and would like to try another formulation because the Sandalwood - though not a problem for me - was not agreeable with my wife.  Thankfully TOBS has other varieties to choose from.</li>
    <li> A gift to a picky son. I had looked at a number of other amazon listings, and was completely pleased with this.</li>
    <li> This product is better than any shaving cream that&#x27;s in a can.</li>
    <li> Been using for years after watching my dad use it before that. Classic manly smell and provides a great shave and excellent lather.</li>
    <li> This is much much preferable to the aerosol shaving cream.  It is easy to use, has a very mild pleasant smell of sandalwood and leaves the skin soft.  Aside from trips where I need to take a 4 oz or less container, I will never go back to aerosol cans.  I strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> On my 3rd Taylor, and love this stuff.  Excellent foaming, amazing shave, and smell that says clean shave.  My favorite so far.  You don&#x27;t need to use much when whipping in a bowl, about a finger tip size is it.  Wet brush, warm mug, good brush, and a new razor blade.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this.  Goes a long way and is very concentrated.  Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> allergic to it, not scented with essential oils, returned</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know of any shaving bowl less expensive. It&#x27;s quality too can&#x27;t be beat.  And like it&#x27;s almond cousin . it&#x27;s aroma is lovely.</li>
    <li> Much better than my original shaving soap that I bought because it was cheap.  This is still on the lower end price wise but I&#x27;d say the quality is way up there! I originally bought it so I could use my safety razor when I traveled but this has now become my only lather.  If you enjoy the Sandalwood fragrance then I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I tried a LOT of shaving creams. This is the absolute best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amongst things I tried were: Gillette, Old spice, Nevea, Vaseline, and many I even don&#x27;t recognize their names :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one with a badger brush, is absolute pleasure. thickness and height of lather is just perfect, smooth and cleansing too. One pass is enough, two pass of shaving is super smooth, three is an overkill but still doesn&#x27;t sting at all! I did three just because I wanted to confirm (practically) that it didn&#x27;t sting and/or burn like every time before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell, is absolutely something. BTW, I am not optimistic usually, this one is a true deal.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, and very good lubricating qualities.  I was leary of the softness of the cream, thinking that it would be used up very quickly, but find that it&#x27;s lasting very well</li>
    <li> 5 stars ..the best product I ever used high quality and smells amazing</li>
    <li> Switched over to Taylor of Old Bond Street from The Art of Shaving. Packaging is much better and the product helps get me a great shave without drying my skin out!</li>
    <li> Product works well for shaved heads and it smells great.  Don&#x27;t need to re-lather up for the close shave.  Recommend buy.</li>
    <li> I keep telling myself to try other brands - but only use Taylor of Old Bond Street.  Have tried most of their flavors over the years and like most, Sandalwood is one of my favorites.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Was using King of Shaves gel and like this a little better. This leaves my face more moisturized after a shave. I shave in the shower and this does not lose it&#x27;s slickness</li>
    <li> This product has a clean fresh smell, a little goes a long way and most importantly it makes for a silky smooth shave.  You can&#x27;t really go wrong with this shave cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream for quite a few years now and it is by far my favorite. Great feel, great scent, and great shaving experience. I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times and it has never disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Taylor Shaving products but this was the first time I had ordered the Sandalwood cream.  Now, I&#x27;m in my 50s and never thought I had what is commonly known as sensitive skin, but after using the Sandalwood cream one time, the left side of my face broke out in a red rash.  This didn&#x27;t occur immediately, but several hours after shaving.  I didn&#x27;t connect the rash to the cream, so I continued to use the shaving cream.  The rash never went  away, so my wife suggested I stop shaving and see what happens.  Within 24hrs the rash had diminished in size and redness and by 36hrs was completely gone.  The next time I shaved I used some old can shaving cream I had and I didn&#x27;t get a rash.  This was several months ago, but last week in a moment of ignorance, I shaved with the Sandalwood and within hours the rash was back.  Again, never had sensitive skin before or such a response from using Taylor Shaving cream, so perhaps it&#x27;s as simply as something in the ingredients in the sandalwood doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
    <li> excellent shaving product, helps to achieve a nice smooth shave and I like the sandalwood aroma...</li>
    <li> The smell is overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with this product and I am sold. I don&#x27;t find the scent overwhelming and the texture of the cream is as good or better than any other I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ll be back for more...</li>
    <li> as soon as i saw it on my doorstep. i walked inside, wet my face and put only what was on the inside clear lid on my brush.  i did a bowl lather which went very well and shaved.  did two passes and realized it was a very good shave.  little to no irritation.  a small bit on my neck but it is mostly because i went straight into shaving without prepping my face with a shower or any oils.  but afterwards i felt very clean and smooth and the smell is amazing.  loved it so much that i just purchased another but in the shave soap instead of cream.  so my vote is. any cream that you can shave with, without prepping your face before hand and still get a good slick shave is great in my book.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, takes a bit to lather up but overall a great product. This combined with a Merkur razor and brush makes your morning shave a relaxing and satisfying experience.</li>
    <li> Great product , the only issue I have is the shipping . Last two items ordered were damaged . I sent first one back because it was unusable . I kept this one because I&#x27;m almost out and not as damaged as the first one ordered.</li>
    <li> This is just an awesome product.  I absolutely love the scent.  A dime size amount is enough for 3 passes.  If you shave every day I can&#x27;t imagine this not lasting well over 6 months.  I find it performers best when you add a small amount of water to you brush (providing you use one) mid application.  Great lather, great scent, get it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a TOBS product, and I was pleasantly surprised. The lather was incredibly smooth and doesn&#x27;t require much more than a dab on your brush to create. The aroma can only be described with one word: Manly. It&#x27;s an awesome smell that you actually hope persists on your face throughout the day. I have probably found my new shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for ~30 years and about 10 years ago I switched from aerosol foams to shaving cream in a bowl with a brush.  Taylor of Old Bond Street makes what is now my absolute favorite and best I have ever used.  It makes a better lather than others I have used and smells great (the scent is there, not strong, but there) as a classic scent.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I had never tried the traditional shaving soap and brush when I shave, but have always wanted to.  I always noticed when I was growing up that my grandfather used it, but I always assumed that he used it because he was \\&quot;old school\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t know any better.  Little did I know that he actually had it figured out!  I have a very thick beard and have never used anything that delivered a truly close shave.  Until now!  The Taylor of Old Bond Street product delivered the closest shave I have ever had!  What a difference a high-quality cream applied to my beard with a badger hair brush can make!  I will never go back to grocery store $2.49 shaving cream again.  The extra $$$ is worth it!</li>
    <li> I was in the market to try out a few new shave products. This seemed to be a big seller. I was worried because the biggest complaint was of a strong odor. During the first use I could smell a delightful barber shop scent but nothing overpowering. After second and third use I can no longer even notice the smell. All those people either got a different batch than I did or my olfactory perception is misconstrued. It lathers up very nice. I put a little on a brush, dab some water and apply. Goes on easy. It will start to dry out quickly so shaving in sections or keeping a wet blade is a must. Get this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency. I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street for a couple of years now. I live the Avocado version better, but this one is good too.</li>
    <li> The product smells nothing like the Sandalwood scent that I&#x27;m accustomed to, and my wife mentioned that it smells like \\&quot;old man\\&quot; (I&#x27;m 26). I&#x27;ve been using the Art of Shaving products for years now and think I will go back to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would *not* recommend this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: this company does not allow refunds, so buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Although the scent is not exactly what I would like, the shaving cream works nicely and I get a smooth shave</li>
    <li> So, I love Taylor of Old Bond Street. The quality is defnitely there. Their products provide an excellent shave and leave your skin soft and reduce/eliminate razor burn. Also, the smell (at least on the sandalwood have not tried the others) is distinct and pleasant without being overbearing. When I got this I did not know what to expect. I normally get the soap but decided to try the cream for the first time. I must say I think I will be using the cream from now on. It does not last quite as long as the soap but it moisturizes the skin so well. The shave is amazing. If you normally use soap I would highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I got this shaving cream for my husband&#x27;s birthday to go with a safety razor, shaving brush, and shaving cream bowl. The shaving cream is a good consistency, smells good, and seems to be lasting well. It results in a clean, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Really like the scent : warm and clean. Seems like it&#x27;d go a long way.  It does leave a film on the chrome of my razor but washes off with a toweling. Want to try more Taylor products. Made my shave.</li>
    <li> I would say that I got a bit of irritation from this product if I made a large number of passes, but it is an all around great product I feel. The lather is wonderful, the smell is nice, and the container is very convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> Great smell and works perfect for me! Works great with my edwin jagger de89lbl and derby razors! Gets the job done right and makes my face smell great all day long after a nice shave.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream creates a thick lather and works well and my wife loves the way it the sandalwood smells.</li>
    <li> If there&#x27;s a barbershop in paradise, they use this stuff. Feel great, smells awesome, and gets the all-important wife approval.</li>
    <li> After a minor product leakage, which Amazon resolved immediately in their usual excellent manner, I tried the shaving cream.  This was the first time for me.  After swirling it in a cup for a few seconds it produced a rich, great smelling lather.  I won&#x27;t use it for every shave because it takes too long to mix and clean up, but for weekends and special occasions it will be mandatory.</li>
    <li> I got a great shave with this product,shaves better than Art of Shaving but Art of Shaving has a better sandalwood smell.I guess we can&#x27;t have everything</li>
    <li> The cream lathers nicely and works very well, but the scent is overpowering and LINGERS forever. It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;d doused yourself in a strong aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was an unscented (or even lightly scented) version I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but I can&#x27;t use this daily as is.</li>
    <li> Switched from the canned shaving gel to this almost a year ago and haven&#x27;t looked back.  Shaving approximately twice a week, one of these bowls has lasted me over 6 months.  Compare that to a can of leading-brand shaving gel, which might last a month and costs about the same (if not more).  Moreover, this is way easier on the skin than the canned stuff, and leaves my face feeling much fresher.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try other scents, but the sandalwood smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented many times on the smell of this (I&#x27;m a 31 year old male). It&#x27;s a musky smell but not an old man smell.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street shave soap and cream are the best available, I&#x27;ve used many. However the reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 is I simply prefer the soap to the cream. The soap bars are easier to get the right amount of water where as the soap takes more judgment on the amount of water in the brush vs soap. Plus you still need an extra mixing bowl / mug for the cream. Thus soap in a mug is simpler overall. The sandal wood sent is the best though, really natural and light, girls love it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Easy to work in to a nice lather and feels great on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing.  Smells like a tough *&amp;%$# man!  Be warned though, the smell is STRONG.  It will last all day on your face and  will be present in the bathroom the following morning.  This is a plus to me but may not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using bars of shaving soap prior to this and it was tricky to get the right lather. I made the mistake of trying to get my badger brush full with this product, but soon came to realize a little goes a long way. Just dabbing a wet brush in this and swirling it on my face resulted in a very consistent and heavy lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would take a star off for price if it didn&#x27;t just work so perfectly well. I also stopped using an aftershave because this will leave you with a very satisfying smell and clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a few bucks more than what you are using or maybe not even, but I think this product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great price, smell, and lathering</li>
    <li> I recently switched to wet shaving with a double edge safety razor about 9 months ago.  My neck gets irritated easily when shaving and the switch has help a lot.  I started off using the Poraso shave soap and had great success.  However, I felt that after 6 months my technique was good but I was still getting some irritation and had some small nicks.  What I was missing was this soap.  I use it with my badger hair brush and bowl and it was like moving from a Geo Tracker to a Bently.  The shave was so smooth and allowed me to easily get the hard parts on my neck and face.  I read reviews of some saying how the scent was too strong, but I love it.  I still havent decided if its very old man smelling or just very masculine (I&#x27;m 28).  It reminds me of how you should smell after you just left a classic barbershop.  I cant say enough good things about this product</li>
    <li> Good product! I find the Sandalwood scent on this to be very nice, and I don&#x27;t agree with it being too strong. The price is also great at about $15 for a tub that will last for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I am only slightly disappointed in the lather. I was hoping this would replace the much more expensive Trumper cream I&#x27;ve been using and love, but I can&#x27;t say that it really will. The Taylor cream is of a bit \\&quot;harder\\&quot; consistency and I think that may be the difference. I have to use more cream to create a lather that doesn&#x27;t feel as slick when shaving, and starts to thin out after the first pass to where I feel I need to lather up even more to finish all three passes. On the other hand, using less of the Trumper cream yields much more lather that is also more protective (at least in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s a good product and I&#x27;ll update this post after experimenting some more if I figure out how to make it perform better.</li>
    <li> Great product for any gentleman</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using plain soap lather (a good soap), which works. But I wanted to find something that worked better and I have with Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> My first tub of soap for my new DE razors. I like the product.</li>
    <li> good cream. The wife says I smell like an old person though???</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving cream - frankly I chose it based on other Amazon reviews. And I was not disappointed. It smells great, goes on smooth (I also bought a Tweezerman shaving brush) and was affordable too. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I got the product in good time and it was packaged well.  I opened it to smell it (it smelled good to me) but it wasn&#x27;t creamy like shaving cream should be, it was solid.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wonderful stuff for something like 20 years. Nothing I have ever tried even comes close. A small amount produces rich billows of moisturizing lather. It almost makes shaving — which I detest — a pleasure.</li>
    <li> I rate this shaving cream a real five stars! I have about eight shaving soaps and creams that I use on a rotating basis and this is one that will definitely be replaced when I use it up. This lathers thick, rich, and easily. I shave mostly with straight razors and Taylor of Old Bond Street is a preferred cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of this product.  It&#x27;s made wet shaving a breeze!</li>
    <li> Magically gets your whiskers ready to be smoothly shaved off.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shaving cream bowl, creates a richer lather than the soap I currently use but it is more expensive. This bowl lasted myself personally when I was originally learning to use a badger brush and safety razor just under 3 months which isn&#x27;t atrocious. But now I simply buy the hypoallergenic soap pucks and replace them in the waterproof bowl container. I would recommend this product just because the bowl is top notch and is so useful when you travel a lot. It seals tight and does not allow your luggage to become wet. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed by this product. I figured it should be better than Proraso red since it is &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34;, but IMHO this does not even compare and it is twice the price. First thought was this is hard to get a good lather with but it does have a pretty good smell (not as good as Proraso red). Next thought was I really don&#x27;t like how this feels on my skin. Your razor will glide smooth but all in all for twice the price of Proraso red this product is overrated and I will probably not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I waited until I have used the product 10+ times to review.</li>
    <li> The cream itself is amazing.  Not familiar with the sandalwood smell I decided to try it out.  It definitely is very strong and lingers all day. Would definitely suggest finding the sandalwood smell elsewhere and deciding if you like it before purchasing.  Some people have written that the smell isn&#x27;t &#x27;strong&#x27;, but it will definitely fill a room.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the scent, but the quality of the cream is there.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream. Has a great aroma and gentle on the skin. Makes for a good smooth shave; great way to start the day. Grab a badger hair brush and you&#x27;ll be good go.</li>
    <li> All i have to say is this shaving cream is the best. But the one i received had a good amount missing from it and i know because i have had this cream before but its so good i didnt care.</li>
    <li> It smells great! I bought it for my husband and reading the other reviews.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff!  Its much more economical than regular shave cream and its effective.  My husband has a beard, but shaves his head (what is left of his hair).  This stuff is fine with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son and he loves the smell and glide of this product.  I will be buying some for myself next time!</li>
    <li> Even better they the art of you know who at a fraction of the price. New staple. Hands down.</li>
    <li> Nice thick protective lather which works up quicker than a shaving soap. My first time for sandalwood. The scent is a little strong but fades quickly enough. This and the Taylor avacado are the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My regular product for over 20 years....still the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Not my prime cream to go for, only because it irritated my skin but works great, shipped on time.i recommend it if you don&#x27;t have senitive skin</li>
    <li> Made my skin burn. But other than that I&#x27;m sure something would like it.</li>
    <li> Really great product! I haven&#x27;t had razor burn yet with this shaving cream as it&#x27;s definitely a smooth gliding surface. It smells great and my roommates at college have asked about it as they like the smell. It is also cheap enough to give it a shot. Feel free to ask any questions.</li>
    <li> Very easy to lather....and oh that wonderful smell....</li>
    <li> My husband bought this shaving cream to try something different from his usual cream. He loves it! It takes very little to work up a great lather, so this bowl is going to last a long time. His face feels so soft and he smells soooo good when he is done shaving. I don&#x27;t think he will be trying any other brands for a while.</li>
    <li> Was not sure about this when I purchased it. Did so based on reviews. Pleasantly surprised. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This shave cream makes a nice thick lather that has a pleasant sandalwood smell and comes in a great container with a screw down top suitable for travel - it will not open accidentally in your luggage!</li>
    <li> I love this scent on my husband.  His face feels so soft after shaving!</li>
    <li> This works and smells great!</li>
    <li> The Sandalwood smell is strong enough to tickle the senses, but not overbearing. I love this scent on my boyfriend, and he loves how crazy I go over it! It shipped quickly and was exactly what I&#x27;d hoped, and at a fair price.</li>
    <li> This was the first shaving crème I bought when I started shaving with the safety razor. Love the smell and the shave I get plus my skin doesn&#x27;t break out.</li>
    <li> One of the best shaving creams, i have used.</li>
    <li> I was looking to get some more Art of Shaving shaving cream and decided to look at a couple of option.  Reviews on this looked good so I gave it a shot and am glad that I did.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is as good as it gets</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t linger the whole day. Gets a good lather and makes for a good shave.</li>
    <li> Shaving with this stuff is great. It made my face smell like sandalwood for the whole day. It lathered up excellently and I only had to reapply once because it dried out. It did an excellent job of moisturizing my face as well. I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough. I really enjoyed my shave.</li>
    <li> This soap is super soft. It needs hardly any lathering at all to get enough product onto the brush. Goes on smooth and lathers quickly and softly.</li>
    <li> As others have said, a little goes a very long way.  As to weather or not this is a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; sandalwood smell is beyond me as I have never really smelled sandalwood before.  To my sniffer, this smells like a real barber shop and not &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; like as others have implied.  It gives a lot of protection to my face during the shave.  I have pretty normal skin and it has never really left my skin dry at all.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I tried proraso green tub prior to this, by recommendation of a friend. I tried this one on a whim, and am much more satisfied than I thought I would be. I like the smell, which is rich and complex. The consistency is of slightly solidified cream, and is very easy with only a slight push of a wet shaving brush, to properly load. The biggest difference/advantage, is how well it lathers. With 30 seconds of working in a shave bowl, the lather is very thick, and easy to get to a proper level of moisture, without being runny. I&#x27;m an enormous fan, and recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent and less irritation than with the shaving soap I was using before. 4 stars because of the price but just a small dollop will make a plenty of lather for 2-3 razor passes so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Oh, my Sweet Zombie Jesus. My package arrived today, I lathered like a champ, and my face has never been this ridiculously, silky smooth. Ever. Ever. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back for a second shave so my &amp;#34;close shaven&amp;#34; patches could be maintained to &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; like the rest of my face. I keep petting my face, which is a little strange but HOLY MAN-O so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback I have is that my entire face is smooth like a baby&#x27;s ass, and I&#x27;m the only one to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO SMOOTH. NOBODY KNOWS. It&#x27;s a problem.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is outstanding.  Not much is needed for a great lather.  The scent is a tad strong for my taste but you get used to it.  Leaves my face smooth and not too oily.  This will be my go to shave cream going forward.  Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream!  With this and a</li>
    <li> I ordered this shave cream for my husband as a replacement for his usual brand (the Art of Shaving) when his (my) preferred scent was out of stock. A man can never go wrong smelling like sandalwood, keep that in mind fellas.  It seems to lather up as well as, if not better than his normal brand (he uses an Art of shaving brush to lather up) and I love how baby soft and kissable his face is after a shave with this stuff. It seems to be super moisturizing. So overall this is a fantastic product.  I however, cannot bring myself to get it 5 stars! As great as it is for shaving the scent leaves me more than a little disappointed. The sandalwood scent is pretty light and it has a medical soap scent that is a little overbearing. For that reason alone when he runs out of this stuff I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it for him again.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this shaving cream........the smell is amazing!!</li>
    <li> OK!! I have never used shave cream like this before, but it is GREAT!!! some of the reviewers complain that it doesn&#x27;t smell like Sandalwood, which in comparison to oils and incense, they are most likely right, BUT no matter, the smell is, as one reviewer put it: &amp;#34;like the old barber shop smell of the old days&amp;#34; and he&#x27;s right AND the women LOVE it. My wife said that it smelled &amp;#34;Manly&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s good enough for me. I&#x27;m looking into getting more of these Taylor of Old Bond Street toiletries because I like the smell of the shave cream so much, I want the rest of me to smell that good!!! would I buy it again? IN A HEARTBEAT!!! OH! and the shave? I&#x27;m using a Mach 3 Gillette right now and the cream made the shave, smooth as glass, I don&#x27;t have a tough beard, about average, but the very few nicks I did get, the cream seemed to stop the bleeding, without the sting that the alum sticks give. BOTTOM LINE: Very GOOD product.</li>
    <li> Great scent, and a shave as close as a babys butt. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Feels great, smells great.</li>
    <li> A nice shave cream. Not sure if it lathers that great. It could be my old art of shaving brush. Getting a new Parker brush today and we&#x27;ll see the difference. It&#x27;s not overwhelming scented whic I like.  Edit. After six months with this product, I have to say, that it has become my favorite shave cream. I like it better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Smells awesome!</li>
    <li> There are two primary functions of a cream: 1) It helps lubricate your skin for a good shave 2) It goes away afterward Secondary, it should smell nice. Ok, the cream does smell nice, though it is a bit strong. As to the first functions, the cream did create a nice lather. Rather, it is a lather, there really is no lathering process with it. You can just apply it. You don&#x27;t even need a brush. However, my skin felt irritated afterwards. So, I don&#x27;t think it did a particularly good job of lubricating my skin. It was a bit pasty. The second function is not mentioned as much, but I find it important. The stuff should be easy to get off your razor and face when you&#x27;re done with it. This is not the case with this cream. It does not dissolve in water at all. You have to have a fairly strong stream of hot water to get it out of the crevices of your razor. It also doesn&#x27;t come off your face easily. I felt like I still had a film on my face after washing. I very much prefer my shaving soap. It lathers nicely, provides a great shave, and washes off. I did a search for &amp;#34;shaving soap&amp;#34; on Amazon, but this appeared and I ordered it accidentally. So, I tried it, but was displeased. It was a waste of money.  EDIT: Because of other reviews I saw, I figured there must be a different  technique to using this cream. After a video and some practice, I was able to get up a decent lather and it washed off better. There was still some residue on my razor each time I changed blades, even though I rinsed it each time. So, there is something not quite like soap in it, which is why I still take off one star. Overall, it does the job and wasn&#x27;t the waste of money I thought it was.</li>
    <li> Excellent lather-more of the consistency of cream than soap.  Results in close shaves and smells great too.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning with the Sandal Wood Oil and it is definitely a positive experience. I have tried the soap and the cream seems to get a nice lather easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out. I found out that you only need a small amount on your brush, then brush on your face for a perfect lather. I used too much at first and wasted a lot. The smell is very interesting and I look forward to it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Won&#x27;t shave with anything other than this...no need to...haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> Great shave cream, gives a very smooth shave an I love the smell!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shaving cream. I don&#x27;t get why people use the garbage aerosol creams and gels sold at stores. So much more comfortable and so much more smooth shaving. The only thing that may be a problem for some people is that the fragrance lingers for a few hours. I prefer if it didn&#x27;t because it collides with my cologne. It is not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s kinda 70&#x27;s barber shop fragrance :)</li>
    <li> I used to shave with regular shaving gel from a can. If my beard was too long I couldn&#x27;t bear to shave because of all the tugging and pulling and scraping. It was as if I was shaving with just water. I decided that enough was enough. I purchased this cream with the intention of using a Edwin Jagger best badger brush, but my beard had gotten too long and the brush hadn&#x27;t arrived yet. So I said f it and I heated up a wash cloth, put it on my face for 3 minutes or so, then took a bit of this cream on my hands and just rubbed it in my beard. At first it wasn&#x27;t lathering very well so I decided to wet my hands a bit. Right away it started becoming a nice thick lather, coating and lubing my beard for the shave to come. I took my razor, which was a couple weeks old, and started shaving. It shaved the hair off as if it was just wiping it away. No tugging, no irritation afterward, just a nice smooth shave. I had to clear the razor out after every pass because it became so clogged with hair that it wouldn&#x27;t shave anymore. I give this an A+, though this particular smell isn&#x27;t to my liking, I&#x27;ll probably get something a little more girly smelling, like lime or lavender.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shaving cream and we both love it!  He likes the creamy foam which many other shave creams don&#x27;t have and the comfortable shave he gets.  We both love the scent!  I love walking into the bathroom after he has used it as the scent lingers long after he has left.  He has tried one other scent but so far this is the favorite.  He will be trying out some more in other scents, but, will be keeping this one on hand .</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street, in all of its products, brings old style class to the art of shaving.  I have purchased the sandalwood, the lavender and the lime products--all top shelf. Give up the disposable lifestyle in shaving, get Taylor, and a class double edged bladed safety razor, and make shaving a pleasurable ritual.</li>
    <li> My better half got this for me, and I absolutely love it. I was using Proraso previously and I think this is much better. I have sensitive skin, and this cream is definitely MUCH smoother and creamier than Proraso. I get a closer and more comfortable shave with this cream, it is more forgiving of my minor shaving mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say this is too scented, I disagree. I think it&#x27;s the right amount of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a traditional safety razor by Merkur with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is OK. I really like the smell and it provides a good cushion. My only problem with it is that it is not quite slick enough for me. Not bad though.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law.  Either he or his wife picked this, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s something he really wants.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream mostly because I love the scent of sandalwood.  It is clean smelling and not as strong as old spice.  My husband has been using it since Christmas and loves it.</li>
    <li> I have been a hot soap double edge shaver for years but always used Poraso or Mama Bears and thought I got a good shave but the difference with MWS is amazing.  The shave seems closer and is definitely more comfortable.</li>
    <li> There are a few video reviews on the internet comparing this product to other popular creams/gels. I recommend looking for those videos before purchasing. They will give you an idea of how well this shaving cream compares to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) This cream took much longer to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;2) The container may be more expensive when being compared to canned gels/creams, but it doesn&#x27;t take much of this to cover a decent sized area of your face. I&#x27;m almost on my second container and have shaved about 4 times a week for 4 or 5 months out of the first.&lt;br /&gt;3) Fragrance is kind of strong, but not intolerable. I always rinse my face well after using it anyway, and that seems to pretty much eliminate the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) You need a brush and a bowl to mix this up well.</li>
    <li> Nice thick cream with a great smell.  My wife can&#x27;t get close enough after I shave.</li>
    <li> Smells great, really great actually, and because it&#x27;s a cream, you only need a little to get a great lather. I use a badger brush and a large mug and compared to my pucks, I can whip up a lather with very little soap that&#x27;ll last through 3 or 4 passes. Feels great on your skin and definitely assists in performing a remarkable shave. Excellent soap!</li>
    <li> This product ranks #3 with Truefitt &amp; Hill and Trumper.  The cream performs well and lathers well.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I’ll just say I love the Taylor of Bond Street Sandalwood products; every product of theirs I’ve used has lasted a fair amount of time. It’s a nice smelling shaving cream and it’s lasted for over 11 months now. I’m finally getting to the bottom of the bowl but still have probably one month of shaves left in it. If I figure out the cost per use; $15 for shaving cream and a decent brush, $30-$100 (your choice), it pays for itself pretty quick and I’m not buying cases of canned shaving cream.</li>
    <li> So many other reviews here have listed the positive aspects of this shaving cream, and I agree. This is an excellent product. The smell is manly and I love it (so does my wife). This product and its great smell have become an important part of my shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Product works great, but make sure to wash your face afterwards if you are gonna get fresh with someone. The soap taste will transfer to the others mouth.</li>
    <li> This is now a staple for me and have introduced it to several of my friends and family. It lathers good (you will need another bowl to do it in, but shouldn&#x27;t be any big deal) and has a smell from my childhood.</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Best smelling shaving cream in the world.</li>
    <li> Good smell, nice texture, but doesn&#x27;t produce as much lather as I&#x27;d like, and the lather it produces is a little thin for my taste. Other than that, good stuff!</li>
    <li> I switched over to a safety razor sometime back, I got tired of being ripped off with the multi head razors. Even at Costco you would pay a lot of money for a pack of razors. In any event I did have to make an investment to get going I purchased two safety razors ,one an Edwin Jagger the other a Mercur plus a Badger brush, bowl soap,etc.. I also have approx. 1000 blades from different suppliers, I have been paying between $7.00 and $10.00 per hundred. I use the blades two times only, they are so cheap it&#x27;s not worth messing with. We then come to the shaving experience, I do the three part set, down, across, and up. You need a pre shave oil and a decent shaving cream. This product is the real deal. You will get a better shave and the bowl lasts for ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes using this shaving cream.  I enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> I am normally a Trumper person.  I received this and I have to say, I love it.  The product lathers very well, you don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  The fragrance is fantastic.  Reminiscent of a shaving parlor in London.  The buying experience was perfect and the price point was good as well.  Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Good product and a good price.  It smells nice and lather is insane.  It actually requires much less than you might think to get a solid lather.  Very happy</li>
    <li> Lathers extremely thick with just the right amount of water and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the soap cakes, which is what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> Very good scent and did a great job of protecting my face while shaving; no razor burn at all.  Definitely a smell of the Old World mixed with a barber shop.  Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give me a better shave than proraso. The issue is more just the oily feeling on my skin after using it. Just not my preference. Considering its popularity, I would still try it as most people i know like it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different products and this one is by far my favorite.  It smells great, lathers extremely quick and easy.  Highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
    <li> It is easy to mix and lathers nicely, but it leaves a soap scum feeling on your skin and sink that is very water resistant which makes it hard to shave with. I&#x27;ve found it easier to just use normal shaving cream. I see no difference in the shave other than the smell.</li>
    <li> A little on the expensive side, but the smell is fantastic (heavy sandalwood notes dissipate when you wash the cream off and leave a very pleasant, subtle odor after you&#x27;re done) and a little goes a LONG way (I predict one tub will last approx. 6 months).  I put a very small amount (dime sized) on my hands, rub them together and apply to face/beard.  Using a badger brush would probably work even better, but this method suits me just fine.  Highly recommend and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The scent is excellent, it stays with you all day. The cream is rich and smooth. Excellent shave cream, give your face a treat.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use with my shaving brush and DE razor. I find the scent quite nice and the shaving cream doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> When I first started learning how to shave with a brand new Parker 99R double edge razor, I bought the colonel conk soap since it seemed to be what everybody bought. After many shaves and cuts, I was about to give up on the experiment altogether. I could tell that I wasn&#x27;t getting much lubrication from the soap and I figured I&#x27;d try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting the Taylor of Old Bond Street cream after reading on several forums that this cream was the real deal. Well it is. With small amounts on the badger brush, it produces a very thick smooth lather. I still nick myself occasionally, but it&#x27;s not from the blade jumping around from my face being too dry. I also never feel overwhelmed by the scent of this cream, in fact, I rather enjoy it quite a bit (and so does my wife).</li>
    <li> I say for the price this is a good product. I lathers really well, so much that I can get a second lathering for a second pass. This cream is far superior to any of that crap that squirts out of a can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit strong for my taste, more especially if you are going to use an aftershave or cologne of a different fragrance. As a stand alone scent it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 13.00 purchase should last me 1-2 years so I feel it is a good buy and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian V.</li>
    <li> Just outstanding! I am going to be hooked on to this one for a while. I am into my 3rd month already with this one bowl &amp; still have over 40% of the cream left. Love it!!! The sandalwood fragrance stays all day!!! This cream along with a badger hair brush just make it all so perfect!</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving cream. The fragrance is wonderful and a little goes a long way so the jar lasts a long time. I like all the Taylor of Old Bond shaving products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives a good lather and feels good on the skin. Used other products in the past but have switched completely to this one. Strongly recommend people try it</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help shave after several days of facial hair growth as my face tends to be very sensitive afterwards. I was very pleased with this product! It also has a very pleasant, mild scent of sandalwood which my wife liked.</li>
    <li> Game Changer.... Best shaving cream known to man.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff.  My first shaving cream.  Lathers easily, smells great, and softens nicely.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this shaving cream.  It lathers up very well with a brush feels great on the skin and leaves my skin feeling good. Does not take much to get a good lather so it seems like the bowl will last quite a while.  I like the sandalwood smell - and, more importantly, so does my wife.</li>
    <li> Awesome and a good price!</li>
    <li> Great scent, Abundant lather, close,clean shave....THE VERY BEST. I  Highly Recommend Old Bond Street and would buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> with this shaving cream!! I have been looking and having him try many types of shaving creams, but they all seem to give him razor burn. He has had nothing but wonderful things to say about this product. The smell is amazing and his face sure is soft! :) A++++</li>
    <li> After getting the knack of how much water to mix with a given amount of Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream, I find it works great, in terms of lubricating your skin--in other words-- allowing the blade to cut the whiskers close without the blade actually contacting your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can take or leave the Sandalwood scent, because, I mean, if you&#x27;re gonna use an aftershave when you&#x27;re done shaving, I mean, hey, why would you care what scent the shaving cream has? Maybe I&#x27;m all wet on this, no pun intended; someone maybe can straighten me out here.</li>
    <li> This stuff was even better than I hoped. It smells awesome and the lather is mind-blowing if you have been used to using spray can shaving cream that smells like cheap cologne. I will definitely be getting more of this stuff when I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. I love the lather and the fragrance. Along with a good razor, it results in a very smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> one of the best products I have used. The fragrance is just right and gives you a fresh feel. 5 Stars all the way through.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Lathers well and provides a great shave. A value compared to some other creams. All the TOBS creams I&#x27;ve tried so far have been great. This was my first but now I think the grapefruit is my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Nice texture and smell. Though I do prefer the smell of the Art of Shaving sandalwood more as this does not have the same smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally new to wetshaving and this has been my first real shaving cream purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let me tell you, this stuff is AMAZING. Whips into a great lather fairly quickly. The tub is a lot bigger than I anticipated and can easily see this behemoth lasting me 6 months maybe more. Some people mentioned the smell is way too overpowering but I think it&#x27;s just right. It&#x27;s definitely prevalent though. I shaved last night and this morning (8 hours later) I can still smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, that&#x27;s perfect because I love the smell of sandalwood. I didn&#x27;t know what it was before this purchase mind you. It has a very manly smell to it. Somebody mentioned it smells like his grandpa, but that&#x27;s because his grandpa is obviously a man. I&#x27;m 22, and wearing this out I&#x27;ve had women ask me what the fantastic smell is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I gotta say is be careful about wearing cologne after you shave with this. Like I said it&#x27;s not overpowering but it&#x27;s subtle afterwards just like cologne should be. And I like sandalwood to the point where I&#x27;m okay with saving a spray of my cologne for a day I didn&#x27;t shave. 10/10 will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently switched to this and fell in love with it. It smells great, not too overpowering, makes a great lather and is super slick! Your razor will glide effortlessly over your face. i use the weight of my razor to get a baby butt smooth shave, no pressure at all! I&#x27;ll use this for as long as I can find it!</li>
    <li> i have used many soaps this soap is wonderful! Barely put any on the end of your brush kinda poke it! For those who are new to shave soap! It makes a perfect lather and it smells soooo sooo good! You have to try it!</li>
    <li> This stuff has chemicals in it such as Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone (try to pronounce those), and a long list of other ones.  It&#x27;s a lot of work just investigating these chemicals.  The fragrance, shown on the container as &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34;, is probably at least partially composed of chemicals too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the chemicals, this stuff is much harder to use than regular Gillette or Barbasol foam in a can.  I can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;m probably going to just toss it out.  The only objection I have to the Barbasol (or other similar canned shaving creams) is that they have sodium lauryl sulfate in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather that you get with this Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream is insufficient, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  The best I could get was a thin layer of lather on my face.  I also noticed that the bathroom had the very strong odor of this shaving cream, even a day after I first tried using it.  Again, I strongly suspect that the fragrance in this stuff is composed of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the trouble and just buy cans of shaving cream.  I can get cans of Barbasol shaving cream down the street at our local redneck supermarket for $1.00.  You&#x27;ll also be saving the cost of a shaving brush that way.</li>
    <li> love this stuff ! lathers up with only a small dab on your fingertip . will last a LONG time and gives great shave.  smell is great too.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a price.  Scent is a great nostalgic barber shop sandalwood and the lather this stuff generates is top tier!</li>
    <li> This stuff is heaven to my nose. Feels like silk. Just a tiny bit lathers up more than enough to shave with. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Most pleaseing scent, good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Contents were not firm . Consistency was like icing . First one I purchased was superior and firmer . Still usable just not as pleased with second purchase .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and tried different kinds of soaps to shave with... and they always dried my face too much and put a drag on my razor... until I purchased the Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) Sandalwood Shaving Cream! You don&#x27;t need a whole lot to get a rich creamy lather in your shaving mug... and it feels really good on your face... but never feeling dry. The razor really &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; across the face... making shaving a pleasure rather than a chore...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the aroma of the sandalwood in the cream... not too heavy but a clean manly fragrance... which will last most of the day. TOBS is now my go to shaving cream... and will be buying more in the future...</li>
    <li> Bought from Mike&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Care.Seems as though it may be a fake.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not Sandalwood....Stay Away!!!</li>
    <li> I lather on the face and this cream makes a wonderful, thick lather that is a dream to shave with. No wonder it&#x27;s recommended by everyone!</li>
    <li> Now &amp;#34;this&amp;#34; is shaving cream.  I was using ProRaso which is more like a soap, (hard).  Taylor lathers so smoothly, and most importantly protects my head much better.  I don&#x27;t even use warm water anymore.  Heck, i don&#x27;t even wet my hair first.  I just wet the brush and lather up.  My shaves have been baby smooth since I started using. Best of all, my speed has improved drastically.  I will be buying again, this time, more than 1.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever tried a shaving cream. It actually all seemed pretty awesome, it lathers up incredibly well and smells great. The only problem is that it&#x27;s almost like putting acid on my face. It pretty much starts to tingle when it goes on, and by the end of my shave it is irritated as can be. I was only able to get three shaves from this cream before I had to give it up. I have been shaving for 5 years with cut throat razors and DE razors, and have used an unscented cheap shaving soap from wal-mart and kroger and have never gotten this kind of reaction or irritation on my face. It&#x27;s too bad, if it didn&#x27;t irritate my face it would be an awesome shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. It may seem expensive but I&#x27;ve been using the same container for 5 months and I&#x27;m not even half way done...I&#x27;ve used it everyday. Get rid of that stuff in a can and use some real shaving cream...worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Smells Wonderful. Fast Delivery!</li>
    <li> This product came damaged.  It was not packaged properly (it came in a mailing envelope instead of a box) and there was a big crack in the plastic bowl.  My husband didn&#x27;t want to go through the bother of returning it so he had to transfer the shaving cream to a Tupperware bowl. The cream itself smells nice.</li>
    <li> Smells so good I wish I could eat it... but I don&#x27;t recommend that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really powerful and when it comes to lathering a little goes a very, very long way. I only dip my brush a bit to cover the tips then apply to my face. It lathers very easily and makes for a great shave.</li>
    <li> Like all TOOBS creams, this one gives you a really good lather, possiby even more so than the others based on my first use.  The mixture I received was much denser and not as creamy as the others, so that may be attributed to a slightly better lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave this 3 stars for the lather alone, knowing that it was a good cream based on my experience with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandalwood scent is pretty poor though.  It smells like something an old man would use and lingers the whole morning as its a fairly strong odor.  Scent is clearly up to preference, but after all the positive reviews I had to try sandalwood, and now regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may never use this scent again after this first use and will just stick to more floral scents.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  I read too many reviews of all the similar shaving creams before buying this one.  It was a waste of time since preference is so subjective.  I was mostly concerned about the smell, its actually fine, not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t smell like old man like some reviews said.  Bottom line: this shaving cream works well, its affordable and it smells good.  I like it and i&#x27;ll probably buy it again unless I&#x27;m feeling adventurous and want to try another Taylor brand product.</li>
    <li> After reading the raving reviews for this TOBS sandalwood shaving cream, I decided to try it.  My previous sandalwood was the Art of Shaving cream.  Here is a side by side review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) Sandalwood Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  One of the best lathering creams I have used.&lt;br /&gt;  Provides good slickness and razor protection when used with a badger brush/Double Edge Safety Razor combo.&lt;br /&gt;  Large size container.&lt;br /&gt;  Reasonably Priced at just under $15 for a 5+ ounce container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not a true sandalwood scent, definitely has an overpowering floral scent to me; which I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art of Shaving (AOS) Sandalwood Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  True Sandalwood smell.  I&#x27;ve heard that this cream and Edwin Jagger&#x27;s Sandalwood are as pure Sandalwood as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;  Large Container&lt;br /&gt;  Lathers well; just not as well as the aforementioned TOBS sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;  Provides a great shave with Badger Brush/Double Edge Safety Razor combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Somewhat pricey at close to $25 for a 5+ ounce cream container.  There are more pricier shaving creams out there though :-p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  I may try Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s other scents when I run out of my newly resupplied purchase of Art of Shaving Sandalwood Cream.  The Taylor of Old Bond Street is just not for me based on the overly floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great (even my dog loves the perfume) and makes for a great shaving experience. I would definitely buy this again. If you like the smell of sandalwood and want to enjoy shaving for a change I would recommend this product. Overall, probably my favorite shaving cream to date, compared to Jagger&#x27;s Sea Buckthorn and Trumper&#x27;s Almond. However, they are all great and would happily use them again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got the most fantastic scent, but the cream itself is either too goopy or too watery - difficult to get the mix right. I greatly prefer Williams Mug Shaving Soap.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a DE safety razor now for a while and I&#x27;ve used both shave soap and regular old gel and foam shaving cream. The shave soap just does not work for me and it leaves my face with razor bumps and nicks because it just doesn&#x27;t provide adequate lubrication. Regular shaving cream seemed to do a little better in this regard than shave soap, but the razor wasn&#x27;t exactly gliding across my face with that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works and fixed all of those issues. I don&#x27;t nick myself or get razor burn any longer. Now the razor glides right across my face like a hot knife on butter. Great stuff and one container last a really long time because it only takes a dab on your badger brush to get a good amount of cream after foaming it up. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Very nice to shave with.</li>
    <li> absolutely cannot be beat! I have tried well over 50 shaving creams/lathers and this is without a doubt the best! Thick, rich, lathers like a bomb! And I can feel the body of it, it&#x27;s truly thick and smooth! I cannot say that enough. I use Art of Shaving products and love them! But this has a edge on even them! I am also able to compare to Jack Black, Ewin Jaggar, New York Shaving Co., and many more...this tops it, I am serious! I still use the others in rotation, but man is this ever my go to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is a MUST try, and the SMELL is AWESOME and has a linger to it others simply do not have. I use with the talic, shampoo/body soap, cologne...and am in need of the pre oil. I currently mix using this with the pre oil by AOS with sandalwood. If you have never used this, spend the little bit of money (A little in this case really goes a long way, but the container is NOT little! I over did it the first time on my brush and had to laugh at myself, this cream just does not require much at all!) Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot.  It has a fragrance that works perfectly for my sinuses.  Most fragrances irritate my sinuses to no end, but this is perfect.  Plus, I like the characteristics of the cream as well.  It works very well with my DE safety razor and for the quick shave, also with the cheap multi-edge plastic housings of the &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; shaving tools (sometimes referred to as razors, but really? :)</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely with little effort, does the job well with no burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the smell is a little strong it certainly brings with it a little nostalgia.</li>
    <li> Works nice and the smell makes me feel like I just walked out of the barber shop.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product before purchasing. Figured with that many positive reviews I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. All the hype is right, this truly is a great product. I just barely dip the tips of my warm damp brush in the container, and spin up a lather in my cup. This provides more than enough to cover my face twice. This container should last me a year. I&#x27;ve yet to nick my fave with it either. Some people complain that the smell is to strong but I disagree. The only time I really smell it is when I&#x27;m staying to break a sweat or something at work. But isn&#x27;t that what you want?? My wife loves it too!</li>
    <li> Just a little bit in a damp wooden bowl makes a really nice lather.  And it smells good too.  I liked the smell so much, that I bought Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood cologne and after shave.</li>
    <li> perfect shaving creme</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Lathers well and has a nice smell</li>
    <li> This is awesome, smells incredible and it lathers up great with a great cushion on your face for your razor to sit against.</li>
    <li> Great scent, convenient packaging.  Dried out my skin, and also burned quite a bit when applying for the 2nd/3rd passes with a straightedge, so while this could be a great option for others, it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had much better luck with shea butter based shaving soaps like pre de provence</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. Good smell. Easy lather. I use badger brush with bowl and safety razor. One small dollop produces so much lather.</li>
    <li> I like this shaving cream. Smooth have!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream, smells great and makes a nice thick lather. My skin felt very smooth after using this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, as I still have some shaving soap to use up. It smells good, looks like it will give a good lather........</li>
    <li> Great smell! A little goes a long ways!!</li>
    <li> This shaving CREME is among the best!! No negatives and seller was quick to ship!</li>
    <li> So smooth and luxurious with a calming, rich scent.  Gives your bathroom a great aroma for days after your shave.  There is a reason Taylor of Old Bond Street has been in business for 160 years.  I cannot imagine a higher quality shaving cream.  It lathers up thick and silky smooth.  Simply fantastic!</li>
    <li> Why I was never told about this stuff when I was just a young man, I&#x27;ll never know.  This beats almost every other shave soap and ALL the canned stuff, hands down.  I just get a little on the brush and beat it into a lather in a little pre-heated crockery bowl (which I found at a yard sale.  You&#x27;ll have to experiment with how much to load the brush (not much) and how wet to get it.  Keep fiddling until you hit the magic combination.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> We wil keep using this brand. It&#x27;s the best ever. We both love the smell. It&#x27;s worth the price for sure</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a bit over a year since I discovered the enjoyment of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaving, and put the electric razor (and the accompanying shaving bumps) away. This was the first shaving cream I tried, and I admit, I got lucky, as it is a really good shaving cream, and readily became my favorite (although there are a few others I use to give my face a change). The fragrance, sandalwood, is a favorite scent for me, and it lathers up nicely in the pottery mug I use. My morning shaving ritual includes warming up the mug and brush in hot water, then lathering up, so that the lather goes on nice and thick, and warm on the skin. I think that&#x27;s one of the tricks, warming up the tools in hot water, then lathering up. I recently switched from using dispoosable razors to a real safety razor, and am getting a cleaner shave than is possible with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several other shaving creams and soaps, including a few others that I like, including several from petal pushers that I liked, but not as much as Taylor of Old Bond Street. I have also tried a few, I will not name, that I disliked as they lathered poorly, and were watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am about a third of the way through my second bowl of this product, using about a half teaspoon of product per shave. That amount has been sufficient to get a good, rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope others will enjoy Taylor of Old Bond aas much as I do.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, my first shave the wife commented that she like it. Lather ups well and makes for a really smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great manly scent, came in a timely manner</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and lathers very nice.  I have very thick facial hair and I used to dread shaving ( which I have to do daily for work).  Once I switched to this shaving hasnt become such a chore, shaving is much smoother.  I tried others and I could still feel the razor dragging across my skin.  So I went back to this and will probably only use this product from now on</li>
    <li> Great product! A little goes a long way and creates a great foam. The container takes a long time to use so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost. Love this stuff. Creamy. Foamy. Easy to wash off and clean off.</li>
    <li> I completely understand why people like this product, but there are some definite draw backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;(1) It has a strong sandalwood smell (If you love powerful barbershop scents of yesteryear--this works).&lt;br /&gt;(2) The \\&quot;Cream\\&quot; is thick, applies evenly, and allows for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;(3) It is not necessary to whip up a frothy peak as it is with some soaps using a mug or scuttle.&lt;br /&gt;(4) The tub is a sturdy go-anywhere construction with a great screw top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;(1) It has a strong smell, zero subtlety, and if you wear cologne this scent will compete with it.&lt;br /&gt;(2) The \\&quot;Cream\\&quot; is really more of a synthetic goo--if you like edge gel this works (I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;(3) It can, on occassion slightly irritate my skin, and my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not my everyday cream, but I use it as my gym/travel brand.  It is easier to use and the packaging is indestructible.  I can shave faster with satisfying results with a travel brush and razor.  It is much better than the gym-supplied garbage provided for free.  I do not consider it a top-tier luxurious shaving product, but it does a good job for getting a quality blade shave quickly with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy, you may not realize it by the look of it; but this is a rather large container, i have rather large hands and holding this container in my hand covers from the base of my palm to my middle knuckles on my fingers. This is alot of soap! and it smells like absolutely pure manliness! Using this with a badger hair brush to lather on my face, I was able to achieve the smoothest, closest shave I have ever gotten; and this was with a disposable razor! I have used expensive shave gells, shave cream, cheap cream etc and nothing comes close to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional benefit of using this soap with a brush also is that not only do you get a smooth, fresh shave, you also dont risk any bad chemicals that are commonly found in popular shave gels into your opened poors (via heat) while you shave. instead you get soap in your pours, and with the lathering action of the brush actually cleans and exfoliates your skin as you lather and shave. (citation: see &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving: Shaving made easy&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly reccommend this as a gift for the hubby or for your own use. you wont be dissappointed. just make sure you use a quality badger hair shave brush.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling shave cream ever! It lasts forever because all you need for your shave is a tiny bit on the brush which works up to a nice lather. I look forward to opening up this jar each morning.</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It is way better than the foam or gel that comes in a can.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good as well.</li>
    <li> Smell really good and really creamy</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into shaving, this is definitely the cream to buy! Lasts a long time, i&#x27;ve had the same container for about 6 months now and still more than half in the container left (at some point i was shaving three times a week just for fun). The smell is amazing, i don&#x27;t even use aftershave anymore because i love the smell of sandalwood more. Leaves your face well lubricated as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving creme I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It works, and it makes me smell pretty good when I&#x27;m done. Reminds me of the barber shop my grandfather used to take me to when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus, it makes the bathroom smell good all day.</li>
    <li> Product came in time. TOB sandalwood shaving cream lathers wonderfully with only a small amount. I&#x27;m using a cheap boar brush and just the lightest brush and the cream lathers. amazing product. Smells great as well.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this product.  If it is available, i will use it for life.</li>
    <li> Overall I think this stuff is awesome, easy to apply, makes my face smell nice and makes it easier to shave. I had to give 4/5 because it is a tad expensive in my opinion. Also when I opened the container, it wasn&#x27;t filled to the top and there was even a decent chunk of it missing off of the side (which is really annoying). I hope this lasts me a while because it is by far not the cheapest option. I think next time I&#x27;ll try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Went through several versions of Shaving Cream and was disappointed, until I discovered this offering from Taylor of Old Bond Street. This stuff is soft, easy to apply and smells fantastic! If you&#x27;re in the market, skip the others and just jump right to this one.</li>
    <li> TOBS has a solid reputation for a reason. The product is well made and has a great, but not overwhelming, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of it, and my wife likes the smell. Win/Win.</li>
    <li> Great shaving great.  Lathers very well.  Odor is a little strong for my taste.  Others may love it.  I have switched to their sensitive skin version as it has a much milder scent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and we both love the smell. The sandalwood scent may not be as strong, but still enjoy it. A little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have pretty sensitive skin and this cream is really soothing and doesn&#x27;t overdry. I used to get slight barber&#x27;s rash before switching to a safety razor and badger brush - that problem has completely disappeared, and I have to give some credit to this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a ton of cream in here, and you only really need a dab to get a good quality lather. I get two shaves (with grain first, then against grain) out of a nickle size dollop. Thinking this container will last me almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all that, it smells amazing. Sandalwood might not be for everyone, but it should be.</li>
    <li> This is decent shaving cream. The smell is not as good as you get with the Art of Shaving products.</li>
    <li> Product makes good lather for a smooth shave, but smell is way to powerful. Although the scent is pleasant, it messed with my allergies and gave me a headache. Would rate five stars if it weren&#x27;t for this.</li>
    <li> I am relatively new in the brush shaving realm, but this cream is perfect. Goes on at a great lather and smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> NOT PLEASED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Off I Must Say I Really Liked The Strong Scent In The Soap And The Fine Way It Lathered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Shaving itself was a &#x27;Wretched and Miserable&#x27; experience with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of it left my face very dry and sore and secondly even after 3 passes with a Merker Adjustable Razor with a new blade I still had way too many hairs on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now granted my beard is pretty tough so it takes a &#x27;Good Product&#x27; to shave me smooth so I evaluate my shave soaps by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Scent and Softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &#x27;HOW MUCH HAIR IS REMOVED PERIOD\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i wound up having to re-lather with Proraso a product that works to get a smooth shave.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to finish the shipper sent me the product quickly and the soap does have a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I&#x27;m not pleased so I guess this is my first negative review but maybe the soap was old, Its hard to say?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indiana ED</li>
    <li> This affords me the luxury of getting the very best smooth and clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and lasts longer than others. My face appreciates it also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety-razor shaving, and also to producing a good weight of shaving foam from cream. However, I&#x27;ve always been successful with this soap, and the lovely smell helps me enjoy the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a plastic-bristled brush from Edwin Jagger, and an old stone-ware bowl to great success with this cream. Doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t be trying other creams in future, just to change it up, but this one&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> A tiny little dab on my badger brush makes a huge volume of thick lather that smells fantastic.  It will last for ever.</li>
    <li> I much prefer Proraso soap bowls.  This product has a great smell, good lather, but its acidic and burns quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Not only does this cream lather up beautiful, but it smells amazing. My girlfriend loves how I smell after each shave, she can&#x27;t get enough of it and I enjoy the extra attention. If you don&#x27;t mind ladies cuddling up to you then buy this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use with the Merkur Safety Razor.  Being new to using a safety razor, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when the products arrived and I was able to use them.  The Shaving cream was unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever used (Think canned and pressurized green gunk).  It has that old barber shop smell that I loved as a kid, and it immediately made me think of my father and grandfather(s).  It is best applied with a badger hair brush, and you can use it without mixing it in a mug; just dab the brush into hot water and get a small amount of the cream on the brush then swirl onto the face.  This shaving cream leaves your face smooth and fresh feeling, and provides very good lubrication for the razor.  If you are on the fence about switching from regular Gillette or Schick blades and Barbasol (or similar), I highly recommend just giving this a try.  It has changed the way I go about getting ready in the morning.  Shaving is now a joy instead of a pain.</li>
    <li> Starting on my journey of straight edge razors and this was the first shaving cream I have bought, smells great, awesome consistency. If only it could help stop me cutting myself it would be perfect :D</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my son who uses safety razor &amp; brush.  He loved it.  Great aroma, builds a nice frothy lather, and provides a smooth shave.  I&#x27;m casting off the cartridge razor and canned shaving cream,  going to double edge shaving with this as soon as I can get it ordered and delivered with a badger brush &amp; cup.  Other great items are the Proraso shaving soap with eucalyptus &amp; menthol and the Persona double edge blades.  See my review there.</li>
    <li> I wish they had it in Patchouli but the Sandalwood is great stuff also. I loved the item and the jar was very retro and classy BUT the package was dropped and it was broken when I opened it the shave cream was all over the place but with Amazon there is never a problem I called them and they sent UPS by to pick it up, they have always been fair with me Amazon is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW,... Back to the product, Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream is from Britain and is one of the best quality products you can get for the money. I have used shaving cream in a can when I first started but then due to my first career (military) time and closeness was a problem so I went to plain soap &amp; water and remained that way for years also going with disposable razors. I went to old fashioned shaving cream in a bowl when I left the Navy and went into law enforcement. When a buddy told me about Taylor of Old Bond Street I tried it. WOW! The Very best shave of my life and zero nicks!! I have found my shaving cream! Amazon has it CHEAPER and with Amazon PRIME shipping is free! Hoo-Ya! If you don&#x27;t know shaving cream can last up to about a year and cans well @ $5 or more the cost difference is staggering! Switch to a GOOD DE razor like an Edwin Jagger for about $40 and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandalwood has a retro smell to it and the babes flock to it --- er and my wife loves it to! (oops) great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be using shaving soap it is just ok for disposables but for double edged shaving just try some shaving cream way better.. Will I order it again --- hehehe! YES! (I just re-ordered) Will in Texas</li>
    <li> So THAT&#x27;S how Sandalwood smells, like an old time barbershop!  After reading on Badger &amp; Blade about how fine Sandalwood&#x27;s aroma is and what a great shaving cream TOBS is, I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took just a small dab to work up a LOT of rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers fantastically, goes on easily, and my razor glides right over.  VERY close shave, no irritation, and a great aroma that hangs around without being very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the HUGE lather produced by just a small dab, I&#x27;ll be buying this again . . in about a year!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites.  I like the fragrance and get a nice shave from it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face and the blade glides over my skin.</li>
    <li> Shaved for the first time with it lathered great smeeled good and got a real good shave with it recommend this product if you are looking for a great shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Thicker than proraso. Good stuff.  The sandalwood leaves u smelling nice. Give it a try u wont be disappointed. It should last me a year.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten a better shave until I started using double edged razors and this shaving cream is simply marvelous. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Product itself is ok.  But the wife really hates the smell of this Sandal Wood. I&#x27;m going to try another scent and see how it goes .</li>
    <li> I have not tried more than Art of Shaving and now Taylor of Old Bond Street, but the Taylor of Old Bond Street gives a much smoother shave.  It seems to lather better as well.  The sent is not overpowering and the size of the container is just right.</li>
    <li> I had been using &amp;#34;Proraso&amp;#34;, but decided to give this a try. All I can say is WOW! This gave me the best shave I have ever had. Silky smooth! It has a great scent, too!</li>
    <li> Could not be more pleased.  Price is great and the results are excellent.  Good lather with brush and stays moist for a good period while shaving.</li>
    <li> I thought the fragrance was ok but the cream itself was too thin and runny and &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling for my taste. I prefer a foamy or lathery cream and this was not it. Not my taste.</li>
    <li> I just bought this shaving cream, a EJ DE89LBL, and a EJ brush all at the same time. This shaving cream was the best part of the purchase. I love the smell, and I enjoyed the ritual of making my own lather. I liked it so much I bought 4 more cans of TOBS cream in different scents to switch it up from time to time. Really an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I shave my head with this and it feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself. Leaves me smelling great all day. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of this product and plan on ordering more before I ever run dry! Need only a small amount for lots of lather. This product makes you feel like a king!</li>
    <li> Love this cream... Best I&#x27;ve tried in the past 27 years. Easy to (face) lather, great sandalwood smell, slick as I want a shaving cream to be.</li>
    <li> This probably is good for someone without sensitive skin. The perfumes in it burnt my head up. I&#x27;m gonna try the non-scented and see.</li>
    <li> I have been using a straight razor now for about 3 years.  I really like this cream.  It lathers up very nice and I love the sandalwood scent.</li>
    <li> Outstanding.  I&#x27;m an everyday shaver, including my head, and this is the best cream on the market.  This is the 5th time I re-purchased it.  I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re an everyday shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a really good shaving cream. It has the fragrance of creams from old school barber shops and very good texture. Good packaging too.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband. He likes it, but the scent is a bit strong. I thought it was going to include a bowl but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great lather, rich cream, smooth glide. Personally I love the aroma of sandalwood, if you don&#x27;t, they have other scents. And I&#x27;ve heard some people are allergic to it (the sandalwood specifically) and get irritation, so again, many other scent options!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the better part of a year. I think a tub lasts about 7 months, or so. It smells good and keeps me from taking off too much and getting irritation. Wih shaving gels I was never able to shave every day because of irritation and now I don&#x27;t have those issues.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, has a fantastic smell, whips up beautifully, and provides that perfect blend of protection and glide for my shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: you do not need much at all to create a good amount of lather so use it sparingly.  If it&#x27;s not whipping up quite enough dab the tip of your brush in the water and it&#x27;ll help build up the lather.</li>
    <li> I always thought that the main cause of my horrible shaving experience was the razor.  After giving this product a try, I can say that my main issue was the horrible gels and creams I had been using.  I&#x27;ve used this product with safety razors, electric razors, and cartridge razors, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint; the cream works equally with all.  Also, while the item is a bit of an initial investment, in the long run, it does save money.  A pea sized dollop of the cream provides more than enough lather for my morning shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream.. I like the scent and it lathers great.  It certainly is a strong scent as all other users say it is, but I don&#x27;t find it overpowering.. but that&#x27;s really something different for everybody.  I never thought I&#x27;d notice a difference between the under $5 can and this type (my first time ever shaving with out the can stuff) but wow... Yah.. there&#x27;s a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is that when I received the bowl, it appears to have a large amount of the shaving cream removed from it, leaving a rather sizable hole.. at first I thought maybe that&#x27;s just the way the cream settled in the bowl, until I looked around and internet pictures and noticed it should be full to the top (so there wouldn&#x27;t have been that room to settle to one side) and it really does looked &amp;#34;scooped out&amp;#34;  Anyway -- it&#x27;s not going to be worth to send it back, but due to that I am deducting a star to what I would have otherwise rated 5.</li>
    <li> Genuine old-timey smell, works great with a brush, doesn&#x27;t dry out immediately. do yourself a solid and get this for your face.</li>
    <li> The shave is probably the best I have ever had but the smell is over powering. Its like sandalwood x 10! Definitely getting more but a different scent.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works great, and seemingly lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Wonderful lather that makes for a great shave. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving cream It is good quality And I think the price is right And it was delivered on time</li>
    <li> It seems I cannot get to the bottom of this tub...Taylor of Old goes a long long way. Great value! And my wife loves the scent...so double bonus.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great, and very easy to lather up.  However, the lubrication of Taylor&#x27;s is not nearly as good as Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat soap, at least for me. With a safety razor, lubrication is everything.</li>
    <li> Amazing shaving cream! Taylor of old bond street never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Great lather and smell.  Shaving 3 to 4 days a week, each bowl/tub lasts about 5-6 months. Truly a quality product.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t shaved with TOOBS products, you are missing out on the best shave possible.  Couple that with a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide and you can&#x27;t get a better shave, impossible, anywhere!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shave soap. Thick, rich lather, great scent and lingers a bit with you all day. My wife loves the scent, and I get a really great shave with this soap.Its a premium product, so it costs a bit more than some, but it lasts a good long time, and your face is worth it. Use good stuff, and enjoy the shave ritual!</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and leaves my skin smooth. During my shave I noticed that the lather was very creamy and was easy to rinse off of the razor. I will be trying some of the other scents available when I need more. Good product!</li>
    <li> My son-in law loves this. He&#x27;ll use it with the Semogue 620 boar bristle shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Most say that the choice of shaving cream comes down to personal preference, and they are correct.  Of course, many things come down to personal preference.  My preference is this product: a fantastic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overload your olfactory sensors; lather that lasts and provides a smooth surface for a safety razor to glide over; a great value to boot.  I cannot imagine ever needing, or choosing, another brand or product.</li>
    <li> Makes a nice lather that is thicker than the shaving soap that I bought from Wally-World.  Smells like grandpa.</li>
    <li> This shaving creme is great!!!!</li>
    <li> Smooth shave. Rick lather. Great scent</li>
    <li> Love the scent and consistency</li>
    <li> classic aroma, rich lather</li>
    <li> I love my Taylor of Old Bond. Now, it&#x27;s not my only soap. I also love my Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat. The Taylor is a shave cream. It is soft. It won&#x27;t last as long as the Mitchell&#x27;s. But wow, it smells great (I have the Sandalwood) and it makes a great lather! I love the fact that the jar has a screw top so it doesn&#x27;t risk popping off if you travel - like my RazoRock or Proraso. This is a quality product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream has a very nice scent and lathers better than any shaving cream I have purchased.  However, there is something about this soap that causes my skin to react.  There are other soaps that do not cause problems for me; they just do not lather as nicely.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream works as advertised.  Easily whips up into a pleasant smelling lather.</li>
    <li> The lather builds really nice really fast, and slick,I would give it a 3.5 if possible the scent wasn&#x27;t for me it reminded me of standard soap scent who h isn&#x27;t bad just not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a manly man...this is the stuff.  Love it.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the TOBS creams and I like this one the best.  I&#x27;m going to try 1805, it will arrive today.  If 1805 by Truefitt &amp; Hill is not better than TOBS Sandalwood I&#x27;ll probably quit looking for the ultimate shaving cream.  I will be completely happy with the Sandalwood.  Happy Shaving.  Update: I just tried the Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 and though it&#x27;s a fine cream, it doesn&#x27;t measure up to the scent of TOBS Sandalwood. If someone finds a better scent than TOBS Sandalwood please let me know... I&#x27;d like to try it. Happy Shaving.</li>
    <li> After DE shaving for over a year now, I feel like I have been doing it wrong this entire time after using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream. This product produces a very rich lather that is very easy to load into a boar hair brush. A small amount goes a long away and just an almond size amount produced enough lather for 3-4 passes with my DE razor (though I only do 2 passes and I will be sure to use a little less next time). The first thing you will notice after unscrewing the cap is the wonderful Sandalwood smell that this product has. It brings back memories of an old time barber shop and is very clean and pleasant smelling. The lather made my skin very slick and produced a very smooth shave when combined with my Astra Platinum blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I used this product after using a well known and liked shave soap for the past year. This product was much easier to use and produced a much nicer shave with a luxurious or premium feel to it. If I had known I would have liked this shaving cream so much, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a refill of my other shave soap so recently. If you are on the fence about buying this shaving cream (I was due to the price), do yourself a favor and try it! It really is an awesome experience.</li>
    <li> This is just simply delightful to use. Wonderful smell, makes a great lather, and made my face feel so smoothe.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. One dab of this stuff and you get such a rich lather - it&#x27;s amazing. There is zero comparison when compared to Proraso. It&#x27;s double the price but for sure double the quality. When the  lather is thicker, you can such a better shave. Trust me, you will not be disappointed with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old and this stuff makes me smell like Grandpa. It&#x27;s a great shaving soap, loved the shave, hate the smell, which is very strong and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly great stuff!  Have used bar-type shaving soap for years. My wife decided that 20+ years of shaving with the same Pure Bristle brush was enough, bought me a lovely Silvertip, and this soap for Christmas. I may never go back. ;)</li>
    <li> Good Strong scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. The cream lathers up well. It does take a few shaves before you strike that perfect balance  for a thick foam. Simply adjust with a very small amount of water to get the desired consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use a small porcelain bowl in which to whip it up with an Escali shaving brush. I just dip the brush in the cream and proceed to mix&lt;br /&gt; to mix it up. The cream has a silky, pearly sheen to it and the thickness of pudding. When you receive it just be aware that it is soldby weight not volume so the bowl it comes in will seem half empty. However there is enough in it to last several months, depending on how much cream you use. My small dabs with the brush give me enough lather for 2 applications for shaving and&lt;br /&gt;1 i leave on while i rinse my bowl and brush. More expensive than your average canned foam but will last longer.I will try some of the other scents but so far this is my favorite ( I&#x27;ve tried the Avocado ones as well, not bad but i prefer the Sandalwood overall.The scent is not overpowering and gets more subtle as the day wears one. Great since you don&#x27;t want to shake hands and have people carry the scent around. It&#x27;s a masculine sort of barber shop smell that reminds me of Sunday morning haircuts. Good on the lubrication but it sometimes dries very quickly.I don&#x27;t think i will be switching to anything else besides creams for now.Might give shaving soap a try eventually but this is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great performer. Great cushion and slickness. The smell is amazing! This is my go to cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever found, and I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 15 years.  Previously I&#x27;ve purchased it directly from Taylor in London, but recently found I could buy it from Amazon - I hope they continue to carry it.</li>
    <li> smells amazing and will last a long time! great quality!</li>
    <li> Be aware that the smell of this product is extremely strong and extremely sharp. It definitely isn&#x27;t for everyone and it sure isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream works great and smells great too. I&#x27;ve smelled other sandalwoods, but liked this one the most! I paired my shaving cream with my shaving brush [[ASIN:B002QHYYR0 Edwin Jagger Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush]]. Google searches will provide plenty of sites for teaching how to use the shaving cream with your shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma really makes the mood for shaving. I made the switch to &#x27;real&#x27; razors ;-) [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C]] and could not be happier. My daily shave has become an enjoyable meditation time, instead of a chore!</li>
    <li> While I have been satisfied witch the lubricating ability of any number of shaving creams, including this one which is excellent, I particularly enjoy its aroma.  I am a fan of all the TOBS products.</li>
    <li> What I said up there...never buying another shaving cream again as long as these guys stay in the business. Good clean shave and that smell from the barbershop from yesteryear...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Taylor&#x27;s Sandalwood shaving cream since switching to traditional single edge shaving four years ago and will never go back.  The combination is easier on my skin and a much more enjoyable shaving experience than the old buzzing or fifty-two blade contraptions on the market today.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps there was major scent factor lost when the container for this product, which was none-too-scrupulously sealed leaked all over the shipping box in 80-degree heat, but it sure doesn&#x27;t smell like anything to warrant the $15 price! This leakage, which could have been prevented, left the container 1/3 empty, but it would not be worth the cost of returning. The mild and very seasonal heat may or may not have made any difference, but there is simply no excuse for shipping an expensive product which is not properly sealed against spillage under any anticipated conditions.</li>
    <li> The cream smells fantastic. It&#x27;s a great way to start the day. Not too strong, but the scent lingers for a while after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a shaving cream (as opposed to the goo-in-a-can that I&#x27;ve been using all along) so I don&#x27;t have much to compare with, but I&#x27;ve been happy with it. It lathers well, the shave is smooth, and I can&#x27;t really ask for anything else. It&#x27;s a big bowl, so it was last for a while.</li>
    <li> nice stuff, only need a very little to lather it up, should last a long time, very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and none of them compare to this one. It is simply the best. Extraordinarily thick, creamy lather after a few swirls and the aroma is heavenly...and lingers in the bathroom long after your shave is done. I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product. Makes for an incredible shaving experience and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, and has a very pleasant aroma. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Fantastic fragrance and produces a great lather.</li>
    <li> Just a dab and a lil hot water creates a great lather.</li>
    <li> Personally, i love the smell, it reminds me of my youth and watching my dad shave. It foams really well and i get a really great shave with this shaving cream. Also it doesn&#x27;t take much to make a really great lather. Love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice job.. works good , smells good..</li>
    <li> Well what can I say, it&#x27;s shaving cream.  It works well and smells great.  Will definitely buy this cream again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year. I love it. Makes a nice thick lather. I did figure out that if you leave the jar on its side the cream will make it hard to open. But if you run it under hot water in the sink it melts whats in the grooves and opens easy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product- this is my second purchase and I love the shaving cream. Make sure to purchase a decent brush. A decent brush makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- good or bad my wife uses the Shaving Cream for her legs.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers well. I really wanted to like this product but just didn&#x27;t work for me. It gave me really bad skin irritation which is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Caused a bad burning sensation.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and will never change. The lather is fantastic and I like the smell. It isn&#x27;t nearly as overpowering as some have said, in fact I have to stick my nose in it to smell it.  I just couldn&#x27;t get the same great shave without Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the shipping was spot on even though it was shipped from Top Shelf Barber Supplies who is the the supplier. I had it within a few days.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and helps me get an excellent shave. Much easier to use than soap.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and he loved it.</li>
    <li> This is the bed product that I have ever used for shaving hands down. A dime size amoumy could lather my whole head twice. The smell is womderful like an old time barbershop.</li>
    <li> Holy cow. This stuff smells amazing. My first time using this, I was transported back to being a boy and getting a haircut and the old fashioned barber shop in my home town. This may be my absolute favorite scent. It also creates a really thick, luxurious lather. I found that I could keep building and building the lather, with almost no end in sight...after using a small smear of the cream on my badger brush. It also completely eliminated the animal smell from my badger brush, so even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, get this stuff. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great smell, lathers up super and makes shaving enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Really great, easy lather even with my hard water. I might try some other scents soon.</li>
    <li> First time I have tried this brand. It is wonderful! I shave my face and head and never found any product that works as well. Ditch lather that stays where you put it and lubricates as well as softenes. I am 100% sold.</li>
    <li> Smells great but my girlfriend tells me it reminds me of her great grandparents house. Regardless this is a nice shaving cream and feels great. The smell is very pleasant and not overwhelming in the slightest.</li>
    <li> Works great as a shaving cream but is so heavily scented that the first time my husband used it I ended up with a massive headache. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes.</li>
    <li> first time with this type of product.  It is a lot of work but gives a very good and close shave!</li>
    <li> Great smell, lathers up great!</li>
    <li> A bit thicker than Evelyn&amp;Crabtree that I&#x27;ve been using.  The cream works well and needs a bit more water when using.  Scent is great. Works very well and is much less expensive than what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Product performs as expected!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this cream I had a burning sensation on my face.  I have been using for several months and it seems not to burn anymore.  This cream lathers up beautifully and smells great.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The reason I purchased this shave cream is because it appeared as the highest rated shave cream by customer review. I was so looking forward to the excellent experience so many others have written about; then writing a glowing report on this myself. Well, I am sorry that I cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Know what Sandalwood smells like before you buy this product! To me, this product smells like an old grandpa&#x27;s bathroom. I must not have fond memories of any old grandpa&#x27;s bathroom, because this stuff does not have a pleasant odor to me. The odor is also entirely too strong. I have to wash with soap and water after using it and that only tames it down. If you like the smells of a nursing home, an old man&#x27;s toiletry kit, or grandpa&#x27;s bathroom, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The lather is good. Not excellent. I use a silver tip badger and bowl made of horn. The lather sometimes begins to dry out before I get there to shave it. Usually, there is enough lather whipped up for 3 swipes, but I feel that I am having to use more of this than I should. Contrary to other reviews, a pot of this shave cream does not last forever, but in this case I am thankful this does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Again, this is a product that I&#x27;d have found in my grandpa&#x27;s bathroom right next to the Brill Cream and Ben gay!  The nostalgia of this product is a hoot! I doubt the packaging has undergone any major revamps since perhaps 1973? If the ingredients are the same since its creation, I suppose you are truly experiencing what a wet shave would have been like in 1908...if you are also using a saftey razor from 1908...the same kind of brush from 1908 --- you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Yes, I&#x27;d use it again, but only if I was out of anything better....which at this time is  a .99 cent can of Gillette - menthol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street is...definitely...old.&lt;br /&gt;It was surprisingly disappointing for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream, pleasent scent builds good lather even with hard water, lays down a nice creamy cushion for your shave.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this style of shaving cream before, but the massive amount of positive reviews led me to buy it. It is every bit as fantastic as the reviews say. Smells wonderful, easy to lather up with a good brush, and gives you a REALLY smooth shave. As others have said, this is the missing ingredient for most when it comes to a good clean shave. Love it.</li>
    <li> Provides a very thick scented lather. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the Cremo Shave Cream beats it hands down for a smoother, closer shave.</li>
    <li> What I love about this shaving cream is the nice vintage old school vibe to it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy the stuff in the can after using this.  It&#x27;s totally easy to clean up, gives a great shave, and smells like a million (old timey) bucks.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! I really like the smell, my girlfriend does too.  I switched from a mach 3 to a parker 22r DE with Sword or Personna (I have been using both not sure which I like better - both good though) blades and a basic badger brush to lather this cream on and I love shaving again...  So far no ingrowns, which I used to get at least once a week.  My skin feels good and I haven&#x27;t cut myself so I guess I have been doing it wrong since I started shaving.  Plus I wasted a lot of money on those stupid triple blade cartridges.  Hope this review helps, good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a shaving cream that is so fragrant, so smooth, and so gentle on my skin.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It takes very little of this product to produce a more than adequate amount of lather.  It smells wonderful and provides a very smooth surface for shaving. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Enjoy traditional shaving using this cream. Only takes a small amount and much better than the canned stuff especially when keeping warm by setting bowl in hot water. Nice when warm when reapplying for second pass. Doesn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of traditional shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m brand new to this and, I&#x27;ve used a 4 blade then a five blade.... it doesn&#x27;t matter.  What matters is a sharp new single edged razor and this cream.  With a wet brush right out of the bowl in which it comes.  It goes on great.  Leave it there for a minute and you&#x27;ll have the closest shave ever.  I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
    <li> great lather great smell just like the old days. Just as easy to use as the canned shave creams and more fun. brush and soap. great to see in the mirror, and you can dab some on the grandkids noses.</li>
    <li> i shave in the shower and have always just used bar soap ......but something seemed appealing about a brushed up creamy lather from shaving cream. as soon as a i got it home and opened it, the smell reminded me of old men. from the description i thought it would smell more like a manly bouquet of flowers and less like the mens bathroom at a nursing home. i figured id give it a try .....how long could the geriatric stench linger on ....an hour or two tops i supposed ....WRONG! ...It clung to my face and vexed me nearly all day. and just for the record im not some teenager, at almost 50 this product smells way too old for me.</li>
    <li> I second what others say: a little cream makes a lot of lather. That lather plus a quality blade produces a close, irritation-free shave. I use a Merkur classic safety razor with stainless steel blades and a boar bristle brush.  While others have complained about the scent, I find it appealing and long-lasting. Only problem is - the scent sticks too well.  I have found it difficult to completely remove at the end of the day, thus the 4 stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*my husband&#x27;s experience, interviewed by me</li>
    <li> I love this product! I bought it based on the many positive reviews as I had no other frame of reference and I was not disappointed. The smell is great and not too overpowering and my wife also loves the smell which is a bonus. I find that a bowl lasts me about six months which is great. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This stuff  works extremely well. Smells great but not real strong and provides a nice cushion while shaving. Definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves using it and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!! The lather created by this cream was absolutely decadent. It moved me to new heights of close shave euphoria. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone and everyone who wants to experience a level of luxury heretofore never experienced on this plane of existence.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for this to arrive and there&#x27;s no disappointment. A surprisingly small amount created a luxurious lather. Great shave cushioning with an easy glide to it. A great fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. This is one great shave cream that is now permanently in my shaving rotation.</li>
    <li> I am comparing this shaving cream to Pre de Provence, Proraso, and Art of Shaving. It is my favorite.  It lather&#x27;s beautifully will just an almost sized dollop, and smells great.  As far as performance, it more than sufficiently lubricates my face for my DE razor.</li>
    <li> this cream would burn my face whenever i applied it. who knows, maybe it is my face skin type. now i switched to [[ASIN:B001MF3FMW Proraso Shaving Soap with Green Tea and Oat - Ultra Sensitive Skin 150ml/5.2oz]] and you should check out in case this one does not pass the test</li>
    <li> I like this a lot better than regular shaving cream in a can and also the bars of soap smells great</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and must disagree with the overwhelming response of \\&quot;too fragrant\\&quot;. Yes, it&#x27;s a strong Sandalwood scent if you sniff the bowl of cream but it doesn&#x27;t linger long on your face and certainly isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I usually finish shaving a half hour before work and when I kiss the wife goodbye she says it&#x27;s very faint by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good lather with badger brush and mug. Very smooth action from my Jagger safety razor using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a quality product that seems it will last a very long time compared to canned blue shave gels.</li>
    <li> great smell and lather if your looking for old school this is it well pleased with every aspect of this product</li>
    <li> One if the best smelling creams ever. The compliments are insane and it has that manly clean smell.</li>
    <li> The Best Aromatherapy for the face before, during, and after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch the Woman of Your DREAMS!?  (Likely!)</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream.  So easy to make a nice lather, and smells great.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews of this product, but still had my doubts.  How could this be so much better than all the rest.  Now you can add me to those who find Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood the best on the market.  It lathers up great and has a very pleasant smell.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful shaving cream, smooth, rich, and effective.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood smell is soft but very good and lathers great. Got for hubs for father&#x27;s day &amp; he replaced his old glycerin soap with it. Seems to work way better for him and doesn&#x27;t take a lot</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS THINKING I LIKED SANDALWOOD AND WOULD TRY IT  UPON USING IT ONCE I WAS HOOKED.  I WENT AND BOUGHT THE SAFETY SHAVER ; BADGER BRUSH AND CUP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE TRIED TWICE TO SHAVE AND REMEMBER HOW IT WAS DONE.......FIRST TIME NOT SO GOOD.  BUT TODAY&lt;br /&gt;I THINK I AM ALMOST THERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Its good stuff.  Great quality but it smells like barber shop.  I don&#x27;t want my whole bathroom smelling like barber shop.  Smell could&#x27;ve been better.</li>
    <li> Buy it! It lathers really well, smells great, and gets a close shave. I use it with my badger hair brush by first soaking the brush in hot water while I shower then just give it a few swirls until it creates a good lather.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement to the Barbasol/Gillette nonsense you are forced to buy in the stores before you wake up and realize you are throwing money away by buying those Mach 10,000 razors and their accompanying shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this (along w/ an Edwin Jagger De89lbl). Will never go back. I kind of thought \\&quot;this cream can&#x27;t be any different then Barbasol/Gillette\\&quot;. Boy was I wrong. This cream will give you a closer shave.( w/ a proper single blade razor like the one I mentioned earlier)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: - An added bonus. The 1st time I used this my wife came running up the stairs because she was so turned on by the smell of this shaving cream. So yeah, that&#x27;s a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I use this and also the Proraso shaving soap with both my straight and safety razors.  I find this product stays wetter on my face longer with a better lather than the Proraso soap.  I get a smooth shave and like the scent also.  Presently I alternate between the two until I can finally decide which product i want to solely use.</li>
    <li> This is my second favorite cream, number one being the coconut version for the same brand, manly smell and it feels great in the face, a classic for me that I will keep buying, a piece of the old world you can wear under your skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who has very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves the way the product feels on his skin - and he likes the light and fresh aroma (and so do I!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly from the vendor - and will last a long while.</li>
    <li> I will buy again. As the title says the smell is exceptional (doesn&#x27;t linger very long though). I&#x27;m not good at describing fragrances but this smells like an old barbershop (translated good for you younger folks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously bought some much more expensive shaving cream which, while had a slightly better smell was not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try some other fragrances from Taylor.</li>
    <li> I guess I like a little bit less sandlewood fragrance if that is the odor I get from it. one</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd tub I&#x27;ve purchased in this flavor and it will probably be my lifelong pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the fragrance in a couple of the other flavors irritates my skin; this one does not which makes it even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is noticeable, but not overbearing which I like the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The scent is great - the first time I lathered up, my girlfriend started clawing at the door, begging me to return to our chambers. I looked down and noticed that my chest hair had doubled, and I shortly thereafter received a phone call from Burt Reynolds, asking for my RSVP to his shindig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protection? You got it. This beats the pants off all those neon colored products that look like they were wrung out of a boy band member&#x27;s hair. My face and neck are as smooth as stone. Bought some for my friends as gifts, and now we all hit the town to chop down trees with our bare hands. Beware! It makes the object of your attraction faint with desire. I have built quite the arm and back muscle picking up lasses when they get close enough to smell that residual clean smelling aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this. Happy edging, my friends.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my skin.  I can&#x27;t say it will do this to everyone but after two tries I realized I just can&#x27;t use it.  BUT Amazon was awesome about a return and I sent it back and got my money right back.  Easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this tub of shave cream months ago and I&#x27;m still using it.  This thing seems endless.  The sandalwood fragrance is great, but not overly strong, and it requires very little cream to get a good lather.  I doubt I&#x27;ll ever go back to shave cream in a can again.</li>
    <li> First time I got this to be included with the whole shaving kit for my son-in-laws birthday. he and my daughter loved the sent! Not too strong and earthy. Then he asked for more at Christmas! So now I have something I know is a &amp;#34;go to gift&amp;#34; for him!</li>
    <li> Very smooth shaves, with this I&#x27;ve got no nicks and shaving feels really nice. Use a small shaving brush, dab it in the cream and put some water on it, then rub it on your face &#x27;til it&#x27;s a nice lather. I use such a small amount, I&#x27;d imagine this will last me a year, shaving every 3 days or so.</li>
    <li> Shaving usually was a 1-2-3 routine every morning but getting Old Taylor&#x27;s just right in the shower I get to consider how much water on the brush, heat in the shower, water on my face etc. putting a little &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; to the shave making the routine more morning ritual.  When done right, the lather is luxuriously thick which provides a smooth shave even when the blade is old.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that makes me want to shave only every few days but with this shaving cream the pleasure is all mine. Some how it is soothing to my face, good enough to use twin edged safety razors, which I have grown accustomed to over time.</li>
    <li> sandalwood that is affordable and does not taper off in terms of quality</li>
    <li> This shave cream has a herbal smell while providing thick lather for old-fashioned shaving.  Great product for shaving, providing a good lather.</li>
    <li> Oh man, where to begin? It smells like serious mannage. And not manage like be in charge of something (I&#x27;m not looking up the Webster&#x27;s definition for you jokers) I mean manosity mannist mannage. If you can take the word man and put a suffix on it, that&#x27;s what this stuff smells like. Except negative suffixes because this stuff is positively non-negative. As in positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously I bought this after reading all the positive reviews. I popped that bad boy open when it showed up and immediately knew this would woo the ladies. And it does. Some people say it smells like an older gentleman&#x27;s scent, but that&#x27;s plain wrong. It smells sophisticated. It smells like you should be wearing a tuxedo wherever you go because you&#x27;re too good for a regular suit. But that&#x27;s the beauty of it. You shave before you go out in jeans and a t shirt and the ladies smell you and think, &amp;#34;Hey, this guy who smells like he should be in NYC with Donald Trump and Tim Robbins (I think they&#x27;re friends) is at this bar with ME? I am one lucky lady.&amp;#34; As she should think. I bet Shaq wears this and he&#x27;s pretty much the manliest man on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it lathers extremely well. I&#x27;ve used it a ton of times and not only does it take very little of the cream to get a good lather, but it is also extremely long lasting. It won&#x27;t dry out on your face provided you use enough water and you don&#x27;t shave like a girl. The scent lasts all night which is awesome. I have a beard and I use this to shape up the neck area, but I put it all over my face and my beard because the scent really gets trapped in there and smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying this. And that&#x27;s my review.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, the scent is a little overpowering. I think I would be ok with it, but unfortunately I do not care for the scent. As far as how it lathers, this stuff is excellent. I would buy this brand in a different scent of i could smell before hand.</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite but still exploring. And there are so many more to try! Look forward to it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> Lathers great and provides excellent protection from razor burns, as I have sensitive skin. You can lather it right in the bowl it is in, which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for the 4 stars is because the scent is very strong, to me, it was overwhelming. Even after the shave I can still smell it hours later on my face no matter how much I wash after the shave. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, it is an old school smell that reminds me of my grandpa, I actually very much like the scent. I just don&#x27;t like smelling it for hours later. I have actually had comments from others during the day who ask me what cologne I&#x27;m using. So it is pungent enough that others can also smell it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the strong scent, then this is an excellent cream.</li>
    <li> very good lather, however it does not really have a sandalwood smell- or at least not a sandalwood smell I am familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the scent of the almond version.</li>
    <li> not too overwhelming, but has a perfect light sandalwood smell. Sensation is great as well. Get a proper brush to properly apply it though :) and enjoy shaving like a man!</li>
    <li> Wife thought it smelled like an old man, so I discontinued using it. I was using it to shave my head, was a little thinner than I&#x27;d prefer as well. I had to use a good size dollop to get the thickness I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. But depending on your taste, it could be right for some men.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is quality goods. Once you use it I can see going back to the crappy aerosol foams in the cans. They give very little protection. Theres a slight learning curve but its not rocket science. This stuff goes along way. I have the Merkur DE razor and Feather blades and every is smooth, smooth. I love the smell of it too, it lingers for along time. I actually us it sometimes for cologne. Just a smidgen in your fingers and rub it around neck, women will be all over you..</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after having done a minimal amount of research. In total honesty, I was looking merely for an entry into a more refined way to shave. What I got is a product that helps make shaving more enjoyable and easy, ends in a slightly closer shave, and leaves my face smelling pleasant. I&#x27;m not convinced that the smell is actually very close to sandalwood, but it is a sufficiently neutral and manly scent that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Coming off of a soap puck I am pleasantly surprised by not only the great aroma of this shaving cream but also its luxurious feel.  I will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Lather it up and great shave that smells oh so good! Face is baby butt soft :)</li>
    <li> Whether its your first shaving cream that does not come in a can or not, you will love this shaving cream.  A little tiny dollop goes a long way.  I had a little trouble at first getting the lather down correctly, but now I get it right every time with no issues.  It does take a little bit more water than you would think, at least to me.  If the lather starts to dry out before you get to that section of your face, then you need to mix it with more water.  If you are considering switching to a nicer cream, this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best shaving cream I have ever used. And the Sandalwood scent is great! It is actually a treat to go without shaving for a few days and use this cream just to feel what an amazingly smooth shave feels like. I also have the Proraso cream and it does a very good job. But in reality there is no comparison between the two - the smell of the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood and the richness of the lather is like going  back to the heyday of the Empire and indulging yourself in the best a gentleman can get. Now... if it wasnt so damned expensive...</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on the reviews and figured I should write one myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using all different kinds of shaving creams and pre-shave treatments to try to irritate my sensitive skin less while shaving.  So far this shaving cream has been one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I was previously using the green Proraso shaving cream that you get in a tube and this is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up easily - be cautious not to get too much&lt;br /&gt;It provides good coverage and protection on the face (doesn&#x27;t dry out, sticks well even over a pre-shave oil)&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  This is the best smelling one too.  Worth every penny.  Cool stuff and want more of it</li>
    <li> this stuff is wonderful. it smells great and masculine. it is soft and doesnt take long to lather up. If it actually ever gets used up, I will look for it again.</li>
    <li> The sandalwood cream lathers real quickly and you wouldn&#x27;t need more than four dabs of cream to work up some rich lather with a badger shaving brush. Did feel that lathering and fragrance are better than the TOBS lavender version. Face friendly and soothing even if the razor gets a little blunt on the edges. The sandalwood smell is not as strong as one would expect, so it&#x27;s possible they have acted on customer feedback. Good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> At first when I opened it, I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Very strong. But after rinsing it off, the smell was very unique. It had a woodsy vintage scent to it which I loved. I don&#x27;t like products that smell fruity. I liked that it smelled manly! The lather was perfect and I really liked shaving with this product, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great soap leaves skin soft and eliminates razor burn.  The fragrance is light enough to not be over powering.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I was shopping around at The Art of Shaving, the sales associate couldn&#x27;t tell me how long a container of shaving cream usually lasted.  Before this, I used to use a shaving bar and would wear it down in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream is pretty amazing.  It smells good, lubricates well, and produces AMPLE foam with a good quality brush.  I actually have the Tweezerman&#x27;s Men&#x27;s having brush (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6) which was a good buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most shaving guides tell you to use a pea or dime sized drop of shaving cream and lather in a bowl.  I was doing this for a while until I saw another video on YouTube of someone watering it down and foaming it up to see how long the remnants of a rung out brush would continue to provide lather.  This was an interesting test because it forced me to evaluate how much shaving cream I actually needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days, I take my brush and sweep it across the shaving cream once, maybe getting 1/8th of the surface area of the brush covered with shaving cream.  This provides more than enough lather for a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foresee this product lasting 12-18 months if you shave 3-4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price! Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my husband about  a while back and I will definitely be ordering more. It smells great, it doesn&#x27;t make his face angry (rash/bumps) and it takes so little product to get a good lather. Great product.</li>
    <li> i just got this shaving cream last week, having just got through a tub of the Art of Shaving cream, which incidentally last a year! It does, as other reviews suggest hint at the old fashioned barber shop aroma and i loved it. it whips up a great lather, and true to the reviews, you do not need a lot to get you face covered. i experienced no irritation and the scent is terrific. I might even up my shaving quota from 2 to 3 times a week with this stuff. its great.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shaving soap that whips easily into a great creamy lather. It does exactly what a shaving soap is suppose to do and does it much better than most others. The sandalwood scent is also great. If you are even considering purchasing this product, let me encourage you to do so. The tub last a good long time because it does not take much to get that great shave. I intend to buy more of this great sandalwood shave cream in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great ratings it received on Amazon. My initial impression about the product was that it had a good consistency and lathered well with a badger brush. This product smells nothing like real sandalwood though, and the scent will last almost all day after shaving. In addition, when using this particular shave cream, it gave me a peculiar burning sensation which only got worse the longer it sat on my face. If you have SENSITIVE SKIN, DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. It lathers exceptionally well (much, much better than the Col Conk brand) and smells amazing. Do yourself a favor and try it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving creams and love them all except Jerym Street for sensitive skin. Sandalwood has a nice masculine smell and has a thick and rich lather. The more I use this, the better I like it. Rose is still my favorite (sandalwood is gaining ground) but it may not be for everyone because it has a relatively strong scent. I personally like to switch back and forth between one of the Taylors and C.O. Bigelow or Proraso. I won&#x27;t get into the argument about which razor is the best but any wet shaver using this product with a decent badger brush should be a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Mixes well, feels good, smells good and gives me less cuts than soap. Try it! It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than soap but if you shave to enjoy the experience, you should at least try this even if it&#x27;s more expensive</li>
    <li> I would recommend this shaving cream over any of the canister style shaving creams on the market but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the nice rich lather that i prefer. If you are interested in something much better that is slightly more expensive try truefitt and hill. Neither is perfect but the later is much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> this is perfect smell my girl friend loves it I don&#x27;t even have to wear cologne anymore this has a nice smell that lasts a few hours</li>
    <li> I bought this after doing a LOT of research. So many on many different sites said how great this was but I am not impressed. I do like the way it smells and so does my wife which was a bonus but this stuff burns my face.  it burns for several hours. I also find it does not lubricate my face well at all. Well what i should really say is it dries out my face.  I had my son try it out and he had the same experience.  Let me say at this point, I do not have sensitive skin.  I have used the cheap stuff (i.e. colgate, col. Conk and others) with out any issues. I don&#x27;t know if TOBS has sample but if you are considering this at all get a sample borrow from  a friend to see if you like it or get something else.  For me I am going back to my Edwin Jagger Sandlewood shave soap.  It does a better job for me and lubricates better.  Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood happens to be my most favorite smell in the natural world.  I have bottles of sandalwood essential oil lying around, powdered sandalwood barks, and other sandalwood products.  Suffice to say - I know what sandalwood smells like.  This is not sandalwood, nor is it remotely close or similar to anything in any way resembling actual sandalwood.  What it smells like is a cheap, musky knock off of old spice.  It smells like my grandpa.  Maybe in 32 years when I&#x27;m rounding my 60th birthday and couldn&#x27;t care less about how I smelled I&#x27;ll reconsider it, but until then, I&#x27;ve returned this item.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave.  I use it with a Merkur Futur and the save is close with no irritation. Smells great to.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream has worked very well for face and head shaving.  Used mostly with a double-edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice sandalwood smell that the cream has is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves the sandalwood scent</li>
    <li> Used this cream for the first time and I am very pleased.  My only other experience has been with cheap shave cream&#x27;s from a can.  This I lathered up and applied to my face for about 1 1/2 minutes with a brush and received outstanding results!  My Mercur 34c cut through my whiskers like butter!  The smell is great too.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream isn&#x27;t just a shaving cream it is an indulgence!  Because I use a double-edged razor, I lather up three times each shaving session.  Even with this frequent use, I still get a month of shaves with Taylor of Old Bond Street.  It is more of a cream than a soap, so it gives you the lubrication you need without the irritation you hate.  Excellent product well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Husband for Christmas and he loves it. Very smooth and smells so good.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream, soap, foam gel, or oil that I have used. It has a subtle fragrance and allows the razor to glide over the skin. At $12 it is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> This the greatest cream yet. I&#x27;ve tried a few but this smells good and shaves clean.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using colonel conk&#x27;s bay rum shaving soap since i started DE wet shaving about a month ago.  conk&#x27;s is a great soap and recommend it, i wanted to try out something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;taylor of old bond street appears to have a solid reputation and high reviews, so i forked over my $12.95 and gave it a shot for the first time this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wow, what a lather! i loaded up my silver-tipped badger brush with taylor the same way i loaded up my brush with colonel conk&#x27;s.  big mistake.  it made way too much lather.  you&#x27;ll really only need a two-or-three passes with your brush and you&#x27;ll be ready to go.  it makes a nice, rich, and thick lather that makes your razor pass over like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m here sitting at my desk 9 hours after shaving this morning and i can still smell the sandalwood fragrance.  i imagine this soap will last several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the smell. I love it. It&#x27;s a masculine smell, and it&#x27;s wonderful to shave with. This is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have an ultra tough, curly beard. This is the only shaving cream/ soap I&#x27;ve found to tame my beard without razor bumps. It really softens the hair for an effortless shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shaving soaps, and I consistently return to Taylor&#x27;s Sandalwood. My skin feels smoother (Taylor does a great job lifting my whiskers), and I never suffer the irritation that I used to when I used canned chemicals. Also, I don&#x27;t like a heavy perfume smell when I am finished shaving; Taylor&#x27;s Sandalwood leaves behind a light, spicy scent that you need to get close to get a whiff of.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big TOBS fan and have used nearly all of their shaving creams at this point.  The Sandalwood is pretty much the same as the rest except the aroma is much stronger.  I personally like, it but I noticed it bothered some of the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have used other creams, especially TOBS creams, just be aware that this cream will smell stronger than the rest.  Apparently a number of people like it this way since it&#x27;s the number one seller on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like TOBS Eton College but the Sandalwood reacts with my skin.</li>
    <li> Lathers up really good and has a very light and pleasant scent. It adds to the relaxation involved with shaving with a safety razor and applying with a nice badger bristle brush.</li>
    <li> Good lather, nice product.  Takes only a tiny amount - this will easily last a year or more.  There is a lot of debate the best way to use it (lid, bowl, etc.)  Try your hand.  Little dab on a brush, swirl in your other hand, rinse.  Very easy.  If your looking for super fast with no lather (i.e., just slick) the Neutrogena sensitive skin is also very good.  UPDATE - 1/18/2016:  As expected, the product lasted better than a year.  Ran out so I tried the old school Colgate.  Ummm, yeah.  There&#x27;s no going back.  This is the new normal and a very good normal it is.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this stuff.  it just takes a little and lathers so great AND it smells great!  love love love</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this shaving cream online unless you have smelled it in the real world.. I&#x27;m a later 20&#x27;s aged kind of guy, and in my opinion this shaving cream makes me think of bad after-shave. To be truthful, I&#x27;m not sure if it works in the &#x27;good shave&#x27; aspect because I haven&#x27;t gotten that far because it stinks. An old fashioned odor if you will. The same goes for the self titled aftershave.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond shave cream so I was excited to try the sandalwood.  Unfortunately, I experienced a terrible burning sensation on my face after the lather had been on for ~30 seconds (and only got worse the longer it was on).  This product lathered well and gave a decent shave but the burning was a deal-breaker.</li>
    <li> The cream is great feeling on my skin and has a great sandalwood scent.  I use a regular disposable blades and the cream helped to give me a comfortable shave.  I won&#x27;t be buying canned foam or canned gel anymore.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. My biggest complaint is the smell. I&#x27;m 30 and I don&#x27;t enjoy smelling like I&#x27;m 60. Further, I could deal with the smell, but it&#x27;s so potent that people will smell it on you for almost an entire 8 hour work day.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried. Smells really great. Gives an easy, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I truly LOVE the smell and the feel of this shaving cream! I will buy it many times more again. It is also extremely economical, it looks like it will never finish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> I had seen a couple Youtube videos recommending this brand and decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it! The smell is very good, my wife really likes it, it lubricates the face well for the shave, and it is CONCENTRATED! I was a little put off initially with the price initially, but I only have to use half as much as the Proraso and I get more lather. One thing I did notice is this seems to lather better for me with less water. I used my regular amount of water the first time and it was too thin, I had to do a second batch, starting with almost no water in the brush and then only added a very small amount of water to get a nice thick lather. Overall great shaving cream, I really like it. I have ordered it several times now and will continue to order. It usually last me about 6 months shaving almost every day.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this shaving cream. I really like it. It lathers up easily and has a great feel and smell.</li>
    <li> My husband said it did not smell very strong after he applied it. He said it was fine as a shaving cream. Would not order again, as there are better options.</li>
    <li> If you are going to use a double edge razor you need a bit more lubrication. The usual aerosol doesn&#x27;t really work for me. Seemed expensive but it&#x27;s lasted awhile. You really don&#x27;t need a lot to work up a good lather. Scent is fine. Has a nice moisturizing effect too.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever. I usually have in-grown hair on the right and left side of my lower neck whenever i shave but this resolved that issue. No razor burns, no irritation. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  People compliment on the smell after I shave.  Seems to help prevent razor burn.</li>
    <li> I use different kind of shaving cream this is the bast that i ever used . I give it 4 stars only when i receive it was not sealed and the cover was little bit open but the shave cream is excellent .</li>
    <li> I like how the soap works for my first safety razor shave.  My face feels soft and smooth. Unfortunately, my wife thinks I smell like her grandmother.  Not the response I was looking for, sorry had to dock a star for that. :)</li>
    <li> I gave Old  Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream a four star rating. Because I have just started using this type of shaving cream  I don&#x27;t know what a five stare could be. To tell you the true, I love the fragrance and the after affect of it&#x27;s use. Lubrication is great  and as I implied about the sent, while applying the shaving cream it just makes shaving that much more pleasurable. I have recommended this product to my brother and an old friend of mine.  Treat yourself!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and the information on the page my girlfriend and I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing at the thought of my face smelling like a &amp;#34;Masculine Bouquet&amp;#34;. Then it showed up. What an amazing scent! My girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of it and ends up inhaling my face after I shave. The soap itself is pleasantly mild and really does smell masculine as well. Definitely going to purchase it again when I use this one up.</li>
    <li> Consistent between shaving creams, tried sandalwood and coconut and lemon lime to follow.  Tried foam, gel as well as other name brands.  Still my favorite.</li>
    <li> As a cream, it produces a more pleasant texture for shaving than shaving soap. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it facilitates a close shave and leaves comfortable, smooth, soft skin, even before applying an after shave lotion. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last; it feels like you are using a lot of it for each shave, but afterwards there appears to be still quite a lot left in the bowl. I don&#x27;t particularly like the aroma, which doesn&#x27;t smell to me like sandalwood, but this is a subjective judgement.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Buy a brush and it will last for ever.</li>
    <li> usually very good, last batch was very watery</li>
    <li> This shaving cream has a nice smoothness to it.  It only takes a swipe of a badger bristle shaving brush in one direction and back in the other direction.  The only reason I cannot give it five stars is that it does not easily wash off of my face without a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  It lathers really easy with little effort.  The Sandalwood smell is very strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I shave at night before bed and I shower in the morning so all of the smell washes off.  The GF likes the smell and says I smell manly.  This product is very slick and I have not nicked myself while using my safety razor with this product</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and is hands down the best shave cream I have ever used. It only takes a very small amount applied to the shave brush to make a nice lather in the dish. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for. This is soft soap not a bar of soap. It does make a great lather. I do not care for the aroma. This all said I am keeping it for a backup.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews, I expected something special, a magical lotion. But really, it&#x27;s just a shaving cream with a nice, antique aroma. Yes, it does soften your skin more than the regular Barbasol, but that&#x27;s because you take that much more time to spread it on your skin and work up a lather. Those few minutes is all it needs to soften any skin before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad, just not magical.</li>
    <li> Wow! Two thumbs up for this shaving cream. It smells great. I&#x27;ve been using the regular shaving cream you buy at chain stores and I have switched to a straight blade and needed a good shaving cream. After reading the reviews here I decided to give it a try and I must say that I am not disappointed for doing it. It provides a smooth surface for the razor. A little bit goes such a long way it&#x27;s unbelievable! If you are looking for a good shaving cream, this is it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing I bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day... and he super loved it! The scent is not overwhelming and not too strong either.  Every time he uses this to shave his face, you can smell the fresh sandal wood scent and if you touch it his face is smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> When I opened product,it appeared that bowl had only been partially filled- Wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. And does what it is supposed to. For me this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Much better than other shaving creams I have used.  Its just hard to know how much to use, a little goes a long way especially when you take time to lather it up!</li>
    <li> This soap smells very classy, Do not even need cologne after using.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail and began using it and instantly fell in love with the wonderful, clean, but manly scent of this shaving cream. Not only does it smell amazing, but it definitely helps with your shave. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product for my shaving cream for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great thick texture makes for a very smooth shave.  Nice old-school barbershop smell.</li>
    <li> great lather and great smell.</li>
    <li> A very good product. I bought it a year ago and it lasted me up until I had to repurchase it just a few months ago. It is a soft soap with a pleasant fragrance, a sweet smell as opposed to the stronger &amp;#34;Woodsier&amp;#34; smell of other sandalwood soaps.&lt;br /&gt;It is soft enough to be lathered directly to your face with a brush, provided your face is wet and you use a very small amount of the soap, but I&#x27;d you prefer using a mug then there is certainly no harm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with it clogging my pores, as I have a very fair complexion and oil problems it is usually a matter of concern for me when choosing facial products.</li>
    <li> The cream produces a nice rich lather, this alone would normally have gotten the product a 5 stars rating, however it has a very strong soapy smell that lingers much longer than I prefer.  I could smell the soap well into the next day.  My personal scent preference is Sandalwood, unfortunately in this cream I was hard pressed to detect the scent of anything but the soap.  If you love the old time soap smell then this is for you - for me, it&#x27;s a backup to my preferred creams.</li>
    <li> I smell like the barbershop when I was a kid. Nice lather, nice shave. Love the scent. A winner.</li>
    <li> Lathers well and smells good.</li>
    <li> This smells like soap, not sandalwood.  The lather is generous and it does seem to give me a closer shave than the cans of foams and gels I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I&#x27;m a fan and I&#x27;ll use it, or something like it, again, thought I would prefer more of a sandalwood scent.</li>
    <li> Okay, so let me make this clear - this is an awesome shaving cream! Before I discovered the glory of the badger brush I used canned shaving cream. When I upgraded to the brush I bought some Proraso to go with it. Later I purchased some Old Bond based on its good reviews. So, is the Old Bond better than the Proraso? Not necessarily. At the end of the day they&#x27;re both equal, in my humble opinion, of course. Both creams will give you an excellent shave. Your mileage may vary, but for me the only difference between the two was the heavy-handed eucalyptus scent of the Proraso that could, theoretically, irritate sensitive skin more so than the OB, but that has not been my experience. On a side note - this is a shaving cream just like you would get in a tube; this isn&#x27;t a soap-like brick.</li>
    <li> smells great!!! writing this review has reminded me I need to order more of this</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this stuff.  I don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining about the sent?  I think it smells great.  At first I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t last very long at all.  A huge mistake people are making is using too much.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to build a really good lather.  With just barely filling the tips I was able to build a nice creamy lather that was more than enough for a 3 pass shave.  Since I&#x27;ve started being more conscious of the amount I was using I realized that I&#x27;m using less and less.  I think I used more in my first shave with this than I did the last 4.  It really doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot.  I recommend using very little... If its not enough just grab some more.  It will make it go a lot further.</li>
    <li> A truly marvelous cream that creates a wonderful lather with the proper brush.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t tell you how well it is for anything other than a straight razor but as fat as how long it lasts and how good it is, this is a stupendous product.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good feels good, I personally use a witch hazel aftershave and the two aromas combined will make you fell and smell like a mans man.&lt;br /&gt;You literally only need a fingertip amount to create enough lather for a proper three pass shave.&lt;br /&gt;I actually found a video on YouTube about this product if you care to go into more depth, just Google the product name under videos.</li>
    <li> Just the tips of my best badger dipped in, and whipped with a splash of hot water, and suddenly my bathroom has that barber shop scent that I wish my barber shop had. Smell is amazing, and lingers on the skin, but it&#x27;s not overpowering; and speaking of skin, it makes for a silky-smooth shave that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I anticipate this tub to last for quite some time. It arrived very quickly, and was packaged decently. My only complaint is the &amp;#34;seal.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s supposed to be a QC seal in the lid, or if that thing floating around was supposed to be a plastic liner for the lid, or what, but there was a fairly thick plastic disc between the lid and the product, and when I first opened the container this thing came out with quite a bit of shave cream on it, and the product inside looked like someone had gotten into a tub of cool whip with a fork. None had leaked out or anything, I just thought it was odd packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever, ditched the plastic disc, and after a couple uses the cream has settled back out. No worries, and still a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I should also note, three days after my first shave, my bathroom still had a masculine, earthy, beachy sandalwood scent. It mixes very well with my girlfriend&#x27;s cavalcade of stuff that she uses, and lingers long after hers dissipates. It has a certain calming effect, and it&#x27;s quite pleasing to the senses.</li>
    <li> Great product. The best shaving cream that I&#x27;ve used for both head and face.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaving cream/soap. Makes nice thick lather and has a pleasant smell. Only drawback is there are no directions. If you just put your brush in and start swirling around like you do with hard shaving soap, you get way too much on your brush. You only need to get about a 1/4 teaspoon on the end of a wet brush, and work it up on your face. (At least that&#x27;s my method)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent (calling it &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; is pushing I think) - but my husband not only loves the scent, he also loves the product and how it works and makes his face feel during/after shaving...and I guess that&#x27;s what matter most.</li>
    <li> This item is wonderful, went beyond what I was expecting, I read other reviews and had to try this out. You need very little of this cream to get a good lather (I use less than a pea size) I just lightly touch the brush to the cream.. The first time I used a little too much on the brush and had to rinse it off when I was done for a long while. You just need enough of the cream to see it&#x27;s on the brush that it. The smell is fantastic and the smell lasts a long time, It does not smell like old man smell, at least no old men (I know a lot) I know it&#x27;s a sophisticated smell. I highly rate this and I will be buying this again in a year when I finish up what I have.. It&#x27;s going to last a long time .I don&#x27;t think I need to look for another cream. A+++. If I get tired of the smell I will try a different scent(they have lots), but i like the sent so it may be a long time on the change of scent. I used a [[ASIN:B008WG9IP2 \\&quot;The Prince\\&quot; High Density Premium Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush]] with this Item.</li>
    <li> Whatever ingredient it is, this stuff burns my skin upon contact. No other soap or cream does this and I searched and found a few other people complaining of the same thing.</li>
    <li> I Bought it as a gift for my hubby.  He loves it!  It goes on smooth and smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;Fast service, too.</li>
    <li> Like most men in America, I was a cartridge shaver. Every week or so I&#x27;d pop on a new $4 cartridge, and by the end of the week, it would feel like was shaving with a cheese grater. I&#x27;m sure the blue goo in a can that I was using wasn&#x27;t helping any. Sure, it lathered OK, and it smelled all right, but most propellants used in shaving gel are irritants, even in those that claim to be for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.  And it was expensive. I don&#x27;t grow much of a beard, and patchy stubble doesn&#x27;t look good on anyone, so I shaved everyday. A $6 can would only last 8-10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been thinking about switching over to wet shaving with a double-edge safety razor and lathering with a badger brush and traditional shaving cream, and a few weeks ago, I finally made the decision to do it. I scoured Amazon for several days reading reviews and weighing costs. I eventually settled on this sandalwood shaving cream from Taylor of Old Bond Street. Boy, I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes a great lather, and a little goes a long way. Two or three quick swipes with a slightly damp brush is all it takes. I&#x27;ve been using the shaving cream for almost a month now, and it doesn&#x27;t look like any has been used. I fully expect this tub to last a year. That means this cost about 60% less per shave than the blue goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the rest of my shaving kit has something to do with it (razor handle [[ASIN:B005RZDEEC here]], blades [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 here]], and brush [[ASIN:B00B1TKY8C here]]), but I&#x27;ve never gotten a closer, more enjoyable shave in my life, and I know this shaving cream is one of the reasons. It moisturizes the skin thanks to the glycerin in the shaving cream (which isn&#x27;t usually found in shaving soaps, which is why they sometimes dry your skin out), and it lubricates the skin well to reduce friction and to allow the blade to more easily glide over the skin. This reduces razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained that the fragrance is too strong. I disagree.I wish it were stronger and lasted longer. It has that old time-y, barbershop, reminds-you-of-your-grandpa type smell. All of which is good. The first time I shaved with it, my wife checked out my face to see how the new products worked, and she said, \\&quot;Wow, you smell like a man!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shave, great value, great smell, and wife approved. I think Taylor of Old Bond Street found a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razor shaving. I got home from work one day, my shaving cream and razor were waiting for me in my mailbox. I went right in and shaved. It was a very pleasant experience. I loved the smell left on my skin of this shaving cream, and my girlfriend even told me I smelled good later that evening from this cream. You will have to have a separate bowl or cup to create the suds from the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream. I only shave once or twice a week. I don&#x27;t have a job or life-style that requires me to shave every day, so I believe this shaving cream will last for a few years. You use very little to create the suds necessary to shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream.  Smells great.  A little goes a long way. I tend to overload my brush with this product and have been learning to dial it back.  Excellent shaving product!</li>
    <li> It feels great, makes for a nice shaeve, is easy to ise, and smells  fantastic!  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, I love the feel and texture, and it is great on your face. My straight razor glides right through it and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling on your skin</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this shaving cream. The smell is very strong, it doesn&#x27;t produce the greatest lather, and it&#x27;s quite expensive. However, it gives a great shave. I&#x27;ve switched to shave soap, which I find is an equally good shave and less expensive with a milder smell. Overall not bad, but nothing I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Best shave cream. Period.</li>
    <li> lasts forever, but only 4 stars because it smells like old man.  they should come out with some contemporary scents</li>
    <li> Great smell, Great shave. I will now place a regular order. Use it with a real DE Razor and Badger brush and you will never go back to the chemicals from a can.</li>
    <li> Use just a little on a wet brush. And i mean a little. Then transfer to a bowl and beat till you get peaks on the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then apply to wet face.  leave the leftover soap in the mixing bowl. I squeeze it out of the brush. So don&#x27;t wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries and you can reuse next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful scent. Reminds me of the barbershop when I was a kid circa 1950.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order two there is no shipping cost. This should last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This product is equal to or better than more expensive products.....I will order this again and will be the shaving cream of my choice.</li>
    <li> In a good way, though! Every time I shave I get nostalgia flashbacks to bathtime at my grandparents&#x27; house when I was four. It&#x27;s a warm, soft, spicy, firm, woody kind of smell. If you whip up the lather just right with a good badger shaving brush (for good combo of low price and high quality, I recommend the &amp;#34;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&amp;#34;), you get a thick, comfy, engulfing, and more importantly, fully protective layer of foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do make sure to whip up the lather right; the difference in protective quality between getting the lather perfect and almost but not quite right is worlds apart.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream lathers very well, but two issues have convinced me to toss out what&#x27;s left of it and buy a better soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, something about the viscosity of the product makes it \\&quot;gunk up\\&quot; and clog the razor. I use an older Merkur safety razor with Feather blades, not the modern cartridge-style razors one buys at the supermarket, and keeping the blade clean is important to keep it sharp. But I have to disassemble and sort of \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; the razor with my fingers to get it clean every time it&#x27;s used. Most shave soaps will slide right off the razor when you run it under water. That said, it functions well enough as a lubricant during the shave itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my girl says it smells like old man... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad scent, but I&#x27;ll admit it is a bit potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad shave soap, but there are certainly better out there!</li>
    <li> love the scent and the lather. I have used several brands. Gillete, edge, art of shaving, Lab, jack black.&lt;br /&gt;this is the one i am sticking with. Very smooth lather makes shaving using a safety or straight edge razor a delight.</li>
    <li> I was using a cheaper brand of shaving soap and it worked ok but I wanted something better started looking around and found this&lt;br /&gt;said I&#x27;ll give it a try and I was glad I did it lathers vary well and feels nice on my face.  I love the smell of this soap it lightens up a little bit as you lather it up but still keeps a nice aroma it even lingers for a little while after you get done shaving.  I like this brand and will be trying other aroma&#x27;s when this finely does run out which may be a while because you don&#x27;t need much a little on the end of the brush is all you need.  great soap</li>
    <li> Perfect, great scent and produces a rich lather. First use though but I have no problem using this product again and again. Just finished shave and still have a great scent on my face.</li>
    <li> i will never buy another brand of shaving cream for as long as i live. I love taylor of old bond shaving cream and i am excited to try the other varieties. I really enjoy the sandalwood odor</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had heard many good things about it. Some have said the aroma is overpowering; maybe this was a batch defect, as I find the sandalwood scent to be refreshing and not overpowering in the least.  The bowl is pricey to my budget, but it should last quite a while as so little is required to work up a lather.  A small dollop of cream whips up to enough lather for two to three passes.  I find that if I am slow, I have to reapply as the lather dries out.  This is not a problem at all.  I get a smooth shave with my straight razor and when I am rushed and use a safety razor, it is just as good.  I highly recommend Taylor of Bond Old Street shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a old guy and so have been shaving a loooonng time.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower with a warm bowl that has been filled with hot water so the shaving cream is warm and silky.  Smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;What to make your lover happy.  Shower and shave with this before you got to sleep at night...it really does smell that nice and the shave is very close and smooth; even for a old guy like me.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got my razor and shaving cream.  Little concerned,  worried about the smell,  or the difference between the bar and cream, if I had made the right choice.  The cream has a wonderful, easy sandalwood smell without being over bearing,  lathers up wonderful.  I wet my badger brush, put a finger of cream on the brush, then scrub my face.  It lathers up quick and full in no time. Gives such a smooth shave. If all you havr ever used is storr bought stuff, try this, you will be shocked. Love this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent so far. Provides a smooth shave. The scent to me is really not all that strong,it&#x27;s a old style soapy smell that someone might could smell if they were within inches of your face. Scent doesn&#x27;t clash with bayrum type aftershaves .</li>
    <li> Exceptionally smooth shave.  A little dab gives a great lather.  Nice, strong scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Easy to build up a good lather and smells amazing. If your just starting to get into artisan soaps you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers great! This is the 3rd one I have bought and it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
    <li> To me it smells like a bar of soap. I didn&#x27;t like it at first, now its fine. My package was delivered and sat in the sun all day before I could retrieve it. The stuff had separated like old milk. I don&#x27;t know if it was suppose to be a solid chunk, it did kinda congealed back into a solid, but its not hard at all. I think $18 for it is a little high.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shave cream. It reminds me of an old barber shop. I get a great shave and experience no irritation. I am looking forward to trying some of the other shave creams from Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> I always nick myself with this infernal can of murder-cream. It smells great so I love using it, but something about the formulation always makes me nick myself. The avocado is much, much better for my longevity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he absolutely swears by it. He said it&#x27;s the best shaving cream he&#x27;s ever used and loves the smell. I just bought him a second container! He also has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Having not used a brush and bowl for many years, I decided to go back.  I&#x27;m retired now and can take the time to work up a lather and shave leisurely. I had expected this to be a hard soap but didn&#x27;t read the description well.  It is quite soft and my brush will pick up quite a bit more than needed if I am not careful.</li>
    <li> Love the old school smell!</li>
    <li> But when I tried this with my safety razor blade, thinks got closer and smoother, and even less nicking than I had experienced with Edge, Schick Hydro and a couple of other brush on soaps I have experimented over the years.  Plus, the smell is simple and masculine.  A real pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely.  One container will last several months before I need to reorder!  Great in combination with my safety razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I first started wet shaving. It lathers beautifully and smells amazing! After I finished my first jar, I switched to Proraso, since it is sort of a standard among wet shavers. I just didn&#x27;t like it, and I missed my Taylor! I still have most of that tube of Proraso left, and I&#x27;m about to finish off my third jar of Taylor!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product and service.</li>
    <li> love this stuff smells so good. Every time I shave I feel like I smell like I came out of a barber shop</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is my favorite. I have other soaps that I use that are also really good, such as Colonel Conk and Prorasso, but none of them lather quite as well for me ( though this may be a problem with my technique).This is a bit pricier but you get what you pay for. It has a generous bit of sandalwood scent in it, which I don&#x27;t mind because I like the smell. The sandalwood is not overpowering in my opinion, but if I shave in the morning I can still smell a trace of it by earlier afternoon. For me, that just reminds me that I had a good shave. The product is what it says it is - a cream. This means a couple of things: First a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t take much to build up a really rich lather. The first time I used it I made the mistake of trying to make a lather in the plastic tub it comes in. All that did was load way too much in the brush and  I ended up wasting quite a bit. The best technique I found is to  swirl a wet brush in the shaving cream tub 2-3 times( no more), and then lather up in a separate bowl or mug. It only takes about 10 seconds to build up a very thick lather. The second thing I found is that as a cream, the contents shift in delivery so be careful the first time you open the tub. Hold it straight up and down as best you can just to be careful( though it is thick enough not to &amp;#34;spill&amp;#34; per se). Typically there is a generous amount on the inside of the lid because of this settling so I swirl my brush in that amount to start out and shave with it until it is gone. If you are a fan of sandalwood( I had no idea I was until I tried this) and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time building up a lather, then this is a great soap for you.</li>
    <li> The consistence of this cream is a soft whipped texture and the fragrance is very strong. The wife doesn&#x27;t like the smell and it last for a long time on your face. Being on the softer side you just need to dip your damp beaver brush in it and a little lather goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newcomer to wet shaving with a safety razor, which is why (after plenty of research) I turned to Taylor of Old Bond Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that it lives up to its well-deserved reputation as an absolutely amazing product at a reasonable price. The tub really does last months and the lather you get from just an almond sized amount is exceptional. (I&#x27;m able to achieve 3-4 lathers/passes with some to spare when I&#x27;m done.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sandlewood scent is not as strong as some of the other reviews imply and fades quickly after the shave. Obviously scent favorability is objective, but I quite like this sandlewood variation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am particularly prone to irritation, which this aids in completely eliminating (in conjuction with a solid post shave routine) when compared to the cheaper drugstore and canned varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more and trying more scents &amp; products from Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> Great cream, good price; excellent value.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood and a Safety Razor... this makes my face feel good.</li>
    <li> I received a gift of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce last Christmas, along with a new Merkur razor and Shark Stainless razor blades.  I found the Merkur razor not to my liking (I prefer a butterfly design) and I purchased a Parker 99R to use with my new Sandalwood shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas!  The Parker razor pulled and tugged!  I changed blades to Personna double edged \\&quot;comfort coated\\&quot; blades.  I found the \\&quot;comfort\\&quot; to be entirely misleading.  I switched to the Merkur and got identical results with different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only commonality (besides the facial injuries) was...THE SOAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swapped out the Taylor for \\&quot;goop in a can\\&quot; - old fashioned, inexpensive, Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic!  The razor(s) sang and the blades rejoiced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there was a fly in the ointment (or in this case, soap) - I liked the Sandalwood scent and the &#x27;feel&#x27; of the Taylor.  The Barbasol, while admittedly functional, brought no joy to the art of shaving (other than the perhaps important one of not bleeding all over the bathroom sink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I re-read the reviews of the Taylor and they were (mostly) quite positive.  Could it be that I have the one face in a thousand that resists the charms of the Taylor?  Unlikely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This called for experimentation.  I put a dollup (a very, very small dollup) of Barbasol in the Taylor bowl, placed the combination on my brush and gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, magic!  Not quite as smooth as the Barbasol alone, and the soap dried out faster than the Barbasol, but the tugs and pulls were reduced by a large factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that other reviewers had commented on fact that the Taylor soap lasted (in the bowl, if not on the face) quite awhile - and yet my supply was rapidly dwindling.  (I was not then shaving every day with the Taylor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be...me???  Could it be my technique???  The Barbasol is a fairly simply application - squirt the goo out of the can onto the fingertips and apply to the face.  The Taylor required a brush and...and what???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a bit more research (thank you, You Tube!) I decided my lathering technique was insufficient to the task at hand.  I was placing my wet brush in the bowl, gathering a goodly amount (as one might with house paint) and placing on my face.  It was going on as a soap, not as a lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I procurred from my wife&#x27;s stash a small Tupperware container, perhaps 2\\&quot; deep and 3\\&quot; across, filled it with hot water and placed my brush in it to soak for 2 minutes (timed).  I dumped the water, shook the extra droplets from the brush and dipped just the ends of the bristles into the Taylor bowl, using very little of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then placed the brush in the still-damp Tupperware container and proceeded to beat the soap like a cheap rug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise and joy the soap lathered up very, very nicely indeed and, when placed on my face, was obviously much closer to the consistency of the Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor cut through the lather like...well, like a razor cutting through lather.  No pulling, no tugging, no nicks, no scrapes and no beard left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire problem I had with the Taylor soap for so many dreary, pain filled months was my technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may even invest in a shaving mug, in which to beat the Taylor soap into submission - but the Tupperware container seems to be doing a fine job on it&#x27;s own (making up in usability what it lacks in style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barbasol has been placed back on the shelf and a new cup of Taylor is on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HEAVILY recommend, if one has trouble with the Taylor Sandalwood Shaving Cream, one re-examine one&#x27;s technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to swirl it in the bowl that it comes in from London simply didn&#x27;t work for me - I couldn&#x27;t work up the requisite speed to create the desired consistency of lather.  A seperate container worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for Taylor and five lashes with a wet noodle for me because I spent so long figuring out the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HTH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> As promised it was shaving cream that made me smell of rich sandalwood.  Only complain is the occasional attack by woodpeckers.</li>
    <li> A Timeless Manly Smell. Lathers nicely on the face and brush. The Scent is subtle &amp; not overwhelming. Diffidently for the Modern Day Gentleman. Great Buy</li>
    <li> with over 1,100 5 star reviews I was expecting the smell to be amazing. It was ok at best, it smelled soap-ish, like lathered ivory soap with a hint of wood. No biggie. The scent wasn&#x27;t amazing but it wasn&#x27;t bad either. I&#x27;ll try the coconut next, that&#x27;s maybe more concealing of the soapy smell.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Great lather and smell.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and it is very easy to lather.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> IMO there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between these lathers and the canned stuff you buy at the store, only the smell and cost.</li>
    <li> Amazing shaving cream minus the scent. Buy this if you want to smell like grandpa or a 1970s stock broker. I will be going back to the regular (&amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34;) scent.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and the smell lasts a long time. I don&#x27;t see any reason to ever buy a different product again.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into shaving with a cream like this. I&#x27;ve always used the canned creams or gels before.  Using this cream and a nice badger brush give me a great lather and a much better shave.  The smell makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a barber shop every time I use it.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> came fast and smells great.  not too strong as it wears off after a while.  feels slick and doesnt take much to make a great lather</li>
    <li> So much better than an aerosol can. Some have commented that it&#x27;s sandal wood smell is too strong, I disagree.</li>
    <li> An old yet modern english zest screams &amp;#34;Gentleman&amp;#34; from the first openings to the final shave; an excellent purchase although and perhaps, priced &amp;#34;too well&amp;#34;. With so many shaving creams available not just from Taylor of Old Bond Street but from other companies as well, I felt my wallet stretching it&#x27;s green bounds when purchasing this product. I&#x27;ve already tested the Proraso menthol shaving cream (inexpensive price, lasted two years, excellent lather as compared to Taylor&#x27;s $15 comparative shaving cream and it is of slightly smaller size then Proraso), and it was a delight but I wanted to switch to a new shaving cream even if the price was upped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind paying a premium for shaving cream, Taylor of Old Bond Street will not disappoint you. The aroma of the sandalwood cream is engrossingly fresh and spicy, hinting at an old barber shop finish that will live up to your elegant decorum. Beyond the aroma, the shaving cream has an incredibly thick lather that is so rich you&#x27;ll only need to spare a minute application on your face to feel completely &amp;#34;Covered&amp;#34;. This English Cream envelopes your face very solidly and when you begin to shave, it is a buttery smooth process that renders no nicks or stinging cuts. There is a small after aroma after you shave but it does not last long and the smell is hardly noticeable on its own (that is for the aftershave to &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34;). Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream Bowl compared to the Proraso Menthol Shaving Cream, it noted as a richer cream and in lather, stronger smelling aroma with a more elegant scent, yet smaller sized and higher priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to have a very close shave, wanting to present themselves in all characteristics that composes a Gentleman, and doesn&#x27;t mind paying a premium.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream is one of the best creams out there you can buy. Great lather and shave all around. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This cream smells amazing, whips up effortlessly into an amazing shaving cream. Would be difficult to find a better shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Over priced at $12.00, very foul, unnatural scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving cream one of the best out there. Good price very little irritation and a good smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever!  My husband loves how the product works and I LOVE the smell.  It&#x27;s a win-win for us both!!&lt;br /&gt;We are customers for life with this company and highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Never thought I would spend this much on shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it provides a lot moisture and smells pretty damn good and a really clean shave.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell the lather is rich and creamy. I use it with an inexpensive ( $12.00 )  pure badger brush and it could not be better for me.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product myself.  It was a gift for my brother, he shaves old school. He loves this product and requested this one specifically. if you are looking for this product i would recommend it.  my brother loves it and said he likes the sandlewood because of the smell. i do have to say that the bowl comes about half full which is probably correct for the 5.3 ounces ( i didnt weigh it) but it looks deceiving when you open it you kind of feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> Great product, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My bf loves this shaving cream, and it has that very manly smell that most women love! It makes the razor glide over his face well, and moisturizes his face too! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents and shaving creams. It lathers very easily and has a scent that lingers for hours. Lubricating properties are adequate.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave cream, no wonder it is the #1 seller.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and easy lather.  Doesn&#x27;t go as far as some creams I use but not as expensive as they are per tub.</li>
    <li> I first thought this shaving cream was a bit on the pricey side but I am glad I tried it.  Lathers up great (I use a separate wooden shaving bowl and boar hair brush).  It really only takes a small dab of cream to build a rich lather and the scent just compliments it even more.  Not overpowering at all in my opinion and i do not use cologne daily so I am susceptible to strong scents.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The scent is fantastic, but not too overpowering and works brilliantly as a shaving soap with a safety razor/wet-shaving. It doesn&#x27;t take very much soap on the brush to get a rich, lather, so it lasts a good long time.</li>
    <li> Came on time. was a gift did not see so can&#x27;t say any more on product. price was great for gift.</li>
    <li> Would not use any other</li>
    <li> I purchases this and a hard soap, the past Lathers really really well but the Sandle wood has a bit of an older man&#x27;s scent... Not to sure about it. Otherwise. Good lather does what it need to do</li>
    <li> The best shaving soap I have ever used.  A tiny bit of it makes a massive amount of lather. It also smells good!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this the most . Great lather and good aroma not overpowering seem to last a good long time</li>
    <li> Literally the best smelling shaving cream on earth.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and moved to old school DE razors to improve my skin.  Was having a rough time until I tried this wonder in a can.  My face feels cool and refreshed after and has a great subtle scent that lingers from 5 to 5.  I rank a 10 on the sensitive scale and none of this bothers my face.  Order and enjoy</li>
    <li> The only shaving cream I buy.  Smells great.  Lathers great.  Nice container.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> TOBS Sandalwood shave cream makes a good lather without much effort and works well for protecting my face from razor burn. It smells good (to me), though almost certainly a little barber-shop-like, and the scent stays on the face all day long. The screw-cap tub it comes in is surprisingly sturdy and can be re-used long-term--a nice feature, since many soaps come packaged in paper and thus need a container. Recommended if you want a reasonably-priced DE shave cream with classic sandalwood scent and nice lather characteristics.</li>
    <li> This lathers very nicely.  The smell is fine for me -- not great, not bad.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of my shave was OK, but not as smooth as with some other products I&#x27;ve used. (Cheaper products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could use this shave cream, I still would probably choose another instead. I can&#x27;t use it though.  An couple of hours after shaving with this, my skin looks and feels like I have a sunburn.  There must be something in it I&#x27;m allergic to. It&#x27;s not the first time, but it&#x27;s the first in a while. (I used this 4 times over the last 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t change any of the rest of my routine, to be sure that the shave cream is the cause.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this works for you, great.  I&#x27;ll stick with Arko and VDH until my next selections arrive and I try them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream religiously for months now and I love it. The scent is just right (it seemed strong at first, but it&#x27;s great and The Girl likes it just fine), the lather explodes in the bowl, and it brushes on smooth and shaves even smoother. Great stuff. Highly recommended and worth the price.</li>
    <li> By far, the best I have used to date. I have used Proraso, Col Conk, etc. and this is orders of magnitude better. Spectacular product!</li>
    <li> I was recently looking at different shaving options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always had issues with irritated skin, especially around my neck (not so much on the cheeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem was when I tried to shave without taking a shower, with dry skin and coarse facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This not only helps soften the hair, it also smells really good (like a genuine barber shop) and works well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for alternatives to the shaving creme/gel you buy from your grocery store I suggest you try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite inexpensive and works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving now for 50 years.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of razors.  Started out with double edge and straight edge and probably tried every kind of cartridge and several electric razors.  I&#x27;ve tried the canned foam, shaving oils, and probably 10 different mug soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference has always been the wet shave and brush/mug has been my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to say my search is now over because I have finally found the best combination for me.  A new Edwin Jagger DE and the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood with a badger brush wins hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hurry up and shave with the old DE I had in boot camp and the can of foam was no fun.  But with the rich lather I get with TOBS and a new blade in my new razor make those double passes a real pleasure both during the morning ritual and I even find my self enjoying the contrast between my goatee and the BBS face throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The women in my life have noticed the smooth touch and the masculine scent too :-)</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving soap, great aroma.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different soaps and creams and this one is by far my favorite. The smell is great, but the lather is what is truly amazing. I use less than a dime size in my bowl and it makes way more lather than I need.</li>
    <li> This is good shaving cream. I&#x27;ve used most of it over the past year, but have switched over to the Proraso Shaving Cream in a tube. I switched for the same reasons that I can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars: 1 - The scent of Sandalwood is too strong. I was hoping for something far less overwhelming; and, 2 - While it feels creamy going on, my skin feels dry after shaving and washing my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not bad, but it just doesn&#x27;t give me what I was hoping to find.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street works well &amp; has a good lather but had to be thrown away because it smells so badly, there are other scents that smell much better for young men but if you are 65+ then this may be the perfect scent for you.</li>
    <li> Great scent, great lather.  Manly!</li>
    <li> I was getting low on the regular shave cream Van der Hagen with aloes and took this on a whim because it was on Prime 2 day free shipping. This is a quality product and you should not put great dobs of it on your face. A tiny dab goes a long, long, way. The shave left my face smoother than I can remember for years. The scent is not exactly subtle, so expect some comments. My wife noticed it immediately. I am sure this has already been said in the reviews so I just +1.</li>
    <li> The sandalwood scent was not what I was hoping for. After using The Art of Shaving&#x27;s sandalwood, I was hoping for a similar smell. This is much more flowery and mediciney, it almost stings your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very high quality in all other regards.</li>
    <li> New to wet shaving, but heard this was an all around great beginners cream. Love the smell, and the lather. Will keep this in my collection, and purchase again. Look forward to trying one of their soap products.</li>
    <li> First off, the smell is amazing. The cream lathers nicely into a nice thick foam with just a couple of brush strokes and a tiny bit of water. Each shave is like a dream,  Taylor of Old Bond Street is now my go to shaving cream! Seriously, just buy this cream. I&#x27;m asian and can&#x27;t grow hair on my face even if my life depended on it. So for me, this will last a year. For you northern folk, maybe a couple months.</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream. Only takes a dab on a brush to work up a very, very thick lather.  Much better than the Proraso cream I usually use. Nice subtle scent as well. A tad pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my son . He asked for these and was very happy with&lt;br /&gt;Them.</li>
    <li> Taylor of old bond st has been in business since the late 1800&#x27;s..obviously doing something right..Great lather!!,  just a small amt of cream goes a long way!...Nice ole school sandalwood smell, much cheaper on Amazon.com than from London&#x27;s website....lasts much longer than other soaps..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cream!  It truly is incredible.  Though the lather and feel of all of the three Taylor of Old Bond Street creams is relatively similar, I absolutely love the scent of this.  As far as the feel and lather, it loads on any of my three brushes with incredible ease, and the lather can be built just as easily on the face as well as in the bowl(which is my personal preference).  A minute amount on the tips of the brush yields a thick and creamy lather which allows for ample coating of three passes, and a touch-up, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another word of advice for the would-be safety razor shaver:  check out YouTube for shaving videos from Geofatboy and Mantic59. These two aficionados make shaving a true art, with tutorials and reviews.  I&#x27;ve personally purchased the majority of the products I use personally based off their reviews.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I have not tried other shaving creams for the safety razor shave... I have been using this one since the beginning three years ago. However, it works well and my wife loves the smell of it. I was considering going with a cheaper option, but she convinced me to continue with this cream because of how much she liked it.</li>
    <li> Product is great, gives a smooth shave. Leaves skin feeling good. Would order again. Fast shipment. Thanks again for your business!</li>
    <li> Pros: The lather on this stuff is incredible.  As full-bodied and creamy as anything I&#x27;ve ever encountered, requires very little on the brush and whips into a robust lather extremely quickly.  Allows for a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell is overwhelming and the cream causes irritation/razor burn.  Of course, each person&#x27;s mileage may vary according to the sensitivity of his skin, but I can only review a product based on my own experience of it.  I was very disappointed to feel a dry, burning sensation during the shave and some noticeable razor burn afterwards.  From what I understand, this appears to be a problem more with the Sandalwood-scented Taylor than with TOBS in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hardy skin and very tolerant olfactory nerves, give this cream a try.  Otherwise, there are gentler scents and formulations out there.</li>
    <li> Perfect shaving cream.  Love the scent</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream shortly after I started wet shaving. I was excited by the rave reviews that I had seen about this product on youtube. I was not favorably impressed by this product for the following three reasons: 1. The price. This is among one of the most expensive shaving soaps available. It is twice the price of Proraso for the same amount. 2. Scent. I was surprised that I did not like the scent because so many other people claim that it is among the best sandalwood scents on the market. The smell is nice but there is an underlying soap smell which I do not like at all, and in fact, this is the smell that lingers after you are finished shaving (provided you do not use any aftershave). 3. Face feel. I did not like the way this shaving cream felt on my face, especially after I was finished shaving. There is a distinctly annoying oily feel after shaving and you have to rinse with a considerable amount of water to wash it away. I am quite sure this must have something to do with the long list of unnatural chemicals that are in the ingredients. On a positive note, I thought that it lathered very good either face-lathering or in the bowl and it holds the lather well on the face. It definitely provides a good amount of  slickness and lubrication for the shave, but no better protection from nicks and razor irritation than other soaps I have tried. Overall, I am somewhat disappointed with this product for the reasons I have stated, but it performs well enough that I would not outright dismiss it.</li>
    <li> Just buy it- you&#x27;ll spend more on happy hour friday and 1 tub lasts months. Proraso is a good cheaper alternative and using a badger hair brush really creates a nice lather. I didn&#x27;t like the Art of shaving brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don&#x27;t press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
    <li> Amazing shave wonderful aroma that lasts. Reminds me of the old barber shop&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the TOBS Sandalwood for a week now and I can&#x27;t speak more highly of a shaving cream.  First- just a dab will do ya.  A small amount on my badger brush, about the size of a dab of toothpaste on your brush, makes a very nice lather.  This will be enough to coat your face with just one swipe of your brush.  The plastic tub the cream comes in should last me 4-6 months before needing to replace. Second-your razor will glide across your face.  I was amazed at how smooth my razor moved over my face. This helps a lot in the hydration of your face and prevents razor burn. I&#x27;ve been using a Shark SS blade this week and it cut very close with this cream without any razor burn. Third-the scent is not overpowering as others have stated. I have experimented with showering before and after shaving.  The scent is strong enough to leave a lingering sandalwood aroma even after a shower, yet not too strong to overpower you if you shave after taking a shower.  The fragrance will last about an hour or two afterwards and you&#x27;ll still have a soft sandalwood fragrance afterwards. I would be hard pressed to try any other brand of shaving cream. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other fragrances TOBS offers.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, nice scent, and a very small amount creates a good lather.</li>
    <li> Have been buying this for some time now.&lt;br /&gt;It has replaced all other shaving creams so far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is OUTSTANDING shaving cream.  Just a little bit will do - you don&#x27;t need too much.  I&#x27;ve used Proraso shaving soap and thought I&#x27;d try some Old Bond.  In my humble opinion, the Proraso is a Toyota Camry - good, realiable, and will definintely get the job done well.  The Taylor of Old Bond Street is the Lexus - It gets the job done in style and sophistication not quite found in the other brand.  Do you love them both?  Sure, but you&#x27;d really love your Lexus -Taylor of Old Bond Street!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall smell of the cream stays on for hours and goes well with the Taylor sandalwood aftershave balm.  Just a great product!</li>
    <li> I buy this shaving cream and scent all the time.  One of my two favorites along with Proraso&#x27;s sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Provides an excellent shave.  Lathers up very well.  Four stars because scent is somewhat overpowering.  Will follow you most of the day.  Proraso Sandalwood (red bowl)  offers a nice alternative to this scent that is much milder, and provides just as good of a shave.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving cream.  It lathers up nicely, remains thick, and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m docking one star since my wife says I smell like an old man after using this (even though I don&#x27;t mind the smell).  I like the almond scent more.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream after doing several hours of research. Right off the bat I was impressed with the reduced irritation this cream caused compared to off the shelf stuff from Target. It foams up quite nicely with my brush and gives me that extra sense of manly satisfaction I was looking for. The only downside is my wife says I perpetually smell like an old man in the mornings. Overall, this is a good quality product for a fair price. I&#x27;ve been able to make mine last for almost a year and a half now. Well worth a few more bucks initially than buying a cheap can of foam every two months.</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is addictive. I find myself disappointed that I don&#x27;t shave daily. Finish off with a little Bay Rum and and women stop to sniff. I&#x27;m not kidding that really happened the first time I used it. Three random women in the grocery store stopped and smelled in my direction.</li>
    <li> I have a love for this that dates to it being my first venture into real shaving creams.  It is great stuff but lags behind some other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is a personal preference, but in my opinion this is a nice scent but it is old mannish.  Grapefruit, coconut, lemon-lime, Mr. Taylor and St. James are all Breyer scents in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These seem to be blended inconsistently.  Some containers are lumpier and drier than others.  The cases are really nice and can be used after your done to store nuts, bolts and assorted hardware.  Just be wary that they shatter if dropped and if you have little ones like I do this may mean scraping your precious cream off the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lathers up great and shaves great.  However I get more bang for my buck for classic Poraso, especially if I purchase it at Bath and Body works under its Alternative label C.O. Bigelow.  You get the third tube free there.  I&#x27;d say this is equivalent to that cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cream that I find far superior in terms of nicks, irritation, and smoothness is Musgo.  The stuff is amazing and about the same cost as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell, Tabac soap is also superior.</li>
    <li> Excellent lather.  Each shave does not require much soap so the tub lasts a while.  I enjoy the clean scent and the cream leaves my skin feeling &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after (no bumps, no chafing, etc.)</li>
    <li> Lathers very well and provides adequate lubrication for my double edge razor. What &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; is highly objective but I really like the way this smells. It&#x27;s a clean, manly smell. Nothing floral or fruity and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great lather and scent.  Alittle overpowering for some, but it has a nostalgic scent for me like an old barbershop.</li>
    <li> Great for building a quick lather.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this at the suggestion of a friend who uses this product. I am very pleased with the amount of lather that it produces, and really like the subtle fragrance. Not so strong that it is overbearing, but just enough to be noticed.</li>
    <li> Great value for price. Works great and would highly recommend it for all newbies out there. It does smell a little old so be sure to look at other options. I heard sensitive skin one smells better.  Also, if $ is not an issue, Trampers and Castle Forbes may be a great option for you!</li>
    <li> Quick Shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for a bunch of years with regular cartridge razors and the creams from local drugstores.  I just started getting fed up of the high price of things and started &amp;#34;getting back to basics&amp;#34; as it were.  I bought this based on the recommendations here, and I can say that it&#x27;s well worth the price and I can tell it&#x27;s going to last for a LONG time.  I used about a thimble&#x27;s worth of the creme, and was able to fully lather my face twice with a synthetic badger shaving brush.  Some have said they think the scent is a overpowering, I am usually sensitive to that, but I found the scent to just right.  I really like the scent and I don&#x27;t find it overpowering at all.  Does a great job and I will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Nice scent but does not last long</li>
    <li> Smells great and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Super fantastic ! Love it</li>
    <li> Brand new to using a safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare this to. But, I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with this - easy to use, great lather that really makes a beginner able to shave without issue, and great smell left afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I really dig the woody smell of this stuff; the scent alone may be enough to get me to try it again sometime if I can&#x27;t find a cheaper alternative. I think maybe I was a little too enthusiastic while whipping up a morning shave&#x27;s worth, but it seemed to me that it had more of a liquid consistency than that of the Proraso I was used to. Perhaps I just needed to put less on the brush and spend more time in the bowl. Regardless, it provided a fairly nice shave (I think it was mainly the aroma), though the cream seemed to last a shorter than expected. For the price, I&#x27;m inclined to think we should receive a bit more product, as it is just shave soap.</li>
    <li> I like the lather and love the sent. I get a great shave from either of my Merkur razors or my old Gillette &amp;#34;Fatboy&amp;#34;. This product is fantastic for wet shaving. My wife likes the sent as much as I so it&#x27;s a win, win. I live in bourbon country and we have very hard limestone water. It&#x27;s not a factor. I understand the sandalwood sent is not for everyone but I reminded me of a times past and Saturday mornings at the barbershop listing to old war stories and assorted tall tales from the old guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff gives a great shave witch should make any man feel better. Yes it does smell like grandpa but that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting great shaves with this for about a month now. Smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels better. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Wow. Talk about a great shave after using this cream. Using a badger brush really helps lather this &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; up. After applying it in circular motions you will really feel the razor gliding over your skin. Really helps fight irritation.</li>
    <li> Lathers so great! Smells very manly. Like an old man driving a tank through the forest, running over trees without any discretion. Firing artillery into the mouth of a volcano, all while chewing on tree bark.</li>
    <li> What can I say.  You want a nice shave?  You want a close shave?  You want to be a real man?  Get this shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;nuff said...</li>
    <li> nice but prefer the soap over the cream.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream.  I love it because it lathers up very well which means that you need very little of it on your face which means that it last long which means that you get what you pay for!  Also it is very soothing to your skin.  It also smells very good. I am an African American man who recently switched to shaving with a safety razor and a straight razor after years of using a 4 (quattro) blade razor.  I have no more hair bumps, and I actually enjoy shaving now. If you are thinking of buying this shaving cream...stop thinking and just buy it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Quality - excellent stuff.</li>
    <li> Definitely not my favorite. There is nothing wrong with the cream but it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the others I have tried. I find Spieck and Cella much better than this for my skin and I rated them 4 stars which means I&#x27;m still kinda looking for my absolute favorite shave prep. Some have come close like Tabac and Cella and Spieck...but still I&#x27;m looking. Anyway this cream lathers well and the shave is decent but I felt dry and a little irritated post shave. Remember everyone&#x27;s skin is different and that&#x27;s why certain products and blade combos work for some and not others. This one just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I really like the sandalwood smell, it creates a great lather for a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Well I finally hit that point, as did all my shaving ancestors who came before me, and all those whom will come after me: I finally got tired of the unholy shaving concoctions in the local Megalo-Mart, and decided to grow up and shave like an adult, and not smell like a teenager after doing it, and not have to sell myself on the local corner in order to buy profanely overpriced replacement cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after getting back into DE safety razors again, which takes me back, as I am sure it does with many people, to the days of our youth watching our father&#x27;s shave. I quickly sought out on my quest to find a suitable shaving soap or cream that works for me, which will no doubt be a lifelong pursuit and one that no one can ever truly fulfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought until I opened this tub of sandalwood laced manna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is soft, that of warm butter, semi-soft, almost a lotion, but not quite. The lather is wondrous, dense, and a pleasure to behold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those that ask: I recommend using a proper shaving brush and bowl. Let the brush and the bowl soak in hot water while you shower, and lather them up afterwards. I would bet my stash of Feather blades that the first time that warm brush and lather touch your face, you&#x27;ll never go back to anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> It lathers well. But I&#x27;ve found it to be a bit too harsh on my face. I did a double shave once and after the second lather, my face was red and burning. Granted it&#x27;s very possible it was an ID10T error, as I&#x27;m a noob to DE shaving. But I have since tried Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin shave cream, and it was great with no burning (but didn&#x27;t lather as well, and much more expensive).</li>
    <li> has a smell vaguely like suntan lotion. not old man-ey at all. and a little dab will do ya. I barely tap my brush in the cream and am able to get a good lather out of it.</li>
    <li> Good lather, smells like an old person. Really strong. Wouldnt recommend if you are a single man looking for companionship with a woman under the age of 85.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream on the market!</li>
    <li> Takes a few tries to figure out how to get a lather up with a badger brush, but I figured it out. Get the brush wet, put a finger tip dab (1 inch) in the center of the brush and apply to face. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Just a pass with the brush will pick up enough to create a rich lather. It&#x27;s like making merengue, thick peaks. Great smell and a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Never knew shaving could be such a luxury.  Great product and very well priced through the vendor.  Shaving is no longer a chore but a pleasant early morning experience.</li>
    <li> This is some great shave cream. About an almond size dab on your brush or in your mug and you are set. The scent takes me right back to the barber shop my dad took me to as a boy when they would whip out the straight razor and hot lather to trim your side burns, ears, and neck. With the proper cream to lather ratio, it quickly frothes in to a thick great smelling lather. the only shave cream I will buy now. Just need to try the other scents.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but, the smoothest, best smelling, lather you can find for a very, very close shave.</li>
    <li> The smell is great. It works well for shaving. You can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that in a shaving cream. It is a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and smells absolutely wonderful!  Not drying on the skin as a lot of shaving cream can be.  A great product!</li>
    <li> This is a very slippery yet thick shaving cream. Great for a comfortable shave. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving cream that ive used so far. I heard from other reviews that the scent is overwhelming, but rest assured it is not very potent. The cream provides excellent cusion for the blade and lathers very very well. i add some pre-shave oil to the mix, &amp;#34;taconic unscented,&amp;#34; About 2 drops, which for my sensitive face does really well with lubricatig the skin for the blade to glide on. I would highly recommend this item for anyone looking for a great shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Wet shavers, do yourself a favor and pick this up now.  This cream is very high quality and gives you a great shave.  The scent is very agreeable and lingers the whole day on your skin.  The cream itself spreads evenly and allows for a nice, slick pull with the razor.  A little goes a long way, so one bowl will last for many, many shaves.</li>
    <li> Finally shaving like a man.  Been using Gillette for a while but this has improve my skin and hair maintenance.  I am African-American and our hair makes things complicated.  I love the smoothness this provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go to product.  I only buy this for my face.  Removing body hair, I still use Gillette.</li>
    <li> used for years like it</li>
    <li> One of the better lathers in a shave cream and provided one of the smoothest shaves I have had with my safety razor. You don&#x27;t need too much on your brush to get a good lather. I used a mug to mix and first time around went a little too light on the water. The cream dried out on my face, but still provided a close shave. Second time around I got the proportions correct and it provided an even better shave. The only thing that got me was that there was only a hint of sandalwood fragrance and more of a barber shop smell in the cream. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, but is strong, so if that turns you off I would avoid. I would personally like more sandalwood as it is one of my favorites in a shave cream, but this should do the trick for the next 6-8 months, as these tubs last a long time.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is perfect.  The tub lasts many months so it ends up being cheaper than any shaving cream at the store.  It goes on smooth and delivers an excellent shave.  Also, data suggests that Sandalwood scent promotes healing and cell regeneration in skin cells.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream out there&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many brands, but this one is fantastic, lathering is awesome, fragrance is outstanding, and best of all the price is outstanding and here is why&lt;br /&gt;small tiny quantity is needed to shave your face&lt;br /&gt;since it smells great you don&#x27;t have to buy an after shave cream&lt;br /&gt;and it moisturize your face better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried in the past, which makes shaving very smooth, eventually you will end up  replacing your blades less often</li>
    <li> Had been a Proraso user for several years and thought I&#x27;d try something new (for me).  After looking on some discussion boards and getting some recommendations, I went for it and was not disappointed!  I scooped up a small amount with my finger (I think &amp;#34;almond sized&amp;#34; was recommended) and placed it into my bowl.  Whipped up with a brush and just the right amount of hot water and I had plenty of very rich lather for my two-pass shave (with the grain and against the grain).  Plus, there was more than enough left over for my 6-year-old daughter to have fun slapping some on to her own face (one of her favorite activities while I&#x27;m shaving).  This 5.3-ounce container will go a long way and I would definitely recommend it for any straight or safety razor shave... heck, ANY shave!</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers great. Gives me a smooth shave every time so far.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would be a cheaper alternative to the Art of Shaving sandalwood shaving cream. It works very well as a cream, but the scent is much more like regular shaving cream; slightly chemical smelling. there is a slight hint of sandalwood, but not nearly as nice smelling as the Art of Shaving one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5.3 ounces is a lot of product though, seeing as the cream is pretty dry and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great product but not as good as the Art of Shaving cream.</li>
    <li> My last shaving soap was Col. Conk Glycerin Almond Scented. (http://www.amazon.com/Col-Conk-Almond-Glycerine-Shave/dp/B002JKKPDG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361677355&amp;sr&#x3D;1-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;col+conk). I have to say that Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream is far better in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street creates a nice rich lather that lasts through an entire safety razor shave, not soaking in as much as many other shave soaps I have used. I have seen other reviewers mention the strength of the scent; don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is quite strong, but I don&#x27;t find it wearing on that strong throughout the day. It fades into a very pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product over the Col Conk.</li>
    <li> This is a good lathering, solid product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaving cream for over a year, delivered by Amazon effortlessly every 3 months. I am reminded every morning of what is to be a gentleman by using this shaving cream. I do not usually review &amp;#34;toilet products&amp;#34; but I had to make an exception in this case.&lt;br /&gt;The powerful yet discrete essence of the sandal wood is incorporated effortlessly in this shaving cream. It is gentle on the face, and sooting after the morning shave. I had been using the generic canned products for years trying always to find the balance between daily use and skin reaction to the product. Very disappointed due to issues with abrasion or overwhelming fragrance,  I found this product which, in all honesty appears as just soap with sandal wood fragrance but that, it is not. The formula is gentle on the skin and generous enough to last 3 months after daily use.&lt;br /&gt;After one year of using it I am sincerely delighted with the product. THe essence lasts all day and the skin reaction after the shave is so mild that many days I forget to use aftershave and the my skin is still not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;THe automatic delivery by Amazon complements this product well, I highly recommend both as practical and a good way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;After all, a good shave in the mornings can never be underrated.</li>
    <li> Works well and has a great smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent shaving cream for those who like to use a brush. It applies easily and is very foamy.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and does its job. All I look for in a shaving cream</li>
    <li> Great shave, quality product, scent is just OK for me.</li>
    <li> This was actually the first shaving cream I started using with a safety razor. The cream foams well and has an excellent scent. In fact, I rate this so highly mainly because my better-half loves the scent and the closeness of the shave from a safety razor. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got tired of all those aerosol cans. Have used this classic , sort of old school barbershop scent for almost two years now. Love the quality and scent. I figure it runs me about sixty cents per month also. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Great product for anyone using any kind of razor. My setup is a Parker 99r with Feather razors. Amazing smooth shave and great smell.</li>
    <li> Great texture! Lathers perfect! Smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product  and lathers  up rich and creamy in seconds.  That is good and bad.  Good as the quality of the lather is the best of any  that I have used.  Rich and creamy.  However if you like to twirl the brush around in the bowl it is not only not necessary but  uses up the soap at an alarming rate.  Get the lather you desire and then  resist the further desire to work the brush</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The lather is thick and luxurious. So much in fact that I am constantly trying to use a smaller amount. I barely dab the soap now for each shave so I believe that it will last a very long time. I have tried other shaving creams but none of them come close to this product. I highly recommend this and all other Taylor of Old Bond Street products. You will not regret paying a little extra because of the quality.</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves skin soft and smooth. Very good lather. Only drawback is that the smell, while it does smell good, is a little artificial.</li>
    <li> Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street is my favorite shaving cream and the only one I use. It is rich and creamy, gives a wonderful shave, and has a great masculine scent. I buy it for myself and my son.</li>
    <li> I travel for work most every week.  To avoid the hassles of the TSA I started carrying old fashion shaving cream with a brush.  I don&#x27;t remember the first brand i used but it was hard packed paste - really had to get the hot water rolling to warm it up to a reasonable lather.  This cream is soft and has a nice scent.  Very easy to use and quick to lather.  I actually find I get a closer shave with this product than the Edge gel cans I use at home.  When i run out of the Edge, I think I&#x27;ll go this way at home as well as on the road</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different shaving soaps since I started wet shaving, and this has become an instant favorite. Prorasa previously held the spot (and its a great choice as well) but this is just so much creamier and a pleasure to apply to my face. It also holds moisture well so when I lather both sides of my face at once, it hasn&#x27;t dried out by the time I get to shave the other side (which has been a slight problem with other soaps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its got a strong scent, which I really like, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances it might be too much for you. Likewise, if you prefer a soapier shave, this might not be the right choice for you (Try prorasa in that case.)  But for me, I&#x27;ll be repeating this order.</li>
    <li> The product is great but it has a very strong scent that only older people might like.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream but the smell of sandalwood is a little overpowering. Lathers really well although it dries quickly even before I have completed shaving. Despite that I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. The consistency was lighter than I expected but just a little bit whips up to a nice, lasting lather.  The scent is mild and pleasant.  The only draw back is that despite it&#x27;s volume it only lasted me about as long as one bar of Col. Conk&#x27;s Shaving Soap.  At $14 each it&#x27;s kind of an expensive way to shave.</li>
    <li> For first time users that are just now coming away from canned shaving creams, this scent might be overbearing, at least initially. I found that on my 2nd or 3rd shave, the scent wasn&#x27;t all that bad and I had adjusted to it. It does linger a bit post-shave, but once you&#x27;re out of the house, you won&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> New to wet shaving last year and after reading too many reviews, I decided to do my own comparison of wet shave soaps. I purchased Proraso New Shaving Soap Pot Sandalwood on July 8, 2014, Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set a week later, and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl on July 22, 2014. I used a different soap each day and the same Tweezerman brush. After one month, I found myself gravitating to the Proraso soap: it lathered well and allowed me to obtain a really close shave. I&#x27;ve retired the remaining Taylor of Old Bond and Van Der Hagen soaps to storage under the sink. I also purchased a second Proraso for use in a second bathroom.  I also note that after eight months of solid use I still have a lot of Proraso soap remaining. Overall, I really like the Proraso soap but found the Taylor of Old Bond and Van Der Hagen soaps lacking.</li>
    <li> Great lather, great shave.  Smell is awesome.  Leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> By far the best shaving lather or foam, I have ever used i 47 years! I&#x27;ve tried about all the shaving types &amp; the new multiple blade razors &amp; this lather soap beat them all by a lot! Wonderful smell too!</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great. Never had a better shave. I will buy this again,</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I own sandal wood furniture, and I use sandal wood scented products. Usually I use Art of Shaving sandal wood scented shave cream, after shave balm, and pre-shave oil. If you would like to experience authentic sandal wood scent, which is a beautiful, delicate, and warm scent, then I suggest you try the Art of Shaving products. That is to what I will be returning; because, this shave cream in NO way resembles sandal wood scent at all. I tried it based on its price and a temporary unavailability of the other, and I am completely dissatisfied. I felt that the perfume overridden scent of this terrible smelling stuff warranted a WARNING rather than a review. There are no refunds with this company, even if their product has no resemblance to the description...Now that I&#x27;ve made the mistake, I understand why the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; products enjoy the success that they do, and I realize why they are priced the way they are...THEY ARE WORTH IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Shaving cream such as this goes on thicker and stays on my face longer than regular shaving soap.  And my girl loves the sandalwood scent!</li>
    <li> Just love the oder in the bathroom now, and every time I open the jar. also does a very good job in wetting my wiskers for shaving, What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> 5 star for product. 1 star for price. Stop raising the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like all the &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; aspects of this shaving cream but my experience suggests that when used by itself and a traditional safety razor it is a little rough in terms of lubricating functionality. Try using Secret Shave or your preferred brand of shave oil applied prior to and the experience will improve significantly.</li>
    <li> My first (and only) sandalwood. Since I purchased this (I do like to switch it up every couple shaves) I&#x27;ve only purchased other scents and formulations of other brands to try so I don&#x27;t have an apples-to-apples comparison of sandalwood, but I would say there are other brands I like a little better. But NOT for the money... TOBS is one of the best values I&#x27;ve found in quality shaving creams. I also have and LOVE (as does my girlfriend) their avocado cream.</li>
    <li> Like the title says, this stuff lathers great and one bowl will probably last you a few months based on my experience. I really like the shaving qualities of this product overall and I would not hesitate to buy another bowl of their stuff, but I would probably try a different scent next time. TOBS&#x27; Sandalwood is a bit overpowering. It is quite sharp and really hits you straight in the smell receptors if you&#x27;re not ready for it. I prefer a more subtle variation on sandalwood. I will order TOBS again, but probably won&#x27;t be ordering this particular scent for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather is thick but a bit on the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; side. Use a layer of oil beneath it or a bit more water than normal in order to make it run smoothest. I&#x27;m a bit of an amateur still with the whole wet shave routine, though, so your results may vary.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving in December after refusing to pay the price for a 4 pack of Gillette Fusion cartridges.  I started with the Van Der Hagen Mens luxury shave set for the soap, brush and mug.  I also ordered the 16 blade sampler pack and have decided on the Astra Platinum Double Edge blades.  100 of these for $10.00, then came this order of soap.  I did not think wet shaving could get any better, but after receiving this soap, I am totally hooked and actually look forward to my morning routine.  This soap lathers great, and smells great also.  It rinses off completely and does not leave any unpleasant scent.  I had to travel for 1 week and bought a tube of shaving cream from another supplier, while it worked ok, I could not wait to get home and lather up with my Taylor Sandalwood!!!!!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Super easy to lather. Smells great. Great lubrication for shaving.</li>
    <li> compared to other products of this ilk, this one is not to be ignored&lt;br /&gt;it just is not quite as good as trufitt and hill&lt;br /&gt;sorry</li>
    <li> Great shave and I really like the smell.  I also really like the full lather it provides.  I only use a small amount and it goes a long way, for three applications. This is the product I use on a day-to-day going to work day.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving a pleasure. Just wet your spiffy brand new badger hair shaving brush and dip it in this soap. Leather it up in the lid and apply. Shave and rinse the lid. Clean your face and apply TOBS after shave. Now you look and smell great, you king of industry! Go get em!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Great scent, lathers up quickly and easily and gives a great shave</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love it. A little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and the way it lathers.</li>
    <li> Great smell, you don&#x27;t need much to make a good amount of lathers, it feels good on the face however it doesn&#x27;t softens the whiskers as much as I would like, a second or third application maybe (this of course depends on the beard) needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is a little higher but the number of shaves from one container makes it a great value.</li>
    <li> Great product..gave 4stars because product was damaged in shipping..otherwise my husband love this!!!</li>
    <li> This cream gives a very good lather and lasts well. The fragrance is subtle, reasonable value for the high quality. Almost but not quite as good as G. Trumper&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Excellent for a smooth shave and a very pleasant smelling experience! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used, period.</li>
    <li> Like the lather, yet the smell (Sandalwood) is not for me - smells like the old-time Barbasol shaving creams remember as a kid. ;us, the smell seems to linger all day and I&#x27;m not big on perfumes, colognes, or aftershaves. If that&#x27;s your thing, then you&#x27;re stoked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will last me the better part of a year as you only need a dab about the size of an almond to shave your face and neck. Great value. I find it not to be slick enough on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th+ stroke and need to re-lather and re-apply it to get that fine shave I like. My Noxema shaving lotion does better to stay slick for multiple strokes, then again I&#x27;m not sure this was intended for this. Just add more an you&#x27;re golden...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al-in-all, I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> smells good it will last you a while.</li>
    <li> Great! This is my first Taylor of Old Bond Street. The smell reminds me of an old barbershop my dad used to take me to when I was a kid.  Great smelling sandalwood cream and super thick.  Going to try the coconut next!!</li>
    <li> Creamy, dreamy .... use a little - goes a long long way ..,.. subtle, masculine fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever owned!! It has a great consistency makes a smooth shave!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It smells wonderful, lathers perfectly and there is a lot of it! The only problem was something happened in shipping and it leaked all over the place, but the product itself is wonderful</li>
    <li> Lathers very nicely the sandlewood is a manly smell and 5 ounces should keep you busy for a while</li>
    <li> One of my favorite creams.  Lather explosion in no time at all!  Love the scent.  Super slick razor glide.  I purchased this one for my father in law to get him away from the dreaded canned goo.</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant and not overpowering nor does it linger too long as others have said. I like the consistency which makes it easy to pick up the desired amount on the brush. It looks like it will take quite a long time to use it all. Better lather than the Arko I also tried, although for the price difference quite comparable.</li>
    <li> I really like the manly smell of this product, however after shaving my face is incredibly dry and a bit irritated. Your mileage may vary</li>
    <li> What a great shave using this cream. Great lather and smell. Brings a little joy to a tedious job.</li>
    <li> Love this, it goes on nice and stays moist for a long time. My partners like how it smells :)</li>
    <li> Not only does this work very well.  It lasts a very, very, very long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of shaving creams and soaps for use with regular shaving razors and straight razors and this is the best stuff i have ever used. its a winner.</li>
    <li> It makes a very good lather, but the fragrance is a lot like a soap smell.  However, it is a nice shave overall due to the rich lather,</li>
    <li> Use it daily to shave. Nice smell and feel. Love it.</li>
    <li> Ok, gut don&#x27;t think I would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought a host of shaving accessories when I recently made the great leap backward to old school safety razor shaving.  (I grew tired of adding my used 5-blade, expensive, disposable blades to the local landfill.)  This cream smells good and works well.  I use it sparingly on special occasions in place of my everyday shaving soap...</li>
    <li> I recently began shaving with a safety razor after years of the disposable...OMG!!  Why did I wait so long?  I purchased this cream based on the reviews and boy I tell you, its awesome! 300+ reviews of 4+ stars can&#x27;t be wrong. If you are one of the folks out there who usually side with the majority when it comes to reviews on Amazon for any product you buy...then you will not go wrong in purchasing this cream. It smells great, lathers rich and thick and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and supple. I had to experiment with how much to put on my brush because Im a newbie, but after about 5 shaves, I got the perfect amount in the bristles. I usually take my badger hair brush and circle it twice around the cup while applying ever so gentle pressure. I then take an old small cereal bowl (why not? It works lol) and I add about a tablespoon of hot water to it, then I swirl rigorously until the lather builds up...you can certainly adjust as needed. I then wet my face and brush on. Ive been shaving like this for several months now, with a shave every two days and it will be time to repurchase in about a month. That should give you an idea of how much I go through. I am not grizzly Adams but I do get a decent scruff going at day two. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this product.  It lathers beautifully and has a wonderful, light scent.</li>
    <li> The cream gives a very smooth shave and the lather is wonderful. It is very creamy and thick and I need a very small amount for my daily shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scent is very over-powering and very old-fashioned. It is the only negative thing about the product but the scent is a key part of any shaving cream and I will never use this particular cream again ONLY because of  the smell</li>
    <li> Best ever. Contrary to what other buyers complain about, my product has never been &amp;#34;fingered&amp;#34; in any way. I have purchased this item MANY times through the same seller and the product is filled nearly to the top and unfingered! This is also sandalwood scent, not &amp;#34;old creepy men&amp;#34; fragrance as one reviewer claimed. If this were &amp;#34;old creepy men&amp;#34; scented shave cream it would smell of stale cigars and moth balls with a hint of Brut aftershave. This product has MUCH better fragrance than &amp;#34;creepy old men&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Just the touch of fragrance that makes it special.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, makes nice thick lather.  All good</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street is THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased Proraso in the past and that blew Van Der Hagen Premium out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToOBS absolutely blows Proraso out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see what I&#x27;m getting at here.  Among all the other soaps (all pretty much the same price) the ToOBS is the best shaving soap in the world.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and yes it is expensive, but you don&#x27;t need a lot and it lasts a long time. I shave 3-4 times a week and have been using this for 4 months and have more than half the tub left. I also bought the aftershave that complements it very well.</li>
    <li> I got this after seeing rave reviews for it on StraightRazorPlace.com. I have used Proraso and Gentleman Bill&#x27;s soaps before since my adventure into straight razor shaving began, and was satisfied with both. Seeing that this one was a cream not a soap, I didn&#x27;t know quite what to expect. I shaved using it yesterday and fell in love. The lather is thick and luxurious compared to my soaps. I think I found my new favorite. I am concerned if it will not last as long as my soaps (my Proraso is not even halfway gone and I&#x27;ve had it for over 4 months now). If anyone could let me know about how long this tub will last me, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. Anyway, the quality of this stuff is amazing, and I will definitely purchasing it from now on!</li>
    <li> A close 2nd is Proraso (green, blue or red). The green is my favorite, but all three are good. Taylor of Old Bond Street is a thicker lather, therefore, I use more water when mixing, than I do with the Proraso. Both are great, if you&#x27;re looking for variety. And, if you travel, the Proraso will get through airport security with your carry on bags. TOBS is a richer lather.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but smells strongly of old men. This product is not for young guys!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Works into a smooth lather. A little goes a long way. This tub will last several months of regular shaving.</li>
    <li> This is sooooo good!!!! Made shaving a sensation. I can not come up with twelve more words. so so lonf.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream, protects your face while shaving and moisturizes.  It would&#x27;ve been nice if I had known that the small little can of shaving cream was in a shipping box the size of a refrigerator.  There was so much packing paper in the box, I almost threw away the little can of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice job packing Amazon!</li>
    <li> Fairly expensive as far as shave soap goes.  It also doesn&#x27;t last very long for the price.  If you like it and money isn&#x27;t an issue then it&#x27;s a great product.  If you want to stretch your dollar a bit more however I would look to other options because there are many shave soaps that last much longer and cost less.</li>
    <li> Scent was a tad strong for me. Made me very nauseous I end up mixing it with regular shaving cream to dull the scent, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference. Everything else about it was great.</li>
    <li> I love when my husband uses this to shave, he smells all old fashioned....fantastic.</li>
    <li> Cool container.  Lathers well and has a pretty strong smell when applying.  Residual odor is nice but not overpowering.  Works well with the other products (shave oil, and aftershave).  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This was my first introduction to Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) products. Some reviewers complained about the smell of this product, but both my girlfriend and I like the smell. This is my first experience with a true shaving cream (besides from a can), but I did notice it&#x27;s slightly quicker to make a lather with this than with shaving soaps. I have sense bought a sample pack of 13 TOBS shaving creams (sample pack not sold by Amazon) and will be buying more different scents of the 150g tubs.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! It lathers really well and works great. The only issue I have is that the sandalwood seems to burn a little when it&#x27;s on my face. I think next time I will go with the sensitive skin version.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer. A little of this goes a long way and it moisturizes just like barber shop shaving cream. The sandalwood scent is also excellent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for every single shave I&#x27;ve had for 5 years straight. I still don&#x27;t believe I ever need to change. The smell is manly, distinct, and wonderful and my lady friend loves it. The consistency is perfect and lathers really well with my badger hair brush. I&#x27;m not one to use a bowl to lather, I just take care of that right on my face. This stuff is malleable enough to lather up easily without a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is full and hydrating and my safety razor glides effortlessly over it. To this day I&#x27;m still surprised but just how little I need to do the job. &amp;#34;Just a dab will do ya&amp;#34; really holds up with this product. I shave two to three times a week and I can make one jar of this product last for nearly a year if I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget whatever else you&#x27;re using and switch to this. It&#x27;ll make choosing a shaving cream a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> OMG. I shaved off my beard just so I could luxuriate in the smell of this shaving cream. I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood products.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend so much on shaving cream and a badger brush when I typically just rub a bar of soap on my face. Smells manly and whips up a nice lather. Makes a great gift!  For more gift ideas visit: http://bestpurchaseever.com/him/</li>
    <li> It deeply saddens me to know I&#x27;ve went so many years oblivious of this product&#x27;s existence. Blows regular shave gel/cream out of the water and leaves a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> The quality of shave with this is top notch - if you can get past the smell. I have memories of sandalwood incense as a child, and this isn&#x27;t it. The smell is very strong to me - kids thought I had been painting something a half hour after I had finished. Would give some guys a headache. Great shave, lather holds in there just fine with little product. Five stars for quality of shave - 0 stars for smell.</li>
    <li> Great smell and a small dab goes very far and lathers up quickly.</li>
    <li> Wow, I ordered not knowing exactly what Sandalwood scent would smell like.  I purchased based on all the glowing reviews.  For those that don&#x27;t what this stuff smell like let me try to capture it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when you were 7 or 10 years old?  Remember when you would walk into Grandpa&#x27;s bathroom or he would give you a hug?  Well I do.  And simply put this stuff smells like &amp;#34;Old Man&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be just my personal opinion but I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  The moment I opened it I my mind went back to those days.  Here&#x27;s the kicker, not making this up.....after shaving with it the first day I got it my 6 year old and I were wrestling around and he said, &amp;#34;Dad, you smell like Grandpa Dave&amp;#34;.  That was it for me.  Packaged it back up and returned it that afternoon.  I&#x27;ll be ordering the coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like to smell like &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; go ahead and order.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of old-fashioned class, I highly recommend adding this shaving cream to your shave setup.  Lathers richly, softly lubricates the face, I LOVE the aroma, rich, pleasant and subtle... My girl likes the scent even more!!</li>
    <li> Still on the same container, I usually use just enough to cover my neck and face. Smells great!</li>
    <li> The Sandalwood shave cream is a great deal. This tub will last you a long time, and it&#x27;s a quality soap. Personally, I didn&#x27;t find the scent overwhelming, and I definitely enjoy the lather from this shaving cream. Not a huge selling point, but I enjoy the look of this tub, too. I keep it on my counter next to my razor and brush stand, and it replaces the need for my oak shave bowl, and looks nice next to everything else.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl has a semi-strong secnt while I am using it, but it does subside some after about an hour or so.</li>
    <li> While this stuff IS more expensive that the $2 can of foam or gel; there is a reason why.  Along with a shaving brush and quality razor, good shaving cream is a must in my book.  Immediately upon my first use I could tell the difference on my skin.  Don&#x27;t underestimate the power of those UN-pronounceable chemicals in the cheap stuff to wreak  havoc on tender face skin.  It&#x27;s hard to say for certain how long I&#x27;ll be able to afford this quality cream, but I look forward to shaving more with this stuff.</li>
    <li> This cream produces a good quality lather, and leaves you smelling like a  man who knows what women want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rambo</li>
    <li> Not much more to say about Taylor of Bond Street (or TOBS to the wet-shaving world). The TOBS products find their way to the top of most every list when comparing products for different companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great shave cream (I use the Sandalwood) that leaves a pleasant, yet never overpowering scent. You can&#x27;t go wrong with TOBS!</li>
    <li> Smells great. I only use about a pea size bead to shave my entire face. It can also be added to a soap lather dor the best of both. Smells great. Worth the price up front....ends up less expensive that buying cans.</li>
    <li> PERFORMANCE -&lt;br /&gt;Practically speaking, this cream (No, it is NOT a solid soap) performs extremely well. I took my dry badger and dabbed it into the cream, just barely covered the bottom surface of my shaving mug with some hot water and whipped up a VERY impressive lather in just a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied, the lather lasts very well throughout the shave without drying up and requiring another application like that &amp;#34;Conk&amp;#34; fella... After the shave, my skin felt great and I noticed several hours later that my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry like it often does after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL -&lt;br /&gt;OK, I get it, some of you do / will love this stuff... But I too have spent years in a Barber Shop....That old Barber Shop smell is one of my favorites. THIS IS NOT IT.  It might be worthy of note that I would have given this a perfect score had it not been for the scent. This is my first shot at the &amp;#34;Sandalwood&amp;#34; scent and I have to tell you, I was NOT impressed. The first thought that hit my mind when the scent hit me was, &amp;#34;Sandalwood?? This just smells like really strong soap!! Soap like Grandma used!! Great!! Now I&#x27;ve spent fifteen bucks on something that makes me smell like my Grandmother!!!..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I DID spend the money, I gave it a shot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONCLUSION - I gave it 4 stars because I was truly impressed with it&#x27;s performance. Based on performance alone, I highly recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street. However, I personally will NOT buy the sandalwood scent from Taylor&#x27;s again. Perhaps Almond?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!!</li>
    <li> It works as expected; however, if you&#x27;re interested in smelling like an old lady all day long, then this product is definitely for you.  It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like sandalwood.  After just one use, my wife and daughter couldn&#x27;t even stand to be near me until I had taken another shower - even after scrubbing the scent still lingered a bit.</li>
    <li> This was only the second shaving cream that I&#x27;ve used with my new badger brush and DE razor shaving experiment.  The cream performed fine, making a nice lather in the bowl with the badger brush after about 30-45 seconds of effort and provided a nice shaving experience as well.  I thought the scent was OK, but after my wife saying that I smelled like her grandmother, I decided the scent was a little too \\&quot;old school\\&quot; for my taste.  I&#x27;m sticking with the Proraso for now.</li>
    <li> I love the aroma of this shaving cream. I prefer the brush on kind like this as it lasts a long time and makes my beard stand up better and is softer to shave. It really works well. I&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is awesome, it smells so good. After I shave a very small smell (only for a few minutes) of the shaving cream stays on me. And it is great to smell. Girlfriend loves the smell, my bathroom smells great after it. Pure nose pleasure, your body will enjoy shaving with this. Overall as a cream which is its true intention it does a great job, it lathers well and makes shaving a breeze. If you have a badger brush this thing will do wonders with your face</li>
    <li> My favorite shave cream so far, the $15 cost is commensurate with its performance.  Even a boar bristle brush lathers with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> Returning to &#x27;old style&#x27;, conventional straight-edge shaving with badger-hair brush, and shaving lather, I can&#x27;t remember when shaving has been such an enjoyable experience as opposed to a daily chore. Rich lather, clean, fresh  scent and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately 5 years now and have no complaints.  It has a nice, clean smell and goes on quite well with a badger brush.  In addition, the small amount you need for a sufficient lather will extend the life of this package for up to 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great product just as described and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream, which you can probably guess based on all the reviews.  The smell is not overwhelming to me but if anything bothers someone, you might find it to strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip I learned through trial and error.  I started just putting a gob of the stuff directly onto my brush and doing a face lather.  Then I just got a stoneware mug out of the cabinet so I could spin up a lather better.  In both cases the cream turns into plaster and clogs up my razor really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add a liberal amount of water to the cream while lathering it up in your mug to help alleviate that issue and you&#x27;ll love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Works amazing for sensitive skin, smells AMAZING. Boyfriend and I are both happy campers.</li>
    <li> WAY too strong Sandlewood. Smells like strong cologne for men. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few of these and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the consistency is supposed to be.  One came thick and a little dry, another came wet and sticky.  Either way, it&#x27;s great shaving cream.  Use with a brush on a wet face.  Get a safety razor and save lots of money.  Smell like a man.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very creamy.  I thought it was going to be a solid soap-type cream you have to froth up, but it&#x27;s more the consistency of mayonnaise. A dime size dab on the brush can work up into a healthy lather.  When I use this, I just stick it in a hole in the brush tip and build the lather directly on my face.  I really like the aroma, though I&#x27;m not sure it smells much like sandalwood.  To be honest, I prefer the Williams mug shaving soap, but I have a mild old-west fetish, plus Williams is dirt cheap; this stuff, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Messy, more complex (screw top lid) than mug soap, expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great feel and aroma, lather is creamy and paints well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Taylor of Old Bond Street has, in my opinion... the best Sandalwood scent! Reminds me of the Ol time barbershop smell. I still love this stuff but the last one I received had scuffs all on the jar... I sent it back and Amazon refunded my money. I reordered and the one I just received 6/11 15 appears used. I&#x27;m not saying it is, but it looks nasty. that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m changing to 3 stars from 5.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream i&#x27;ve used. The smell is great and my fiance likes it</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Good for shaving men&#x27;s faces and women&#x27;s legs!</li>
    <li> I am way too young to smell this old.</li>
    <li> It smells like an old man in a nursing home. Oh my god it&#x27;s awful.</li>
    <li> Smeel to much. It is good product, but I&#x27;m no repeat..</li>
    <li> Really good Shaving cream. the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it truly helps sensitive skin like mine</li>
    <li> Good lather and smell</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel. Is not over powering</li>
    <li> Just started my second tub of this shave cream.  The first lasted more than a year, so I reckon that has saved 4-5 aerosol cans of shave foam and makes it good value.  Good stuff and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Great product, clean, fresh everything is as stated. It takes me back to a simpler time of quality products.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaving cream. If you do your research you will realize the quality, longevity and aroma of this brand are what makes it so highly desirable. Buy it and don&#x27;t think twice.</li>
    <li> Good cream. Great scent. The packaging is not great for shipping. Product leaked slightly when it shifted. Not sure how much I lost but as you can see there is a large hole where product may have been. I think they need to add a seal of some sort.</li>
    <li> I love the smell but product arrived missing a big chunk on the side of it. I saw some others had the same problem with it.. It needs to arrive in better condition.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the product. Did not know how it would be on my sensitive skin but I am pleased. Should last a very long time because not much needed for a shave.</li>
    <li> Now this is some good smelling nice shaving cream. Gives a great shave and the remaining scent has prompted my wife to comment and then other things....no better endorsement than that. Get this stuff guys.</li>
    <li> I personally couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of this shaving cream.  I got sandalwood expecting a wood smell like oak or cedar. Perhaps I don&#x27;t know what sandalwood smells like or perhaps I got a bad batch (which seems to happen every so often reading other poor reviews).  However, this smells like cheap bar soap to me.  As such I am not using it.  I have gotten a sampler pack for 12 different Taylor of old bond creams. Once that arrives and I try a few I shall update this review with what I find.    Also, to be fair, the shaving cream itself is very nice.. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all (but it did irritate my nose) and it has a very nice lather with solid protection.      Update. 12/22/14 I got a sampler pack of 12 shaving creams from Taylor of old bond St.  Sadly sandalwood smells identical in the sample as it does in my large jar so I will keep my rating at two stars.  However there were a few that are good.  I really like the almond, St Jermyn and Mr. Taylor versions.  I would give this shaving cream a solid five stars for either of those three.  I guess I&#x27;m just not a fan of sandalwood</li>
    <li> Sandalwood smell is excellent, not well known by people.  Clean scent.  Goes on well and rinses off cleanly.  Helps for a great, close shave.  Been using if for about a year now and keep buying it.  Pairs well with the Escali stand and brush</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for the first time a few months ago and I enjoyed it so much that I recently ordered a second bowl. This shave cream has a nice scent, lathers easily, stays slick and moist during the shave, and provides some of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had with a variety of different razors and blades. Simply a great product at a great price and I will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> get just a good a shave with can, if not better. I know the purists out there will frown on me but I can honestly say I get no better results using this with my badger brush vs my Brut Tri Guard shaving foam from a can.&lt;br /&gt;This is neat to use, feels old school but it takes more time and prep vs the can. I just use this on weekends now to use it up but workday mornings I use the Brut foam, saves me time and get a great shave from it. I also tend to get less nicks and cuts with the canned foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does work though and smells great and gives you that old school feeling of shaving which I can not replicate with a can. I use an Edwin Jagger DE razor when using this and my Brut foam.</li>
    <li> I am a man, I shave, when I shave with this I smell like a man.</li>
    <li> Smells great lasts awhile.  Good buy</li>
    <li> Nice lather, great scent, and most importantly, a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This sandalwood shaving cream contains a strong long-lasting scent -- almost too-strong and too-long lasting.  If you like the scent, it is  a good shaving cream, but everyone around you will know you used it -- for several hours.</li>
    <li> Smells great. If your a man you need to shave your face with this.. A little goes a long way. I use my badger brush and froth it up. Shave my neck and leave my beard. This beats shaving cream cans and tubes hands down. What are you waiting for already!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best shaving cream hands down. A little pricey but will last months.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, so I cannot evaluate it. If I receive comments, I will post them.</li>
    <li> If you are starting to shave like a real man (DE Razor), this s a real man&#x27;s shaving cream. It gives off a very gentlemanly odour and makes you smell like a real man. Not like someone who bathed in axe body spray.</li>
    <li> I really liked shaving with this until I found out it contains Triethanolamine (skin toxin, carcinogen). This is a product that uses 200+ years of heritage as a selling point.  Steer clear-- go to the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; version of this or something like Proraso which removed the toxins from its formulation.</li>
    <li> I really like that this comes in a bowl with a tight fitting lid.  Makes it easier to toss in a bag if your on the go.  Lathers up really well, and smells great.  The smell is strong while shaving, but its much lighter and lingers just enough throughout the day to be just the right amount of noticeable.</li>
    <li> Scent a little to strong for my taste</li>
    <li> The sandalwood makes for a refreshing moment while performing the chores of cleaning up one&#x27;s whiskers.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product that I will be buying more of.  Just a slight touch of the shaving brush to the cream and you can work up all the shaving lather you need.</li>
    <li> foams well, strong scent</li>
    <li> It must have been last August when I tried a sample of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my order it&#x27;s been one of my personal favorites, and I would say a must have for any wet shaver be it straight blade or a DE safety razor whose looking for an exceptional shave experiance.I first chose, with some trepidation the rose scent.I thought I might end up smelling like someone&#x27;s great granny - or worse, a funeral parlor all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in reading about the product itself as well as the scent both date back to 1850&#x27;s. For any product to last that long I surmised it just had to be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the scent is delicious. A little strong at first but not overpowering or cloying - fresh and fragrant.It lingers for a while but fades quickly and if there&#x27;s anything to this aroma therapy business - it&#x27;s abundantly clear in how relaxing the rose scent is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how heavy this little tub of shave cream was, it&#x27;s the densest shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s so incredibly lush and thick you only need a tiny bit (the size of a small almond) to produce a great volume of lather.There&#x27;s nothing &#x27;soapy\\&quot; about the cream and it glides over your face with ease - I use a shaving brush to work up a lather and find just using this tiny bit is more than enough for two full latherings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream provides a drag and nick free shave. It softens the whiskers so much that the blade has no trouble making mincemeat out of them. Afterwards your skin feels refreshed and supple without any dryness whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street is one of those little luxuries I think anyone would enjoy.</li>
    <li> I like the texture but the fragrance is to strong and not as masculine as I&#x27;d like.  Its soft and I have to be cautious to not put to much on my brush...I rather see it firm than creamy like it is.</li>
    <li> Just a small bit of this stuff(marble size maybe a wee bit more) on a wet brush will build enough lather for me to make two passes, do a touch up and still have enough lather left to shampoo my chin whiskers. While the TOBS Lavender lathers great as well I prefer the sandlewood scent. I will not be without of tub of this stuff in my shaving arsenal.</li>
    <li> very good! I would return to buy</li>
    <li> Good quality shaving soap, good lather, excellent lubricity.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product trying to save some money.  I previously used and have gone back to using Geo F Trumper products.  This smell was not one that I could get used to.  I preferred the Trumper Coconut OIl shaving cream.  The shaving cream worked fine, but the fragrance and overall quality of the Geo F Trumper is what sent me back.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong the shaving cream performed nicely I just like the other stuff better.</li>
    <li> I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I&#x27;m getting a much closer shave than with Gillette Foamy or any other aerosol can shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I think it&#x27;s mostly because of the oil...the aerosol foams seem to provide much less lubrication.  I use a Schick Xtreme 3 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bathroom smells really nice for hours after I shave. I just wish the scent would last that long on me. It&#x27;s a masculine &#x27;clean&#x27; fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am learning that less is sufficient. The stuff is frankly expensive and at first, I found myself rinsing way too much leftover lather out of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidently, I bought a cheap Van Der Hagen $6.49 boar brush [...] at Harmon and so far I like it fine.  Maybe someday I&#x27;ll spring for a more expensive one but for now I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Use that stuff all the time as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, smooth shave and what a great scent.  Those guys in London do it right.  Use it with a good super badger shaving brush for an even more amazing experience.</li>
    <li> Burned the actors face when applied. caused a rash.</li>
    <li> You get a very close, clean, &amp; comfortable shave. The smell has a very clean, &amp; masculine scent. I&#x27;ve tried all of the shaving creams, gels, &amp; several other shaving lathers, &amp; nothing comes close to this. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 years. Each tub of this product lasts me over a year. When I used the gels or shave cream in the cans, I would go through 1 every 2 months or so. This is much more economical. I get a better shave because it lathers much better, and I feel using a shaving brush helps to get the beard more moisturized &amp; to stand out better. Once you try this you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> Awesome sent,easy lather! Only use a finger tip full each time and get 3 passes easy out of it! I use a very little warm water in my bowl with a pre soaked brush and love the lather!</li>
    <li> The quality of shaving with the cream is superb.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite soap. Did not lather as well as others I have used.</li>
    <li> Great smell, fantastically thick lather.</li>
    <li> The scent is understated. Some may perhaps find the scent a tad exotic - hence the &#x27;strong&#x27; moniker. Each man to his taste. Listen to what the ladies are saying. That&#x27;s all that matters in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usability and shaving experience - tops. Amazing, how little goes a long way. It dries rather quickly on your face - so lather up one side and finish shaving and then lather up the other side. I am a changed man since I dumped my 5 blade disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, gf loves the smell. Lather up very well and makes a good smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I am old school guy and love the quality of this product</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Makes huge amounts of lather! Keeps my skin from breaking out. Is easy to clean out of my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to my friends who are shopping for shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Good purchase and glad I found something like this online. Is convenient  to get it. Works nicely and lathers to please my husbands expectations.</li>
    <li> Some people think this scent is too &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; but I personally like the sandalwood smell and my wife thinks it smell delightful! Nice lather as well</li>
    <li> I like the smell. My wife has doubts. I may try another shaving cream next time. :) With that said it does the job. I like it. I would recommend watching videos on Youtube on creating a lather with it as I didn&#x27;t realize I need to do so and just applied it directly to my face. Makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> The best for a great shave and the great fragrance lasts all day, I get this for my husband all the time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent and easy to work up a great lather with only a small dab.  The only additional bit of advice I can lend would be to warn fellas who are new to shaving with a straight razor that  you may want to start with shave soap first, as it provides a slightly slicker surface and better glide.  But once you know how to handle the straight edge, this shaving cream is excellent.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a little too industrial but my wife loved the scent! Did not think it smelled like sandalwood though.&lt;br /&gt;Gave a good lather and shave. I was pleased overall. And the amount in the jar will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I liked my Neutrogena shave cream much better.&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s just OK.</li>
    <li> This stuff is thick and covers your face evenly.  The scent is very pleasing and not too strong.  I know there have been other comments about the strenght of the scent but I did not find it so.  A little bit of the soap goes a long way giving you a nice lather to shave.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product about a week ago and it makes a great lather and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> After trying Van der Hagen and Proraso shaving soaps I decided to give Taylor of Old Bond Street a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  This soap lathers far better than the other soaps I&#x27;ve used.  I find I can gently rub the tip of my badger hair brush into the soap and pick up a good dab of soap that then lathers up very well in a separate mug with a little water.  Initially I tried to lather the soap in the soap container itself, but this makes for a lather that is way too thick and wastes soap.  A little goes a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the sandalwood scent.  Admittedly, it is hard to convey a product&#x27;s scent in a review, but I do think a prior reviewer was correct when they described it to be much like a dryer sheet smell.  If you like the scent of fresh laundry I think you will like this scent.  To me it smells fresh and clean.  I like how my face feels during and after the shave while using it.  The scent is enduring, and there is no need for aftershave if one uses this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream is more expensive than other shaving creams, but I think if you give it a try you will find it to be worth the added expense.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I get far less razor burns and cuts using it than cheap shaving creams and gels and the scent is wonderful. Also, since you don&#x27;t have to use very much one container lasts quite a while. Really great stuff.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as a gift at christmas - he LOVES it.</li>
    <li> Great smell, smooth and helps produce a great shave.  Lasts a long time.  Spreads easily and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. Very luxurious and long-lasting.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this shaving cream. The lather is easy to achieve with a good brush and the smell is good, but not overwhelming. I&#x27;ve used a few different creams but this is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after going thru 2 soap bars of Col. Conk.  I love this a lot more.  It is very easy to get a real thick lather going.  I comes with a bowl essentially, so you don&#x27;t have to purchase another for the soap bars.  I like the smell of it.  The only negative is that it seems to build up on my razor blades and stick there.  I use a merker DE safety and find it very difficult to get this buildup off withought having to replace the blades every or every other use.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream!  Lathers up well &amp; has a subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this new shaving cream based on the positive reviews but after my first use can only say how disappointed I am.  This product is so heavily scented you&#x27;re going to smell like an old lady at a funeral home.  That&#x27;s the only image that kept popping into my head when I used it.  It&#x27;s so heavily scented it might actually wake the dead.  Buyer beware, unless you want to smell like you&#x27;ve just sampled every item from the perfume section of Macy&#x27;s, I would suggest finding another product to suite your shaving needs.</li>
    <li> Lathers great -- smells great.  I use it with a double-edged razor and ultra-sharp [Feather] blade on my tender face.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My husband is a fan of these hard soap shaving products (whatever is the technically correct word, I don&#x27;t know). I got this for him after he put it on his wishlist. I can&#x27;t discuss how it feels, or ease of shave or pull or whatever. I think he&#x27;d scream if I used it for lady-shaving. But here&#x27;s what I can review: 1- his skin always feels super soft and smooth after a shave. 2- I love the smell of it. It starts a little strong, but good, but it also lingers all day. straight after shaving, I can smell it if i&#x27;m in the same small room. But I get all excited when after a long crappy work day, I get home, and he gets home and I kiss him hello and there&#x27;s a lingering scent that&#x27;s right at his cheek that only I get to smell. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Builds a great lather very easily, feels good and provide good covering and protection of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Package is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I do like sandalwood fragrance, but this particular one is not my favorite. This is just personal preference of course, however, I find the strength of the smell to be a bit overwhelming (hence the 4 stars).&lt;br /&gt;Still smells clean and I will use it integrally with no problem.</li>
    <li> taylor of old bond street sandalwood foamed up well and has a nice cent. I like it a little better than proraso which is also a very&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; good product.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream in the world!!!</li>
</ol>
