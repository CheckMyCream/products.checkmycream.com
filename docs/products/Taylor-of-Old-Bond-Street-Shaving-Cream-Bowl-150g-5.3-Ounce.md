<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fragrance wise I find the grapefruit spot on.  I got a sampler from Maggard Razor and tried nearly every variety of cream TOBS offers.  IMHO, the grapefruit stood out above the rest.  Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t get the best shaves from any of the TOBS formulas.  If you do, give the grapefruit a try.  It smells amazing and works as well as the other varieties.</li>
    <li> I ordered this not really knowing what the Grapefruit Scent would actually smell like or how well the product would perform.  The good news is that it has performed well above &amp; beyond the call of duty.  I love the Grapefruit smell.  It&#x27;s a very pleasant scent, providing you like the smell of grapefruit.  This product also lathers up very nicely.  It really doesn&#x27;t need a lot of cream to achieve this either.  I usually run by wet badger hair brush over the cream about one full swirl or a little more not 4 or 5 swirls like some I&#x27;ve seen in the videos.  I&#x27;ll have more than enough cream to last me thru at least 3 passes.  Usually 2 passes are all I do but I do go back at times with a spot pass in 3 or 4 places that normally are harder to whack off.  I thought the Proraso Green lathered nicely which it does but TOBS can certainly hold it&#x27;s own against it.  The most important result is that it gives me a close, smooth shave...AKA \\&quot;baby butt\\&quot; smooth as they call it.  And I don&#x27;t get the occasional razor burn like I did with the stuff in the cans.  It would appear that our British cousins have a great product.  Another thing is it didn&#x27;t cost as much as some of these others &amp; I can&#x27;t really see how they could perform any better than what I described in regards to TOBS.  Anyway, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  I think Taylor of Old Bond Street has a customer for life.  I&#x27;ve never tried the other products from TOBS, but if the Grapefruit scent is any indication....then I look forward to eventually trying some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is that if you are thinking about purchasing this product, then give it a shot because you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream (TOBS) and I found this product to be very good. The tricky part is learning the difference in making lather with a shaving soap vs a shaving cream. The key is not to use too much water when whipping up the shaving cream. TOBS is not a &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; shaving cream which means all you need to make a good lather is to shake out the excess water in your shaving brush, lightly &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; the brush into the shaving crème then whip it up in your shaving mug/bowl.  You need very little shaving cream to make a lot of lather.  I found the scent was very pleasant (not overpowering) and it was easy to make a good, cushioning lather.  I did not experience any shaving burn or irritation.  I like the container and the fact that it has a removable inner cover. All in all, my first experience with TOBS was excellent.</li>
    <li> I love all of the TOBS creams I have tried.  This scent is no exception - lathers up very nicely indeed, nice and rich, but the smell - THE SMELL - is amazing. Wonderfully fresh citrus notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your face a favor and try TOBS!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty much sums it all up, amazing grapefruit smell, great lather, great even early shipping by the seller. I will be buying a TOBS product again but i suspect it will be hard to beat Grapefruit.</li>
    <li> Best brand of shaving cream ever</li>
    <li> Great soap. Love the lather. Onky need a little bit per shave.</li>
    <li> Refreshing. Lathers easily and provides the basis for a great shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first TOBS product and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Grapefruit smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> It gives you a very close and comfortable shave in one pass.</li>
    <li> Great lather, very cushioning, scent is a nice bitter grapefruit. Makes me want to shave more than once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use AOS pre and post shave and 4x Dsc blade. Daily shaver</li>
    <li> My husband love this shaving cream for straight razor shaving and it last a long time. This grapefruit sent smells good and it&#x27;s not overpowering. I recommend it to anyone willing to try it. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is invigorating and... delicious.  The cream itself is amazingly smooth and lends itself to a close, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff. I usually use soaps, but when I feel the need to switch it up and give my face a bit of pampering, I grab my silvertip and a tub of TOBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grapefruit has an amazing citrus scent that lingers throughout the shave, but won&#x27;t last to interfere with any aftershaves or colognes you might use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG LONG way. almond or less size to get a slick, thick, decadent lather that your blade will LOVE and will protect and cushion your face. Did I mention that I LOVE TOBS?!?!?!</li>
    <li> It works just like a shaving cream should.  Lathers well, nice scent, smooth shave.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything else from a cream.</li>
    <li> Smells great, easy to lather. Bit drying. I went back to art of shaving products.</li>
    <li> If you wetshave, and wish to use a NICE cream or soap, this is a stellar choice. For newbies, or those that want an easy to build lather, that won&#x27;t dissapate in a few minutes, that hydrates and cushions your face from blade very well, this is an awesome choice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d catagorize this as luxury. Every wet shaver Must have one luxury soap or cream in their rotation.  TOBS creams are awesome. The grapefruit citrus scent is very nice, and not to powdery or \\&quot;modelled\\&quot;, like one may expect.  A little bit goes a loooong way.&lt;br /&gt;It likes a soft brush when whipped in a bowl, or on the face, although I prefer the former.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I shave with the door open and the wife catches the scent and comments how she loves the scent.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Luxury\\&quot; because it costs more, lathers better, smells better, and just feels that way.&lt;br /&gt;Its nicer than something basic like proraso. But one can&#x27;t go without proraso.  Its just in a different catagory.  Its certainly nicer than any shave stick, like palmolive or speick, which are basic and very good. But this is a luxurious and refined cream.&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite \\&quot;benchmark\\&quot; soap/cream would be tabac soap. A bit more technique is required to build a lather, which is the \\&quot;slipperiest and cushioniest\\&quot; luxurious of lather.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a staple in my rotation as well. My benchmark. But for me, the fruity scent, and easy/quick lather of Tobs is a great way to go.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to have one ridiculously expensive item in your bathroom, you could do far worse than to make this the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and provides a very slick lather whether you use a brush or your fingers.</li>
    <li> This STRAIGHT UP smells like Grapefruit. I mean there&#x27;s almost nothing else to say beyond that, but I think these reviews have a word limit, so onward. Anyways, yes very citrusy scent. Some like it, some down. It depended on my mood. I bought the sample pack from Maggard Razors and tried all their scents. This was very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And again with all of the Taylor of Bond Street products, it performs great!</li>
    <li> Smells good shaves good.</li>
    <li> Smells SOOOOOO good!  I just love the way this stuff smells.  Close you eyes and you will be sure you are having fresh grapefruit for breakfast!  I love the smell.  I have used TOBS Avocado for years, and am very happy with it, but I love this stuff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is quite intense while shaving, but doesn&#x27;t linger.  In my opinion, that&#x27;s perfect.  I really enjoy it during the shave, but usually don&#x27;t want to walk around all day smelling intensely of grapefruit.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic. Thick cream goes a long way and has nice citrus scent that is not over powering. Just need to keep my wife from using it all...</li>
    <li> This is my first time using real shaving cream.  It lathered up very easily and found the scent to be incredibly intoxicating.  After I shaved with this, my roommate thought I was cutting up grapefruit.</li>
    <li> Great lather, great fragrance (smells like real grapefruit!).</li>
    <li> I surrender.  I bought this product because of the rave reviews it has received.  This is the second time I have purchased  Taylor of Old Bond Street and received one as a gift.  All three are labeled as &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; and range in consistency from a dried out soap product to a lotion.  Grapefruit is one of there newer products so shelf life at the seller should not be a problem but it a &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; cream.  I have been wet shaving for several years and I find that  the $15 I am paying for Taylor of Old Bond Street would be much better spent on The Body Shop Macca Root Cream.  At least its a cream</li>
    <li> The alcohol in the blend seems to be drying my skin.  Otherwise, nice lather, nice aroma.</li>
    <li> As a fan of TOBS Avocado, I anticipated a pleasant shaving cream.  An almond size dollop produced rich, moist, luxurious lather with an understated but refreshing scent.  I would recommend this product without any reservations.</li>
    <li> Grapefruit on steroids!  If that sounds good to you then, this is your shave cream!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shaving cream. Not only is the grapefruit smell incredible, which I was a bit hesitant on since some grapefruit smelling products are way to over powering, but the actual cream itself is great. Nice lather and goes on nicely. Will definitely order again and would love to try some of the other varieties as well.</li>
    <li> Can you say kicks butt!!! Smells so good you can eat it! It has a great lather and can be used for a mans shave or a woman&#x27;s since the scent is so neutrally refreshing! This is the best grapefruit shaving cream there is! I believe this is a cream my husband and I will fight over to use it! It lathers very easily and has great cushion and glide oh and did I mention the great scent! Any TOBS shaving cream is excellent. It has been one of my favorites since starting to wet shave over a year ago! If you want to know what this really smells like go to your local farmers market and smell you a grapefruit on the stand or better yet buy it and cut it open and inhale! Simply delicious!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Super awesome lather and my wife loves the smell so I love the smell!</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street is great. I use the grapefruits sent in the morning. It smell helps wake you up andthe lather is amazing. Would recomemend it so anyone shaving with any kind of razor.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite cream. The smell of grapefruit is strong, and I love it. The cream is a lot easier to lather up with a brush and bowl than the harder soaps, and it gives a slick lather that helps prevent nicks. I will be reordering this as soon as I get low.</li>
    <li> I love the scent from this TOBS. I don&#x27;t even normally care for grapefruit but the scent is pretty good from the fruit, the smell from this shaving cream is fantastic. The main scent is obviously grapefruit but there are also undertones of some other things I can&#x27;t quite page my finger on. If you like citrus this will be good for you or loved one. It lathers well like all other TOBS I&#x27;ve used and provides a great cushion for shaving. This is an absolute gray cream.</li>
    <li> If you like grapefruit, you will love this shave cream. Just like all the other OTBS shave creams, this one is great. It is very highly scented compared to the other ones that I have tried except maybe rose. The scent will turn some people off but the lather is still excellent. If you don&#x27;t like grapefruit, try one of the other OTBS shave creams.</li>
    <li> Big fan of TOBS and the grapefruit is probably my favorite scent so far. Ive tried a handful of different scents and like this one the best. Fresh and clean, and actually smells like grapefruit/tropical fruit. TOBS makes some of the best wet shaving soap. Read other reviews on TOBS for their quality of product or value, especially the unscented one.</li>
    <li> Wow, this was my first order of this type of shaving cream and to say the least I was blown away, I would suggest adding a few drops of water to your lather bowl and apply the cream to the tip of the brush(dime sized works for me for a single pass) it lathers in seconds and the scent is great, and is awesome in the morning because the grapefruit scent wakes you up and make you feel super fresh. I do not know if I want to risk trying another scent because this one is so good.</li>
    <li> Husband likes the texture and I love the smell.  Not overpowering and only those that get up close can smell it.  Great for price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this fragrance.  But it does give a nice lather like the other TOBS products.  I still prefer sandalwood and coconut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m adding to this review because my recent experience has been phenomenal.  I LOVE this cream, but include it in a regular rotation of Taylor shave creams; the time had come to move along to the Eton College cream when I began what I thought would be the last few days of shaving with grapefruit.  It has taken me TWO WEEKS to finish the tub.  Even the slightest residue of cream lathered beautifully. If you like a citrus scent, this is the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fifth variety of shaving cream I have ordered from Taylor of Bond Street.  Each one has been great in its own way.  I always keep a tub of Eton College as it is the standard by which all others are measured, but, looking for a hint of citrus, I ordered the Grapefruit, not really thinking it would work as well as the other scents.  It&#x27;s equally as effective as the others with a very nice &amp;quot;zest&amp;quot;.  In fact, I often choose not to use aftershave because I like the scent so much.  In addition, the bathroom smells fantastic all day long.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers easily, but my razor doesn&#x27;t glide over my face as slippery as I&#x27;d prefer.  I tend to get a little more skin irritation using this product than when I use Colonel Conk&#x27;s shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Dried up, used cream. You could see finger prints carved into the little cream there was.  Got the wrong scent to top it off.</li>
    <li> works great smells great</li>
    <li> I love how good it lathers up and makes my shaving experience good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face smell good after my shave.</li>
    <li> It makes me happy to shave with this stuff since it&#x27;s just got a fantastic scent! If you love grapefruit, get this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. The cream itself works well with a brush, and it lasts quite a while, though not as long as Proraso.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Reasonably priced and great performance like all the TOBS creams. The grapefruit is my favorite scent of all the TOBS products I think. Its one cream where I actually wish the scent would last longer but that&#x27;s not what they are for. Lathers easy and makes for a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS, to the initiated), is one of the oldest (since 1854) and most respected gentlemen&#x27;s shaving and skin products company in the world. This is my third TOBS shave cream I&#x27;ve used, and they have all been of the highest quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grapefruit scent is apparent immediately, but don&#x27;t let that slow you down. When you have shaved with it and finished, the scent left behind is not of strong Grapefruit, but of a fresh mild scent with a citrus undertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part of TOBS is the way it leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> If you are shaving with a double edge blade and brush, then you are a man who understands a close shave and the economy of doing it well.  Why over pay for expensive blades and foam filled with air.  This Cream is an consistent performer in glide and cushion, typically my benchmark for others.  The price point vs. performance is good.  Smell is great early in the morning.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of grapefruit and the smell of it.  As a kid I worked in the citrus groves and enjoyed much of this fresh fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my nose, this shave cream captures the smell of a marsh seedless grapefruit as if I had just peeled it with my own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this shave cream and highly recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah... and the shave cream itself is of the best quality -- top shelf compared to the other major English brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m knew to wet shaving, but have used other creams like Proraso which is good, and other cheap soap. This is by far my favorite cream! It lathers really good and the smell it out of this world. If your like citrus sent than this is the cream for you, so do yourself a favor and buy this shaving cream!</li>
    <li> This is the best quality shave creme I have used when using a traditional shaving brush and using two or three passes.  I enjoy the scent but prefer their Eton College scent better.  No complaints though.  Incredible lather and the scent is fresh and not overpowering as long as you like the smell of grapefruit.  ENJOY</li>
    <li> I love Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams.  They lather well and provide a nice smooth shave.  They do not dry my skin out either.  I have several different scents.  The grapefruit smells a little strong--great to wake me up in the morning--but quickly dissipates.  Do not let the smell detour you from trying this one, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Lovely, refreshing citrus fragrance, great lather, and a little bit goes a long way. This grapefruit cream is an excellent addition to Taylor&#x27;s impressive lineup of high-end shaving products. You really can&#x27;t go wrong when you choose Taylor.</li>
    <li> It smells so good and refreshing that I wanted to taste it! The lather is excellent (rivals T&amp;H, GFT) and the smell is amazing and refreshing. I wish they made a aftershave balm in this scent! Th only thing I found slightly as a con was that it was a bit irritating on my skin. I use Noxema under it as a pre-shave and that fixed it right up.</li>
    <li> One of my personal favorites. Not too fruity but enough to make it interesting. The amount needed to get a good lather makes this worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I chose five stars on this product because it exceeded my expectations. It lathers just as good as any other TOBS product, very very easy to lather. The scent does not seen synthetic at all. It is a nice crisp and refreshing smell and feels great on my face. I really like the slickness and hydration aspects to this cream. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice summer cream or just a nice shave experience.</li>
    <li> Even if you don&#x27;t like to eat grapefruit, just trust the positive reviews and get this scent! I&#x27;m not a fan of eating grapefruit, but I like the scent...so I trusted the reviews and I, too, am now a big fan.</li>
    <li> New to wet shaving, I have been experimenting with different types of shaving soaps. I must say that the Taylor of Old Street Shaving  soap is simply amazing! I was so eager to use it that the evening it arrived I dropped what I was doing and took a shave. The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> this leaked during shipping, and was a big mess. On top of that, the product had separated, and so it was a little gross. Smelled bad. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my 6 year old daughter because she likes to play with a shaving brush and shave cream in the bathtub!  She loves grapefruit.  So I smelled it when it arrived and it smelled really nice!  I used it for a shave and it performs better than the St James Street shave cream I already use.  The st james street tingles a bit and sometimes leaves me red.  This cream is good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream!</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving cream has always been Taylor and when I found out they came out with grapefruit it was inserted in my cart. The shaving cream did not disappoint and produced a good lather with a nice grapefruit smell.</li>
    <li> The Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams work great for me. I use a safety razor and these creams for shaving and always have a smooth finish with no irritation. I lather the cream in my hand, instead of using a bowl, and it still comes out great.</li>
    <li> An excellent and uniquely scented version of Taylor shaving cream. A must try if you&#x27;re looking for something new or just different.</li>
    <li> Great smell.  A little goes a long way.  Great lather with a boars hair brush.  I have not used this cream with my badger hair, but I assume it would produce the same, at-least similar results.  The citrius smell is great, and the natural ingredients dont bother my skin.  I usually have to use a pre shave oil, but its not needed with this cream.  Taylor of Bond, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found a replacement to my trusty Art of Shaving Lemon Shaving Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used a safety razor for shaving over the past 5 years, I have been occasionally trying new shaving creams.  My go-to shaving creams have always been the AoS creams, but they are quite expensive.  This has just bumped AoS off the go-to list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It has a very pleasant, yet light, grapefruit/citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;2. Lathers as well as, if not better than, AoS creams, using equivalent quantities of each.&lt;br /&gt;3. Very smooth and refreshing on the skin, much like AoS creams.&lt;br /&gt;4. AND, the containers arrive with MORE shaving cream than AoS, for a LOWER price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;After more than a month of use, none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold... indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used the Mr. Taylor cream a couple of time with Ok results and thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot. First, the scent is reminiscent of a cheap citrus cleaner. Second, it wasn&#x27;t very creamy. I had a difficult time getting a good lather and the shaves were pretty rough. I threw this out and bought a tube of Proraso blue for almost half the price and the difference was night and day.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. Ordered for son and son n law for Christmas stocking. Both loved it and will buy more.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave cream. Makes an excellent  lather. Nice grapefruit smell. Sort of expensive, but worth it. Should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;My first TOBS product, but I will probably try another flavor soon. I can see this stuff getting addictive.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, the smell is invigorating, the  shave cream itself is thick and  pretty close to perfect. I love this shave cream, may be the best I have used yet ( of 10). Seems to soften the beard, offers good protection, and fine smell. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Creates a great lather and the scent is very grapefruity. With the realtivly low price everyone should try this scent</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Taylor products.  This one smells nice to me, but is not overwhelming.  I get a very nice, smooth shave.  Don&#x27;t let the price put you off.  5.3 oz last a long time.  A daub about the size of an almond is all I use and get great lather.</li>
    <li> I just cracked open this tub after receiving it today, I was super excited about it and my expectations were so amazingly fulfilled I can&#x27;t even believe it. I just finished shaving and now I&#x27;m sitting here, writing this review, and my face has this gentle smell of citrus and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad someone recommended me this creme, I can&#x27;t even believe how happy it is making me right now.</li>
    <li> My wife started using my TOBS Sandalwood Cream for shaving her legs.  She loved the feel of it and the smoothness of the shave she got.  She just wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent.  She decided to try the grapefruit out, and she is in love with it.  She tells all of her girlfriends about it.  TOBS makes great products, and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> the cream is great............BUT it got here and was a gruel rather than a paste.  If kept in the fridge its fine.  Not that big a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent lather and slickness...  for the price its a great deal</li>
    <li> Rich creamy lather and amazing scent to boot.</li>
    <li> Good cream did not like smell</li>
    <li> I have been using shave soap for quite some time and I bought the shave &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; for travel.  I decided to try it out before hitting the road and much to my surprise, it&#x27;s a better product for me; I am able to get a denser lather and takes less time.  I also find that the lather from the shave cream provides a better shave for me.  I use Proraso &amp;#34;pre-shave&amp;#34; (white label), a Simpson Chubby-1, and a Gillette E-4 &amp;#34;Fatboy&amp;#34; with Bic Blades.  I am a &amp;#34;convert&amp;#34; and now using the shave cream; it is a bit heavier and requires a little more effort to clean out of my shave brush but that&#x27;s a result of the cream being &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; and not due to the scent/fragrance.  I do not find the scent to be any stronger than &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Definitely grapefruit, but as with all TOBS creams, it&#x27;s subtle. Very good lathering, although a bit more drying than some others (in the middle of the scale). Great in warm months.</li>
    <li> Think it had been laying around for a while as it kinda had a dry layer over the top. Underneath that though it was nice and soft. A really good shave cream that lathers well.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I was hesitant due to being a softer compound, but man this stuff is soo smooth and shave soo well!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing also! I will deff be looking for more flavors.</li>
    <li> I love TOBS, its great. I&#x27;ve used the original sandalwood before, and have used it as my main shaving cream for a while. I then tried this Grapefruit scented one, and I have to say its awesome. It&#x27;ll be my new go to from now on.</li>
    <li> The shaving cream had a great, bright smell, and lathers well.  The only thing I could recommend to buyers is to order their product during the fall and winter.  I found in the past when ordering shaving cream like this during hot months that the cream seems to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; and harden a bit, which will dampen the experience.  Since this arrived in January, I had no issues.</li>
    <li> I suppose I could have seen this coming, but the oil from the grapefruit burns my skin a little when I shave. the Eton College scent does not. Additionally, the grapefruit one has kind of a hard consistency, like cold butter, while the Eton College scent is really soft/creamy.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents from ToBS. I have most of their scents and this one I like towards the top. It gives a good shave and has a somewhat lingering scent for a couple of hours. Not overpowering, but pleasant.</li>
    <li> A thirsty cream that lathers well, creates a great slickness and conditions the skin. All while smelling INCREDIBLE!</li>
    <li> smells good. lathers great. will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  The only thing I&#x27;ve found that I can use that leaves my skin soft and smooth with no razor burn!</li>
    <li> Not as nice as the Lavenduer, St. James, Avacodo, Rose, or Sandalwood.  The scent is excellent; however, once you dip your brushes in, it only last for 2 passes.  It does not feel as good for the face as the other products.  Definately not so good on moisturizing properties.  I will say it&#x27;s better than other creams, but in my humble opinion, it lacks the quality of other TOBS products.</li>
    <li> As with all variations, this Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream works wonderfully.  A small amount in a shave bowl or whisked across a brush generates enough thick lather for a multiple pass shave.  The tub lasts a really long time; daily use should get you a few months worth of shaves.  When figured that way it makes the price difference between TOBS and aerosols almost negligible, not to mention that all these TOBS creams are made with noticeably better ingredients.  Shaves are comfortable, regal smelling and enjoyable (when time permits).  The scent is pleasant and complex, with noticeable Grapefruit along with some other citrusy and spicy notes coming through.  If that is your speed, Grapefruit will be right up your alley.  While the Grapefruit scent is not my favorite of the TOBS creams (or favourite since we are discussing a proper British cream), performance is as great as the others.&lt;br /&gt;I give an objective five stars for quality, a subjective four for scent.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! T.O.B.S is always great and easy to use in my experience!  If your wondering about the scent it smells like a freshly cut grapefruit. Tangy but alil sweet. Not to be confused with grapefruit zest or the fake sweet sugary grapefruit of a candy. Very natural imo</li>
    <li> The shaving cream is a fine product, and a little does go a long way.  The grapefruit scent is overly perfumed; however, and you really have to imagine that you are smelling a grapefruit.  I prefer the almond or the lime scents but will continue to try their other scents of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great scent, easy to lather and gives a great shave.  What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Being a fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street, and having used their Mr. Taylor&#x27;s, Eton College, and Avocado creams before, I was excited to try this cream for the first time.  A deep whiff straight out of the tub can be a little overpowering, but the scent is perfect when it counts...whipped into a frenzy with a good, hot brush.  There&#x27;s no artificial scent, just the sweet-and-sour smell of a grapefruit fresh off the tree.  The 5.3oz tub lasts a good long while, if used properly, and the lather it produces is second to none.  It provides a perfect, slick, creamy lather that provides the perfect cushion for shaving.  Paired with a sharp double-edged blade, it dispenses the perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to cream for shaving during the summer, and I generally fall back on Mr. Taylor&#x27;s or Eton College during the winter.  For the menthol fiends, a dab or two of C.O. Bigelow will perk it up and give you that icy feel you want so bad.</li>
    <li> I enjoy all of the Taylor of Old Bond shaving creams, but they tend to get used quickly compared to other brands.  This particular fragrance, grapefruit, is probably my least favorite of the three I have tried.</li>
    <li> It smells really synthetic. So bad that I may not use the rest of the container. Works fine for shaving, but I like the TOBS coconut better. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really care for this.  It&#x27;s very soft and there really isn&#x27;t much in the package.  The smell is ok.  I don&#x27;t like perfumery smells so this works along that line.  It&#x27;s not my favorite but it&#x27;s really a matter of taste.</li>
    <li> Very creamy, easy to mix thin or whip up a thick lather, smells wonderfully refreshing.  Recommended for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of traditional (non-aerosol) shaving creams, and Taylor of Old Bond Street has worked the best for me.  Compared to all of the other traditional shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried (and there have been MANY), TOBS edges them out in every category.  The selling points for me were scent, lubrication, and lathering.  The grapefruit scent is great, and only slightly soapy.  This shaves well even without a shave oil, so lubrication is unmatched.  Biggest plus for this is that a little goes a long way.  You only need maybe a dime-sized bit, and it will give you enough lather for AT LEAST two passes.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My favorite Taylor of Old Bond Street cream is the Almond, but the Grapefruit is a very close second.  If you&#x27;re only going to have one cream, then Taylor of Old Bond Street is the one to get.  It just works great, makes a rich, thick lather, and most of them smell good enough to eat.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few different T of OB creams. They are all 5 star. It comes down to personal preference but all the scents are subtle, any are acceptable. I have used Sandalwood, Eaton College, Rose, and Citrus. Satisfied with all of them.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this stuff and it works pretty well, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to completely lather the face as I can still see skin under the whiteness... Will be trying a new brand after this is finished.</li>
    <li> I think the cream smells lovely and my husband really likes the scent too. We&#x27;re both fans of the avocado so this choice was a bit different than what we&#x27;re used to. My husband has yet to use it. However, I have used it on my legs (Shhh!) and it worked great. And smelled even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other products and I can&#x27;t stop raving about them.  They have a ton of different scents!  Try them all!</li>
    <li> This cream smells fantastic and does the job very well.</li>
    <li> This product works great with the antique, comb-type safety razor I have. Unlike shaving soap, I can apply this cream to my whole beard area and it is still holding from one end to another by the time I&#x27;m done. And I love the smell!</li>
    <li> The Pros:  Great tropical scent; another high-quality cream from TOBS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: This cream didn&#x27;t work well on my sensitive skin.  After one pass I found it would generally make my skin hot (like razor burn).  Tried it with several different razors and blades, but ultimately gave it away as it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I had a similar reaction to the TOBS Almond cream.  The cream also seemed to be a bit finicky about lathering well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of brands of shaving cream, but of those I&#x27;ve tried, TOBS has the best combination of shaving performance, aroma and price. While this has a pleasing aroma, and is nice for an occasional change of pace, my two favorites are still avocado and sandlewood</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving. I have tried a number of shaving creams, and I think that I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one. I have also used the Old Bond Street Lavender shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells amazing, a great way to wake up in the morning with a close shave.  Lathers well and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good fresh smell, great lather; quality product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells great, it lathers well, and shaves even better. The only complaint that I have is the duration of the container size. I used my first tub within 45 days of daily use. It feels like you use a little bit more of this type of shaving cream than you might with a traditional shaving cream. That being said, I will continue to purchase Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream for years to come.</li>
    <li> My first reaction to this shave cream was what a powerful grapefruit smell...really smells like a grapefruit but the ingredients are under the Parfum category and I find the smell is a little too pervasive for me...not so much on your face - it fades away - but on my silvertip brush...I have shaved twice with my usual almond scented (from real extract) Taylor cream since I used the &#x27;grapefruit&#x27; and my brush still smells like a grapefruit!  The cream and shave quality is the same quality as my other Taylor cream but man, that smell needs to go away.</li>
    <li> The lather is slick and thick. The aroma is citrus but never overpowering.  This and the sandlewood have been terrific.</li>
    <li> I have used most of the different shave creams from TOB and they are all awesome, this one is no different.  It does smell like grapefruit, which is a little strange at first, but I&#x27;ve found it to be a very pleasant scent to wake up with.</li>
    <li> Works like it should &amp; smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh, clean scent of this cream. Like all TOBS creams, it lathers quickly and provides a nice, protective coating.</li>
    <li> Descent smell and lather, comforting on the blade good to have around better than some other Taylor dung , this one doesn&#x27;t have toxins in it up the wazoo!</li>
    <li> Got this for the hubby to try as a summer shaving cream since it has a citrus scent. He likes it. Good consistency as the unscented one &amp; he actually likes the light smell even though he&#x27;s usually pretty picky about fragrances. Great brand. Definitely makes shaving so much easier &amp; more enjoyable!</li>
    <li> Since my first foray with cream-in-a-tub products with a purchase of Crabtree and Evelyn, I have been hooked. The stores all closed up near me, so I tried Art of Shaving which is very good but a bit pricey. This is almost half the price and quality wise is very close to C&amp;E or AofS quality.</li>
    <li> I love the grapefruit smell of this cream. TOBS is also is a great cream. Nice lather and protection. Has a great white color and smooth on the face.</li>
    <li> This is the best all around shaving cream I&#x27;ve found. It gives really smooth lather while being forgiving on water volume. It smells nice, but the odor washes away so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with my aftershave. This is my go to cream for when I stumble out of bed and have to shave half asleep before work.</li>
    <li> Great smell! Lathers well.</li>
    <li> ooh la la...this stuff smells so good. For any of you guys that still shave with that horrible foam that smell like speedstick, stop it now! Your face will thank you and your significant other may accost you before work, you have been warned.</li>
    <li> Strange smell but great. Glide.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shaving product, great scent!</li>
    <li> Least favorite tobs scent but good for early mornings! The smell of REAL fresh grapefruit wakes ya up! Lathers beautifully! Likes A little more water I find for my face anyway...</li>
    <li> The scent is pleasant and it lathers really well. It is a high quality product. You only need a little amount each time you use it and so it lasts a good several months (at least).  I&#x27;m never going to go back to Gillette products again!</li>
    <li> Smells great I love TOBS</li>
    <li> Like all TOBS creams, this one does a great job - good protection and cushion. The smell is pretty accurate and good for the summer. If you look around online, you can find sample sized kits to check out the different fragrances. You can&#x27;t go wrong with TOBS.</li>
    <li> As someone who used shave soaps for the longest time, I was surprised at how much easier it is to lather using a cream. This thing gives a LOT of creamy lather that stays nice and foamy for over three passes from just a tiny bit of cream. The scent is pretty great too, and my face feels super smooth after shaving with it. If you&#x27;ve never used a shaving cream before, definitely try this out over soaps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting addicted to the scent.  Though sometimes it seems to dry my skin.  All and all, I&#x27;m very happy that I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it when I smell like grapefruit now.  I&#x27;m amazed at how little I need for a good lather and my shaves could not get better! I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run in in a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream for the past 10 years and this one is my favorite of all the scents.  Their products are great, and although they&#x27;re a bit on the expensive side, I think it&#x27;s worth it.  Make sure you use a shaving brush and not your fingers, as you&#x27;ll get a much better lather and shave.  It will also last a lot longer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaving soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has an amazing grapefruit smell to it, I can still smell it on my goatee after a nice fresh amazing shave. I love citrus smells in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready and this will actually make me look forward to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold.  I have used &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Kiehls,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Shisedo,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Hermes&amp;#34; shaving creams et-cetera, this by far is the best I have tried, and not at all expensive, and not gloppy it holds its shape and stays on the face to make it easier to shave.  Will never use another product again, and this smells incredibly great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shave creams out there and have stuck with TOBS.  I like the texture and love the different scents.  I have different scents for different seasons.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> The cream itself works great. I tried this scent because my wife enjoys citrus notes. However, I will just stick to fresh scents like St James Collection or Jermyn Street.</li>
    <li> The TOBS Grapefruit Shaving Cream is fantastic.  It smells great, lathers really well, and feels good on the face.  This is a great shaving cream, and one I will definitely be ordering more of.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, and a very nice product. The TOBS was a very nice summer scent, and again. Fast shipment over the summer. No shaving cream issues with summer heat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great shaves with all TOBS creams.  The grapefruit version has a wonderful, refreshing citrus smell.  I look forward to using this cream on hot summer days.  It&#x27;s easy to lather and gives your razor a nice, slick cushion to ride on while you shave.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Love Taylor of Old Bond!! This is my husband&#x27;s new fragrance favorite!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  Smells just like grapefruit, but the individuals at Taylor of Old Bond Street were smart and added other fragrances (orange, floral, and \\&quot;crisp green\\&quot; notes) to bolster the scent.  Without those notes it would be a pretty simple scent.  The resulting fragrance is a wonderful, zesty, invigorating scent, that just like the fruit will pop your eyes open as you lather it up in your mug or on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lathers up super rich, as one would expect from Taylor of Old Bond Street.  A little goes a long way, and a small dollop will provide enough thick delicious-smelling cushion for at least 5 passes, with each pass getting better and better if lathered up correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like all of their products, for a relatively cheap price you get a LOT of quality and a tub of cream that will last a very long time, even if you use it every day.  And it will leave your skin moisturized and baby butt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dump the can of chemical foam and the expensive 5-blade monstrosities.  Get yourself a proper blade, a best-badger brush, and some of this stuff, and you&#x27;ll be so moved that you&#x27;ll come back here to click on the button that says this review was helpful :)</li>
    <li> Had previously enjoyed ToOBS&#x27;s Sandalwood cream, which is very nice. Then there&#x27;s this stuff - lathers up very nicely indeed, nice and rich, but the smell - THE SMELL - is amazing. Wonderfully fresh citrus notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quite possibly the nicest thing you could do to your face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and great cushioning. Whips up a great foam with a tiny amount of cream. Will last a long time.</li>
