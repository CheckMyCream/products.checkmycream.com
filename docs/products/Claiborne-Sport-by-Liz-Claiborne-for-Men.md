      <li>Perfect cologne for day or night use - ladies seem to really like it.  </li>
      <li>To be honest I bought this accidentally thinking it was a scent a friend told me about.</li>
      <li>Claiborne Sport is a good cologne, but like Claiborne Curve, the smell may be a bit overwhelming.</li>

      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did! :-)</li>
      <li>So, I asked the young lady at the register which did she like best.  </li>

      <li>It is a clean, fresh, attractive scent that I personally love!  </li>
      <li>This is not an easy cologne to find in our local area so finding on line with a GREAT price is very nice.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and love the strong scent.</li>
      <li>it smells very nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It is definitely easy on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In my case i like because is accurate for the morning</li>

      <li>--DOUBLE GREAT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Hopeful that it will remain available for purchase.</li>
      <li>been wearing this cologne since I was a kid, will always buy when available.</li>
      <li>The smell is very unique and fresh.</li>
      <li>This is now his new favorite, I also love the way it smells on him.</li>
      <li>This is my dads favorite cologne and he was so ecstatic that he received it for fathers day because evidently they do not make it anymore.</li>
      <li>and this one sounded familiar</li>
      <li>familiar-</li>
      <li>It is 100% original.</li>
      <li>one of my favorites,,,fresh sporty clear,,,also very reasonably prices, having something good does not mean that you have to break</li>
      <li>The package I received was fresh and the cologne smell was accurate from my recollection.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is crisp and clean, not too strong but noticable.  </li>
      <li>it is so sweet when friends appreciate what you do...... and thank you all for having it.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s good with younger men too, if you&#x27;re wanting to get it for your son.</li>
      <li>A sweet smelling cologne if you ask me.</li>
      <li>This element is the most important to me and the one I am most critical.  </li>
      <li>The large bottle is available on Amazon with free shipping under $20.00.  </li>
      <li>- my Mom swears that no one has a nose like mine - I detect a \\&quot;clean showered\\&quot;, (touches of) floral, fresh, and \\&quot;piney\\&quot; notes.  </li>
      <li>They really like it..!!  </li>
      <li>Clean, fresh and semi-exotic smelling, yet very affordable!</li>
      <li>I was really surprised and wanted to buy more of it, but Macys was out and the manufacturer was not distributing.  </li>
      <li>I love the clear bottles that allow you to see the clarity of the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Emphatically and without hesitation, she suggested that the Claiborne Sport was by far her favorite scent for men.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the only kind he will wear.</li>
      <li>Quick ship and the real stuff!</li>
      <li>Without question, I took her advice, and she was right.  </li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s a good cologne to supplement your more expensive choices and it&#x27;s good to alternate</li>
      <li>I was brushing up a right cologne for my 11 year old twin boys,  and I got it right..!!  </li>
      <li>- I have had several compliments (i.e. Wow Factor) from many of the fragrances (probably most from Bora</li>
      <li>I took a test spray and at first noticed a hand sanitizer smell which threw me off a bit.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Claiborne Sport never fails to impress.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this for my husband years ago</li>
      <li>I got compliments on this cologne the first day I wore it.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for making a wish come true.</li>
      <li>Thank you Amazon for making products like this available for those of us who like the old stuff.</li>
      <li>Besides other than smelling great, it was relatively cheap and there is a considerable amount that will last.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my dads favorite cologne and he was so ecstatic that he received it for fathers day because evidently they do not make it anymore. It is such a big bottle for such a cheap price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got a vial of this as a Xmas gift a few years back. I personally dislike the smell, it makes me nauseous, and I mean that not just saying it to further degrade the product. If you&#x27;re looking for a men&#x27;s fragrance by Claiborne, try Mambo instead.</li>
    <li> Claiborne Sport is my favorite cologne and the price on Amazon was 50% less than any local store.  It was my second purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Besides other than smelling great, it was relatively cheap and there is a considerable amount that will last. A sweet smelling cologne if you ask me. Truly a must have.</li>
    <li> Great product arrived very fast and was the best deal I have seen anywhere!!    Thank you so much</li>
    <li> For $15 dollars and change this so far was the best deal I ever got for a good quality cologne.  The fragrance is crisp and clean, not too strong but noticable.  I got compliments on this cologne the first day I wore it.</li>
    <li> .the smell last for 5 hours..very good money spend in this product....  I will recomend this product...</li>
    <li> Claiborne Sport is one of the best colognes out there, this cologne settles in very nicely and it last a long time. The smell is very unique and fresh. I buy the cologne straight from Amazon, they have the best price on it. Check it out for yourself, the girls will love it.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I love this cologne. It just became my new signature scent. Also It was a great price. much cheaper than in a retail store.</li>
    <li> Seems a like a different smell than I remember. Any way to tell if it is a knock-off?</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s mom got him this for Christmas or something randomly, and I fell in love with it! He&#x27;s out, and he doesn&#x27;t even remember what it was called. But i found it on here, and i&#x27;m getting him for Christmas again! So it&#x27;s good with younger men too, if you&#x27;re wanting to get it for your son. It makes any guy instantly huggable! ;)</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever used!!!! It will last all day!!!! I&#x27;ve never had another cologne last this long!!!!</li>
    <li> I wore this cologne for years. I thought it had been discontinued then I found it here on Amazon.. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Still to this day it&#x27;s one of my all time favorites...</li>
    <li> When I walked into the neighborhood drug store in search of a fragrance, I hadn&#x27;t a clue as to which would be best for me.  So, I asked the young lady at the register which did she like best.  Emphatically and without hesitation, she suggested that the Claiborne Sport was by far her favorite scent for men. Without question, I took her advice, and she was right.  I&#x27;ve since received numerous complements from women on this scent.  Believe me fellas, some men&#x27;s colognes were designed to make a funky monkey look appealing in the eyes of women, and this is one of them.  Also, try the Claiborne Mambo.</li>
    <li> Claiborne Sport never fails to impress.  It is a clean, fresh, attractive scent that I personally love!  I recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> Perfect cologne for day or night use - ladies seem to really like it.  I know I do.</li>
    <li> My husband was delighted when I gave it to home for our annniversary.  I tried buying it at Christmas but the stores no longer carry it.  It smells great.  I just cant stay sway from him when he is wearing it.    Thanks so much for making a wish come true.</li>
    <li> My son uses this cologne and he loves it. Thank you</li>
    <li> gREAT---GREAT  FRAGRENCE  GREAT --DOUBLE GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes that my husband wears.  This is not an easy cologne to find in our local area so finding on line with a GREAT price is very nice.  Thank you Amazon for making products like this available for those of us who like the old stuff.</li>
    <li> This cologne is a timeless favorite.  Such a masculine, clean fragrance.  Never offensive.  Hopeful that it will remain available for purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of claibourne sport. It&#x27;s very soft yet manly. A perfect blend! I&#x27;m certainly a life time buyer.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, this is an awesome cologne and would recommend it to any of my guy friends. the ladies like it too :)</li>
    <li> one of my favorites,,,fresh sporty clear,,,also very reasonably prices, having something good does not mean that you have to break the bank,,,this is a great option</li>
    <li> been wearing this cologne since I was a kid, will always buy when available.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. To be honest I bought this accidentally thinking it was a scent a friend told me about. I forgot he said it was a Nautica one and this one sounded familiar so I got it. After I received it I realized why it sounded familiar- I already have it in the back of my closet since I never wear it. So I chucked that one and started using this just to get rid of it. I have received compliments on it although I try to use lightly as people have scent issues where I work and I don&#x27;t want to annoy others. For the price it&#x27;s a good cologne to supplement your more expensive choices and it&#x27;s good to alternate so you don&#x27;t get too used to the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and love the strong scent. I can smell it hours after application especially if my body temperature increases. The package I received was fresh and the cologne smell was accurate from my recollection. If you want something unique, then this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn cologne in ages, but went with this one based on the reviews and I am glad I did. As soon as I started wearing this, I got compliments from a few co workers.</li>
    <li> My wife was desperately was looking for this cologne for years with no luck until she decided to start the search again to give it to me as our 10th year anniversary gift. She met back in the days wearing this cologn so now she gets to re-live those moments again!</li>
    <li> Bought this cologne for my husband and he absolutely loves it. This is now his new favorite, I also love the way it smells on him.</li>
    <li> It wont last for too long but it smells very nice ... For the money i would say do it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne, but you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  I was so happy that I was able to find it on here for such a great price</li>
    <li> This is the first cologne I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon and must say I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more in the future. To start off with, the cost for the amount of cologne is superb. My package got here three days earlier than what was initially set so that was nice. Received it nicely packaged without any damages. I was a bit iffy on cologne buying online after reading negative reviews on other colognes, but this one is simply fantastic. I took a test spray and at first noticed a hand sanitizer smell which threw me off a bit. Once it settled in within a three minutes or so, it smelled amazing. Lasts for hours too. Great price, service, and smell. Would recommend this to any one of my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this cologne for years and have had both men and women tell me ask me what is, and where can they buy it. I like it because it&#x27;s great for both every day use in the office/workplace, and also for &amp;#34;Date Night&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you. This is a quality product that smells great and lasts all day.  Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did! :-)</li>
    <li> Very happy with it!  Quick ship and the real stuff!</li>
    <li> Thee best smellin stuff ever made. I love this stuff. I been wearing it since middle school. That like 15 years.</li>
    <li> I first bought this for my husband years ago and it&#x27;s the only kind he will wear.</li>
    <li> My friend loved it..... it is so sweet when friends appreciate what you do...... and thank you all for having it.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for this fragrance for a long time.  Last time I used it many middle aged women(cougars)approached me and asked me what it was.  I was really surprised and wanted to buy more of it, but Macys was out and the manufacturer was not distributing.  Recently, after two years, and much to my surprise, I went on a search for it and found it on Amazon and ordered two bottles.  Guess what, I still get women asking me what I&#x27;m wearing and of course my wife tells them, ha.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Claiborne fragrances - Bora Bora, Curve, and Sport.  I have many of these (variations of Curve) in my collection.  Sport has been a pleasant addition.  I get that our \\&quot;noses\\&quot; are different - my Mom swears that no one has a nose like mine - I detect a \\&quot;clean showered\\&quot;, (touches of) floral, fresh, and \\&quot;piney\\&quot; notes.  The fragrance is appealling from the initial application and settles into the fresh clean showered essence that is quite pleasing.  It is definitely easy on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real beauty of  Sport is the deal.  The large bottle is available on Amazon with free shipping under $20.00.  Great deal with great service.  Secondary to the deal is the longevity.  This element is the most important to me and the one I am most critical.  The fragrance has above average longevity, lasting about six (6) hours, maybe longer on the shirtsleeve.  The fragrance has potential \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot; - Sweetie smelled my neck this morning and asked about the fragrance.  Keep in mind that I applied the fragrance yesterday morning prior to work.  Claiborne is underrated in men&#x27;s fragrances - I have had several compliments (i.e. Wow Factor) from many of the fragrances (probably most from Bora Bora).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is appealling to me - it is clear with shading/etching on half.  I love the clear bottles that allow you to see the clarity of the fragrance.  The spray is above average - use moderately..!! Additionally, the packaging is above average, which is great for such an inexpensive fragrance.  The bottom line guys - if you want an underrated fragrance at a great price - Sport or any of the Claiborne frangrances should be added to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Sport 4.2 stars out of 5 and definitely recommend.  Try something new today - you may like it...</li>
    <li> Claiborne Sport is a good cologne, but like Claiborne Curve, the smell may be a bit overwhelming. There are other sport colognes out there that are much better.</li>
    <li> Is very good. it smells very nice and soft. In my case i like because is accurate for the morning</li>
