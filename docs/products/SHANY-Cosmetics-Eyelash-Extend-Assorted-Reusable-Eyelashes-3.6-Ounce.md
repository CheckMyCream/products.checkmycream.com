<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these lashes and will definitely order from this company again! Great quality, and I love the beautiful colors and wide variety to choose from.</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail today and i was more than impressed! So often in bundles the quality just isn&#x27;t exceptional. These eyelashes are exceptional!  I put on the first pair to go out tonight and they were even better quality than the ones i pay almost $10.00 a pair for. They were easy to apply and were perfectly shaped.the colors looked even better than the photo&#x27;s which truly impressed me as I&#x27;ve often found color is not as good when received or is really different than the photo quality. The colors were so nice that i even plan on wearing the yellow pair which is a color i very rarely care for. I have exactly two pieces of clothing that have yellow in a shade i like to my name that is how rare it is i like yellow. I have added this set to my wish list to purchase again when these are ready to be thrown out. It is also rare to find color eyelashes that are this affordable much less in a multipack. I am definitely telling my girlfriends to pick these up and check out other Shany cosmetics as well. I have a case full of Shany nail polish and art along with other cosmetics that i just love. I recommend Shany products very highly and these lashes doubly so!</li>
    <li> I bought these eyelashes for a costume and am so glad I did! For the price of 2 pairs at a party shop you get 9 different pairs plus extensions, which is an excellent deal. I have used 2 pairs so far and have had no problems with them, but I DID use my own glue so I can&#x27;t attest to the quality of theirs. However glue is included with each pair, which is nice. Great, fun product!</li>
    <li> These were great on stage.  Great price also.</li>
    <li> They look really cool but they need to be trimmed both in length and width. They stay on fine with the right glue but are very irritating to my eye.</li>
    <li> I wore these lashes for costume pieces, and they are great for that. Beyond that they&#x27;re not really practical or easy to use. The lash glue that comes with them is pretty awful, but I just used my own.</li>
    <li> Most of these lashes are way too hard and almost impossible to even put on. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I was really looking forward to use these on my clients, but there is no way that&#x27;s going to happen. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for going with the cheaper stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a professional make up artist and I love having some variety to my lash collection. these are fun and my clients love these for special mascaraed, dress up events or around halloween.</li>
    <li> I like them. Very pretty, but I only tried to wear a pair on halloween, but didn&#x27;t succeed. I&#x27;m not used to false eyelashes. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Great value but the lashes didn&#x27;t stay on long at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered these lashes because of their bright colors and fun designs. Not only did they ship quickly, but I was incredibly happy with the quality of the product. I recently wore the blue pair to a rave in Chicago-- raged all night and they stayed on comfortably. I never had to reglue, nor did I have to cut them to begin with! I would recommend this product to anyone... everyone loves fun, affordable lashes!</li>
    <li> This was so much better than I could have hoped!! I got the package in 3 days (the absolute minimum, and I ordered at 10 at night!!) I was expecting quantity over quality, seeing as how awesome the price was, but I ended up with 8 beautiful sets of false lashes- each with their own tiny set of glue!! I was expecting to have to get back on amazon and have to go find some, but they each come with a more than ample amount of lash glue. Under all the lashes was a very customer-satisfaction driven note- You can be sure that I am joining their mailing list! I am SO happy with this company!!</li>
    <li> these lashes are very cool, I would recommend to anyone who wants to jazz things up or for halloween or costume party.  you will need your own glue though, it doesn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
    <li> nice quality for the price. the colors are bright. only wish they came on clear bands not the thick black ones that make heavy black eyeliner necessary to hide the band. happy with my purchase and cant wait to put them to use!!</li>
    <li> Fun party lashes but I don&#x27;t plan on buying them again. I don&#x27;t love all the colors and they are a little too wild for me</li>
    <li> Love love love this colorful kit of eyelashes.  Two girlfriends and I needed particular color lashes to match our Halloween costumes.  We searched locally in beauty supply stores with no luck. Amazon.com and Shany Cosmetics came to the rescue. Not only did I find all the colors we wanted in one set but they are reuseable.  I have colored lashes for my next fancy dress costume or when I am feeling fun on a Tuesday.  I will be buying more items from Shany Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> These lashes are just what a makeup artist needs for a photo shoot they really give a pop of color to your picture and makeup! They are also great for making great fantasy  looks. You can also send your Halloween costume over the top.</li>
    <li> Great set of lashes for a sexy alternative look!  Pair them with some of Shany&#x27;s bright eyeshadows and you&#x27;re all set to drop jaws!  Even if they aren&#x27;t really for your everyday look- they work great to compliment a halloween costume!!</li>
    <li> I like all the options you get with this kit. You can play it up and have really off the wall dramatic eyes if you wanted to, not many cosmetic companies make kits like that that are actually worth paying for.</li>
    <li> Though I do not have this product, I know that there are a lot of women out there who would want to use this product.  Everyone craves eyelashes that are thick, soft and sexy, and false eyelashes are one way of getting these types of lashes.  I would definately recommend this product to anyone who wants to enhance their lashes.</li>
    <li> I use these for fun avant garde portfolio looks - and they will definitely get used for Halloween this year! You can&#x27;t beat the price - Halloween stores charge this per pack!</li>
    <li> I ordered these to wear for a Halloween costume. These are my first set of false lashes but I think they worked great and they were just what I was looking for! They will be easily reusable too! I would definitely recommend them! Mine did NOT come with glue so prepare for that.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my niece who loves to do make up and hair, she loved it, the eyelashes are very pretty and nicely made.</li>
    <li> Great selection and quality, I wore the black sparkle for Halloween.  Reason for lower stars is the glue in that particular pack had dried up so I took another glue from another pair.</li>
    <li> I liked most of the lashes.  I used them for Halloween and they looked great.  Definitely not for everyday use but I think that&#x27;s obvious.</li>
    <li> Love colored false eye lashes! It can be hard to find really good set of some, these are amazing and fun!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I decided to order these lashes. They are beyond gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and the styles are so sexy. I am going to have so much fun with these lashes. The packaging is wonderful, the shipping was extremely fast and I would definitely order from you guys again and again... You couldn&#x27;t buy 3 pairs of these fancy lashes for the price of this whole box. I am super happy. Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> Seem to be alright not used them yet</li>
    <li> I bought these for costume parties.  Great value, lots of bright colors to choose from, and seems to be good quality.  Each set of lashes comes with a tiny tube of adhesive, although I&#x27;ve just used a bigger bottle of lash adhesive that I already had.  Really good price compared to what you might spend on buying them individually.</li>
    <li> For the adventurous spirit, SHANY has put together a collection of really fun, colorful lashes that will add a touch of color to your Halloween costume, outrageous party makeup, or editorial look.  The packaging is superb: each pair comes in its own plastic tray with a clear plastic cover piece to protect it while being stored in your kit.  The box that the sets are packaged in is also sturdy and gorgeously designed, showing off the product very well.  Each pair also comes with its own individual tube of adhesive, an even greater value for the price you pay.  The lashes are very colorful and well made, the bands are flexible and remove easily from the tray and the lashes are light and don&#x27;t feel bulky on your lids.  The fibers are soft; some of the colors look a little plasticy up close, but these lashes aren&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;everyday wear\\&quot; and they look great when worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one very minor complaint about the set is that the package of single lashes seems out of place in this particular collection.  This collection is about wild, costumey looks while single lashes are usually for more realistic looks.  Since the lash sets in this collection have very little black if any at all, these singles would be hard to use to enhance them.  Considering that the whole set was less than $10, this is a minor complaint indeed, and you can always throw them into your kit to have around in case you need them but it might have been nice to have a tenth pair or fun, colorful lashes rather than the singles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHANY is doing everything they can to prove to people that inexpensive makeup doesn&#x27;t have to be poorly made with sketchy performance.  SHANY delivers pretty consistent high quality product and their prices allow you to get a variety of products into your kit without spending a ton of money.  I did have some problems with their Smooch Collection lipsticks (you can read my review on the page, here: [[ASIN:B009ARXDDK SHANY Cosmetics SHANY Cosmetics Smooch Collection Lipstick Set No.1, 6 Count]]) but otherwise I have been amazed by every product I have ordered from them.  SHANY is truly an asset to makeup artists because of the value you get from their pallettes and collections, and they are a boon to makeup students who want to be able to experiment and play with products as they hone their skills.  This company is definitely one to keep your eye on.stick Set No.1, 6 Count]]) but otherwise I have been amazed by every product I have ordered from them.

    <li> Thank you for my order. They are very georgeousssssss. My daughter will be using them for an upcoming play-The Little Mermaid. Thanks</li>
    <li> Have you ever wondered what it would be like to wear lashes that were a different color then yours? Well, this set lets you do just that as it has purple, green, pink, blue and so many more. I like how these were not tested on any animals and can be washed over again. Just imagine how long these will last and definately get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> If you ask me I think these are the coolest things out there because they aren&#x27;t readily available all year long. This makes any event or everyday more fun and it&#x27;s cool how you can kind of see the color you are wearing!! 10 pairs is awesome for the price!</li>
    <li> These are fabulous! They didn&#x27;t come with glue, but I had some already and didn&#x27;t need it. The colors are bright and make your eyes pop.  They were as comfortable as fake eyelashes can be, and I was able to wear them all night.</li>
    <li> this is such a fantastic deal.  these lashes are well made, come in their own little boxes, lots of variety and you absolutely cannot beat the price.  if they added the glue with it it would be the best deal on amazon for sure.</li>
    <li> I ordered the colorful pack of eyelashes. They were a good price for 10 sets. The quality seems great and they seem fun. The con is that they state on this page that each pair of eyelashes comes with glue...well I&#x27;m missing 10 tubes of glue. I can obviously still make them work by buying glue but I didn&#x27;t think I would have to buy it separately or I would have ordered it from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review would have been 5 stars if the glue came like it said.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to wear these with my costume this year.</li>
    <li> I love this product. When your looking to give yourself a little pazaz lol, these lashes are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;As far as reusable? Idk, I think it depends on the care of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> The quality and price of this assortment cannot be beat.  As an FYI, be careful when removing the eyelashes from the product as it can damage them.  The colors are vibrant and true to advertised.  A single pair of eyelashes can sell for this much if not more, and to get 10 pairs of eyelashes, along with individual tubes of glue and individual packaging... well, this is a deal that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>

I may end up having to get another set just cause I know I am going to wear theses out. I can&#x27;t wait to see what I can do with them for Halloween looks!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my mother she enjoys them I purchased two packs for her and she wears them everyday.</li>
    <li> I used each of these eyelashes at least twice. They came quickly and look just as they are pictured. They don&#x27;t bend very easily, so if you have very round eyes, you may want to go a different direction.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes are easy to apply and have a nice variety of colors.</li>
    <li> these tabs are a sensation the purchase for a fantasy photo sessions and spectacular. Sincerely&#x27;ll ask more from a group you can.</li>
