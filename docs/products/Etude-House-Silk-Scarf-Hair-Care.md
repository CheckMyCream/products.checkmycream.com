      <li>This stuff is AMAZING, I tried it on my own hair and my 2 daughters one that had very dry hair from bleaching and</li>
      <li>Not bad.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh and leaves my hair smelling and feeling really light and pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an adequate size, but the scent -even</li>
      <li>Sometimes I shower in the evenings and when I wake up in the morning, my hair doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice but it does not last</li>
      <li>The fragrance kind of reminds me or Tinkerbell perfume they used to sell back in the day. ^_^</li>
      <li>It also runs out pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It does smell nice, so I like to spray it on if I don&#x27;t have the time to shower after a long night of work.</li>
      <li>It could smell a little better &#x3D;)&#x3D;</li>
      <li>i love it but didn&#x27;t came with the English instructions</li>
      <li>I have not used it since the first week of delivery and will not be repurchasing.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my sister and she has told me that her hair is less frizzy and feels more smooth.</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying that this product alone doesn&#x27;t do much to your hair other than make it smell nice.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t spend this kind of money on hair sprays, but I love this stuff and fully intend on buying a second bottle when mine runs out.</li>
      <li>Thanks to ..</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really see the benefit of using this product.  </li>
      <li>Although the product claims to &amp;#34;boost hair&#x27;s health&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t think it does much in that aspect.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
      <li>Great product, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I just spray a little bit of this on them and my ends become soft, shiny, and healthy looking!</li>
      <li>I like to use it if hubby cooks onions or certain foods, I am highly sensitive to smells, and can not stan when my hair smells like the food.  </li>
      <li>Will right later to keep updates.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>but yet is not over powering, and leave my hair silky soft.</li>
      <li>I have multi-textured Caucasian hair,its straight here, curly there,and wavy all at the same time.</li>
      <li>Hair feels soft.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel any softer or look any shinier; there&#x27;s not less frizz or anything.</li>
      <li>whatever this product&#x27;s name is, I finally know what my hair is normally supposed to look like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I really see this doing much of anything for my hair.</li>
      <li>To think how much money I&#x27;ve spent over the years on popular name brands that are useless.</li>
      <li>First of all I received what seemed to be watered down conditioner kinda looking liquid with no scent and in no way</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way so using all 3 is doable and worth the outcome ^.~</li>
      <li>I sprayed it into my hair (straight asian hair, medium thickness) and it made it slightly sticky.</li>

    <li> It could smell a little better &#x3D;)&#x3D;</li>
    <li> I like to use it if hubby cooks onions or certain foods, I am highly sensitive to smells, and can not stan when my hair smells like the food.  Have used others I liked better.  Hard to find products like this.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!! Gives my hair a nice shine after drying it!! :)</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this product alone doesn&#x27;t do much to your hair other than make it smell nice. I think you&#x27;re meant to use it in conjunction with the other silk scarf products, but I didn&#x27;t buy those because I just wanted to use it as a hair perfume. Sometimes I shower in the evenings and when I wake up in the morning, my hair doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh. I got this product for that reason and it&#x27;s effective. I get migraines and personally the scent did not trigger any for me which is definitely a plus. To me, it smells like apples and flowers and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> it does give a nice shine to the hair but the smell reminds me of one of those car hanging scent things. like one of those small little hanging trees that has the smell of cheap strawberry especially the ones that you find in cabs but this is just my opinion it might  work for someone else.  but it does give your hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what this product does to my hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel any softer or look any shinier; there&#x27;s not less frizz or anything. With that being said, I still use this product all the time because it smells so good: a really beautiful watery floral scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells SO amazing! It&#x27;s light, fresh and leaves my hair smelling and feeling really light and pretty. I love the packaging and will be ordering again and using as a staple. It didn&#x27;t make my hair super shiny or silky but it is a really nice product! The fragrance kind of reminds me or Tinkerbell perfume they used to sell back in the day. ^_^</li>
    <li> It does smell nice, so I like to spray it on if I don&#x27;t have the time to shower after a long night of work. But if you just want the effects, just go to your nearest Target and buy a bottle of that detangling spray we used to get as kids. It works the same. It also runs out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind, American shoppers, This is a tiny bottle for a big price tag. The product is excellent and smells lovely, and my hair is definitely silky. For those who may be concerned over ordering a korean brand product, this comes with english instructions.</li>
    <li> Best product for your hair</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a teeny tiny bottle. It&#x27;s a good sized bottle. It&#x27;s meant to be misted on your hair. It smells nice (a reviewer on YouTube said that it smelled like herbal essence hairspray but I beg to differ!)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this stuff is!!! I have very Dry, bleached, curly hair, and this makes my hair so shiny!!! and it smells really good also!! :)</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, just wish it lasted longer. Helps with flyaways.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, that&#x27;s about it. I sprayed it into my hair (straight asian hair, medium thickness) and it made it slightly sticky. I don&#x27;t really like this product. I&#x27;ll give it another try soon.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this product does what hair mists are supposed to do - make your hair smell nice. It is 120 ml and has a nice floral scent. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or grease feeling, and the scent is long lasting. The mist is weightless and leaves my hair looking shiny.This is perfect for those days when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair. Don&#x27;t worry, this product does have instructions written in English. Although the product claims to &amp;#34;boost hair&#x27;s health&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t think it does much in that aspect. I will continue to purchase this product unless I find a better hair mist.</li>
    <li> A bit of the product spilled but its ok&lt;br /&gt;Not bad wouldnt buy again thiugh</li>
    <li> It smells good when you spray it, but the smell is gone pretty fast...&lt;br /&gt;My hair is pretty healthy, I guess I don&#x27;t need it to moist my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the worst advertisement I have ever seen.First of all I received what seemed to be watered down conditioner kinda looking liquid with no scent and in no way did it moist or add shine because it was anything for hair.I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it even if it was given for free.</li>
    <li> Smells incredible and leaves my hair feeling soft. It&#x27;s a perfect little pick me up during the day, I just so wish that the smell lasted... it&#x27;s a gorgeous scent!</li>
    <li> Just was not pleased with this.  I lost the packaging or I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an adequate size, but the scent -even though it&#x27;s great- goes away very-very fast!  Too bad!</li>
    <li> Etude House Silk Scarf Moist Hair Mist 120ml  I will be changing my hair care products to Silk Scarf. This stuff is AMAZING, I tried it on my own hair and my 2 daughters one that had very dry hair from bleaching and the other had hair damage she is trying to repair. Mine is just coloring but curly so the frizz factor is all over my head haha, this product proved its self against all 3 hair types leaving them all silky soft and smooth frizz free even after a night of sleep, I am impressed 100% my daughter is now ordering some for herself .I used 3 products Etude House Silk Scarf Moist Hair Mist also the silk scarf hair treatment and hair serum in combo to get this out come.  A little goes a long way so using all 3 is doable and worth the outcome ^.~</li>
    <li> It smells nice but doesn&#x27;t stay.  Don&#x27;t really see the benefit of using this product.  I have not used it since the first week of delivery and will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> i love it but didn&#x27;t came with the English instructions i didn&#x27;t see it</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and my ends can get really dry. I just spray a little bit of this on them and my ends become soft, shiny, and healthy looking! It also smells really nice. Great product, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft after using  this, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This silly little product works. To think how much money I&#x27;ve spent over the years on popular name brands that are useless. Thanks to .. whatever this product&#x27;s name is, I finally know what my hair is normally supposed to look like.</li>
    <li> Love this product :) Smell so good but yet is not over powering, and leave my hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Used three quarters of my bottle. I have multi-textured Caucasian hair,its straight here, curly there,and wavy all at the same time. Other than the fact that my hair gets greasier quicker (i.e. instead of going four days between washing your hair, you might only go two-- or as I do, updo&#x27;s) but I&#x27;ll take that over dry frizzy hair. I also use the deep conditioner in conjuction with this. I usually don&#x27;t spend this kind of money on hair sprays, but I love this stuff and fully intend on buying a second bottle when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Hair feels soft.</li>
    <li> nice scent on my hair</li>
    <li> Wow! this product is great! smells soooo god, and leaves my hair silky and looking great! i definitely gonna buy this product again!</li>
    <li> The smell is nice but it does not last</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I love the smell but I think it&#x27;s drying up my scalp. I&#x27;m gonna stop &amp; see if the itching stops. Will right later to keep updates.</li>
    <li> This product just serves the purpose of giving some smell to your hair. That&#x27;s all. However the product came with an expired date. I want to avoid the hassles of returning etc. So i will keep it and use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Not bad.  Not overly awesome. I&#x27;m not sure if I really see this doing much of anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and is really light.</li>
    <li> I hated this..first of all I received a broken bottle half empty..i decided to keep it and try it but still didn&#x27;t like it it made my hair feel so dry...so it&#x27;s a 1 star wish I could put -1</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I found this product and have been faithfully using it for a year now In place of a lightweight leave in conditioner.  I love this so much more and I can see the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> it really tames flyaways and has a nice smell.  you also don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it either</li>
    <li> Product smells great! As for if it works? I bought this for my sister and she has told me that her hair is less frizzy and feels more smooth. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Best ever. Made my hair silky&amp; soft ,also it smelt amazing! I see a diffence in my hair! ❤️</li>
    <li> This is a good leave-in conditioner.  It has a lovely floral scent and I use it as a detangler for my girls hair.  It&#x27;s too pricey as in the price outweighs the benefits.  One time purchase for me.</li>
