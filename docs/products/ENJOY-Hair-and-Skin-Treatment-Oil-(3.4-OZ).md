    <li> I have been using this for 6 years now.  Love it for my long hair!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have extremely thick and long hair that is also very frizzy. This tames the frizz and makes my hair feel healthy without being greasy or weighed down. It does NOT protect against heat, but I recommend Pureology Super Smooth for that. I cocktail them together and it&#x27;s a great combination. I HATE wearing hair product but love these two.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves your hair beautiful!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair Soooo soft.</li>
    <li> Just a small dab works to make my hair shine and feel silky smooth with no frizzies!</li>
    <li> This is a must item for my hair. This product isn&#x27;t oily at all. A very small amount in wet hair and my hair blows out gorgeous and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;As a nice bonus it has a nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;My son uses it on his beard. It&#x27;s also a very nice moisturizer for your hands.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love how light it feels on the hair and skin. So far this is the best product for my type of hair. I have tried lots of products. Thank you to my hair stylist who recomended this product.</li>
    <li> Love everything Enjoy.  This oil is far better than others that cost way more.  Will continue to order this</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Makes my hair soft and shiny, always.  I have been using Enjoy hair oil for two years now.  I used the intensive one first since my hair was so badly damaged when I started using hair oil, and switched to this one two weeks ago.  An awesome product.  My bottle lasted me a year and nine months- it would have lasted longer if I hadn&#x27;t knocked it over without closing the lid and spilled about a third of it on my bathroom sink.  Can&#x27;t recommend Enjoy hair&amp;skin oil enough.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft, even when I flat iron regularly.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hair products ever.  I&#x27;ll never go without it.  I use it after washing my hair while its still damp and after its dry to help tame it.  A little goes a long way.  It keeps my hair from frizzing, helps with fly-aways, and I haven&#x27;t had static issues yet this winter.</li>
    <li> Great oil for my skin! a bit too heavy for my hair. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This smells soo good!! A little goes a long way and the bottle lasts months! For my thin waist length hair I use less then a dime size.. Rub my hands together and massage into my scalp and hair.. Looks shiny and feels soft with no greasy look or feel :) also use just.  A dab on dry skin and works excellent for the soft feel again! Love it!</li>
    <li> i have super thick curly hair and its frizzy..I have been getting the Brazillian Blow this past year. I used BB products and my hair would have this strong smell and it felt weighed down. I switched to a new salon and one of the girls recommended ENJOY. I had never heard of it and thought she was just trying to sell me another product. I LOVE ENJOY!!! it works so well with my hair and this oil is soooo smooth and light and works wonders with my hair. I don&#x27;t dar buy it in the salon I always buy it on amazon its much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It transforms my hair to great body and is non-greasy. Use only a little, it goes a long way. This price is wonderful too.</li>
    <li> I really like this, but will only use on the ends because it can be a little heavy for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast no complaints and the product absolutely saved my hair after dying my hair. Smells really good and works wonderful before styling and has your styled hair looking flawless.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! gives my hair Life.</li>
    <li> Great product for face and hair.  I use it every day as part of my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Product smells really good, as far as quality, I like moroccan oil better</li>
    <li> Best oil for dry skin and makes hair softer</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that was highly recommended by my friend.  I use the product on my skin and the fragrance is amazing.  It is definitely on my must have beauty product list.  If you don&#x27;t feel like putting on a spray fragrance this is definitely one to wear it&#x27;s very light and the smell is amazing..</li>
    <li> Works for keeping my ends from splitting and my elbows from cracking.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me but my daughter-in-law and I love it....gives my hair a little shine without being greasy.....only need a small amount!!!</li>
    <li> Love this hair product!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel soft and silky especially after applying the flat iron. The four instead of 5 stars is because it has a yellow color, it turns my bleach blonde a yellow tint. Usually the purple shampoo will fix that.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for smoothing thick coarse hair. I use it along with a serum &amp;#34;iso tamer&amp;#34;. Always a good price than the salon&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It works great and I got it right away.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this treatment for my hair and I love it.  It&#x27;s light, and has a citrus fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look &#x27;oily&#x27; and adds a nich shine.  I use it right after the shower, and I think my hair looks healthier with less frizziness after I&#x27;ve started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only use a tiny bit each application, (about the size of a dime in the palm of your hand) so the bottle lasts a really long time.  Sometimes I like to skip a day washing my hair, and it works nicely on those days to perk up and freshen my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I apply to my wet hair and comb through and any left on my hands I apply to my heels.</li>
    <li> I love the product but when it arrived on time...it was broken.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using Frizease for years but it left my hair oily. This stuff works just as well but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily. It stays silky smooth and soft all day. Love this stuff, couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else for my hair.</li>
