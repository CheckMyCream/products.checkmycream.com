      <li>Those cheap brushes you get from your dentist?</li>
      <li>really recommend learning better brushing and flossing techniques before buying fancy, overstated looking brushes that actually do more damage than their basic but more effective counterparts.</li>
      <li>unique part of this tooth brush is the whitening cups and polishing bristles.  </li>
      <li>Need to get a new tooth brush every 3 months as I value having nice teeth</li>
      <li>It gets gums clean.</li>
      <li>I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>

      <li>haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about the cheek &amp; tongue cleaner.</li>
      <li>So far its worked amazingly.</li>
      <li>How the Colage 360 Optic compares to the Colgate Full Head</li>
      <li>B00ELI7U3C Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]])</li>
      <li>head on it is full in size.</li>
      <li>So I like a firmer brush to make sure I&#x27;m cleaning everything very well.</li>
      <li>Gums are very sensitive, and it&#x27;s very important to clean out the crevices between gums and teeth.</li>
      <li>Quick Version:</li>
      <li>For some reason this brush feels like there are more bristles, better bristles, bristles that are positioned in the right places and that the bristles are soft enough not to hurt my gums while they do a great job cleaning my teeth at the same time.  </li>
      <li>it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Favorite toothbrush ever... so far.</li>
      <li>It is worth it.  </li>
      <li>only thing I liked about this toothbrush is the built-in tongue cleaner.</li>
      <li>like it does the job right .</li>
      <li>This medium firmness is just right.</li>
      <li>The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  </li>
      <li>and I use many different teeth whitening tools to maintain a nice, white smile</li>
      <li>I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.</li>
      <li>Best brushing action by far compared to other brushes.</li>
      <li>You actually feel a difference when you are finish brushing, I would definitely say it is a great buy and for the price</li>
      <li>My most recent purchase of this toothbrush was on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It has about as many features as there could possibly be in a non-electric brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall the price I paid at Meijer, but I had a coupon which is why I decided to try it in the first</li>
      <li>First time I have used a Colgate toothbrush and I do not like it.</li>
      <li>This is a top of the line basic tooth brush.</li>
      <li>After a lot of reading, I found that the current ideal method is the &amp;#34;modified Bass&amp;#34; technique, which can be accomplished with a small headed, soft, cheap toothbrush.</li>
      <li>better than cheap grocery store toothbrushes - save a little and upgrade!</li>
      <li>B00A9YS9QO Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]] has it all!  </li>
      <li>To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  </li>
      <li>short version, from my perspective, is that medium toothbrushes are actually really good as long as you are taking care when you brush.</li>
      <li>The circles are concave, and with the large difference in bristle lengths</li>
      <li>While some people may not like the large head on this brush, I do.</li>
      <li>also liked the medium bristles, which I found just right after my usual sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need that much toothpaste.</li>
      <li>And this is a very grown-up type</li>
      <li>This toothbrush really grabs all of my teeth and brushes well.</li>
      <li>but I really like it.</li>
      <li>I like the 360 feature, this brush is very well designed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like how the bristles of this toothbrush contour to my teeth.</li>
      <li>I still like it very much and will likely buy it several more times</li>
      <li>I have a small mouth, so that made it a bit tougher using this toothbrush, as the head is kind of large.  </li>
      <li>The bristles got between my teeth also helping to get a deep clean.</li>
      <li>This item was the only true purchase that met the description it was  advertised for.</li>
      <li>I like the design of this Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>It actually feels like its doing more than a standard brush and gets to more areas than I was previously used to.</li>
      <li>It actually feels like its doing more than a standard brush and gets to more areas than I was previously used to.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this toothbrush for the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; cups and haven&#x27;t noticed any particular whitening</li>
      <li>Quickly cleans the gums and teeth and everything else because it is so big.</li>
      <li>The bristles are long and staggered, so they get inside teeth crevices as well as clean around the gum line.</li>
      <li>Having the little cups helps keep the toothpaste on the brush, to better cover each tooth.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this one on Amazon, but I like it and will buy it from Amazon next time (if the price is right).</li>
      <li>I feel like it does an adequate job of cleaning my teeth without having to go over the same area as many times due to its larger design.</li>
      <li>My toothbrush always looks like new after three months.</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft, the handle is firm and the back of the tooth brush head has an effective tounge cleaner to help remove plaque.</li>
      <li>So far, no bees!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is a pretty solid toothbrush.</li>

    <li> Amazed by this product</li>
    <li> Toothbrush performs cleaning your teeth  good</li>
    <li> Wonderful  toothbrush holds up and gets my teeth clean</li>
    <li> Need to get a new tooth brush every 3 months as I value having nice teeth</li>
    <li> Best brushing action by far compared to other brushes.</li>
    <li> Awsome tooth brush I have always used this brand.</li>
    <li> Does the job .. I like it.</li>
    <li> First time I have used a Colgate toothbrush and I do not like it. Oral B is still the best. This is supposed to be medium firm, it&#x27;s flimsy. I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> This is a tooth brush (&#x27;toof&#x27; brush to some).  Regardless of how you say it.... use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush your teeth...brush your teeth....brush your MF&#x27;n Teeth  BWAHAHAHAA.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inner city PSA on healthy living:&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/q_wH9tlRI7w</li>
    <li> The best part about this brush is the whitening cups. The keep a steady application of toothpaste on every tooth helping to whiten overall. This brush feels really good in my hand while I am brushing. I like the 360 feature, this brush is very well designed. I found that cleaning the bite of my teeth the sides were also being reached by the brush. The bristles got between my teeth also helping to get a deep clean. The brush is massaging and gentle as it gives an excellent clean.</li>
    <li> I find the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; brushes made by Colgate to be rather hard, and this one I find on the harder side as well.  But I like how the handle feels, and how it bends with the motion.  I&#x27;m not sure what the various different shapes and colors of bristles do in the mouth or on the teeth, though, but as long as the brush can get to food particles and remove tartar, I am happy with that.  As with other Colgate 360 brushes, the best thing going is the ergonomic design of the handle.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush I have braces and I feel like it does the job right .</li>
    <li> UPDATE: November 6, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased: October 23, 2015&lt;br /&gt;Price: $2.99&lt;br /&gt;Seller: Amazon.com LLC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to get used to this toothbrush because I normally use Oral B, and the handle is made differently. After a few weeks it no longer felt awkward, and it feels comfortable in my hand now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening cups hold onto the toothpaste very well, and the size and shape of the brush head makes it feel like it&#x27;s reaching every nook and cranny (including reaching behind upper wisdom teeth easily) while covering a larger area at the same time (than most other toothbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about the cheek &amp; tongue cleaner. I didn&#x27;t buy this toothbrush for the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; cups and haven&#x27;t noticed any particular whitening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few months and the bristles haven&#x27;t begun to fray or flare at all. I didn&#x27;t purchase this one on Amazon, but I like it and will buy it from Amazon next time (if the price is right). I don&#x27;t recall the price I paid at Meijer, but I had a coupon which is why I decided to try it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 6, 2015:  My most recent purchase of this toothbrush was on Amazon.  I still like it very much and will likely buy it several more times (i&#x27;ve been trying to replace my toothbrushes at the recommended rate instead of using the same one for a year!)</li>
    <li> I have to say I was suspicious of the claims. But I did find that my toothpaste actually lasted long enough to get all the way around my mouth instead of dissolving into bubbles right away in the first quadrant brushed. My mouth also tasted mintier after, because of this. It kind of cupped the toothpaste and made it take longer to disperse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the medium bristles, which I found just right after my usual sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that my teeth are whiter, but they do feel more evenly cleaned.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like how the bristles of this toothbrush contour to my teeth. The circles are concave, and with the large difference in bristle lengths I feel that I don&#x27;t get good contact with my teeth in a lot of areas. Also, this toothbrush is &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; but feels really, really stiff to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked about this toothbrush is the built-in tongue cleaner. It does a good job without feeling too scratchy or uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Umm... I was just brushing my teeth, and something fell off from the toothbrush (see picture). And I know it&#x27;s not because I brush too harsh. My toothbrush always looks like new after three months. I don&#x27;t think this ever happened to me in my life. I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> It gets the job don&#x27;t so no complaining here.. Got a nice tongue scrubber so you can brush you tongue..</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, I think it is the best I have ever used because it really do a good job. You actually feel a difference when you are finish brushing, I would definitely say it is a great buy and for the price it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I like how the brush feels in my mouth. It actually feels like its doing more than a standard brush and gets to more areas than I was previously used to. I would recommend you try this.</li>
    <li> I actually like the large size of this toothbrush. I feel like it does an adequate job of cleaning my teeth without having to go over the same area as many times due to its larger design. I understand this design is not for everyone but I really like it. Great product!</li>
    <li> Wow, I never thought a tooth brush would be something I would review but this one is great. The head is a good size, the brush is multi shaped and cleans very well. It gets gums clean. So far its worked amazingly. Being disabled makes brushing very hard for me and this brush has helped make the job easier.</li>
    <li> This is the first toothbrush I have paid this much for (I usually buy them at the dollar store).  It is worth it.  For some reason this brush feels like there are more bristles, better bristles, bristles that are positioned in the right places and that the bristles are soft enough not to hurt my gums while they do a great job cleaning my teeth at the same time.  I do not believe a toothbrush can whiten teeth...I just wanted a really good toothbrush that cleans my teeth really good.  I think this one does.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush in the morning and bedtime, but for those in-between brushings, I use a manual toothbrush.  I like the design of this Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head toothbrush.  The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  I thought the bristles were much too harsh for a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; toothbrush, and felt more like a harder bristle.  I would buy this type of toothbrush again, but with the compact head and soft bristles.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a nice handle that is easy to grip, medium bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums and a tongue and cheek cleaner that works.  It also  has whitening cups and polishing bristles that help polish and whiten teeth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique part of this tooth brush is the whitening cups and polishing bristles.  They look like little circles on the head of the toothbrush surrounded by larger bristles on the sides. When I take my time and focus on polishing it feels like my teeth are being polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a tooth brush I look for a few things. I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy. Finally, I like toothbrushes that have tongue cleaners because there are times when I eat something like chocolate or yogurt or drink tea or coffee and my tongue and even gums feel like they could use a cleaning.  This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it has the polishing cups and bristles which seem to polish my teeth. I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with white teeth and I use many different teeth whitening tools to maintain a nice, white smile so I jumped at the opportunity to try this toothbrush that claims to help whiten teeth. Well, it didn&#x27;t, even I used it with the toothpaste from the same line. There are \\&quot;cups\\&quot; which are suppose to hold the toothpaste to effectively remove surface stains. What I noticed about the \\&quot;cups\\&quot; is that they feel like half the toothbrush was missing. It didn&#x27;t feel like my teeth were being cleaned thoroughly. Some people may have different results and may really like this toothbrush, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This is a top of the line basic tooth brush. The brushes are soft, the handle is firm and the back of the tooth brush head has an effective tounge cleaner to help remove plaque. For the price- this is a toothbrush you will not be disappointed with. The only downside with ordering online is you can not select your color, which could be a big issue for some.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush. I would still be using it, but switched to an electric. I still purchase these for my husband. This brush always gives a great cleaning without feeling too abrasive on my gums. I think the polishing bristles make all the difference.</li>
    <li> Reliable toothbrush. Always keep a few extra on hand for guests.</li>
    <li> Quick Version: It&#x27;s a good toothbrush with wide and hard bristles. If that works for you, get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few reasons why this might not be for you:&lt;br /&gt;1) You have sensitive gums or small teeth&lt;br /&gt;2) You hold your toothbrush with a finger on the back of the head (the rubber grip is near the neck)&lt;br /&gt;3) You have a hatred of 360 being used in product names without having anything to do with the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a pretty solid toothbrush. I keep a few of these for traveling and in case someone stays over at my apartment and forgot theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the harder bristles actually help with whitening, but they definitely help with cleaning, even if they are a bit abrasive at times.</li>
    <li> Coming from a regular toothbrush from the dollar store, or somewhere around that price range, this toothbrush was mega weird when I first started using it -- too big and the cheek and tongue cleaner hurt my lip. However, I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush&#x27;s cousin ([[ASIN:B00ELI7U3C Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]]) for over a month now, and I&#x27;ve gotten to where I can&#x27;t go back to a regular toothbrush. This toothbrush really grabs all of my teeth and brushes well. I like the cheek and tongue cleaner and it stopped hurting after just a couple brushes. How the Colage 360 Optic compares to the Colgate Full Head I don&#x27;t know. They seem the same to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I Iove this toothbrush and will be ordering more. It&#x27;s a surprisingly likable toothbrush.</li>
    <li> better than cheap grocery store toothbrushes - save a little and upgrade!</li>
    <li> While some people may not like the large head on this brush, I do. I hate when I buy a toothbrush, just to get it and realize it&#x27;s the kind with the smaller head on them. I don&#x27;t like using toothbrushes that feel like they are meant for little kids. And this is a very grown-up type toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head on it is full in size. The back of the brush head has a texture applied to it, so it cleans your inner lips and cheeks while brushing. The bristles are long and staggered, so they get inside teeth crevices as well as clean around the gum line. It&#x27;s bu no means a simple boring tooth brush. It has about as many features as there could possibly be in a non-electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medium bristles are fairly firm. So if you&#x27;re one who like their brushes a little bit soft, I&#x27;d suggest checking out this same brush in the soft version. To me, the medium feels a little more like the firm, which I like. I have extensive dental work in my mouth due to a tumor I had in my jawbone a few years back. So I like a firmer brush to make sure I&#x27;m cleaning everything very well. This medium firmness is just right.</li>
    <li> This item was the only true purchase that met the description it was  advertised for.</li>
    <li> Item as described! cvpnj.com</li>
    <li> Got a 10 pack with the medium firmness. It&#x27;s definitely more firm than the regular medium toothbrush which made it last longer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whiten side of this... I didn&#x27;t see any difference that it made to my teethes which made this whiten tooth brush pointless. Those whiten cups deforms after about a week of use. It&#x27;s basically more costly for nothing.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best brush ever especially the medium brush. I had a little bit a plaque and with use of this brush and paste I was able to eliminate almost all of it from behind my teeth. Vert strong and sturdy clean it all upðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ&lt;br /&gt;If you have a sensitive mouth use the soft one</li>
    <li> I like how the brush feels in my mouth. It actually feels like its doing more than a standard brush and gets to more areas than I was previously used to. I would recommend you try this.</li>
    <li> With special cups to hold the toothpaste for better whitening and polishing and an extra-wide, extra deep brush head to brush both sides of your teeth at the same time clear down to the gum line, and a built-in tongue cleaner, this [[ASIN:B00A9YS9QO Colgate 360 Optic White Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]] has it all!  Medium bristles for those who prefer a firmer toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - Experts say that you should change out your toothbrush every three months whether it appears to need it or not - and also after you&#x27;ve had a cold, the flu or a strep infection. Germs can hide in those bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth, so that made it a bit tougher using this toothbrush, as the head is kind of large.  However, that inconvenience was overshadowed by the extra whitening power I noticed.  Having the little cups helps keep the toothpaste on the brush, to better cover each tooth.  The cheek and tongue cleaning capability is a definite plus.  If you have really sensitive teeth and gums, you may want to go with the soft head.</li>
    <li> Gums are very sensitive, and it&#x27;s very important to clean out the crevices between gums and teeth. This toothbrush is far too wide and the outer bristles are much longer than the inside ones, so you can&#x27;t properly brush the gumline without excessively brushing your gums - which you shouldn&#x27;t ever do. Gums are sensitive. After a short time using this, my gums started bleeding far more than they ever have in the past, for any reason. After a lot of reading, I found that the current ideal method is the &amp;#34;modified Bass&amp;#34; technique, which can be accomplished with a small headed, soft, cheap toothbrush. It will be far more gentle on your gums, and reach better to the places where most people get their plaque buildup.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the toothpaste cups on this are quite unnecessary. You don&#x27;t need that much toothpaste. And really, all these rubber bits do is make an annoying sound as they rub against your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend learning better brushing and flossing techniques before buying fancy, overstated looking brushes that actually do more damage than their basic but more effective counterparts. Those cheap brushes you get from your dentist? They&#x27;re not just throwaways or travel brushes. They do the job right.&lt;br /&gt;Also, check out the modified Bass technique. It may improve your dental health.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Every time.</li>
    <li> Favorite toothbrush ever... so far.</li>
    <li> The head is huge and the brush is cupped to hold plenty of whitening Colgate toothpaste. The medium bristles are perfect because you don&#x27;t have to exert a lot of pressure. Quickly cleans the gums and teeth and everything else because it is so big. I use Colgate toothpaste to whiten, it is the only brand for our family for the last 100 years.</li>
    <li> You always hear everywhere to start with a soft toothbrush.  But when do you upgrade to a medium toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short version, from my perspective, is that medium toothbrushes are actually really good as long as you are taking care when you brush. They get your teeth cleaned faster, but if you are brushing too hard you will irritate your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This colgate is a really good medium toothbrush.  If you are tired of your soft toothbrush wearing out in a hurry, and are wiling to take some care, then give it a try.</li>
    <li> great tooth brush and great price</li>
    <li> works great not hard on gums</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a toothbrush - does what it says</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a rough side on the back that really cleans your cheeks and tongue.  Gives you a nice clean feeling when you&#x27;re done brushing.</li>
    <li> I put toothpaste on it and put it in my mouth. So far, no bees! I was worried about the bees. I&#x27;m ALWAYS worried about the bees...</li>
    <li> The brush is as expected.  Seems to be holding up well, and a good value for the $</li>
