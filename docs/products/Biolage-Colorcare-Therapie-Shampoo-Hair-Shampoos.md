      <li>but, I used this product and it took most of the color out of my hair!!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>It cleans my hair well without drying it out and smells great!</li>
      <li>Matrix color care shampoo is a great shampoo for anyone who colors their hair.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>Great suds, no film or greasy residue.</li>
      <li>It smells good and seems to work for my highlighted hair.</li>
      <li>Good body</li>
      <li>Always makes my hair nice and shiny, with no grease....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
      <li>Authentic and on time.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need to use it more and my hair will get used to it?  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought this product after seeing it online.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job preserving the color, and I really like the feel of the product.  </li>
      <li>However, the scent is not that appealing.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite shampoos for colored hair of all time.</li>
      <li>The packaging as well as the smell and texture of the shampoo was fake/not original.</li>
      <li>Now, I just use a special hydrating conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have thick straight hair and it works wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Biolage products are by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I needed it right away</li>
      <li>If I use another shampoo my hair gets greasy fast, but not with this one!</li>
      <li>I have been using this Biolage shampoo for years and knew right away that this is NOT the real Biolage.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair clean and soft without changing hair color.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great and gets hair really clean, but my only complaint is that it is really drying on hair.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo I received was not the real thing.</li>
      <li>I think it is very drying for my highlighted hair.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really has no scent, and just reminds me of hair salon chemical smells.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that I think have worked better, and been gentler on my hair.</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t for other products I use in my hair before drying I would not be able to tolerate this smell.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>My hair and scalp feel clean but shampoo smells a little too much like chemicals.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s either a knock off or extremely old and stinky...almost rancid in smell.  </li>
      <li>I used it today for the first time and it dried out my hair the same way</li>

<li> This shampoo treats color treated gently, but doesn&#x27;t leave it limp and flat.</li>
<li> There was no noticeable difference in the speed of my color fading than there was with regular shampoo, and this shampoo left my hair feeling strangely unwashed; it felt dirtier after washing than it did before washing.</li>
<li> If my hair is still dry after a months use I will go back to Redken Blonde Glam.</li>
<li> and it never feels as dry as it does today.</li>
<li> Have been using this for 10+ years whether my hair is blonde or dark!</li>
<li> Seems to be a fake product, not sure if this is an isolated case but the product doesnt seem to be genuine.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s up to the usual standard!  </li>
<li> I really hope I am wrong about this product</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the Biolage Color Care Shampoo.</li>
<li> Very upset and disappointed that Amazon would allow imitation products to be sold on their website, especially after several bad reviews.</li>
<li> This product smells so bad I can not hardly tolerate it.  </li>
<li> This shampoo seems to have no benefit over any other shampoo, AND it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
<li> It also is very thick, so I feel I am wasting a lot of product because it is difficult to dispense just a small amount of product.</li>
<li> Not happy with this.</li>
<li> but unfortunately you have to click on a star to even write a review.</li>
<li> , I want to like it badly.  </li>
<li> Incredibly disappointed.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I know, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Matrix Biolage&amp;#34;, but, I used this product and it took most of the color out of my hair!!!!!!!!  I had to immediately re-dye it.  Now, I just use a special hydrating conditioner.  For me, I would not use this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the recommendation and review of a blogger, Emily from Cupcakes and Cashmere (totally check her out at cupcakesandcashmere.com and buy her book here on Amazon!). I really like it. It cleans my hair well without drying it out and smells great! I don&#x27;t even have colored hair but I still use this because of the nutrients.</li>
    <li> Authentic and on time.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair clean and soft without changing hair color.</li>
    <li> The shampoo I received was not the real thing. The packaging as well as the smell and texture of the shampoo was fake/not original.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought this product after seeing it online.  It smells good and seems to work for my highlighted hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Biolage shampoo for years and knew right away that this is NOT the real Biolage. Very upset and disappointed that Amazon would allow imitation products to be sold on their website, especially after several bad reviews. The different/weird smell gave it away immediately and after investigating it, the writing on the bottle is different. I wouldn&#x27;t have even given this 1 star rating (no stars) but unfortunately you have to click on a star to even write a review. Horrible.</li>
    <li> I bought this to you on my hair that is color treated with both highlights and a semi-permanent glaze.  It does a great job preserving the color, and I really like the feel of the product.  However, the scent is not that appealing.  I really has no scent, and just reminds me of hair salon chemical smells.  It also is very thick, so I feel I am wasting a lot of product because it is difficult to dispense just a small amount of product.</li>
    <li> Always makes my hair nice and shiny, with no grease.... If I use another shampoo my hair gets greasy fast, but not with this one!</li>
    <li> My hair and scalp feel clean but shampoo smells a little too much like chemicals.  Works well with biolage conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo treats color treated gently, but doesn&#x27;t leave it limp and flat.</li>
    <li> Matrix color care shampoo is a great shampoo for anyone who colors their hair.  It helps hold the color without drying out the hair.  I would recommend this shampoo to anyone;I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the Biolage Color Care Shampoo. I think it is very drying for my highlighted hair. I&#x27;ve used other products that I think have worked better, and been gentler on my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this. What a waste of money. There was no noticeable difference in the speed of my color fading than there was with regular shampoo, and this shampoo left my hair feeling strangely unwashed; it felt dirtier after washing than it did before washing. Never again. I don&#x27;t even want to use the rest of the bottle. Incredibly disappointed. This shampoo seems to have no benefit over any other shampoo, AND it&#x27;s expensive. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a fake product, not sure if this is an isolated case but the product doesnt seem to be genuine. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> This product smells so bad I can not hardly tolerate it.  It does seem to work as a conditioner but it&#x27;s either a knock off or extremely old and stinky...almost rancid in smell.  If it weren&#x27;t for other products I use in my hair before drying I would not be able to tolerate this smell.  You need to check this and stop selling it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shampoos for colored hair of all time. Have been using this for 10+ years whether my hair is blonde or dark! Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great suds, no film or greasy residue. Good body</li>
    <li> Biolage products are by far my favorite.  I use this shampoo on a daily basis and have been for over a decade now.  I have thick straight hair and it works wonderful.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and gets hair really clean, but my only complaint is that it is really drying on hair.  I used it today for the first time and it dried out my hair the same way Matrix amplify did.  I am very disappointed.  Maybe I need to use it more and my hair will get used to it?  What I don&#x27;t understand is my hairdresser uses it on me when she colors my hair and it never feels as dry as it does today. I really hope I am wrong about this product, I want to like it badly.  If my hair is still dry after a months use I will go back to Redken Blonde Glam.</li>
    <li> Helps keep in my red color hair I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and I was recommended by a friend to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Salon quality and I&#x27;ve used  it before.  It&#x27;s up to the usual standard!  I needed it right away and it did the trick.</li>
