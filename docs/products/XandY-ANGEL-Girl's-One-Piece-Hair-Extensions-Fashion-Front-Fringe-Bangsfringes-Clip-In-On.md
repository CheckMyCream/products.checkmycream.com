      <li>On another note, shipping on this was fantastic.  </li>
      <li>and I just wanted something cheap.</li>
      <li>I recommend you secure them with a couple of bobby pins in addition to the clips that are attached.depending on the style you are trying to achieve you may need to cut them or take them to your hairdresser to get cut.color</li>
      <li>but wen i got it it looke like a light brown redish kinda colored.</li>

      <li>Overall good buy.</li>
      <li>It was an inexpensive way for me, a very visual person, to make a good decision on whether to cut bangs or not.</li>
      <li>I think these extensions are great for the price!You will have to work with them a little to get them to blend with your hair.</li>
      <li>Color was as expected and shown in the picture, so thats good.</li>
      <li>Actually when I came out the first time my own aunt didn&#x27;t realize I had it</li>
      <li>It takes a bit of time to get the hairline right to look believable, but you can definitely do it with these!  </li>
      <li>Great buy, but the bangs are really thick, might need to trim if you wanted thinner bangs.</li>
      <li>Honestly for this price I expected them to look horrid with my hair.</li>
      <li>This is my first hair extension.</li>
      <li>this short extension is so cute and it blends in with my hair making it look real</li>
      <li>I had read another reviewer&#x27;s advice about spraying some dry shampoo onto the hair extension in order to remove some of the synthetic hair shine and make it look more like real hair, it worked!</li>
      <li>The only problem I see is that is extremely straight, so even when I have my hair ironed, it doesnt kind of match my type of hair (that is naturally</li>
      <li>not able to wear this unless it is meant to be a joke.....would be laughed at.</li>
      <li>I had to throw this piece away, the clips wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair and tugged too much.</li>
      <li>Pulled out my real hair.</li>
      <li>The bangs did look real</li>
      <li>Matched my hair color very well.</li>
      <li>, it matched my hair really well.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t look real.  </li>
      <li>and I need to take a little more time to figure it out, but it matches my hair and looks real!</li>
      <li>I loved these bangs the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it wasn&#x27;t dark brown</li>
      <li>More realistic than expected!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very dark, so it doesn&#x27;t quite match my dark brown (but slightly more red) hair, which is fair.  </li>
      <li>The only thing is, I ordered the light brown for myself and it&#x27;s definitely not &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;... it&#x27;s pretty much brunette.</li>
      <li>really aware of colours, i asked for the dark brown and is still to light for me; fortunatelly, I can dye it with clothes colouring...</li>
      <li>and texture is realistic.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised at the quality for the price!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t blend it in very well to look natural</li>
      <li>Not in love with the tone of brown as it has a purplish hue, and I had to trim the bangs, they were super long (I am a petite 5&#x27;0\\&quot; with a small face/head)</li>
      <li>it was like a reddish burgandy color but other than that they cool</li>
      <li>looks natural just watch in the wind</li>
      <li>They feel like real hair and can either hang over the forehead or be brushed to the side.</li>
      <li>I have communicated with the seller and so far he/</li>
      <li>It looks like natural hair, not too shiny.</li>
      <li>The dark brown is true to it&#x27;s color.  </li>
      <li>Ease of use was good too and material not glossy or fake looking.</li>
      <li>just what i expected, color and style where just right.</li>
      <li>DOES NOT FIT RIGHT!</li>
      <li>The bangs are very thick, so I would suggest thinning them or having them layered a bit more.</li>
      <li>which was much sooner than the expected delivery date.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the dark brown because it looked almost black in the picture and when I got it, it is a light red-brownish color.</li>
      <li>I had ordered the Jessica Simpson bangs hair extension in the past and the clip that holds the top portion of the hair was not secure.</li>

    <li> Product color not as described.  Product returned and no refund despite several requests.</li>
    <li> very cute! looks natural just watch in the wind cause it does blow out of place</li>
    <li> Matched my hair color very well. might want to get a better attaching clip, but good condition otherwise.</li>
    <li> omg i love these , wish i didn&#x27;t dye my hair so i could wear them again!</li>
    <li> My bangs fell apart as soon as I put it on</li>
    <li> This is my first hair extension. didn&#x27;t expect it to be this big just for bangs. pretty good quality and makes me look really young with bangs</li>
    <li> I just got these bangs on the mail today and when I first opened the package, I was afraid the color would be off, but I was very surprised once I put them on how the color blended really well with my hair. After I trimmed them and put on a headband to conceal the clips on top, it looks amazing! I&#x27;ve worn bangs for years, and my own hair never looked this full before, AMAZING!</li>
    <li> the hair material is soft but it looks fake. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t let me wear it, he might think I look scary haha</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t look real.  I would advise to save your money on this one.  not able to wear this unless it is meant to be a joke.....would be laughed at.</li>
    <li> These are really really cute bangs However they are not brown.  The two stars are for not being dark brown but otherwise the quality is great and they are really cute.  I can&#x27;t use them because I have dark brown hair not red hair.</li>
    <li> Received different corl</li>
    <li> I Got these bangs in dark brown and they are perfect :) they match just right kinda a redish color to them but my hair has that too. U cans style them a lot of ways except I tried to straighten them and it kinda burned so I wouldnt use heat on them.</li>
    <li> I always have trouble trying to figure out ways to change up my hair style. These bangs are the solution to my dilemma! The quality is great and they match perfectly with my hair color. The seller does a great job of communicating and answering questions you might have as well. I recommend giving these a try!</li>
    <li> The piece looks very abrupt on the back ( raised straight line) and artificial, stands out. Does not blend into existing hair.  The clips don&#x27;t work properly. The piece falls off .  I have communicated with the seller and so far he/ she has not agreed to refund my money. He / she asked me to send photos ,which I did. But he /she keeps coming up with reasons to not refund.</li>
    <li> The dark brown is true to it&#x27;s color.  It&#x27;s very dark, so it doesn&#x27;t quite match my dark brown (but slightly more red) hair, which is fair.  I didn&#x27;t expect a perfect match.  It takes a bit of time to get the hairline right to look believable, but you can definitely do it with these!  The only thing is that you have to keep them side-swept.  They do not part well in the middle.    On another note, shipping on this was fantastic.  It took less than 3 weeks to get to me (North east, United States) which was much sooner than the expected delivery date.  I would definitely order from this shipper again.</li>
    <li> It fits nicely but the colors do not correspond to the pictures. I ordered the dark brown because it looked almost black in the picture and when I got it, it is a light red-brownish color. So it didnt match my hair color at all.</li>
    <li> The hair extension (dark brown) was just like how it was described and arrived in a timely fashion. I had read another reviewer&#x27;s advice about spraying some dry shampoo onto the hair extension in order to remove some of the synthetic hair shine and make it look more like real hair, it worked!</li>
    <li> I had ordered the Jessica Simpson bangs hair extension in the past and the clip that holds the top portion of the hair was not secure. So I ordered these to see if I would have the same problem and I did. They are cute bangs and people thought I had cut my hair. The bangs did look real but I have to wear a headband to hold the extension in place for it not to fall off. I would recommend them only if it is worn with a headband. The color matched perfectly.</li>
    <li> Honestly for this price I expected them to look horrid with my hair. But they don&#x27;t. Actually when I came out the first time my own aunt didn&#x27;t realize I had it in.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit shiny, but other then that it matched my hair perfect and I am very happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> I had to throw this piece away, the clips wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair and tugged too much. The length was also really odd and made me look like I was wearing a bad beatles wig. I will say this though, it matched my hair really well.</li>
    <li> It is not any sort of brown. I wouldn&#x27;t of mined if it was darker or lighter than my hair color; but it simply isn&#x27;t the color brown whatsoever. The hair piece is dark red. I wont be able to use it, and I will not buy from this seller again because they don&#x27;t describe their products correctly.</li>
    <li> Thank you. It was an inexpensive way for me, a very visual person, to make a good decision on whether to cut bangs or not.</li>
    <li> I choose the darkets brown but wen i got it it looke like a light brown redish kinda colored. I did liked the product though and it came before the chosen date so thats nice. I do recomend it its just the color can be tricky but good luck !</li>
    <li> i love it!! they match perfect to my hair. I rock them every where school church club parties they go with every hair style</li>
    <li> just what i expected, color and style where just right. Ease of use was good too and material not glossy or fake looking.</li>
    <li> I think these extensions are great for the price!You will have to work with them a little to get them to blend with your hair.I recommend you secure them with a couple of bobby pins in addition to the clips that are attached.depending on the style you are trying to achieve you may need to cut them or take them to your hairdresser to get cut.color and texture is realistic.</li>
    <li> this short extension is so cute and it blends in with my hair making it look real I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great buy, but the bangs are really thick, might need to trim if you wanted thinner bangs. It matches my hair fine, and good price.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m returning it . It doesn&#x27;t cover properly.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair so I got the brown bangs. They actually look red so I can&#x27;t wear them. Also it came a loooong time after.</li>
    <li> The color dark brown looks reddish brown, The hair clip fell off, I can replace it to have it sewn In again. I am not happy with this purchase, and would not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> looks like 99 cent store barbie hair</li>
    <li> Pulled out my real hair.</li>
    <li> I originally bought these because I wanted to see how I would look with bangs before cutting them and I just wanted something cheap. I was very surprised at the quality for the price! They feel like real hair and can either hang over the forehead or be brushed to the side. The color matched my hair perfectly as well! Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with this hair piece.</li>
    <li> CHEAP LOOKING AND DOES NOT FIT RIGHT!</li>
    <li> Great price feels silky and full but the cut is blunt and nothing like the picture style wise. So 3 stars is fair.</li>
    <li> OMG looks so fake. Looks like a tupee.</li>
    <li> It looks like natural hair, not too shiny. The only problem I see is that is extremely straight, so even when I have my hair ironed, it doesnt kind of match my type of hair (that is naturally wavy).&lt;br /&gt;Be really aware of colours, i asked for the dark brown and is still to light for me; fortunatelly, I can dye it with clothes colouring...</li>
    <li> The bangs are very thick, so I would suggest thinning them or having them layered a bit more. Otherwise, the clips attach very securely. Overall good buy.</li>
    <li> This hair piece is terrible . It looks like a tupay.. Do not buy this...</li>
    <li> More realistic than expected!</li>
    <li> The bangs were really long and the side bangs were much too long and thick. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear them out yet, but hopefully after trimming them a bit I can.</li>
    <li> Just looks fake. Way to glossy to be human hair and the cut looks a little unnatural on me.</li>
    <li> Must wear with something OVER the track- a headband is cute, scarf or beanies are too.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t blend it in very well to look natural, maybe it&#x27;s just me and I need to take a little more time to figure it out, but it matches my hair and looks real!</li>
    <li> I thought I would like these, but they look super cheap (which they are, so you get what you pay for).</li>
    <li> hair does not move to be arranged right&lt;br /&gt;color match was good&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend at this time. keep trying</li>
    <li> I really love these bangs; such nice quality and very comfortable. The only thing is, I ordered the light brown for myself and it&#x27;s definitely not &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;... it&#x27;s pretty much brunette.</li>
    <li> I loved these bangs the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it wasn&#x27;t dark brown it was like a reddish burgandy color but other than that they cool</li>
    <li> Not in love with the tone of brown as it has a purplish hue, and I had to trim the bangs, they were super long (I am a petite 5&#x27;0\\&quot; with a small face/head) but the piece was very easy to put on and take off and served its purpose!</li>
    <li> They are SO thick and the clip doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Color was as expected and shown in the picture, so thats good.</li>
