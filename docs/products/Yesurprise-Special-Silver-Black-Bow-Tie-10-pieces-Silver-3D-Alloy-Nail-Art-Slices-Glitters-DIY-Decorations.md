    <li> I really like how this fits my nails.</li>
    <li> These bows are perfect size for nail art!  They&#x27;re shiny, light weight and flat on the back.  Easy to glue on.  I want to buy more since I did actually lose 2 I glued on my nails.  :(  That&#x27;s my fault tho!  I always hope to keep a good eye on them and check them to make sure they&#x27;re secure, but, I love them so much I don&#x27;t mind purchasing them again!</li>
    <li> I love these little thingys! lol&lt;br /&gt;But to get them to stay you have to put lots and lots and lots of nail glue on the to make them stay.&lt;br /&gt;They stay on my toes for about a week. The good thing is that you realize when they come off and you can&lt;br /&gt;find them and recycle them for another fashionable week!</li>
    <li> They are to big for my nails, but they are beautiful, this works maybe for cell phones o for people with big finger nails</li>

    <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  I could not find anything like this in my area anywhere.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to bling up their nail art at an affordable price.  I received my items very quickly and am very happy with them. They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  I am so happy....</li>
