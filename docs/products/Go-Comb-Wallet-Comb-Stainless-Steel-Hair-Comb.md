      <li>This beautiful, sleek, smooth, well built and most serviceable wonder fits in my wallet just like a credit card.</li>
      <li>This is a very light weight and functional comb.  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy if you use it for head hair, not entangled beard :)</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have too many things in my pockets.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this comb.</li>
      <li>(hence the name I guess).  :)&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
      <li>5 stars would be given if the comb retained beard oil better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay in a pinch, but it&#x27;s more like afro-pick spacing than any fine-toothed comb I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
      <li>Works for my beard, but I would like to get more teeth pre inch.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve used this thing.</li>
      <li>Elegant lines and edges.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s far more sturdy than cheap, plastic ones, and its size is perfect, fitting in my wallet for easy access and convenience.</li>
      <li>I bought it because I grew my beard out in the spring, and needed to give it some combing to keep it from becoming unwieldy.</li>
      <li>This is a really easy way to keep track of your comb.  </li>
      <li>That easy job is to carry a comb, without forgetting it, or losing it.</li>
      <li>This is a really cute present to give and a great stocking stuffer.  </li>
      <li>not as fine toothed as i would have like but serviceable when you&#x27;re out and have no comb</li>
      <li>The teeth are smooth and easy on my beard, and holds up fine in my wallet all day.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.</li>
      <li>Awesome little comb for my beard.</li>
      <li>This is a great back up comb for my beard.</li>
      <li>Fits great in my urban survival tin or wallet.</li>
      <li>I have seen others around, but they are plastic or cheap metal.</li>
      <li>Right size, good quality, fair performance the teeth are too square giving them sharp edges which pull and scrape the hair and damage it.</li>
      <li>Excellently crafted comb that fits right into any wallet as the comb is the exact same size as a normal credit</li>
      <li>Put it in my wallet and it bent really quick smh</li>
      <li>bends easy for stainless steel.</li>
      <li>Bends a little easy to flatten out and really good for medium beards</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>Great little</li>
      <li>The teeth aren&#x27;t as fine as most beard combs, but they do work well for coarse hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tough and lightweight and it fits perfectly in any wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Same size as a credit card and tits fits nicely in your wallet.</li>
      <li>I ended up getting a good quality wooded comb to replace this and now this one sits on shelf simply because it cost too much to toss into the recycling bin.</li>
      <li>It also comes in really handy to have around when a man&#x27;s out and about (or a woman with short hair) and need to straighten her hair.</li>
      <li>I tend to keep my hair shaved or too short to require combing, so I don&#x27;t usually own or carry combs.</li>
      <li>Just right for both beard and head.</li>
      <li>I am a very smart (Mensa qualified IQ) person.</li>
      <li>Teeth are just fine enough and smooth against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>(as my mom would most likely</li>
      <li>Wooden combs are better for oiled beards, but I knew this going in to this purchase</li>
      <li>metal seems to be coated with something at eliminates static which is a BIG plus for the winter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure, one might be in another pants pocket, but not the pants I wore last or want to wear today.</li>
      <li>but still works very well!</li>
      <li>only con I have for it, is that if you are a user of any kind of beard oil, which every bearded gentleman should be, the metal needs to be wiped clean before placing it back into any leather wallet.</li>
      <li>If I have a little bit of product in my hair such as suavecitos brilliant cream...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep in the wallet as it is the same size as a metal credit</li>
      <li>I have gone through dozens of the ACE plastic combs over the past few months, and it&#x27;s nice to have this handy in my wallet for quick touch ups.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tines (?) are a bit wide but it works. Not a substitute for a good horn comb. Convenient.</li>
    <li> Bends a little easy to flatten out and really good for medium beards</li>
    <li> Put it in my wallet and it bent really quick smh</li>
    <li> If, like, me, you are dreadfully absent-minded, this thing is all kinds of useful. It fits in your wallet just like a credit card, and you always have a comb with you. I have fine, straight hair that often sticks up at ridiculous angles if I don&#x27;t keep an eye on it. I also regularly forget to put a comb in my pocket in the morning, so I often walk around town looking like I&#x27;ve stuck my finger in an electrical socket. Now that I have this I always have a back-up to keep the Einstein-like creeping hairs at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side? The &amp;#34;fine-toothed&amp;#34; version is not even vaguely fine-toothed. It&#x27;s okay in a pinch, but it&#x27;s more like afro-pick spacing than any fine-toothed comb I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> Great little comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always feared growing out a beard due to how frizzy and out of control mine sometimes gets. However, the go-comb is awesome for keeping my mountain man look in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far more sturdy than cheap, plastic ones, and its size is perfect, fitting in my wallet for easy access and convenience. Only complaint is the tines seem a bit on the sharp side, but whatever. A tough neck is manly.</li>
    <li> Comb fits well into my wallet which is a plus, considering I&#x27;ve lost several combs already. The teeth aren&#x27;t as fine as most beard combs, but they do work well for coarse hair. I ordered the comb in stainless steel but I was sent a blue comb...not a big deal since it&#x27;s in my wallet most of the time and I don&#x27;t mind the color. The material is thin and pretty flimsy but holds up well if you don&#x27;t plan on bending it. With that being said, if it&#x27;s not kept somewhere secure (wallet), it will definitely bend after a while. I&#x27;m also not thrilled it&#x27;s not an American-made product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Well constructed, durable, small, and thin enough to take with you anywhere!</li>
    <li> This is a very light weight and functional comb.  If I didn&#x27;t know it was SS, I&#x27;d think it was titanium.  Fits nicely in my travel kit.  The teeth are great for my fine hair.  You can carry it in your wallet like a credit card.</li>
    <li> perfect size and just does what you need it to do.</li>
    <li> Great wallet comb.  Very solid and won&#x27;t bend.  Same size as a credit card and tits fits nicely in your wallet.</li>
    <li> 1) Stainless steel is not going to fall apart like all the &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; combs I usually buy.&lt;br /&gt;2) Fits in my wallet --don&#x27;t need to remember to bring it with me.&lt;br /&gt;3) Teeth are just fine enough and smooth against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t believe how hard it was to find a good, quality beard comb. Wallet compatibility is a welcome bonus. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I&#x27;m reviewing the &amp;#34;fine toothed&amp;#34; model specifically</li>
    <li> Very nice, lovely for beard and mustache, excellent for wallet.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Better than I expected.  It fits perfect in my money clip.  Just right for both beard and head.</li>
    <li> Wish they made one with finer teeth but this is great. Probably works as a credit card security device also if kept on the back side of the wallet.</li>
    <li> This is a great back up comb for my beard. It&#x27;s easy to keep in the wallet as it is the same size as a metal credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have for it, is that if you are a user of any kind of beard oil, which every bearded gentleman should be, the metal needs to be wiped clean before placing it back into any leather wallet. Wooden combs are better for oiled beards, but I knew this going in to this purchase so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> Love this darn thing!</li>
    <li> very cool little comb. perfectly credit card sized</li>
    <li> not as fine toothed as i would have like but serviceable when you&#x27;re out and have no comb</li>
    <li> Love this thing! I never carry a wallet I only use a credit card sleeve with my credit card and license and this fits right in with so I always have it when I need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side, it will bend a bit if you sit on it or lean against something. Also I have very thick, coarse beard hair and it tends to get caught in it but still works very well!</li>
    <li> This is a great idea and a good quality comb. However, I ordered the fine tooth &amp;#34;beard comb&amp;#34; and unfortunately it seemed  to consistently snag strands of hair when I used it. By this, I don&#x27;t mean the entire comb was snagging from my beard being curly, but more so that single individual strands of hair would get caught in the teeth of the comb where they meet at the base and end up getting pulled right out. Not a good thing to risk having happen to something that has taken much time and care to achieve. I ended up getting a good quality wooded comb to replace this and now this one sits on shelf simply because it cost too much to toss into the recycling bin. Save your money. Pass on this for beard use.</li>
    <li> Great, fits inside my wallet, also i suspect it will work as an RFID shield. i always have short hair but it gets a little long sometimes, this is nice to have on hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little sharp for the scalp, but pulls my beard hair. Fits well in my saddleback leather wallet, but has been relegated to emergencies only.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in the wallet. I use it at home and on the go. 5 stars would be given if the comb retained beard oil better. The teeth are pretty wide and spaced fairly far apart for a beard comb to prevent snags but beard oil is difficult to keep in the tines to apply to your beard.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Small, compact, stylish. But kind of pulls the hair.</li>
    <li> Fits great in my urban survival tin or wallet. This is part of my EDC when wearing a suit. Great in combination with a bladeo knife and credit card flashlight.</li>
    <li> Awesome little comb for my beard. Fits perfectly in my wallet!</li>
    <li> I have pretty long hair, and ride my motorcycle often. If I have a little bit of product in my hair such as suavecitos brilliant cream... I bust out this little credit card sized come running through my hair a couple times with or without water and it&#x27;s back to normal! I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve used this thing. It stays in my wallet all the time. It did get slightly bent one time when I lent it to somebody and they sat on it. No problem, I just bent it back and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.</li>
    <li> This came today. Not sure if it&#x27;s actually stainless steel as I can bend it one handed. It&#x27;s a tight fit in my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Good but not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> It works! It fits in your wallet!! Perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I keep it in my wallet and accidentally try to pay with it. It almost works, almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nifty for the convenience of brushing your beard so it does not look unkempt.</li>
    <li> I have seen others around, but they are plastic or cheap metal. This one is stainless, firm enough to comb long hair, and fits right into a credit card slot in a purse too small to carry a brush. Perfect. I don&#x27;t like carrying around bulky purses.</li>
    <li> BE GENTLE WHEN YOU USE THIS, REMEMBER IT IS METAL.  IT DEFINATELY HAS A COOLNESS FACTOR AND IS SMALL ENOUGH THAT IT FITS IN MY TRAYVAX WALLET SO WHEN I AM OUT AND ABOUT I CAN SNEAK IN A QUICK BEARD GROOMING WITHOUT LOOKING TOO OBVIOUS.  lIKE I SAID EARLIER, THIS IS METAL SO YOU CANT GO JAMMING THIS THING INTO YOUR BEARD OR MOUSTACHE WHEN COMBING IT.  RESPECT IT AND IT WILL RESPECT YOU!</li>
    <li> Convenient and quality product</li>
    <li> Right size, good quality, fair performance the teeth are too square giving them sharp edges which pull and scrape the hair and damage it.</li>
    <li> This is a really cute present to give and a great stocking stuffer.  It also comes in really handy to have around when a man&#x27;s out and about (or a woman with short hair) and need to straighten her hair.</li>
    <li> Excellently crafted comb that fits right into any wallet as the comb is the exact same size as a normal credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually did cut my mustache off but will regrow it again for Movember and this baby will make a triumphant return!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a serious or even amateur beard/mustache farmer, this comb is for you.</li>
    <li> I thought that the teeth on this comb would be closer and finer than they actually are. I have gone through dozens of the ACE plastic combs over the past few months, and it&#x27;s nice to have this handy in my wallet for quick touch ups.</li>
    <li> I got this for my beard comb.  It is handy to keep it in the wallet so I don&#x27;t have too many things in my pockets.  They dip the steel in some sort of soft clear plastic so that it is not sharp or rough.  I hope the plastic coating lasts a long time--don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
    <li> A little to flimsy for my taste, any amount of pressure and this thing will bend in half... the aluminum used is extremely frail. However it fits perfectly in the wallet just like a credit card.</li>
    <li> Ever since I got Go-Comb, the number of women petting my beard has increased dramatically. 10/10 would pet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as fine-toothed as I was expecting. Works for my beard, but I would like to get more teeth pre inch.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;fine-toothed&amp;#34; comb is one of the coarsest-toothed combs I own.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a louse comb, but it doesn&#x27;t compare with a normal medium-toothed pocket comb. The stainless steel isn&#x27;t smoothly finished, so instead it&#x27;s coated with a heavy coating of plastic.  I don&#x27;t expect it to wear well if I keep it in my wallet, where credit cards get scuffed.</li>
    <li> I bit overpriced (-1 star) other then that it is awesome. Fits in my front pocket wallet and doesn&#x27;t make it any bigger (fatter)</li>
    <li> The go comb works great for me. I have the fine toothed version and it works great for my beard to look presentable on the go. The size of a credit card is great so it fits in your wallet.</li>
    <li> Super cute and awesome!</li>
    <li> I used to kinda pick at my beard as a tick of mine, and i&#x27;d end up with thin patches - not sexy.  Now, I can rub it down with my favorite aftershave and luxuriate in passing moments, perhaps drawing the eye of a female pogonophile whilst a draw the steel teeth of the comb through the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect..Works very well...</li>
    <li> bends easy for stainless steel.</li>
    <li> This is a really easy way to keep track of your comb.  Fits neatly in one credit card space of a wallet.</li>
    <li> Comb came in a shoe box size cardboard box with bubble wrap. I thought they had forgotten to put in the comb which I eventually found under one of the box flaps. Great comb fit my wallet perfectly. .</li>
    <li> Excellent idea, and will make a great stocking stuffer. I would recommend getting the fine tooth version as this is the perfect amount and space between teeth. Yes it is metal so it will bend with decent pressure..but that&#x27;s just like any thin metal object. This is a Christmas gift for someone who is always fussing with his hair wanting it to be perfect - this will make it a lot easier for him!</li>
    <li> The comb is nice as a present, but quite thick to fit in credit card department of my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy, but it hurted my beard when I tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy if you use it for head hair, not entangled beard :)</li>
    <li> These combs are so sleek! They slip into wallets or phone cases...anywhere you can carry a credit card. Elegant lines and edges. I bought 5 for Christmas gifts! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> MUCH nicer than v.1.0. This version has finer tines and fits nicely in my credit card wallet.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no excuse to look messy now! (as my mom would most likely say).&lt;br /&gt;The metal seems to be coated with something at eliminates static which is a BIG plus for the winter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all around the perfect comb to carry around. (hence the name I guess).  :)&lt;br /&gt;Glad I picked one up.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it was a little more firm as it does bend, but it does its job of being a good beard comb.</li>
    <li> I was worried this thing was either going to be too flimsy or too heavy. But I love this comb! It&#x27;s tough and lightweight and it fits perfectly in any wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come with any protective sleeve other than the original wrapping so if you use beard balm it may get a little oil residue. I recommend putting  it in a separate compartment of your wallet away from any credit cards and such.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway like I mentioned.... love this comb! Great deal</li>
    <li> use it for my beard and keep it handy in the wallet. I also got the plastic one from the same manufacturer and the this one, metal, is the thinner one with finer teeth and of course does not bend. gave the plastic one away as a gift.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this comb.  The teeth are smooth and easy on my beard, and holds up fine in my wallet all day.</li>
    <li> Very handy I use it from time to time...Only bad this is it get struck in my wallet some times lol</li>
    <li> This was an answer to prayer, believe it or not. I am a very smart (Mensa qualified IQ) person. Do you have any idea how frustrated a very smart person can get when they fail at doing one of the easiest of life&#x27;s tasks? That easy job is to carry a comb, without forgetting it, or losing it. How hard can that be? Sure, one might be in another pants pocket, but not the pants I wore last or want to wear today. I feel like I have purchased enough small black plastic pocket combs to have one in every pocket of every pair of pants I ever wore, with enough left over to fill a bathtub. I was trying to avoid investing in yet another bag of combs. Is there not a better way? I was asking for some divine guidance to resolve the personal affront to my self esteem that the losing of the next bag of combs will yield, when I found the Go-Comb. Combs come and go, but my wallet I can manage to hold on to. This beautiful, sleek, smooth, well built and most serviceable wonder fits in my wallet just like a credit card. I giggle like a child every time I open my wallet and see my comb. It has turned my comb sorrow into comb joy. It is the Ultimate Everyday Comb, because it will actually be with me every day!  I just looked in my wallet, it is still there! I cannot put a price on the aggravation averted and the happiness that comes with this brilliant invention.</li>
    <li> Love this comb. I bought it because I grew my beard out in the spring, and needed to give it some combing to keep it from becoming unwieldy. I tend to keep my hair shaved or too short to require combing, so I don&#x27;t usually own or carry combs. So I needed something that would be handy to carry without losing it or forgetting to take it with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just the best idea for a comb. Its credit card size lets you slip it into your wallet so you always have it.</li>
    <li> This totally satisfies my needs. I didn&#x27;t want to carry a plastic comb in my pocket that would end up breaking. And this comb fits perfectly in my aluminum card holder! This is exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> its wallet sized, and does everything you would imagine a comb could do, like straighten out hair. It&#x27;s not very useful now since i shaved off the beard, but it will be again, and that&#x27;s all i can really ask of it, to be there when i need it.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy credit card comb that is great for on the go, just leave it in your wallet and its there when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that its best to get the fine toothed version because even in the fine toothed one the teeth are farther apart then you expect; however it still does the job of any comb.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good buy defiantly nice to have in case you need a comb.</li>
    <li> i ordered two of these and lost them both, its one of those items that are so easy to loose...i am a man with short-medium length straight hair and i found the fine tooth to not be quite thin enough, still a little to far apart than i would like. i will probably not order a third one.</li>
