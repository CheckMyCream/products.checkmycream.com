### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have been VERY happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>It may work great to keep your skin from getting burned, but man do you look like a shined up porn star with how greasy it is.</li>
      <li>It also smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash or zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, EWG gave it a great rating.  </li>
      <li>The best reason to keep using this sunscreen :)</li>
      <li>So that is good.</li>
      <li>It did not occur to me that the sunscreen was not working because I had trusted the good rating on ewg.</li>
      <li>I hope this is still good...</li>
      <li>I found this product which has received many great reviews.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was getting a good product for the price, but yikes, you sure don&#x27;t get a lot of product for your money.</li>
      <li>but it was effective against sunburn.</li>
      <li>I saw Loving Naturals received a top rating from the Environmental Working Group</li>
      <li>Under the hot and bright Hawaiian sun, Loving Naturals never gave up.  </li>
      <li>Against my better judgement, I used it anyway.</li>
      <li>I guess I should have paid more attention to the ounces.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even exactly sure how to describe it.</li>
      <li>We went snorkeling most of the time and this kept me from getting sunburned</li>
      <li>I found that it goes on better when I use a dab of Jojoba oil then apply.</li>
      <li>for the love of God, do NOT get it in your eyes.</li>
      <li>We all had a good laugh at my child&#x27;s fuzzy appearance.</li>
      <li>A lot of people seem to be happy with this sunscreen so it could just be that my son&#x27;s skin is not compatible with this particular product.</li>
      <li>Well, I will start with the good first.</li>
      <li>I use this for my kids and it rubs in VERY quickly.  </li>
      <li>was in florida on vacation when used, (live farther north) and am somewhat fair skinned.</li>
      <li>but I am fine with that..</li>
      <li>In summary, this wonderful product remains my tween&#x27;s sunscreen of choice for everyday use... but not for playing soccer.</li>
      <li>The consistency of the product is good and the natural oils seem to have a moisturizing effect on my skin but without making it greasy.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite sunblock!</li>
      <li>Therefore I ordered it and was excited to try it.  </li>
      <li>Loving Naturals Clear Body sunscreen was a hit with my kids.</li>
      <li>This is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t have cancer causing ingredients and perfumes and dyes like almost all of the other sunscreens on the market.  </li>
      <li>It feels great on the skin...but needs further testing under normal conditions for me to say for sure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was hard to wash off in the shower, but I felt like this was more of a good thing, as it was proof that it stayed on all day.</li>
      <li>Once on, it feels kind of sticky but the stickiness gets better after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>this is the reason for the low rating, it kind of makes my skin feel almost burn-like.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultimately, it is my own fault for using an oil based sunscreen, but I thought I would save others from the same mistake</li>
      <li>older son is completely fine with it, so I can keep using this sunscreen on him until it is finished.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put it on right before going to the beach</li>
      <li>I am pasty white and burn very easily.  </li>
      <li>It works well, is very easy to apply, and rubs in well without leave a white film.</li>
      <li>This new version goes on clear, but it not as effective.  </li>
      <li>I loved the previous formula - except for the waiting time for the whitish color to disappear  - but it worked.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only does Loving Naturals deliver on its clear promise, it protects more completely and longer than the Badger sunscreen I had been using.</li>
      <li>Very very greasy.</li>
      <li>I read the ingredients on the label, and noticed that the first listed was grapeseed oil.</li>
      <li>but at much higher prices.  </li>
      <li>but I used it first.</li>
      <li>Which I found strange because it says safe for babies.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like how it rubs in easily and has fewer chemicals than traditional brands.</li>
      <li>But I am writing this completely out of self-interest so people will buy this product and it becomes more easily available and maybe the price will come down a bit.</li>
      <li>This is very greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have a child who is now a tween and has become very self-conscious of having sun screen visible on the face.</li>
      <li>Though, when I touch things after I put it on it is very greasy and you can really tell.</li>
      <li>that being said, this is a very \\&quot;odd\\&quot; sunblock.</li>
      <li>I had been using California Baby on my two boys and it&#x27;s very pricy...</li>
      <li>soooooooo smooth and no white residue!</li>
      <li>It leaves this very shiny look and feels a bit itcky.</li>
      <li>far, I haven&#x27;t found a waterproof sunscreen that isn&#x27;t expensive and do a good job in covering me from the sun, which is why I think this is a okay one to use.  </li>
      <li>Love that this is all natural but it leaves a white mark and that can look goofy on already pale skin.</li>
      <li>This is the first natural one I have tried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We live in the Pac NW so we don&#x27;t see the sun very often.  </li>
      <li>Yeah, it was slightly oily, but I didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was drowning under a ton of axle grease (unlike most \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreens).  </li>
      <li>The main problem I have with it, and</li>
      <li>Up till this year, we pretty much only used Badger, which we love but leaves a white tint that only disappears with much rubbing.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have read the description a little closer because the bottle is only 2 ounces, so I was glad I had purchased 2 bottles!  </li>
      <li>The slight stickiness that had never bothers us before was just enough to hold fast to all the very light particles kicked up in the air.</li>
      <li>I took him to the doctor, and he said it must be an allergic reaction to the new sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I want to say start by saying I live in an area when it isn&#x27;t really sunny or anything but wanted to protect my skin daily from the sun.</li>
      <li>and it was advertised as clear</li>
      <li>and I am too old to try to pass for a Goth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was concerned with the size because of the price, but so far it is not unreasonable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product really kept out the sun which is why I bought it though it does not spread on like regular store shelf products.</li>
      <li>I do not have a ghostly appearance that some natural sunscreens give and have not burned at all since using.  </li>
      <li>especially given how much outdoor activities they have in the summer.  </li>
      <li>I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars to this product because I have found one situation where the stickiness is an issue: After playing soccer on a grassy field near our house, my child was covered with tiny pieces of grass, pollen, dust, etc.</li>
      <li>Also, it is VERY greasy as other users have mentioned.</li>
      <li>So far no major issues using it.  </li>
      <li>I would step outside with this on my face without patting it down first</li>
      <li>During the first week, I only applied a little on my kid&#x27;s before I sent them off to preschool.</li>
      <li>Okay, let&#x27;s start with the bad first.  </li>

<li> Not only do I have skin that is insanely sensitive to fragrance and the usual sunscreen chemicals, I also have photodermatitis.</li>

<li> So be careful.</li>
<li> After a few months, the solid and liquid separated but I just shake well and use.  </li>
<li> expensive and worth it</li>
<li> This sunblock left my skin very slightly greasy and lightened my skin a shade or two.  </li>
<li> It is such a hard plastic that I could not squeeze out the lotion as it emptied unless I used both hands and even put it on a counter then pushed on it.</li>
<li> The sunscreen is thick so little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Both of those products are a little pasty in texture and have a clay smell that my kids can&#x27;t stand.</li>
<li> If you do decide to use this, however, please pay close attention to your little one and stop using it if you notice any redness or skin tone changes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even think I used it everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading plenty of reviews about organic sunscreens, I went with this one.  I like how it rubs in easily and has fewer chemicals than traditional brands. The only issue I have with it is the packaging. It is a very rigid bottle so getting the last ounce of an already small package will be difficult and this is an expensive product so I&#x27;d like to get all I can out of it.</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail.  And I didn&#x27;t realize when I was paying the $12.99 for 2.5 ounces, which is more expensive than the typical sunscreen in stores near me, that it would be half the size of the normal sunscreen...but at much higher prices.  Now, I have a baby size bottle that will be gone after 3 or 4 uses.  It&#x27;s a shame they charge a lot but give you very little in return.  Now I hope this product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Okay, let&#x27;s start with the bad first.  This sunblock left my skin very slightly greasy and lightened my skin a shade or two.  Oh, and the glittery sheen made me feel like an emo vampire.  Seriously, I looked like I was tastefully covered in stripper dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works.  Under the hot and bright Hawaiian sun, Loving Naturals never gave up.  Yeah, it was slightly oily, but I didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was drowning under a ton of axle grease (unlike most \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreens).  I put it on right before going to the beach and it stayed on through snorkeling, surfing, and paddleboarding.  Sand didn&#x27;t stick to it very well and after a few minutes, my hands weren&#x27;t too greasy to handle a camera.  It was hard to wash off in the shower, but I felt like this was more of a good thing, as it was proof that it stayed on all day.</li>
    <li> I use this for my kids and it rubs in VERY quickly.  Nothing is worse than trying to get sunblock to rub in on a screaming kid.  This is my new favorite sunblock!</li>
    <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but was shocked at how small a bottle this is. I guess I should have paid more attention to the ounces. I thought I was getting a good product for the price, but yikes, you sure don&#x27;t get a lot of product for your money.</li>
    <li> BABY BURNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am LIVID. I did quite a lot of research on the ewg website looking for the safest sunscreen products for babies and toddlers and purchased this on Amazon. After using this for a couple of hours at the park, my toddler&#x27;s face was RED. It did not occur to me that the sunscreen was not working because I had trusted the good rating on ewg. However, after playing for couple of hours at the zoo the next week, his face was RED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! I am not misusing the product in anyway. 1) I apply sunscreen 20 minutes before we go out in the sun. 2) We play in the sun and I apply his sunscreen every 50minutes ~ 1 hour. A lot of people seem to be happy with this sunscreen so it could just be that my son&#x27;s skin is not compatible with this particular product. If you do decide to use this, however, please pay close attention to your little one and stop using it if you notice any redness or skin tone changes. Also, it is VERY greasy as other users have mentioned.</li>
    <li> soooooooo smooth and no white residue!</li>
    <li> I had been using California Baby on my two boys and it&#x27;s very pricy...especially given how much outdoor activities they have in the summer.  I found this product which has received many great reviews.  Also, EWG gave it a great rating.  Therefore I ordered it and was excited to try it.  During the first week, I only applied a little on my kid&#x27;s before I sent them off to preschool. I don&#x27;t even think I used it everyday. I felt some colorless bumps on my younger son&#x27;s forearms, but I didn&#x27;t give it any thoughts.  The next week, we went to a birthday party at a park, so I applied and reapplied a lot of sunscreen on my kids.  That evening, my younger sons had the bumps all over his arms, legs and even his body.  He wasn&#x27;t itchy or in any pain.  I took him to the doctor, and he said it must be an allergic reaction to the new sunscreen.  He asked me to stop using it and the bumps will go away a week or so by itself.&lt;br /&gt;My older son is completely fine with it, so I can keep using this sunscreen on him until it is finished.&lt;br /&gt;This is a bummer because now I have to go back to the expensive California Baby.</li>
    <li> Very very greasy. Its really only suited if your going to the beach I would step outside with this on my face without patting it down first</li>
    <li> This product really kept out the sun which is why I bought it though it does not spread on like regular store shelf products. I think that is because of the chemicals left out of it. It stays on sticky and a bit white but I am fine with that..health comes 1st. I have been applying a bit of moisturizer on with it and the stickiness and whiteness goes away. The biggest complaint I have is with the plastic the lotion is in. It is such a hard plastic that I could not squeeze out the lotion as it emptied unless I used both hands and even put it on a counter then pushed on it. Eventually I cut open the plastic knowing that there was quite a few applications left in it and scooped it out with my finger. I would not buy this again unless it was in a different bottle.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all, it was like zinc and baby oil, caused my skin to break out, so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for our trip to Hawaii.  I am pasty white and burn very easily.  We live in the Pac NW so we don&#x27;t see the sun very often.  I put this on my face every morning and at least another time throughout the day.  We went snorkeling most of the time and this kept me from getting sunburned and I was in and out of the water all day long!  I wish I would have read the description a little closer because the bottle is only 2 ounces, so I was glad I had purchased 2 bottles!  I did put some on my arms and legs as well and I used almost both bottles in the span of a week.  I wish the bottle was a little bigger!</li>
    <li> expensive and worth it</li>
    <li> It may work great to keep your skin from getting burned, but man do you look like a shined up porn star with how greasy it is. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Well, I will start with the good first. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, to the bad. I want to say start by saying I live in an area when it isn&#x27;t really sunny or anything but wanted to protect my skin daily from the sun. It has been 100+ lately (which isn&#x27;t very normal for NC) I&#x27;ve also been on this thing where I am trying to rid my home of chemicals, especially those I am putting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this is a very \\&quot;odd\\&quot; sunblock. This is the first natural one I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;ll mention the size. I bought the 2.4 size. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it it still has some in it. So that is good. I was concerned with the size because of the price, but so far it is not unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday. It is VERY thick. I found that it goes on better when I use a dab of Jojoba oil then apply. It leaves this very shiny look and feels a bit itcky. I don&#x27;t mind this. Though, when I touch things after I put it on it is very greasy and you can really tell. (Note:I do mean if it greasy WITHOUT Jojoba as well. So it is NOT the Jojoba oil that is making it greasy) The main problem I have with it, and this is the reason for the low rating, it kind of makes my skin feel almost burn-like. It is very uncomfortable.  Also, I get red, especially on my face. I&#x27;m not even exactly sure how to describe it. But I do not like it. It hurts. But, I have noticed that if I wear it and take it off it isn&#x27;t AS bad. But if I leave it on for a few hours, it is a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;Especially the redness of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the love of God, do NOT get it in your eyes. I was sweating pretty badly and must have had some too close to my eyes and it burned very, very badly. Which I found strange because it says safe for babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to finish it. I doubt I will though. Unless something changes.  I think I am just going to make my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product though. Just not for me. I think you should tryit and see how it works. But others have also reported reacations to it. So be careful.</li>
    <li> I loved the previous formula - except for the waiting time for the whitish color to disappear  - but it worked.  This new version goes on clear, but it not as effective.  I am very sensitive to the sun, so this was not strong enough for me for the summer sun.</li>
    <li> Not only do I have skin that is insanely sensitive to fragrance and the usual sunscreen chemicals, I also have photodermatitis. I am literally allergic to the sun and break out in a horribly itchy rash when I am overexposed to UV rays. For years, I have put up with non-chemical sunscreens which leave my a ghostly mask on my brown skin and I am too old to try to pass for a Goth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Loving Naturals received a top rating from the Environmental Working Group and it was advertised as clear, I decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t really believe a non-chemical, non-nano sunscreen could truly be clear, but I was somewhat desperate to stop my family from laughing at me whenever I wore sunscreen in their presence. (Yeah, I don&#x27;t visit them much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does Loving Naturals deliver on its clear promise, it protects more completely and longer than the Badger sunscreen I had been using. It also smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash or zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if I read this review, I would think I was a plant. But I am writing this completely out of self-interest so people will buy this product and it becomes more easily available and maybe the price will come down a bit. The one drawback is the price of the tiny squeeze bottle. But it is a small price to pay for the ability to walk in the sun without fear of rashes or burns.</li>
    <li> For my children, I only use all-natural sun screens. Up till this year, we pretty much only used Badger, which we love but leaves a white tint that only disappears with much rubbing. I have a child who is now a tween and has become very self-conscious of having sun screen visible on the face. Thus, I began searching for all-natural sunscreens that would rub in well. I tried Jason (mineral) and All Terrain Kidsport. Both of those products are a little pasty in texture and have a clay smell that my kids can&#x27;t stand. Loving Naturals Clear Body sunscreen was a hit with my kids. It works well, is very easy to apply, and rubs in well without leave a white film. Once on, it feels kind of sticky but the stickiness gets better after a few minutes. This stickiness \\&quot;general\\&quot; has not been an issue. I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars to this product because I have found one situation where the stickiness is an issue: After playing soccer on a grassy field near our house, my child was covered with tiny pieces of grass, pollen, dust, etc. The slight stickiness that had never bothers us before was just enough to hold fast to all the very light particles kicked up in the air. We all had a good laugh at my child&#x27;s fuzzy appearance. In summary, this wonderful product remains my tween&#x27;s sunscreen of choice for everyday use... but not for playing soccer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t have cancer causing ingredients and perfumes and dyes like almost all of the other sunscreens on the market.  No 5 star rating because it is ridiculously expensive for such a small container.</li>
    <li> This is very greasy.  I will use it on my neck and shoulders, but I had purchased it for my face, and for the size it&#x27;s not a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our toddler son but I used it first. I felt it was quite oily and greasy but it was effective against sunburn. I don&#x27;t know if I would use it again bc it felt heavy on my skin even after I used a baby wipe to try to wipe it off!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive. So far no major issues using it.  I use this on my face and neck living in AZ is hard on the skin.</li>
    <li> Love that this is all natural but it leaves a white mark and that can look goofy on already pale skin.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen is thick so little goes a long way.  I put this on one day and went swimming and nothing got into my eyes.  I don&#x27;t like how sticky this is and it takes a while for this sunscreen to dry (unless I put VERY little but that would just makes using a sunscreen meaningless).  After a few months, the solid and liquid separated but I just shake well and use.  Summer is coming up so I will be using that same sunscreen.  I hope this is still good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t found a waterproof sunscreen that isn&#x27;t expensive and do a good job in covering me from the sun, which is why I think this is a okay one to use.  Also I didn&#x27;t break out after using this on my face!  The best reason to keep using this sunscreen :)</li>
    <li> I have been VERY happy with this product.  I do not have a ghostly appearance that some natural sunscreens give and have not burned at all since using.  The consistency of the product is good and the natural oils seem to have a moisturizing effect on my skin but without making it greasy.  I just forgo my usual moisturizer in the morning and am all set.  I am planning to purchase this product again and have been telling others about it too.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. It&#x27;s in a convenient bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Although I can&#x27;t &#x27;totally&#x27; vouge for the effectiveness yet.&lt;br /&gt;I was in florida on vacation when used, (live farther north) and am somewhat fair skinned. But the big &amp;#34;if&amp;#34; was that I had to take medicine at the time which causes sun sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Still... i did not get burned, but got red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it works well. It feels great on the skin...but needs further testing under normal conditions for me to say for sure.&lt;br /&gt;My impression though is that it does work well.</li>
    <li> I read the ingredients on the label, and noticed that the first listed was grapeseed oil. The next was sunflower oil. Against my better judgement, I used it anyway. Just got one of the worst sunburns I can remember. It was not for a lack of reapplying either. I did not sweat it off, or rinse it off with water. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the ingredients used in this product are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. Organic OIL will still BURN YOU! Why would you formulate a product this way? What&#x27;s worse, is that this is called &amp;#34;safe for babies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it is my own fault for using an oil based sunscreen, but I thought I would save others from the same mistake I made.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this as a sunscreen!</li>
