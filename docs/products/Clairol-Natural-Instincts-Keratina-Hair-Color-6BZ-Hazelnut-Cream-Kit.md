      <li>I should be able to tell if it changes color with exposure to sunlight, and will revise my review as appropriate.  </li>
      <li>Easily top 4 hair dyes I have tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great dye that stays looking good several weeks after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
      <li>Included is a coconut oil conditioner that should be used weekly to keep hair healthy and silky.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
      <li>I love the color it came out.</li>
      <li>Okay, this is fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>What impressed me most was that the color did not keep &amp;#34;bleeding&amp;#34; after I washed my hair for the second time.  </li>
      <li>I am very impressed with how long this color stayed on my hair despite it being temporary!  </li>
      <li>The coverage and lasting quality of the dye is very good.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of fun.</li>
      <li>The smell of the conditioner was very nice afterwards and made my hair feel SO soft.</li>
      <li>When I mixed the two (not the easiest to mix because of the great differences in consistency), the color was still very light.</li>
      <li>Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color is a very nice product to use.</li>
      <li>It was beautiful while the dye was in my hair, but when I rinsed the dye out the first time, the beautiful purple black rinsed to a light purple; after two weeks, the color is virtually gone.  </li>
      <li>Application is easy.</li>
      <li>Clairol makes it easy to die your hair.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to mix and apply.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand strong fumes.</li>
      <li>Product was easy to use, no nasty fumes, and the results were true to the color guide on the box.  </li>
      <li>If you choose to use this product knowing what it contains, do a patch test first for your own sake.</li>
      <li>If you choose to use this product knowing what it contains, do a patch test first for your own sake.</li>
      <li>However, my sister who received the full salon treatment with this product shampoos 2-3 times per week and will probably get more time out of this temporary dye.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Natural Instincts on many occasions with good results, but it is important to realize that this product is not a permanent dye.</li>
      <li>The color change was attractive and there were no strange tones or streaking.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a little drippy during application but the results are awesome!</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the fact that it&#x27;s ammonia free.</li>
      <li>The subtlety is important because of my rather staid work environment.  </li>
      <li>product contains Keratin and is ammonia free.</li>
      <li>It seems they canâ€™t even give it away for free.</li>
      <li>I use this brand and enjoy the results.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, especially if you don&#x27;t want to commit to permanent hair dye.  </li>
      <li>It has now faded to a deep brown/black which is nice because it didn&#x27;t go at all reddish, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with weeks of navy hair.</li>
      <li>Ideal for light brown, medium and dark brown hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was very easy to use, it covered her hair very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure about this brand at first.  </li>
      <li>Unique color if you&#x27;re looking for a darker hair color treatment.</li>
      <li>No burning, tingling, or staining around my hair line (that was a huge concern for me)--in fact, true to the packaging, any dye that came in contact with my skin washed off without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a lot of fun if you want to change your hair color on a temporary basis!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect and colored her grey completely.</li>
      <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t burn, and that they provide you enough conditioner to help keep your hair in good shape for a month.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
    <li> I am a compulsive label-reader, and have to say, shocked myself at how long it took me to read this one.  I picked it up because it said &amp;#34;ammonia-free,&amp;#34; which I had hoped meant that it was less harsh than other commercial products.  I try to avoid chemicals to the extent possible (and it is entirely possible, but not in any mass market product I have found).  What I saw on this label I found truly shocking.  I have seen bleach, ammonia, even urea :p but toluene?  That&#x27;s nail polish remover, paint thinner.  I believe (honestly) that chlorox is safer.  Why on earth would anyone want to put paint-thinner on their head?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was preparing to test this product and read the directions, which started with a warning: do not use if you have allergies, broken skin, sensitivities.  I do.  I have allergies and chemical sensitivities.  I have, however, been able to use most commercial products without any adverse effects.  I checked the label to see if it contained anything which I know that I am allergic to (Since I am allergic to aloe, which many cosmetics now contain, I have to be espedcially careful) and was astonished to see toluene.  Like I said, I am a compulsive label reader. I look for all natural, organic, if I can find it.  If I can&#x27;t, I go with the mildest formulation i can find which does not contain allergens, but I have never, NEVER seen toluene in a hair care product, or skin care product.  The only thing I have seen which contains it that one might use on their body is nail polish remover (most of which is straight toluene).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, i will not use this in any way that it contacts my skin.  I agreed to test it, and so did a strand test.  I chose it because of the &amp;#34;blue/ black&amp;#34; descriptor, which made it sound a little more interesting.  I am guessing that whatever blue this contains is o counteract the tendency of black dyes to turn red in the sun (I remember a very unfortunate experience my mother had once, a long long time ago).  It will be a while before I know whether  this does that or not.  I live in Hawaii, and so am exposed to intense sun.  I should be able to tell if it changes color with exposure to sunlight, and will revise my review as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very dark black, one which I would imagine would damp down if not eliminate any highlights.  Unfortunately I can not give as full a report as I might otherwise, afraid to expose my  skin to the chemicals in this product.  I feel badly not being able to provide as thorough a review as I might, however, had I known that it contained dangerous chemicals I would not have selected it to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping my review is helpful to some.  While this product does not contain ammonia, it does contain paint thinner.  It will damage your hair.  It might damage your skin.  Absolutely do not get it in your eyes.  If you choose to use this product knowing what it contains, do a patch test first for your own sake. I would be very cautious with this product, even if you do not have allergies or (known) chemical sensitivities.a while before I know whether  this does that or not.

    <li> I have a few gray hairs that I was trying to cover, for the most past this dye worked however I was looking for some shine which it seemed not to provide.  From a coverage perspective, I have washed my hair 4 times since my initial application and the coverage faded a little.  I am somewhat satisfied with  this product.</li>
    <li> Great hair dye, made my hair look beauo and shiny. Didnt fry my hair</li>
    <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m going through something of a midlife hair crisis. A few months ago, I chopped off about 15 inches, leaving shoulder length hair that I really rather liked. But after a few weeks, I wanted something a little more dramatic and decided to jump on the current color trend. I wanted something dramatic, and my aim was a dark blue or purple. I bleached my dark brown hair to a golden yellow and then colored with Ion Color Brilliance in purple (http://www.amazon.com/Color-Brilliance-Brights-Semi-Permanent-Hair/dp/B007W3DMQC). It was beautiful while the dye was in my hair, but when I rinsed the dye out the first time, the beautiful purple black rinsed to a light purple; after two weeks, the color is virtually gone.  I was afraid the same thing might happen with this dye, but seeing as I don&#x27;t look good as a blonde, I knew I needed to try something. I was a bit worried when I opened the color cream tube that needs to be added to the activator. The color coming out of the tube was a light gold, and tWhethers only the slightest bit of dark color at the end of the tube. When I mixed the two (not the easiest to mix because of the great differences in consistency), the color was still very light. Had I received the wrong color?  Fortunately, as soon as it hit my hair, the color started changing to a beautiful blue black. Think Lois Lane or Wonder Woman--that dark and dramatic. Still, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well the color would take. I left the dye in for thirty minutes (the max recommended time).  After I rinsed and conditioned using the included conditioner, the color stayed brilliant. It is the same blue-black that I saw while dying. The blue isn&#x27;t subtle, but it&#x27;s not obvious, either. Whether blue or black shows more clearly depends on how the light hits it. I totally love it!  As to the entire dye kit, its easy to use and everything is included. The protective gloves in the pack are not high quality, but they are large enough to fit any woman (they&#x27;d be a tight fit ona larger man) and they are sturdy enough that they don&#x27;t split at the seams. There was enough activator and dye for me to get full coverage over my rather thick shoulder length hair. The dye easily came off my skin in just one shower, and I wasn&#x27;t especially careful around the neck and ears in the first place.  I&#x27;m too excited about my new color to wait to see how long the dye job lasts before I write this review, but I will update when I have a better idea of its longevity.  Update: After one full week and two washings, my hair maintained a brilliant blue-black color. After two weeks, and a total of about five washings, my hair was still incredibly black, and the blue is still easily visible, but toned down a bit. I&#x27;m going on the end of three weeks, and maybe seven washings, and there&#x27;s just a bit of fading on the ends of my hair. It&#x27;s probably not noticeable to anyone else, but I can see that just the very ends of my hair are a little lighter. If I let my hair dry naturally and keep its curl, this fading isn&#x27;t even visible to me. Its when I blow out my hair so that the strands separate more that the lightening is visible. It still looks good, but it&#x27;s not as blue as I&#x27;d like it--in fact, it&#x27;s almost blue-gray instead of blue-black.</li>
    <li> Great color. I&#x27;ve used the product before, therefore, I knew what to expect.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It fully covered all my grey and left my hair feeling soft. I would recommend Clairol Natural Instincts.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my mom, and she loves it! The color is very nice and work good. Very easy to apply</li>
    <li> Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color is a very nice product to use. I like the no-drip foam application and especially the no ammonia formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair color follows all the normal directions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t wash your hair before coloring.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use care after coloring, no perming.&lt;br /&gt;3. Continue to use the included conditioner after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister has naturally blue-black hair. It is very difficult to find a hair color that doesn&#x27;t leave her with a matte, flat black that looks like it&#x27;s been colored with a Sharpie. This product returned her hair to it&#x27;s gorgeous blue black color! It&#x27;s perfect and colored her grey completely. The coconut conditioner left her hair soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially if you don&#x27;t want to commit to permanent hair dye.  This is a demi-permanent hair dye, so it should last for about a month.  Product was easy to use, no nasty fumes, and the results were true to the color guide on the box.  Plus, the coconut conditioning rinse makes hair super shiny and full.  This may become a regular purchase for me - and I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it because I cannot find the Crema Keratina line in any of my local outlets.</li>
    <li> Unique color if you&#x27;re looking for a darker hair color treatment. Has a bluish tint to it which seems to compliment and work well with black. The blue aspect isn&#x27;t overpowering. Ideal for light brown, medium and dark brown hair. This Is ammonia-free so no strong scent. Also contains keratin which protects your hair while being colored. To use put on the included gloves, mix the solution, apply to dry hair, wait 20 minutes then rinse and condition. Comes with color-treat conditioner with Aloe &amp; Coconut Oil. Good on grey or if you&#x27;re looking to go dark yet want to add an extra pop of color. Recommend if you&#x27;re looking to try something different.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to mix and apply. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It turned my medium-dark brown hair black with blue notes that only showed up in bright sunlight. That was pretty neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as it faded, it toured a variety of less pretty colors, as the blue-grey clashed with my natural color. I think this could be fun to do as a permanent color, or on hair that is either very dark or very light already. However, with mid-range browns, by two weeks post-dye you&#x27;ll be pretty eager to cover it up.</li>

    <li> I have darker hair to begin with. I was hoping to have the blue shine to it. I applied this two weeks ago. It changed my hair to a darker color and I was hoping the blue would be more noticeable. However, you can barely see it in the color. In the direct sunlight, you might be able to see a hue of blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 and get gray hair in a week. The bad is this faded on the gray and did not cover it well. I usually dye my hair every month if not every two months and the gray stays covered. Since this is a semi, it washes out faster and seemed to wash out faster with the gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used this kind before but have two more to try. So far I am not a huge fan and this color is not one I would recommend since it does not stay/color gray and the blue does not show. I would not buy it again. I see as I write this review it is less than two dollars and there is a two dollar coupon. It seems they canâ€™t even give it away for free. I would find something else and sadly canâ€™t recommend it.</li>
    <li> First, let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before (professionally or otherwise), so this review is coming from a novice&#x27;s perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a hereditary quirk, my hair began greying in my twenties--not completely grey, but enough that people could tell just looking at me from a few feet away. It never really bothered me before, but when offered a chance to review a hair dye targeted specifically for black hair, claiming to cover greys, and being temporary, I figured what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the instructions in full (because, first time) and jumping through the hoops of a patch test for allergies and a strand test for dying time, it was ready for the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have very thick hair a few inches past my shoulders and my main worry was that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough dye, but there was more than enough. I&#x27;d say there would be enough even if my hair were a few inches longer. Application, though still messy*, wasn&#x27;t nearly as messy as I expected it to be. No burning, tingling, or staining around my hair line (that was a huge concern for me)--in fact, true to the packaging, any dye that came in contact with my skin washed off without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all was said and done, the dye deepened my natural black giving it a nice slightly blue luster. It actually looks quite natural, which was a pleasant surprise. As far as my greys are concerned, it didn&#x27;t completely cover them, but it made them a lot less pronounced. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to see them unless you were inspecting my hair up close and personal. But knowing that they don&#x27;t actually dye the greys a deep blue/black, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to folks who are heavily grey--a few salt and pepper issues here and there, sure, but not an entire head full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a temporary dye, I&#x27;ll periodically update this review as I note how long it will last, how it looks while being washed/grown out, and anything else that seems relevant. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the dye or my experience with it, please leave a comment and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Although the applicator allows you to squeeze strips of colour onto your hair, it is prone to dropping dots especially if you put it down too hard in haste, and those dots will stain porcelain. Also, the gloves were a bit of a letdown, so I&#x27;d recommend having a pair of latex/nitrile fitted gloves on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The photo is a snap of a chunk of my hair pre-dye and the same chunk after. Apologies for the blur...seems I&#x27;m not that great a hair photographer. :)ye or my experience with it, please leave a comment and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer.  * Although the applicator allows you to squeeze strips of colour onto your hair, it is prone to dropping dots especially if you put it down too hard in haste, and those dots will stain porcelain.

    <li> Natural Instincts is a go-to, moderately priced brand of home hairdye that works well for me. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering while you apply, and it really lasts. I appreciate the grey coverage as my white is really dye-resistant. A bonus is the oversized tube of luxurious conditioner that&#x27;s a lot larger than many brands I&#x27;ve tried, enough for at least two or more applications.</li>
    <li> If you want to dabble with a new hair color this is the way to go. Application is easy. Follow the instructions to the letter and there should be no problem. I applied this to my sister&#x27;s hair this evening and she went from a dark brown shade to this nearly black shade. The color change was attractive and there were no strange tones or streaking. The color was consistent and lush. Overall this was a very flattering color when applied to naturally dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;The color looks natural and the hair was left soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve used Natural Instincts on many occasions with good results, but it is important to realize that this product is not a permanent dye. I believe this is a plant based colorant which makes it super gentle and non-damaging, but it only lasts 28 days/washings. I have never squeezed out that much time out of Natural Instincts because I wash my hair daily and sometimes more frequently. However, my sister who received the full salon treatment with this product shampoos 2-3 times per week and will probably get more time out of this temporary dye.&lt;br /&gt;This product contains Keratin and is ammonia free. Included is a coconut oil conditioner that should be used weekly to keep hair healthy and silky.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice product that also provides moderate grey coverage.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me. Full disclosure: I have thick, curly hair that is notoriously resistant to hair dye, but as a redhead I figured black (even demipermanent black) would do something. It kind of did, in that it darkened my hair to a very weird deep blackish silver, coated with a blue sheen. It looked like something I&#x27;d wear at Halloween. It was interesting, but not work-appropriate and definitely not black. Fortunately in my case, it didn&#x27;t last for 28 washes, either. Most of it was gone after one. About two weeks on, I still have a totally unnatural bluish hint in sunlight, but no one&#x27;s remarked on it yet. While I&#x27;m glad that&#x27;s the case, that means it doesn&#x27;t last for 28 washes, either. One star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other variants of Natural Instincts before. This was my first time using the new Crema Keratina formula. Most hair coloring has that weird chemical smell. This particular formula actually had a pleasant scent. I have very long hair (goes all the way down my back) so I often worry if one bottle will provide enough coverage. Had no issues at all with this formula. I only have a few gray hairs, and the color blended in perfectly. Not sure if the coverage would be sufficient if you were trying to cover a lot of gray. But if you just have a little gray showing or if you are just looking for a new color, this hair coloring is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the conditioner that came with the hair coloring was sold separately. My hair felt so soft after it was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I color my hair, I ruin a t-shirt because I&#x27;ll get some of the hair color on it. This time was no exception as I ended up with some color on the back and shoulders of the t-shirt I was wearing. Was surprised when I pulled the t-shirt out of the washer and it wasn&#x27;t stained. Not sure if I just got lucky this time of if it is the new formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that, like most of these color-at-home kits, the gloves they give you are woefully insufficient. I don&#x27;t even have long nails, and my fingers pinched through during the coloring. Use your own gloves instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, would definitely use this color again.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color! It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t smell as awful as some other brands when it is in use and rinses out easily at the end. The color is bright and the coconut oil does help smooth frizzy hair. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> This is a lot of fun if you want to change your hair color on a temporary basis! It lasts about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning: if you&#x27;re looking to cover grey, you need a product specifically for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little drippy during application but the results are awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister in law who has dark brown hair and wanted to go darker. This was the first time she colored her hair ever and we are happy with the results. The kit is very easy to use, it does not drip or run. She kept it on her hair for about 25 minutes, maybe closer to 20 and it&#x27;s a very pretty, shiny black color. She is very happy with it. Great item for a first timer!</li>
    <li> Iâ€™ve used a few formulations of Natural Instincts over the years and Crema Keratina is my favorite one so far.  PROS - Really thick formula minimizes any drips and inadvertent staining. Sticks well to hair to ensure effectiveness. - Did a great job with some very resistant grey strands I have above my earlobes. For these parts, I left it on for 25 minutes. - You do not have to wet your hair beforehand. Being able to apply it to dry hair saves time. - The coconut oil and aloe conditioner smells great and conditions exceptionally well and they give you a nice generous 1.85 ounces of it â€“ enough for at least 3 or 4 applications.  I would buy this if it were a separate product.  CONS - The gloves supplied are some of the flimsiest Iâ€™ve ever seen in a Natural Instincts product. Best to use your own if you have them.  Iâ€™m not going to dock a star just because of the poor gloves which is probably the least important aspect of a box of haircolor because you can always use your own, and this product did an outstanding job of hair coloring in the recommended time.  One thing to note â€“ I was not used to a  dark hair colorant being totally white. It freaked me out for a moment, thinking maybe they put the wrong shade in the box and I would end up an unintended blonde . This is supposed to be the darkest black, after all. Even after initially mixing with the developer it was almost pure white. Thankfully, it started turning a dark black within a few minutes and my fears were totally allayed by the wonderful results.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my hair.</li>
    <li> purchased 2 of these boxes for a BIG discount. I wish i would have paid attention to the color, this is a bit dark for me, but oh well. I use this brand and enjoy the results. I will use this dark color during winter time.</li>
    <li> Meh. Didn&#x27;t work too well or last too long.</li>
    <li> Worst hair dye ever. Turned my hair gray after two weeks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last after washing once</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> it works great. I have dark brown hair. it made completely black, very black.....I see very little bit of blue...</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and was easy to use! Instructions were very clear and made my hair feel great when I was finished!</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair, but I wanted to change up the color a bit. This did the trick. I love the color it came out. Black with a tint of blue in the sunlight. It was very easy to use and didn&#x27;t smell bad at all!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple 3 step 20 minute process for this non permanent hair color. Mix, apply, wait and condition.  My hair was nice and soft. I have dark brown hair, so this made it a nice shade of black. Not as shiny as the permanent home kits I&#x27;ve used, but it would cover gray well and does make hair darker.</li>
    <li> Left my hair a nice black blue defiantly going to buy more wen it come to dying my hair again</li>
    <li> I like this hair dye. I like to use it when I&#x27;m unsure what color I want to go with. It&#x27;s demi-permanent meaning it won&#x27;t last long, which is good for me at least because I never know what color I want to go with. I like that it&#x27;s creme based not liquid because I have a habit of dripping dye all over my sink lol. I also enjoy the fact that it&#x27;s ammonia free. I can&#x27;t stand strong fumes. I definitely recommend to those who are looking for a different color but have the option to go with something else because this dye does t stay long.</li>
    <li> (I reviewed the raspberry creme and chocolate creme colors recently, and it&#x27;s basically the same as those in every aspect aside from the color. So everything I said in those reviews applies here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very basic dying process&lt;br /&gt;-Dye is thick and doesn&#x27;t run through/off your hair&lt;br /&gt;-The color looks pretty close to what it looks like on the box&lt;br /&gt;-Your hair will feel super soft after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;re going to think that the dye is never ending when washing your hair the first time, because it just keeps coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great dye that stays looking good several weeks after it&#x27;s been applied. Colors are bold and cover up any unwanted hair colors, like grey, and don&#x27;t burn the scalp. It&#x27;s a great deal too.</li>
    <li> The color of this blue black is very striking, and does a great job of blending in the grey hairs. Clairol Natural Instincts Crema Keratina Hair Color goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as the hair colorings of years past did. The colors come out rich and vibrant, and hold up fairly well, though you have to make a conscious effort not to overwash your hair, even with dye friendly shampoos. The instructions are clear and easy to understand, and anyone who&#x27;s ever colored their hair will pretty much know the drill with this one as well. The only drawback is that like most do-it-yourself blue-black colorings, the bluish sheen fades within a week and you&#x27;re left with more of a dull, flat black.</li>
    <li> Nice color and didn&#x27;t damage my hair. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I receive this offer at a discounted price in returns for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Product is good. Easily top 4 hair dyes I have tried.</li>
    <li> Nice! My sisters color! As expected!</li>
    <li> Clairol makes it easy to die your hair. After you follow the steps. The gray hair becomes high lighted. Not fully covered to match the gray. If you want it to do the gray. Do the gray first. Then do the rest of your hair after that.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the color treat 3 conditioner that comes in it.  Will donate the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Super inexpensive deep conditioning treatment for chemically treated hair.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter says this colors deep and the blue tint actually shows up, unlike other brands she&#x27;d tried.  Less of a chemical smell with this as opposed to the other brands.  The only negative thing she has to report is that the colorant is hard to get out of the tube, by that she means it&#x27;s metal and it&#x27;s hard to roll it and get the dye out without getting it all over yourself.  Other than that she thought it was great!!  And she thinks as long as you know about the colorant tube and are willing to take a little extra care you&#x27;re good to go.  So she only deducted one star.</li>
    <li> For the areas NOT bleach treated it has a very nice sheen to it.  Just remember that yellow and blue makes green, so if you are going from anything in the blonde color group, pass on this particular color.  Overall really easy to apply and the smell during application wasn&#x27;t as bad as most.</li>
    <li> I like how this made my hair feel and the blue color that shines within the black made me feel beautiful again. :)</li>
    <li> If you use it as intended (on hair that&#x27;s already dark) it&#x27;s kind of fun. It adds a blue tinge that would risk being a little too wild and unusual for lighter hair where the blue could be really obvious, but is just a little striking on hair that&#x27;s already darker and helps to mellow out the effect a bit. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t burn, and that they provide you enough conditioner to help keep your hair in good shape for a month.</li>
    <li> nondamaging hair coloring. my hair feels nice and conditioned and i get the beautiful color i want as well.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping and item is as described. :)</li>
    <li> Nice dark blue black color.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Lasts very long and would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I purchased the blue-black color.  The coverage and lasting quality of the dye is very good.  However, instead of black hair with brightish blue shimmer, it turned my hair dark navy (think Snidely Whiplash&#x27;s coat in Dudley Do-Right).  So my hair looked &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; every time I used a black headband or barrette or wore a black shirt.  It has now faded to a deep brown/black which is nice because it didn&#x27;t go at all reddish, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with weeks of navy hair.</li>
    <li> Okay, this is fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, dark hair and I thought it would be fun to try this blue shade.  And it is.  The blue is subtle on my dark hair.  It catches in some lights.  The subtlety is important because of my rather staid work environment.  In my cubicle, it isn&#x27;t really noticeable.  But, when I&#x27;m out having fun in the sun, you can see the highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye is easy to use and has a pleasant scent.  I&#x27;ll definitely use it again to jazz up my rather boring work look!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with how long this color stayed on my hair despite it being temporary!  It slowly faded over time exactly as stated, and didn&#x27;t do any damage to my hair at all!  The smell of the conditioner was very nice afterwards and made my hair feel SO soft. I got so many compliments on this shade of black.  It&#x27;s not so blue like others are.  In fact it does look very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as the name implies!  This was very easy to do. It did cover my several dozen grey hairs completely as promised.  I will definitely purchase this hair color again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a true blue black color, but it does not last long at all. It is not a permanent hair color, so it fades away very quickly, especially if you wash your hair daily. Once it starts fading, it is a rather awkward color and needs dyed again very soon. I don&#x27;t feel that this version of Natural Instincts is any less damaging than the original. I do not see or feel much difference on the hair between the two at all.</li>
    <li> In exchange for this product, I am to leave an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure about this brand at first.  However, after dying my hair and waiting a couple of days I noticed that the color sort of faded.</li>
    <li> I have curly jet black hair.  This color was more of a black than a &amp;#34;blue black&amp;#34;  I was pleased with the results. It completely covered my gray hair, and seems to be holding the color nicely even though I wash my hair frequently - 4-5 times a week. The application was the same as any standard hair color product - leave on for 20-30 minutes.  The conditioner left my hair a little dry, but that was easily resolved when I applied a deep conditioner.  What impressed me most was that the color did not keep &amp;#34;bleeding&amp;#34; after I washed my hair for the second time.  Consequently, I didn&#x27;t ruin my towels.  This is a great buy the price and results are perfect.</li>
    <li> My daughter is blonde, but she likes to dye her hair black. We tried this color and she really liked it. In fact, she liked it so much she was a little disappointed that it is only a temporary color and wants to know if they make the same color in a more permanent hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to use, it covered her hair very well. It&#x27;s a very pretty color and it leaves your hair feeling very soft and luxurious&lt;br /&gt;A very nice temporary change of color that really does give a slight blue highlight.</li>
    <li> i got this for my wife to try it on and to my surprise she was happy with the results. it really worked on her. thinking on buying more in the near future. very easy to use and apply.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It left my hair so smooth.</li>
    <li> I had my sister try this and she like it very much.</li>
    <li> the color last as long as it said it would so it worked out great</li>
</ol>
