      <li>BEST APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
      <li>BronzeGlow mitt from Ulta works best</li>

      <li>This is truly a bronze color that looks great.</li>
      <li>Works great with a cotton rag.</li>
      <li>This Behrens glow works great.</li>
      <li>This is a really great tanner.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good value for the size and pricing and will be giving it more uses over the warmer months.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I am delighted with this product.  </li>
      <li>If you have fair skin.</li>
      <li>A very healthy glow without an orangey undertone.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This time he had no idea and commented that I smelled nice.</li>
      <li>I am getting nice color.</li>
      <li>It does look like a nice tan and goes on evenly.</li>
      <li>But this is a nice product and I would purchase it again.</li>
      <li>Recommended for someone looking to not stand out at the beach or in a swimsuit now that the nice weather has come out.</li>
      <li>Perfect for the springtime and wearing that first sleeveless top and  shorts.  </li>
      <li>Very impressed with the color, very natural looking.</li>
      <li>For $12, this far exceeded my expectations and is perfect for when I need some color.  </li>
      <li>For rub on stuff, this is the best I&#x27;ve seen so far.  </li>
      <li>Color is too light, and this is coming from someone with an extremely fair complexion.</li>
      <li>For a more natural looking tan, I&#x27;d go with the shade that is lighter than this but for the summer, this one is perfect!</li>
      <li>It really is a great product - beautiful natural color, dries, quick, no</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it was easy to use and see once you had put it on but wasn&#x27;t really fantastic at creating a good sunless tan.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use a very light coat around knees and ankles.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you wash your hands immediately after each part of your body or your hands will stain.</li>
      <li>I might get more for my buck if I try a cream.</li>
      <li>Even oxyclean could not get the stain out of a favorite bikini.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!!  </li>
      <li>so I read as many reviews and tips as I could ahead of time.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to wash your hands after applying.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Spend more for a better brand than this.</li>
      <li>More and more, they&#x27;re applying sunless tanning lotions and gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I Love the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>I went swimming in a salt water pool and when I was done, most of my color was gone.</li>
      <li>I use disposable plastic gloves - would probably do better with tighter latex gloves or a sponge.</li>
      <li>Love this product to death...</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s definitely better products out there.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used &amp; only need to use twice a week.</li>
      <li>, this product is probably the next best thing.  </li>
      <li>I love the color this gives to my skin.</li>
      <li>As long as you exfoliate every inch of your skin till it almost hurts, the mousse will look perfect with no streaks.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - soooo easy to put on.</li>
      <li>I like that the tint of the foam makes it easy to see where to apply</li>
      <li>I prefer the lotion kind of self tanner to this foam, since there is no skin conditioning in this kind, but as far as tanning goes it works.</li>
      <li>Application is easy and you can see where you&#x27;re applying it which is a plus.</li>
      <li>That product goes on easy, and darkens gradually.</li>
      <li>The applicator provides a smooth and easy to apply measure of the tanning product.  </li>
      <li>Mousse&#x27;s are the best for beginner self tanning because you can see where you are applying the product with less chances of having streaks or missed areas.</li>
      <li>The color and scent were fine.</li>
      <li>This product is incredible, easy to blend, doesn&#x27;t leave spots or lines, dries quick and gives instant color.</li>
      <li>Does not smell at all, wore it all day and didn&#x27;t shower and it was fine</li>
      <li>Make sure you wash your hands quickly after applying or</li>
      <li>was not unpleasant like many self tanning products.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>The color is just fabulous</li>
      <li>They often include sun screen, so they can be applied and worn in ways that work precisely to meet the customer&#x27;s needs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also like to use a cotton ball to apply to face for a natural-looking light application.</li>
      <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for a moderately priced good sunless tanner this is the one :).</li>
      <li>This provided a good natural color.  </li>
      <li>This suntan lotion is dispensed as a foam so that it is very easy to apply to large areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Jergens Natural Glow is very easy to use (just make sure you wear gloves).</li>
      <li>Still, under normal circumstances, I have more of a comfort level with the &amp;#34;Natural Glow&amp;#34; cream - just feels more &amp;#34;natural, because it is lower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In sum: if you&#x27;re looking for a sunless tanner that is easy to apply, dries quickly, and works well</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and dries and quickly.</li>
      <li>Gives good color that looks natural and can see a deeper color after applying, so it&#x27;s true to &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; labeling.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good choice for general use on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did have some streaking, but it was only visible in bright light and my husband said he wouldn&#x27;t have noticed if I hadn&#x27;t pointed it out.  </li>
      <li>It is so economically priced that this is a fine amount of time.</li>
      <li>Again, there was some streaking and that&#x27;s where you could see some of the orangey look, but only visible in bright daylight.  </li>
      <li>Using an instant tanner in foam form had a bit of a learning curve but after it was applied there was a good amount of &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; color and the scent</li>
      <li>So Easy to put on, no fake tan smell .</li>
      <li>So this Natural Glow (looks more natural) is the next best thing</li>
      <li>Another super</li>
      <li>Themis went on super evenly and the mitt protected my hands from getting any product on them</li>
      <li>a palm-full in your hand then quickly spreading across sections of your body.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I think this is a good sunless tanner, but if it&#x27;s your first time, there will probably be mistakes like I had.  </li>
      <li>product applies easily and dries readily.</li>
      <li>Smells like a fresh scented lotion.</li>
      <li>I did, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Jergens sunless tanning products are the tanning trend right now, so I ordered some, and tried them out.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure skin is clean and dry.</li>
      <li>I have LITERALLY tried every self-tanner out there, this is by far the easiest to apply and gives the most realistic tan.</li>
      <li>The skin gets darker with each application and  should be done once daily, to allow for a more gradual effect.  </li>
      <li>Reapplied 5 days after first use and doesn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;, if you wanted to re-up once it begins to fade in color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for tanners that didn&#x27;t last or the color was so off</li>
      <li>Overall, one of the better sunless tanning products out there.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time using a sunless tanner</li>
      <li>When I first used it, my hands turned pretty orange, so I had to scrub them well as soon as I was done.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gives good color that looks natural and can see a deeper color after applying, so it&#x27;s true to &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; labeling.  Per the usage, only used on body, not face as it will likely clog pores plus the fragrance could irritate.  In general, it&#x27;s best to avoid non-facial tanners on face, which could led to unpleasant blackheads and blemishes.  My go to for face is St Tropez tanner.  Mousse formula is a big pro, easy to apply with gloves or a mitt, as I use the St. Tropez one normally.  Another super plus is it doesn&#x27;t get patchy which can happen with some other tanners.  Reapplied 5 days after first use and doesn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;, if you wanted to re-up once it begins to fade in color.  It&#x27;s a very good value for the size and pricing and will be giving it more uses over the warmer months.  UPDATE - this stained clothing I wore well after rinsing off the tanner.  Even oxyclean could not get the stain out of a favorite bikini.  Threw the rest of this bottle in trash &amp; went back to St. Tropez mousse.</li>
    <li> The only thing I did not particularly like about this  sunless tanner was that sometimes it was a little difficult to see where it had been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the color looked reasonably natural. It wasn&#x27;t a very dramatic change from my regular color. The color showed up better on my slightly tanned arms than it did on my pasty legs that haven&#x27;t seen the light of the day for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasted for a few days and then gradually faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a rather noticeable sunless tanner scent. It&#x27;s not horrible, but I definitely kept getting whiffs of it over the next few hours after I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that I need to wash my hands I&#x27;m between applying the tanner to my arms and legs. The color started darkening on my hands before I was done applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the color lasted a but longer, but there&#x27;s plenty of mouse for multiple applications.</li>
    <li> According to my teenage daughter this stuff works.  She has been applying a little at a time over the past week and developing enough color so she does not look pasty white when she goes on spring break.  She has sensitive skin and the Natural Glow product has not tripped any allergies or created dry patches.  The applicator provides a smooth and easy to apply measure of the tanning product.  Overall, one of the better sunless tanning products out there.  Recommended for someone looking to not stand out at the beach or in a swimsuit now that the nice weather has come out.</li>
    <li> The foam mousse is easier to apply as compared to many of the other sunless tanners and gives less streaking. It&#x27;s simple to see where it&#x27;s applied. Do use less over the knees and elbows, and wash hands immediately after applying, or use gloves. Otherwise, the palms will get REALLY dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will darken over time, so do not do an immediate second coat if it&#x27;s not the expected color. Also, make sure skin is clean and dry. Oily bits or wet bits take forever to dry and are likely to rub color off on clothes or other things that touch the skin until it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about 5 days.</li>
    <li> This suntan lotion is dispensed as a foam so that it is very easy to apply to large areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work as claimed, creating a fairly realistic tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest one of the lighter versions rather than this dark bronze, for those new to tanning lotions or with winter paleness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions twice, and then read them again.  Wash your hands thoroughly after application!</li>
    <li> FINALLY this product is on amazon! Ive been using this product for a couple months and OHMYGOD not joking when I say this stuff changed my life. Ive used so many self tanning sprays/mousses and this is the only one that I havent been disappointed with. I live in south florida and ive been under pressure my whole life to get tan,problem is my skin just burns in the sun. I use this every other night and i&#x27;m now tan at all times. As long as you exfoliate every inch of your skin till it almost hurts, the mousse will look perfect with no streaks.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I like that there is no streaking. I am getting nice color. Even though it says dark- there are others that say that also- it is not really DARK. It is a very slight darkening which I could speed up if I used it everyday but I don&#x27;t want to look freakish. Subtle so that you don&#x27;t look like you are using a tanner but just have a healthy glow. The mousse is easy to use but I am not sure if I am getting the full amount of product because the mousse is so light. I might get more for my buck if I try a cream. But this is a nice product and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Jergens is a highly respected name in skin care. One expects a lot from a product marked by their brand. With this sunless tanner, Jergens meets expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us who came of age in the mid-late twentieth century, there was a sea-change in notions about exposure to the sun. It was not uncommon for young people to slather baby oil or similar substances--and then to sun themselves or remain outdoors for hours on end. While that may have resulted in an apparently healthy glow, it also occasioned short- and long-term skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have explored various avenues for healthy substitutes that, at the least, can recreate the healthy appearance of sun kissed skin. More and more, they&#x27;re applying sunless tanning lotions and gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product applies easily and dries readily. Unless one is in the heat and perspiring, it goes to work fast. It doesn&#x27;t streak. It&#x27;s a good choice for general use on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I did not see any limitation noted, my instinct would be to give some additional thought before applying this product to the face and neck. There are alternative products that are aimed specifically to that purpose. They often include sun screen, so they can be applied and worn in ways that work precisely to meet the customer&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: if you&#x27;re looking for a sunless tanner that is easy to apply, dries quickly, and works well, Jergens has come up with a winner.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s definitely better products out there. Color is too light, and this is coming from someone with an extremely fair complexion. The guide color is light and the tan slowly develops darker. That&#x27;s a personal preference thing but I&#x27;d rather have a darker guide color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially it smells good, but as it develops it gets that characteristic fake tanning smell and it&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, it feels tacky on your skin for a couple hours afterwards. That really bothers me, it&#x27;s annoying when you wear clothing over it the first couple hours, and heaven forbid you have to sit on leather. The stickiness of this product alone is enough to make me not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have LITERALLY tried every self-tanner out there, this is by far the easiest to apply and gives the most realistic tan.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed, didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
    <li> Wife uses this. Loves it. It does look like a nice tan and goes on evenly.</li>
    <li> This provided a good natural color.  I like that the tint of the foam makes it easy to see where to apply so you don&#x27;t miss areas. Be sure to use a very light coat around knees and ankles.  Note that this is NOT a gradual color lotion (like other Jergens tanning lotions).  This is a straight-up sunless tanner, so you will see a dark tan after just one application.  You don&#x27;t need to rub this in like a moisturizer, but rather just glide it over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I found it difficult to clean off my hands, and had to use a nail brush to scrub.  I recommend to apply to face and body, then wash hands well to remove all color from palms.  Then use a cotton ball to lightly apply to tops of hands and back of wrist area and blend softly.  I also like to use a cotton ball to apply to face for a natural-looking light application. It also helps if you shave legs and exfoliate and moisturize skin before application.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a sunless tanner so I read as many reviews and tips as I could ahead of time.  Overall, I think this is a good sunless tanner, but if it&#x27;s your first time, there will probably be mistakes like I had.  It is easy to apply and quick to dry, as others have mentioned.  However, one needs to be careful about applying evenly.  I did have some streaking, but it was only visible in bright light and my husband said he wouldn&#x27;t have noticed if I hadn&#x27;t pointed it out.  It does leave a good color on the first application, especially on skin as white as mine.  It was subtle but noticeable to me and my own family.  Again, there was some streaking and that&#x27;s where you could see some of the orangey look, but only visible in bright daylight.  I will let this application fade out before I try again.</li>
    <li> I vowed to not use tanning beds this summer and was searching for a sunless tanning alternative. This product is amazing! Mousse&#x27;s are the best for beginner self tanning because you can see where you are applying the product with less chances of having streaks or missed areas. I love that this product doesn&#x27;t have that terrible self tanner smell--it does a little bit, but it goes away after you wash off the guard color. This product also doesn&#x27;t stain your sheets or your clothing as some self tanners can. My only complaint is that it is too heavy to use on your face. I tried using it on my face a couple of times and it caused me to break out. All in all, a great product and one that doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bad enough that middle-aged ladies wear capris with athletic shoes.  Worse yet that exposed flesh between shoes and pants glows pasty white.  I don&#x27;t have much patience for tanning products that streak and reek, and years of working daily with the unclothed and gowned (I&#x27;m a primary care doc) have confirmed that if unnatural orange doesn&#x27;t clue you in to fake tan, the telltale stink does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am delighted with this product.  One glop of foam easily spreads over those lily white lower legs, leaving even color and a very temporary alcohol sort of smell.  I applied mine post-shower and post-moisturizing cream, and emerged with a tan that looked natural even when inspected closely with reading glasses on.  Granted I still look middle-aged--probably need a fashion consultant--but at least my legs don&#x27;t look like white-washed picket fence posts.  I had no problem getting color off my palms with immediate use of soap and water.</li>
    <li> I will never lay in the sun again to tan again..This product is Amazing!! So Easy to put on, no fake tan smell . can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!!  :) Was asked multiple times this weekend did I go to Aruba or something . Apply once and you are instantly tanned .</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - soooo easy to put on. I use latex gloves though as it can stain your hands. It goes on smoothly and evenly. I spray tan using an aerosol can doesn&#x27;t come close to this mousse. I highly recommend it. Color stays on for about 2 days. It is so economically priced that this is a fine amount of time. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for tanners that didn&#x27;t last or the color was so off and/or an orange hue. This is truly a bronze color that looks great.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is an instant tan.  A dark one at that.  Perfect for the springtime and wearing that first sleeveless top and  shorts.  The mousse goes on smoothly (take care to use it sparingly on knees, elbows and ankles) and last for days, even after a daily shower.  Make sure you wash your hands quickly after applying or you will end up with tanned palms (which looks really, really weird).  Myself, I will only be using this for special occasions when a tan will complement my over all look.  While it does say that it is moisturizing, I have no seen that benefit and will continue to use my Eucern for daily skin moisture.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Now that pool (and shorts) season is finally here, I&#x27;ve been using this product more. I really like it. The color is just fabulous but you do need to be careful with application. I use disposable plastic gloves - would probably do better with tighter latex gloves or a sponge. I you miss a spot you will see it !!!  It really is a great product - beautiful natural color, dries, quick, no scent.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;For the past few years, my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; self tanner has been the Jergens &amp;#34;Natural Glow&amp;#34; cream. That product goes on easy, and darkens gradually. That works for me. It&#x27;s still a bit early in the season for self-tanner - here in NJ, we had snow flurries last week !!!  I did try the new Jergens mousse, and it worked pretty well. I think I would use this in an &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; situation - ie, my legs need to be tan ASAP. The color and scent were fine. Still, under normal circumstances, I have more of a comfort level with the &amp;#34;Natural Glow&amp;#34; cream - just feels more &amp;#34;natural, because it is lower.</li>
    <li> Jergens Natural Glow is very easy to use (just make sure you wear gloves). It took me a few times applying it before I was able to apply it more evenly but you are definitely noticeably tan the following day or even later in the day (if you apply it in the morning). I apply it after a shower and wait a few minutes before putting any clothing on. For a more natural looking tan, I&#x27;d go with the shade that is lighter than this but for the summer, this one is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been using tanning lotions for years. But I&#x27;ve never really cared much for the foam versions. I could never seem to apply it evenly before it dries. But a friend recommended I try applying it with self tanner mitt. It&#x27;s like a flat sponge thing that slips over your hand. OMG! Themis went on super evenly and the mitt protected my hands from getting any product on them do so dark brown palms for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I Love the smell of this product. Smells like a fresh scented lotion. My boyfriend usually always noticed when I put on tanning lotion from the smell. He hates it. No matter what product I use. This time he had no idea and commented that I smelled nice. So bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color didn&#x27;t look orange or too brown. I got the darker color option. I have naturally have a pale olive complection. It may be too brown on someone&#x27;s skin that has pinker undertones.</li>
    <li> I love the color this gives to my skin. A very healthy glow without an orangey undertone. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I do not like that it comes off very fast if you are in salt water. I went swimming in a salt water pool and when I was done, most of my color was gone. The same happened when i was gardening and working up a sweat. Any where the sweat ran, my tan ran too. Thats my only complaint. I have not used any other self tanner so this may happen with all of them. This does apply evenly too. I use gloves and a dampened mitt to apply. That seems to be the best way to apply for me without any streaking! I also apply lotion to my knees, feet, elbows and wrists before applying for even color. I am definitely a customer for life! This is saving my skin! With good care, the color will last for about a week for me before starting to break down. I also do not use the color extender either!</li>
    <li> Jergens offers a solid foam product if you are looking to get a sunless tan.  Please be aware that there is a lighter shade available of the same product.  This one is a tad on the dark side and if you easily tan, try the lighter shade first.  No two skins are the same and everyone desires a different shade, so expect a good ole trial and error with this one.  I think this foam is terrific and the color should last you half to a full week, depending  on your wash frequency.  Absolutely no streaks shown and doesn&#x27;t look fake at all if done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that should you get this product, you may strongly consider their add-on products, such as body scrub to put your skin into a &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; condition, as well as their color-maintainer product.  Also, you should definitely get a pair of gloves or spongy mittens in order to keep your hands as clean as possible(Look for all of those on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other problem is that if you apply it in the late afternoon and it gets hot at night, your body heat may transfer some of the color onto your pillow or sheets.  However that problem should go away after your first wash.  Therefore, you may want to apply it early in the morning and take a shower before bedtime to avoid colored sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can put up with all that and master the Do&#x27;s and Don&#x27;ts of it, this will be one of the best sunless tan products you can buy.</li>
    <li> Using an instant tanner in foam form had a bit of a learning curve but after it was applied there was a good amount of &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; color and the scent was not unpleasant like many self tanning products. The color lasted quite a while, but I did use a tan extender (also by jergins) to help with that. I prefer the lotion kind of self tanner to this foam, since there is no skin conditioning in this kind, but as far as tanning goes it works.</li>
    <li> I love it! I can work on my suntan indoors. No worries about harmful UV rays, etc. When I was younger, my sister and I sunbathed alot. However, she recently had melanoma removed from her leg and the doctor said no more sunbathing ever. So this Natural Glow (looks more natural) is the next best thing and it doesn&#x27;t look like you soaked in orange Kool-Aid as the products did in the past. A great and healthier way to suntan!</li>
    <li> Love this product to death...my daughter does pageants and this gives you the best bronze tan over night.  No streaking or orange look.  It goes on easy and dries and quickly.</li>
    <li> Using this product almost eliminated the appearance of my awkward tan lines.  My significant other complained about the smell for about a day after applying it, but I didn&#x27;t find it that offensive once it was fully absorbed (he&#x27;s pretty sensitive to scents).  When I first used it, my hands turned pretty orange, so I had to scrub them well as soon as I was done.  I bought one of those tanning mitts, which seemed to help reduce the orange tinge on my hands.  I recommend squirt a palm-full in your hand then quickly spreading across sections of your body.  I do NOT recommend squirting a line of the product down your body and then spread.  It seems that the highest concentration of color occurs wherever the product first touches your skin. For $12, this far exceeded my expectations and is perfect for when I need some color.  I wish Jergens made an instant tan product for your face, too!</li>
    <li> This is a really great tanner. I am fair skinned and this was a perfect, brown color. Not orange at all. My only complaint is it tends to come off patchy after a few days</li>
    <li> Did not make order plesae no more tan stuff</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used &amp; only need to use twice a week. Shake bottle well(because it&#x27;s a foam) apply quickly for it drys almost instantly, &amp; you don&#x27;t have to wait to put on clothes. Be sure to wash your hands after applying.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible, easy to blend, doesn&#x27;t leave spots or lines, dries quick and gives instant color. Does not smell at all, wore it all day and didn&#x27;t shower and it was fine</li>
    <li> This Behrens glow works great. If you have fair skin. This will give you a tan like you have been in the Caribbean for a few weeks. If you use a buffer. After it dries. You can lighten it up. I use a bit in my foundation,to give me a color that I can handle. Now I do not have a pale face. Works great with a cotton rag. Just use a little</li>
    <li> I usually spray tan and get the medium to dark color. So even though I&#x27;m very pale..I decided to buy this product in dark. The color is nice but because of how dark it is compared to my natural skin tone it&#x27;s really easy to see if you missed a spot once it has darkened over a few hours. So definitely get the light if you&#x27;re pale. Also, I tried this with a mitt and I didn&#x27;t think it went on as evenly as when I just used my bare hands. Make sure you wash your hands immediately after each part of your body or your hands will stain. I do one leg, wash and dry hands, other leg, wash and dry hands, one arm, wash and dry hands and so on. It seems like a lot of washing but I&#x27;d rather do that then have fake tanned palms haha. The color lasts about 3-4 days with me after one application. It&#x27;s totally as good if not better than more expensive products so if you&#x27;re looking for a moderately priced good sunless tanner this is the one :).</li>
    <li> For the price this works great.  Very impressed with the color, very natural looking.</li>
    <li> Jergens sunless tanning products are the tanning trend right now, so I ordered some, and tried them out. The color was not very dark. I used the medium to tan skin tone color, and I didn&#x27;t really see as much of a difference as I had for. This DOES NOT give you a tan like you see lifeguards have! Only gave me like a shade darker, which isn&#x27;t much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR BEST APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;Use a mitt- BronzeGlow mitt from Ulta works best&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate before applications- You can exfoliate by buying Jergens shower scrub, or by shaving, or buy using soap and a loofa and scrubbing&lt;br /&gt;Apply lotion before application to dry areas...knees, elbows, knuckles, ankles, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer After application- You can buy Jergens tan extender, which is basically just lotion in a fancy bottle, or you can just use lotion&lt;br /&gt;Takes about 6-8 hours to dry-wear loose or no clothing during that drying time&lt;br /&gt;Wash off color guard- after the tan has dried for 6-8 hours take a shower to wash off the colorguard and get rid of some of the self tanner smell&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize- continue to moisturize your body every day to keep your tan for as long as possible</li>
    <li> For rub on stuff, this is the best I&#x27;ve seen so far.  I have previously used the stuff that makes you turn orange looking.  Nothing natural about that unless you are from some other planet where orange people live.  Since those past experiences have left me skeptical, I was actually reluctant to try this one.  Other than the professional spray on tans that I have done for the last few years, this product is probably the next best thing.  This does work and as long as you apply lightly can indeed look fairly natural.  Just follow the instructions and if you want to go darker, wait and apply a second application the next day. Marilyn.</li>
    <li> I like how this product comes out of the container. This lotion comes out as an airy mouse, and rubs in fast and oil-free. It has a slight fragrance of coconut and leaves the skin moisturized.  The skin gets darker with each application and  should be done once daily, to allow for a more gradual effect.  It looks natural, with no orange hue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the cap on the container prevents the applicator from accidentally releasing the product.</li>
    <li> Eh. It&#x27;s sticky regardless of what they say and the color is orange-y. Application is easy and you can see where you&#x27;re applying it which is a plus. It might &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; in 60 seconds but it is still slightly tacky for a little bit. I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my knees super orange like other tanners. I&#x27;m going to get my husband to apply this to my whole body to see how much use you get out of one bottle.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this self tanner out at home as I have used other jergen&#x27;s products and found they are a good bang for one&#x27;s buck was disappointed in this. While it helped to maintain my current tan longer than had I not used it, it didn&#x27;t really create a good base color once my tan had totally faded. Additionally, it stained my hands orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was easy to use and see once you had put it on but wasn&#x27;t really fantastic at creating a good sunless tan.</li>
    <li> This works okay. Spend more for a better brand than this. I did, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
