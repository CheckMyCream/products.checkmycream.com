<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is amazing how much nicer my skin is when I use this soap.  I have used Dr. Bronner also and it works well, but this seems to work better.  I think b/c of higher tea tree oil concentration.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what this actually is. They say it smells faintly of tea tree oil and soap, I must have gotten a defective bar, because it smells like soap, there is no tea tree oil in this. I have used tea tree soaps of other brands before, and they treated the mild skin problem I have, and cleared it up, while this does nothing and seems to actually make it worse. I wont buy it again, and will likely be throwing whats left of the bar (about 75%) into the garbage. I would buy plain soap if I wanted plain soap.</li>
    <li> Arrived in the mail on time, looking just as described. I have been struggling with my skin for a few years now, trying lots of different face washes/masks/creams etc. and this soap seems to be just the trick! Absolutely love the smell of the tea tree oil, not too harsh or overly scented. It is very mild and does not leave your skin super dry or flaky as some others will. Definitely will be buying more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfectly fine product! But I&#x27;m on a quest for the perfect tea tree soap.  This was not MY vision of perfection.  I can barely smell the tea tree. But a nice soap in general.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with sebaceous cysts quite often and was told to use this soap to prevent them. Since I started using it, I haven&#x27;t had a single one.  An additional note is that there is no soap scum in the shower. When we clean the tub/shower, there are no spots at all.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Cleared my skin fast</li>
    <li> Fantastic Soap. Tea Tree Oil is great if you work outside in the woods like I do. Helps with any kind of rash treatment. And then keeps yopur skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> My son has very dry itchy skin and is very sensative to most soaps.  This soap helps his skin feel smooth and relieves most of his itch.  So much that he started complaining and scratching as soon as we ran out.  It is very soothing and I started using it when I shave and I have less irritation.  Very good soap!</li>
    <li> Its work on bad skins. May work on good skin lol. Leaves yu feeling fresh to no dry out feel</li>
    <li> It is fine, had used before</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the tea tree soap bar. After cleansing my face with the soap for the past few weeks I have seen a vast improvement with my skin. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Nice soap esp if you are having skin troubles</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap to use if you suffer from acne on your face and/or body. Its scent is refreshing and energizing as well, and it cleans thoroughly. Best part is that it is so inexpensive!</li>

I&#x27;ve found several home-made soaps (or &#x27;small factory made&#x27;) like this which are potent, I prefer them over branded ones. Tea tree is naturally anti bacterial so why touch chemicals if you can avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels pretty hard and solid, not too soft, so it does lasts. You should remember it&#x27;s small (only 110g), however also cheap so pricing is fair.</li>
    <li> I do find it&#x27;s the best tea tree soap out there, and I&#x27;ve tried several including Dr. Bonner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a higher concentration here -- they claim to put as much as they can without the soap falling part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers and rinses well, and helps to reduce body odours, I find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no wrapper at all to dispose of or try to recycle.</li>
    <li> Lathers well but not enough Tea Tree oil in this product.  There is no label of ingredients on this produce so you can not tell how much tea tree oil is in it.  Therefore, you can only tell buy the strength of smell of the tea tree oil.  Tea tree oil at 10% is very apparent. I could NOT detect any smell of tea tree in this product.</li>
    <li> Love it ... Soapworks products are excellent</li>
    <li> Put the kids to bed...looking forward to a hot shower to try my new soap but here I sit peeling (not one quick peel...the frustrating kind when the sticker won&#x27;t come off) the barcode sticker off my bar of soap.(see uploaded picture)  Not a deal breaker but not something I&#x27;m pleased at having to stop and do. Surely there has to be a better way to package. May update to comment on soap once I get this sticker off...</li>
    <li> Would give this soap 5 stars if I could detect the scent of even more tea tree oil. The soap is very nice and sudsy.</li>
    <li> No soap film. Leaves skin feeling clean</li>
    <li> My husband favorite soap</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap. It&#x27;s all I use most days now for my whole body and scalp. It helped me get rid of a horrible plantar wart. And my skin is overall very happy when I use this soap. It&#x27;s not drying or oily. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it both morning and night. It feels gentle but effective. I usually have pretty oily skin but I&#x27;ve recently changed my skin regimen and I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with this, and then I use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner, then I take a cotton pad and wet a bit, add a few drops of tea tree oil (helps with my acne) and peppermint oil in the morning (I don&#x27;t know if the peppermint oil helps with much but it feels really fresh for the morning), and sometimes a few drops of lavender oil. Then I use Dermalogica Oil Control Lotion as moisturizer, but I add a few drops (like 4-5 in the morning, 5-6 at night) of Jojoba oil. I don&#x27;t know if the Dermalogica Oil is actually anything special, considering it&#x27;s kind of expensive. I think just a normal moisturizer will be good enough, I used to use Trader Joe&#x27;s moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good soap for my rosacea. Medical research has often pointed to the microscopic skin mite, demodex, as a potential factor in the cause of rosacea. EVERYONE has demodex mites living in/on their skin (creepy, but true!), but rosacea sufferers often have more than average or an allergy to demodex mites. Tree tree oil is said to kill demodex mites, which is why it&#x27;s often used in some form by people with rosacea. Tree tree oil is very potent however, so it must be used in diluted form to avoid harmful effects. I&#x27;ve found the 2% tea tree oil this soap to be non-irritating and helpful for my skin.</li>
    <li> Soap makes skin feel nice and clean !</li>
    <li> I like having my tea tree oil product in a convenient conventional bar form. No worries about my bottle of liquid tea tree oil product leaking in my luggage when traveling. This bar feels nice, and seems long lasting. Fast shipping from distributor.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and sometimes the water or soap provided at hotels makes my skin itch.  Using this soap seems to have resolved that problem.  I find it rather expensive for a bar of soap but it&#x27;s maintaining it&#x27;s shape and consistency well.</li>
