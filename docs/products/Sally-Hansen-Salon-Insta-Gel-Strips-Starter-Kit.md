### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had wonderful experience with Sally Hansen products up to this point.</li>
      <li>This at home gel kit is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is best to just use gel polish coat and cure with this ramp.</li>
      <li>and they are great!</li>
      <li>Not one of the best gel systems out there.</li>
      <li>I was still really impressed because I use my hands a lot at work, working in dirt</li>
      <li>I thought I loved the Salon Effects strips, but these beat them  by a million!</li>
      <li>And my nails looked great.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy with myself</li>
      <li>I bought this for prom to save some cash and still have my nails look great.  </li>
      <li>Everything worked and I was so happy the gel nail polish works with thw mini led lamp.</li>
      <li>but was happy to see it had a power</li>
      <li>The application itself is fine, perfect, but it&#x27;s the way</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a good way to save money on gel manicures.</li>
      <li>This is a good price for a good product.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>The instructions say to do this with warm hands.  </li>
      <li>My non-dominant hand is going on 3 weeks and still looks nice, except on the bottom where my nails have grown out.</li>
      <li>I was kind of irritated to know I paid for an orange stick, a file and two alcohol pads because those are things that I</li>
      <li>Also run the top coat across the end of the nail before stroking it on, to seal the top edge.</li>
      <li>(and I think most of us) already have in our nail care</li>
      <li>so it was over priced and would of been better to just go to the salon.  </li>
      <li>I have over 20 bottles of the top coat</li>
      <li>Thought it might have been my fault, so I tried once more.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with this item.  </li>
      <li>But the patterned strips are really cute, and I do intend to try more of those as well.  </li>
      <li>I followed the steps to the letter, even choosing the size strips before and laying them out before beginning to minimize touching my nail beds.</li>
      <li>but I had a $2.00 coupon so that made it more palatable to purchase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I saw this product advertised in a magazine and got very excited.  </li>
      <li>But most of the time I get it to work just fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and the size makes it easy to store.</li>
      <li>The strips should dissolve easily.  </li>
      <li>* been easy on them.  </li>
      <li>instructions are fairly easy to follow.  </li>
      <li>I just give it as a gift, and I was glad I did it, because it was a great product at a very low price</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>One of them did come off very quickly -</li>
      <li>The strips should dissolve easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>I smudged it so easily on almost everything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still going strong as well.  </li>
      <li>I recommend filing and scuffing up your nails first and then wiping them with an alcohol soaked cotton ball to ensure they are free from any kind of oils/dust.</li>
      <li>The Gel cured fine and my nails are glossier than with the Insta-color strips.  </li>
      <li>The Gel cured fine and my nails are glossier than with the Insta-color strips.  </li>
      <li>The shapes of these strips are huge and square, I felt as if they were cut for a tranvestite&#x27;s hand (no offense to the trannies).</li>
      <li>/&gt;The time it took to apply these gel strips is greatly reduced from the time of the traditional gel process.  </li>
      <li>I followed the instructions precisely.  </li>
      <li>I put each nail under the LED light gadget twice.  </li>
      <li>The reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because the sizes don&#x27;t exactly fit my nails, and I have to trim some of them to get them to fit.</li>
      <li>You apply the topcoat and then put your nail immediately underneath the LED light for 30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I put each nail under the LED light gadget twice.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because I had a coupon and wanted to try a gel polish kit; this was the cheapest available</li>
      <li>Once the strip is on the nail you want to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>The light turns off automatically after 30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>The top coat is more like an extra shiny top coat that dries in 10-30 seconds under a light.</li>
      <li>All in all, this has allowed me to have nice looking hands, when that was not possible before without a pro manicure. :)</li>
      <li>One star is really too many.  </li>
      <li>The kit was good for only two sets and after that it was a goner</li>
      <li>Anyways, I haven&#x27;t tried the strips, but with other gel polishes it works great.</li>
      <li>but first I used the heat from my fingers to smooth out the color strip.  </li>
      <li>It also could work with regular nailpolish then appy the gel top cat!</li>
      <li>I was impressed with the overall shine of the nails once they were completely dry.  </li>
      <li>The ultra violet light was for one finger at a time and it didn&#x27;t really work as I had to do it about a dozen times for one finger</li>
      <li>but I found that using regular sharp edge tweezers is the best way to pull the excess from underneath the nail tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That would allow for two applications right?  </li>
      <li>I think other reviewers are correct that the key is to have a very good seal all the way around the strip</li>
      <li>Also hoping to use the gel top coat over regular nail polish to get prolonged wear.</li>
      <li>But so far - FABULOUS.  </li>
      <li>I tried Sally Hansen Insta-gel strips for the first time, and I followed the directions explicitly.  </li>
      <li>More time than a traditional manicure of a bottle of polish and topcoat.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t even need to clean the top coat off like you have to with other brands.</li>
      <li>I decided to stop, and since I type all day at work, doing my own nails would always chip; therefore, I would only wear clear nail polish.  </li>
      <li>The little curing light kind of malfunctions and lights up immediately when it&#x27;s plugged in and sometimes shuts off early.</li>
      <li>The process was easy enough, and they do dry instantly after using the UV light, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I took my time placing the strips and made sure they were well-adhered, warmed and stretched with my fingers.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have a lot of time to invest doing it perfectly myself - these were done half at my desk before leaving, and half after the baby was in bed.  </li>
      <li>Seller clearly does not have quality control, I quickly returned it as soon as I received it.</li>
      <li>The strip doesnt result in an opaque color like on the box, it just looks like I slapped on a few coats of super glossy top coat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice little system.</li>
      <li>I would have sent this product back if it were not for the fact that i needed the light for prom and another order would never come that fast.  </li>
      <li>I will just use the remaining gel topcoat on a traditional polish job and see if the LED light works with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will just use the remaining gel topcoat on a traditional polish job and see if the LED light works with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rating this product 1 star is really giving it too much.  </li>
      <li>On the one that did pop off, I used a regular polish and topped with the gel / light as some others have described.  </li>
      <li>I then gently pulled the excess strip out and off my nail.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy what I need to do a REAL gel manicure.</li>
      <li>I always do my own nails and will rather go back to regular nail polish then</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I love the other Sally Hansen nail strips.  </li>
      <li>If they&#x27;ve lasted 4 days on me - prone to chipping to begin with, and also engaged in many nail-threatening activities - then I&#x27;m not sure why they wouldn&#x27;t last even longer on most people.  </li>
      <li>The instructions say to use the orange sticks&#x27; flat side to smooth along the cuticle and sides of nail bed.  </li>
      <li>Most of us wear our nails in an active length.  </li>
      <li>idea, but impossible to make work unless you get PERFECT fit and adherence (especially around the edges)</li>
      <li>I also do not like that you basically have to soak your fingernails in acetone nail polish remover to take the polish off, which I understand is true of all gel polishes, but its just not what I feel like doing since I just did my nails last night.  </li>
      <li>After a day at work -- where I spent most of the day typing, four nails had shipped and the polish had come almost completely off of one.  </li>
      <li>kit includes two alcohol prep pads, an orange stick, a double grit file, gel top coat and 16 color strips of various widths.  </li>
      <li>but my hands are considerably normal size-no super tiny hands here.</li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;m not sure why so many people had problems.  </li>
      <li>Today I polished my nails with a regular (albeit higher end) nail polish brand.  </li>

      <li>The whole process is long, but worth it as my last manicure lasted almost 3 weeks!</li>

    <li> I used to get my nails done professionally all the time.  I decided to stop, and since I type all day at work, doing my own nails would always chip; therefore, I would only wear clear nail polish.  This at home gel kit is wonderful!  The gel prohibits my nails from chipping and I get to wear color on my nails!  The reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because the sizes don&#x27;t exactly fit my nails, and I have to trim some of them to get them to fit.</li>
    <li> Looked great...for about a day. Thought it might have been my fault, so I tried once more. Looked great...until I took a shower. Clear coat bubbled, wrinkled, peeled. Even tried it with regular nail polish. Cured each nail twice each time I tried it. I give up. I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy what I need to do a REAL gel manicure. Least I didn&#x27;t waste too much money on this.</li>
    <li> I just give it as a gift, and I was glad I did it, because it was a great product at a very low price</li>
    <li> My sister bought me the kit for my birthday. The little curing light kind of malfunctions and lights up immediately when it&#x27;s plugged in and sometimes shuts off early. I think the power cord/connection is screwy. But most of the time I get it to work just fine. My other sister has one and it works with no problems. I just got somewhat of a dud. Anyways, I haven&#x27;t tried the strips, but with other gel polishes it works great. I ordered the BMC base/top coat set from Amazon and they are great! You don&#x27;t even need to clean the top coat off like you have to with other brands. I used the TruGel nail color and also a brand called &amp;#34;Fuse!&amp;#34; from Wal-Mart. I cured them for a minute each. I cure everything for a minute even if it only says 30 seconds. I tilt my fingers from side to side to ensure both sides get cured properly. The whole process is long, but worth it as my last manicure lasted almost 3 weeks! My non-dominant hand is going on 3 weeks and still looks nice, except on the bottom where my nails have grown out. But no chipping. My dominant hand started peeling/chipping a little after 2 weeks. I was still really impressed because I use my hands a lot at work, working in dirt and I&#x27;m also in and out of the water a lot. It&#x27;s a nice little system. I recommend filing and scuffing up your nails first and then wiping them with an alcohol soaked cotton ball to ensure they are free from any kind of oils/dust. This helps the manicure stay longer.</li>
    <li> In one word - LAME.  One star is really too many.  I followed the instructions precisely.  And my nails looked great.  After a day at work -- where I spent most of the day typing, four nails had shipped and the polish had come almost completely off of one.  Definitely not worth the time and effort.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It came earlier than expected. Everything worked and I was so happy the gel nail polish works with thw mini led lamp. It also could work with regular nailpolish then appy the gel top cat! This is a good price for a good product. It&#x27;s a must buy!☺</li>
    <li> Rating this product 1 star is really giving it too much.  I spent a solid (something my nails never got) hour and a half on my nails.  They were so see through I had to paint them.  I was so happy with myself so I sat down and I literally just scratched my arm and they fell off.  I sent a complaint to Sally Hansen, so hopefully they will respond.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not possible to give no stars. But this mug is a blatant rip off. It worked once and then broke. No wonder they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore. Absolute crap!</li>
    <li> After receiving the product I noticed a black X on the box marked with a sharpie. After I opened it the product was broken, as I suspected. Seller clearly does not have quality control, I quickly returned it as soon as I received it.</li>
    <li> I did each nail 9 times and it still did not cure. I&#x27;ve had wonderful experience with Sally Hansen products up to this point. I am wondering if this product is faulty for if this wasn&#x27;t actually Sally Hansen set.</li>
    <li> I have Sally Hansen&#x27;s gel nail kit and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I needed to take it with me on my vacation and repair it in case I brake or chip my nail.&lt;br /&gt;It suit my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t use gel strip so I am not sure how it is.&lt;br /&gt;It looks hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;It is best to just use gel polish coat and cure with this ramp.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant but then thought for $28 at Target it was a big steep but maybe I can use over and over again and save money on going to nail salon.  WRONG.  Took over two hours to do both hands and made it inconvenient as I couldn&#x27;t touch anything a I smudged it so easily on almost everything. The ultra violet light was for one finger at a time and it didn&#x27;t really work as I had to do it about a dozen times for one finger and it still didn&#x27;t make it completely dry!  The kit was good for only two sets and after that it was a goner so it was over priced and would of been better to just go to the salon.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I tried Sally Hansen Insta-gel strips for the first time, and I followed the directions explicitly.  The process was easy enough, and they do dry instantly after using the UV light, which is nice. However, less than 24 hours later two of my nails have already chipped.  For this reason, this system is not worth the $14 it costs for the strips each time you want to do your nails.  For that price you might as well go to the salon and get a manicure done.  I also do not like that you basically have to soak your fingernails in acetone nail polish remover to take the polish off, which I understand is true of all gel polishes, but its just not what I feel like doing since I just did my nails last night.  I do not recommend this and I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Followed directions and the polish popped off by the next day. And they are a pain to apply</li>
    <li> Not one of the best gel systems out there. The top coat is more like an extra shiny top coat that dries in 10-30 seconds under a light. The polish strips chip within a day or 2. I don&#x27;t totally mind though since I change my polish so often. I have over 20 bottles of the top coat and when I use it with the foil and cotton ball soak off method it&#x27;s completely off in 5 minutes. Not good for longevity but for added protection until I&#x27;m ready to remove it and for quick removal I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I agree with what all the other posters are saying. I thought it would be a good way to save money on gel manicures. My two previous salon gel manis have each lasted two weeks; I used this kit two days ago, and already, two nails have popped off, despite painstakingly following the directions. Since I&#x27;ve already bought the starter kit, I might give it another go with a different color (I used Shell We Dance, and was not impressed -- nowhere near the quality of Essie Ballet Slippers or OPI Bubble Bath), but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> Was Missing parts! I never got a chance to use it.</li>
    <li> Oh how I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews for these strips before I bought them. I&#x27;d read the reviews for the polish but didnt realize the results would be so poor with the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a petite woman but my hands are considerably normal size-no super tiny hands here. The shapes of these strips are huge and square, I felt as if they were cut for a tranvestite&#x27;s hand (no offense to the trannies). I had to trim them down on all but two fingers. I put these on an hour ago and was so disappointed I wanted to cry. The application itself is fine, perfect, but it&#x27;s the way it looks that&#x27;s the problem. The \\&quot;shell...\\&quot; color is a total misrepresentation. The strip doesnt result in an opaque color like on the box, it just looks like I slapped on a few coats of super glossy top coat. The whole purpose of a manicure at least for me is the have a smooth finish, not see my nail beds underneath, what the hell is the point of that?? I will take this back to CVS and demand my money back. I always do my own nails and will rather go back to regular nail polish then do an hour+ amount of work for piss-poor results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen should be ashamed of themselves for this horrible misrepresentation of color. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I love the other Sally Hansen nail strips.  I wasn&#x27;t pleased with this item.  The curing did not work and when the polish came off, it damaged my nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had a coupon and wanted to try a gel polish kit; this was the cheapest available and I knew going in that it would take some work to get the strips to perform as advertised. I followed the steps to the letter, even choosing the size strips before and laying them out before beginning to minimize touching my nail beds. I took my time placing the strips and made sure they were well-adhered, warmed and stretched with my fingers. I wrapped the tips and even cured an extra cycle under the lamp. They started peeling off within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Good idea, but impossible to make work unless you get PERFECT fit and adherence (especially around the edges) when applying the strips. I have short nails, so I was able to cut the strips in half for two applications, so I&#x27;ll try again. Also hoping to use the gel top coat over regular nail polish to get prolonged wear. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to invest in gel nails, choose a regular polish kit. Ultimately you get what you pay for, and there&#x27;s a reason you pay so little for this.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here before I tried these and I was dubious.  Well I&#x27;m not sure why so many people had problems.  I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;ll last a whole 2 weeks, but I can tell you this: a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; manicure on me chips within 12 hours every time.  I&#x27;ve had these on for four days and there is one small chip on my pinkie. One of them did come off very quickly - it was clear I had not sealed that one tightly to my nail and water had gotten under and lifted it.  I think other reviewers are correct that the key is to have a very good seal all the way around the strip (press it down with opposite fingers &amp; squeeze hard), and make sure the gel top coat goes a little past the edges of the strip.  Also run the top coat across the end of the nail before stroking it on, to seal the top edge. The gel should be thin so it doesn&#x27;t run into your cuticles and build up a ridge that could cause lifting.  I&#x27;m no expert at this stuff, as I said a typical manicure with base &amp; top coat chips on me virtually instantly, so I usually don&#x27;t bother to do my nails at all.  But I&#x27;m newly single, and if I ever manage to get a date I&#x27;d prefer my hands not look like a 3rd grader&#x27;s.  So I resolved to try at home gel - since I&#x27;m also (single) mother to a 2 year old and don&#x27;t have time or money to go out and get my nails done.  I don&#x27;t even have a lot of time to invest doing it perfectly myself - these were done half at my desk before leaving, and half after the baby was in bed.  As I said they&#x27;ve lasted 4 days, and I have *not* been easy on them.  I don&#x27;t have a dishwasher, and my hair is really long, and I bathe the baby in addition to myself - they&#x27;ve had lots of exposure to water.  Not to mention plenty of chip-prone activities like wrestling the baby into and out of his clothes, changing diapers, and carting around 3 tons of baggage and often a wriggling child everywhere I go.  If they&#x27;ve lasted 4 days on me - prone to chipping to begin with, and also engaged in many nail-threatening activities - then I&#x27;m not sure why they wouldn&#x27;t last even longer on most people.  On the one that did pop off, I used a regular polish and topped with the gel / light as some others have described.  It&#x27;s still going strong as well.  I thought the strips were a bit fussy to put on, and they&#x27;re more expensive, so I expect I&#x27;ll probably opt for regular polish as a rule.  But the patterned strips are really cute, and I do intend to try more of those as well.  All in all, this has allowed me to have nice looking hands, when that was not possible before without a pro manicure. :)</li>
    <li> I am not sure why the other reviewers had issues - My manicure is 1 1/2 weeks old now, I do not have a single chip and it is still shiny and pretty.  And I work at a computer all day, my #1 issue is that the ends chip and break from typing.  But so far - FABULOUS.  I thought I loved the Salon Effects strips, but these beat them  by a million!</li>
    <li> I saw this product advertised in a magazine and got very excited.  I used to do the whole messy gel process at home (mixing the powder alone was a pain).  I was a bit shocked when I learned the price of the kit but I had a $2.00 coupon so that made it more palatable to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is available in a few color choices (one color per kit).  Then you buy individual Insta gel color strips at 14.99 per box.  I chose the kit with the Shell We Dance color strips and also purchased a separate box of strips in the Punch Drunk color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see how small the LED curing gadget was.  I figured it was going to be battery operated but was happy to see it had a power adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are fairly easy to follow.  I read through them all thoroughly however before starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes two alcohol prep pads, an orange stick, a double grit file, gel top coat and 16 color strips of various widths.  I thought 16 was a strange amount.  I mean, most of us have 10 fingers.  So why not 10 for a lower price or include an extra 4 for an even 20.  That would allow for two applications right?  I was kind of irritated to know I paid for an orange stick, a file and two alcohol pads because those are things that I (and I think most of us) already have in our nail care kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by filing my nails to the desired length and shape.  I softened and pushed my cuticles back (this is important in order to place the color strip evenly at the base of your nail).  I washed my hands, dried completely and then swabbed my nails with the alcohol pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I examined the color strips and selected the needed sizes for each nail.  The strips are fairly long (over an inch) with a tab at the ends.  You peel the plastic cover off and then peel the strip from its backing.  You then position the color strip evenly on your nail starting at the nail bed.  The instructions say to do this with warm hands.  Once the strip is on the nail you want to smooth it out.  The instructions say to use the orange sticks&#x27; flat side to smooth along the cuticle and sides of nail bed.  I did that but first I used the heat from my fingers to smooth out the color strip.  I then gently pulled the excess strip out and off my nail.  In my opinion, there is a LOT of waste with the color strip.  Most of us wear our nails in an active length.  I didn&#x27;t pay that amount of money for half the color strip to be thrown in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use the pale pink grit of the included file to get the excess color plastic off of the edge of the nails.  The instructions don&#x27;t mention this but I found that using regular sharp edge tweezers is the best way to pull the excess from underneath the nail tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying all the color strips it was time to brush with the curing gel topcoat.  You apply the topcoat and then put your nail immediately underneath the LED light for 30 seconds.  The light turns off automatically after 30 seconds.  The instructions say at this point your manicure is done.  It is NOT.  Your nails will still be tacky (sticky) for at least 10 more minutes.  So, don&#x27;t do anything with them until they are completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was impressed with the overall shine of the nails once they were completely dry.  The next day I noticed they weren&#x27;t as shiny AND there were two that had been chipped.  Not just a small chip but a noticeable chunk was missing.  I figured out the reason for the extra 6 color chips in the kit...REPLACEMENT.  The problem is I had already used the size needed for that nail so that size was not in the remaining 6 extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time it took to apply these gel strips is greatly reduced from the time of the traditional gel process.  But it still took time.  More time than a traditional manicure of a bottle of polish and topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for removing the gel strips are:  Soak each nail in nail polish remover (acetone) and then coverwith foil.  The strips should dissolve easily.  I have an easier way.  Scrape your nail with another nail or any sharp object and just PEEL the darn thing off.  Easy Peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the time it takes to apply these correctly and the lackluster result, I have to say that I am NOT impressed.  I am going to return the extra color strip pack I purchased.  I will just use the remaining gel topcoat on a traditional polish job and see if the LED light works with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 1/25/13:  Today I polished my nails with a regular (albeit higher end) nail polish brand.  I let them dry for 20 minutes and them applied the Gel Cure that was included in the kit.  I put each nail under the LED light gadget twice.  The Gel cured fine and my nails are glossier than with the Insta-color strips.  So, if you are not happy with the kit itself keep the light and the Gel Cure and use it in conjunction with your regular polish.with foil.  The strips should dissolve easily.  I have an easier way.

    <li> Easy to use and the size makes it easy to store.</li>
    <li> I bought this for prom to save some cash and still have my nails look great.  Luckily i bought a second color of nails at the local drug store because when this came only days before my prom the nails that were supposed to be in the package were not there.  I would have sent this product back if it were not for the fact that i needed the light for prom and another order would never come that fast.  so overall i like the product i was just very unhappy when i found that i didn&#x27;t get what i paid for.</li>
