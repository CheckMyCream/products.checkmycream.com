    <li> Works very well on my kids. I bought it because they swim a lot, it protects better than other brands.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. No longer need to be afraid playing outside. Shipment took too long time.</li>
    <li> this sunscreen is the best out of the market in my view . None stick  , absorb well and it doesn&#x27;t give you a &amp;#34; white mask&amp;#34; look like other products . Most of all , it&#x27;s very effective . I always use this in a hot day outside in summer or snow day in winter . I don&#x27;t give a five star it&#x27;s because the shipping took more than 45 days to arrive. I had to rush to buy another one from different seller for my vacation.</li>
    <li> Feels light on the skin, very good, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good product! Will buy it again:)</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen❤️it&#x27;s light, not greasy, it feels like silk on my skin. Smells nice,Works awesome.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have used, a little expansive though.</li>
    <li> I feel good about this product.  I always use SPF.  But other brands don&#x27;t work on my face.  I always have hat on under this strong-sunny-Los Angeles. I love the fact that it sticks to my face and doesn&#x27;t disappear, when I jump in the pool and get out. It is water resistant.</li>
    <li> very good quality! Faster delivery than I thought! I love it</li>
    <li> Not oily at all. And has no scent, do it does not interfere with my perfuem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best of all, it does the job!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to spread over on the face; It wouldn&#x27;t make skin looks too white or oily; Size is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Comfortable for the skin.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen if you have oily skin.  If you are looking for a moisturizing product, this is not it however.  It goes on very smoothly, and leaves no residue.  I use it on my face and neck every day, and my previous bottle lasted for just over a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from S.Korea and all my friends back there use this products a lot and I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere(I went to Macy&#x27;s, Dilard&#x27;s...etc they didn&#x27;t carry this product) So I had to order it through amazon, the delivery wasn&#x27;t so fast since it came from Hong-Kong(It&#x27;s said its from there) but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quailty of the product. It&#x27;s not greasy or anything. I love it! I would def. buy it again when im done using one.</li>
