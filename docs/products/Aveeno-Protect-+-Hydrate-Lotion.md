### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Otherwise, happy shopping!</li>
      <li>This is probably an excellent block...</li>
      <li>happy with this and would recommend it for anyone with lupus or who is allergic to aspirin!</li>
      <li>Great product sold by a great seller!</li>
      <li>This worked perfectly for me when I was at the county fair all day.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be a great product.</li>
      <li>However, this is a great sunscreen if you don&#x27;t wear makeup.  </li>
      <li>However, I will happily rub it in thoroughly to have good protection for my skin.</li>
      <li>This seems like a good product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Again .. it seems to be a good product ..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually a good workout for your arms.</li>
      <li>Nice sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and comfey.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not oily/greasy at all, which is very important to me.  </li>
      <li>Its better for the body than the face because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply with no skin irritation.</li>
      <li>I have lupus, and wearing a strong sunscreen is important.  </li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t stay outside more than a couple hours since we are fair skinned and burn easily.</li>
      <li>Feels clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>put on an even coating of the lotion, and it did need rubbing in a bit more in spots, but I felt it absorbed well and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I use it daily and am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I should add that I am fairly young (around 30) and am mostly interested in preventing these temporary wrinkles from becoming more permanent establishments.</li>
      <li>Aveeno is typically the best option for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is oily, and I have been told it is acne prone, even though I actually rarely break out.</li>
      <li>directions recommend reapplying after 80 minutes, which I didn&#x27;t do, but I suffered no ill effects.  </li>
      <li>Better to use Clear Zinc, which is instantly clear and water resistant.</li>
      <li>I deducted 1 star because this formula doesn&#x27;t work well under makeup because it doesn&#x27;t spread very well.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is really greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin.</li>
      <li>You have to rub it in pretty well for your face to not look kind of pale, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for ensuring adequate sun protection for your face when you live in Florida!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you are interested in knowing any of the specific brands, please let me know!</li>
      <li>This Aveeno natural sunscreen lotion does leave white traces on your skin unless you rub it in very well.</li>
      <li>have been using this product in conjunction with a silk pillow for sleeping, a few drops of almond oil at night, a coconut oil washing once a day, an Aztec mud mask with apple cider vinegar once a week, a daily apricot scrub, a daily slathering on of an all-natural retinal product, and a frequently used rose water toner.</li>
      <li>My old skin loves it.</li>
      <li>either (1) really work it in or (2) have white streaks.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt smooth afterwards, instead of greasy and gross like a lot of other</li>
      <li>The only issue I have with this sunscreen is that it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well at all and leaves a white film, luckily I&#x27;m pretty white already so it&#x27;s not so noticeable.</li>
      <li>bought this as part of a new &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; skin regimen I&#x27;ve recently started,</li>
      <li>No harsh smell and does not sting like some other high SPF sunscreens I have tried.</li>
      <li>Not water resistant at all, not sweatproof, does not dry even after 15 minutes.  </li>

<li> There&#x27;s also the white cast issue that you typically get from mineral base sunscreens but if you were able to wear this under your makeup it wouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue but since you can&#x27;t minus half a star.  </li>

<li> After using one bottle we through the rest away because we hated it so much</li>
<li> Not a good look for faces in the USA.</li>
<li> But keep in mind that it is very, very thick.  </li>
<li> If you want a sunscreen to wear under your makeup, skip this option but by no means is this a bad sunscreen.</li>

    <li> Leave a white film on your skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great product. Easy to apply with no skin irritation. We don&#x27;t stay outside more than a couple hours since we are fair skinned and burn easily. Aveeno is typically the best option for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this sunscreen takes a lot of work to rub in. I mean, a lot. It&#x27;s actually a good workout for your arms. And then you&#x27;ll still look paler overall than when you started. Despite it&#x27;s SPF 50 sun protectant factor, I still burned in areas I was not already tanned despite faithful reapplication.</li>
    <li> This works as protection from the sun but does NOT rub in well. Leaves white streaks all over.</li>
    <li> Not water resistant at all, not sweatproof, does not dry even after 15 minutes.  Better to use Clear Zinc, which is instantly clear and water resistant.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products but this one stinks.  Just go get some zinc oxide and use that as your sun tan lotion.  After using one bottle we through the rest away because we hated it so much and it gets everywhere.  We did like the Avenno Spray SPF, we would recommend that.</li>
    <li> My old skin loves it.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is NOT sweat proof. I was using it this summer while in Florida and it starts running down my face within 15 minutes. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for a facial sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is probably an excellent block...but it makes you look like a kabuki dancer.  Not a good look for faces in the USA.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily, and I have been told it is acne prone, even though I actually rarely break out. I sometimes feel that this sunscreen actually makes my skin look LESS oily (I&#x27;m not sure how that could be), and it definitely doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.

Whew, I feel like that is a lot, especially considering I was just washing with water a month or so ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in knowing any of the specific brands, please let me know! Otherwise, happy shopping! I hope you find what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin.</li>
    <li> Nice sunscreen. Not oily at all. Feels clean and smooth. I use it daily and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 3/5 star rating. I deducted 1 star because this formula doesn&#x27;t work well under makeup because it doesn&#x27;t spread very well.  You have to apply pressure during application in order to spread and blend it.  There&#x27;s also the white cast issue that you typically get from mineral base sunscreens but if you were able to wear this under your makeup it wouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue but since you can&#x27;t minus half a star.  However, this is a great sunscreen if you don&#x27;t wear makeup.  There&#x27;s no stinging and drying effect and it also doesn&#x27;t make you oily. I wear this on days where I don&#x27;t wear makeup and also on my neck and chest.  I also use it on arms and legs and it moisturizes without feeling oily and sticky.  I would buy again for that purpose.  If you want a sunscreen to wear under your makeup, skip this option but by no means is this a bad sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have lupus, and wearing a strong sunscreen is important.  This worked perfectly for me when I was at the county fair all day.  It&#x27;s not oily/greasy at all, which is very important to me.  It also doesn&#x27;t contain any aspirin-like products (salicylates, etc.), which is something I look for since I&#x27;m allergic to aspirin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on an even coating of the lotion, and it did need rubbing in a bit more in spots, but I felt it absorbed well and quickly.  My skin felt smooth afterwards, instead of greasy and gross like a lot of other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions recommend reapplying after 80 minutes, which I didn&#x27;t do, but I suffered no ill effects.  If I had been hotter than the upper 70s like it was, I probably would have needed to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this and would recommend it for anyone with lupus or who is allergic to aspirin!</li>
    <li> skin does not absorb it , it leaves white residue</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue, and does not breath during heavy exercise, skin feels clammy.</li>
    <li> This seems like a good product.  But keep in mind that it is very, very thick.  And it doesn&#x27;t absorb so expect to either (1) really work it in or (2) have white streaks.  Its better for the body than the face because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again .. it seems to be a good product .. but it does suffer from this serious flaw.</li>
    <li> Great product sold by a great seller!</li>
