<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Amazing smell and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this have to buy more!</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars but the bubble wrap was so tightly wrapped around the sage that when I went to cut it open the string was cut. not sure what string to use to replace it but not sure if I should exchange just because of that. Nice smelling sage though</li>
    <li> WOW this bundle is huge.  I decided to purchase this to cleanse my house.  I know that may sound funny to some but at times I seem to feel negative energy when I am at home, it&#x27;s random and I figure periodically burning sage around the house can&#x27;t hurt anything.  Additionally, earlier in the year I had went to a psychic party and had a reading.  During the reading, the medium advised me to cleanse my house, specifically a certain area with sage and gave me some to take home with me.  I cleansed my house as advised and don&#x27;t really know if it did anything but it has been probably close to a year since then.</li>
    <li> Much larger then I expected but it burns really good.</li>
    <li> I received this product within a week. Product was protected by careful packaging. I saged my home and enjoyed the scent.</li>
    <li> Cool stuffing. Great for hpuse blessing</li>
    <li> I love this sage.. California YOU ROCK.  I burned it for hours and it last forever.  I have plenty left.  It has a great aroma.  I can get addicted to this stuff. I told my sis to order too.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase my smudge sticks locally at a few shops....was I ever overpaying!!  For the same price as I paid for these TWO sage bundles, I would get 1 bundle, half the size!!  Will definately be a return shopper!!</li>
    <li> nice big bundle...very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> this product met my expectations.The price was great, and the end result was what i was expecting, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> this is the biggest bundle of sage I have ever seen lol. I am so glad I have a shell to rest it in.</li>
    <li> super fast especially when I need to Sage your  home as we all know say Sage really helps take out the negative energy and it really works  – it&#x27;s quite amazing thing I would say this sage is .</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis to purify my home and environs. Very pleasant smell to remove negative vibrations !</li>
    <li> This bundle was perfect for what I needed.  I cleansed my house and a friends with no problems.  Thank you.  Will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I keep sage on hand at all times. this bundle was packaged great. loose enough that I can pull from it yet tight enough that I can use the bundle as a whole if wanting to.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with the size and smell of the sage, good size in bundle and the price was really low in price</li>
    <li> First time ordering these little treasures. Perfect, as expected.  I&#x27;m going to send all negative energy out of my new home. Out with the bad, in with the good.</li>
    <li> A little big but went a long way.  Enough to cleanse my daughter&#x27;s house as well.  Smells nice.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice...Is very good quality and have a nice.very nice aroma.For sure I will by this product in the future.Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t burned them yet but they are meaty and fragrant</li>
    <li> Love it and affordable. Use it almost everyday. This would last me about a month or so. Would recommend everyone to buy this.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, great value and very good quality, potent sage. These bundles can last quite long depending on usage.</li>
    <li> Well grown, great aroma before &amp; after burning. I burn this often &amp; love it. I would recommend. Also arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> Arrived extremely fast! Smells fresh and earthly, I dnt know how wel it&#x27;s getting rid of negative energy but it&#x27;s big enough for me to keep trying!</li>
    <li> Very Happy. BIG Bundle. Order Said It Was Small, But This Is A Big Sucker,&lt;br /&gt;It Will keep Me Busy For Many Months.</li>
    <li> After extensive research, I found SK Sage. The product is top notch, burns like a dream (wait, do dreams burn?), and smells amazing. The price is spot on too, but the clincher for me is the freebie! With this specific smudge stick, I received a small one (maybe 2 inches) free of charge. Since I ordered the smudge stick for a friend, I kept the little one for myself and have just enough for occasional smudgings. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is order number two for me from this brand, and is definitely not the last.</li>
    <li> The poltergeist that lives in my bathroom cabinet seems to prefer this brand.</li>
    <li> The smell was nice, but the wrapping was so loose that pieces of the sage were constantly falling out. I could not light it as a whole due to the loose stringing and therefore had to cut the string, empty all the pieces into a glass bowl, and light it in there. It was a bummer. I order many of these and also make them of my own. Tight stringing around the sage is VITAL for easy lighting and enjoyment; both of which I sadly did not receive with this order.</li>
    <li> Very nice, I will order more!</li>
    <li> did what it needed to do, but threw away after 1 burn...</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly &amp; was actually a little bigger than what I expected. This was a 1st time buy for this kind of product but overall I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> as advertised. very fast delivery will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was super excited when my order arrived, because I wanted to cleanse our new house.But it&#x27;s smells so strong, and I can&#x27;t take it. Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to find something else to do a house cleansing.  Sage isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I needed a cheap but good sage stick for my house and this fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s wrapping is so intricate and really holds it together. It smells delightful - before I even burn it. It&#x27;s big enough to last me a while.</li>
    <li> Best incense to clear and clean your home from bad energy; that at times we bring or others bring to our home.</li>
    <li> Love the sage I got today! It is strong and it definitely cleansed My home! Love a GREAT buy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent, quick light and slow burning! Perfect for Native American smudging&#x27;s and other house/body cleansing rituals. We&#x27;ve ordered this several times and not a complaint one. Excellent item, and service.</li>
    <li> Speedy service...love the product</li>
    <li> Very nice, large smudge stick. This burns well, and smells great. Once you are finished burning this, it leaves behind a very nice scent that fills your entire house. It also can be put out easily in a jar, so you can burn a little at a time.ni</li>
    <li> It is what I expected so I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So I received this in the mail way before the delivery due date which was excellent. Was amazed at how big it was and full. Use it right away and actually had to bring it up and make a smaller bunch to bless my house as it was way to much. I have had it for over a month and I&#x27;m still trying to go through the small punch I created from the big bunch. Smells good to me as well and I can feel the difference of the energy in my house.</li>
    <li> Love it. The sage is a great quality.</li>
    <li> not working like I thought it might. a liitle disappointed  in quality.hoped  it would&#x27;ve worked out the way they say.</li>
    <li> arrived less than 5 days . the size is what I expected and smells strong but love it!!</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, exactly as described, will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a tough time and needed some cleansing. I&#x27;m feeling much better now and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the sage smudging experience yet, but am pleased to have everything I need.  This product was sealed in plastic and came in on time.</li>
    <li> dont burn it for a long time,you will smell it all over. be careful mine lost some burt ins that was still hot. i would make sure it was in a place where you can keep a eye on, or have something under to catch the lost pices. over all after i got use to it, i liked it.  just make sure it is out. for safty.</li>
    <li> This was wrapped well, there was a generous amount and it smelled wonderful. Top notch.</li>
    <li> Purify myself and my home with it daily.  Smells great.  Stays lit.  I hold it over a metal bowl.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> The picture gives the product a feeling of being small, but it&#x27;s not! It&#x27;s quite a thick bundle.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived securely wrapped, smells amazing when burned (and afterwards as well), and I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT... LOVE IT... LOVE IT.. The best made large bundles of white sage, that I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!! AWESOME.....</li>
    <li> I expected Sage to smell different, maybe like Lavendar or something.&lt;br /&gt;In reality it smells like smoke. Like smoke from an open fire.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as my new apartment has a bad smell from the previous tenants dog peeing on the carpet.&lt;br /&gt;This did get rid of the dog smell for a while, but replaced it with a &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try purchase a strong peppermint oil aroma disperser.</li>
    <li> I use this to get odors from cooking out of my house</li>
    <li> its aswome I still have it and when things aren&#x27;t going good I use it.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent. Bundled nicely!</li>
    <li> Perfect for Yoga Room</li>
    <li> This was a big huge bundle I am STILL working on to burn. I found it was very easy to unwrap it and use what I needed and a large bundle like this would smudge a a whole house a few times.You&#x27;d get more smudging out of it by breaking it up. I love sage!!!</li>
    <li> I was quite impressed. I have been purchasing my smudge sticks from a local Head shop for years. Recently he stopped selling the large ones so I decided to try Amazon. I was immediately amazed at the size. And after trying it I was equally happy with the quality. Thanks, guys! I like your overall &#x27;vibes&#x27;,</li>
    <li> Extremely Satisfied with this purchase and my home feels lighter &amp; Clear.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great ! I Blessed my home with this!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and nicely packaged. I have used it several times and still have at least 10 uses left. Nice, thick, fresh bundle of white sage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth buying.It helps to cleanse away all negativity . I recommend it....</li>
    <li> great for negative release</li>
    <li> I liked the sage smoke smell, It was easy to use. But it has a strong staying power.If you don&#x27;t want the smell to linger in your home, do it outside. You skin smelled sage all day. But it a nice way to feel you&#x27;re purging any bad energy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and in great shape. The sage smells amazing and soothing! I am really looking forward to smudging. Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> Really nice white sage bundle and pretty big. Great flavor the smoke also lasts awhile and works great but would be better if it was wrapped in organic cotton or hemp rope.</li>
    <li> Good but I like a softer midwestern sage</li>
    <li> It arrived very quick. smells great and used to cleanse the home of negative vibes. included a mini bonus one</li>
    <li> Product is as described.  I am very happy with it. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sage to smuge my crystals and this was perfect. i might have to buy another because i&#x27;ve been using it clense my house</li>
    <li> These fantastic sage sticks arrived very quickly.  They are big and fat and last for a long time. I have ordered this product before and love them!  I will be back.</li>
    <li> I received my purchase within a couple of days after ordering.  I was also given an extra bonus with my order.</li>
    <li> The bundles are so abundant that one would last for a Month. Sage is great for burning to Cleanse or to Cook with. Must have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as big as advertised and should last quite awhile. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> This sage stick is so loosely bundled together and tied with thread that the leaves are falling out all over the place.  I haven&#x27;t tried to smudge with it yet, as I&#x27;m afraid the burning leaves will go flying off all over and start a fire, seriously...</li>
    <li> these sage sticks are HUGE. Had an issue with the 1st order but the company took care of it immedialty</li>
    <li> I never got it sent to me..I had the right address and I waited for along time.This was a waste of my money and I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> this is my second order...the price is right and I love this product!!</li>
    <li> Not only do they ship quickly ,the smudge stick is H-U-G-E ,there price is amazing and the sage is great quality but they ship you a little nubby smudge stick (which is almost the size of a normal smudge stick) as a free thank you gift. The sage alone smells fantastic. The smoke is strong but subtle and lasting, not pungent and overbearing like most that have a stink to it.  I highly advise these guys if you desire a great quality for the price sage stick.</li>
    <li> The smudge sticks are pretty big, so I didn&#x27;t have to stop and use another stick. They arrived in good condition and the smell is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> great price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I camp in the forest a lot and lighting a sage stick by my chair really helped keeps mosquitoes away naturally.</li>
    <li> This sage is not fresh and the majority of the leaves are dead and rotted.  I usually love the calming aroma of sage, but this smelled just terrible!  Save your money!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this smudge stick I wasn&#x27;t expecting the size to be as large as it was.  It is an absolutely beautiful smudge stick that is expertly bound. I would highly recommend to others who are looking for a large stick.</li>

    <li> It arrived in the mail about 3 hours ago and I immediately smudged with it, Not only does it smell fresh, it also lights very well and produces a lot of smoke. I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have used the sage bundle to smudge our house of unwanted negetativity.  It makes the house smell good also.</li>

    <li> Wonderful smell, burns nice and great for the price.  I highly recommend trying this product! It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing it&#x27;s a huge bundle my mom purchased one at a Native American powwow many years ago and I got her this one when I finished up her old one and she was skeptical and angry at first but when we received it we were very pleased to see the quality in the bundle and it smelled amazing I still have so much left and I burn it all the time just be careful because if u burn a lot in a small room and it gets smokey the alarms go off</li>
    <li> the ones I got are very thick, have a absolutely fantastic smell, seem relativity fresh compared to the super dried out ones I get at my local store for twice the price.</li>
    <li> Although the smell of this product is not the most desirable I still like it . I use it for cleansing purpose to get rid of lingering negative energy. Its a good product and I try to use it weekly because I truly believe that things are often left behind in our vicinity such as different energies and spiritual aspects . I would recommend it , it does whats it&#x27;s suppose to do .</li>
    <li> for 8 inches its a great price compared to any other store ive been too.highly satisfied and would purchase again</li>
    <li> Cheap, HUGE bundle, smells great, looks great, burns great. Shipped FAST.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Great sage stick, quite large and very aromatic, very little flakage from the dried leaves, arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and cleanses well.</li>
    <li> did not care for the binding string but other then that, nice, the bonus gift bundle was just the right size too.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN AWESOME ORDER , IT CAME ON TIME, SAME SIZE AND AFFORDABLE, CLEAR THE NEGATIVE ENERGY OUT OF MY HOME</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because I believe it worked wonderfully. There was nothing I disliked about the product. It helped accomplish a goal</li>
    <li> I love this California white Sage!  The smudge stick shape and size are just perfect to my liking. when I light it; the smell is great and postive energies..</li>
    <li> I gave the product 3 stars because I just used it and I don&#x27;t know the results yet. I used the sage smoke to cleanse my apartment of negative energy and any possible spirits that might be around. I am trying to create as positive a world as possible for myself. I read that burning sage in the bedroom will get rid of bad energies and nightmares. It is worth a try!</li>
    <li> I have not burned them yet for smudging...but the sticks smell great! They are a good size - especially since you have to hold one end.</li>
    <li> Very good price. It is for real. This is another item I use on a regular basis. The store here in my town where I was buying my sage did not even give such a large amount. The amount half this size was $6.00. I know now where I am getting my sage from. Thank you.</li>
    <li> So far it is great. It does smell to me a bit like maryjane though dying, but I believe it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this item</li>
    <li> Sage, good ol sage. This is wonderful for clearing negative energy from a room. I love the smell too. My doggies don&#x27;t care for it all. They sneeze constantly and then want to go outside, when I forget to put them out.</li>
    <li> I use these for smudging. Lots of smoke, I recommend covering the detectors because they will go off. I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This item was so strong that you could actually smell it thru the packaging. That made me happy becuz I knew it was specially made, not pre-packaged. Awesome. Please purchase from this company. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> much thicker than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I  found that the sage sticks to be very fresh and gifted both.</li>
    <li> excellent product for the money.  It suited my purpose, my ghost cat is gone, although I did love that cat more than anyone could know.  I wonder where I sent him, maybe I should have left him visiting me at night.  I know this sounds crazy and I never had any type of ghost visit it before.  I have heard that the sage smudging only send away bad spirits.  My cat had gone wild, running with feral cats beore he died. Prehaps he was more wild than tame when he died.  maybe that is why the smudging sent the cats ghost away.  I am usually a totally sane person but this whole episode freaked me out</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s the first time that I&#x27;ve been able to find fresh and green sage&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am very happy with this purchase.  I liked the great shipping&lt;br /&gt;the vendor was quick to response, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Great stuff very strong, should get all those demons out. I really enjoy this product, you should buy it for all your smudging needs</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because I like the sage it was cheap and it did the job. However it burns way to quickly and it flakes off easily too. I would recommend it however its messy and burns quick.</li>
    <li> I will only buy my sage from this seller.  The wands are HUGE and long-lasting.  Nothing but the best and you get your money&#x27;s worth!!  Not to mention, the smudging works every time!!</li>
