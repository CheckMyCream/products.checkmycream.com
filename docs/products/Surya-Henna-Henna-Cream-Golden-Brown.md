      <li>I&#x27;m thinking of doing what one person said, and leave it on while watching a movie to get more color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair with straight up body art quality henna and indigo for years now.  I&#x27;m sick of the smell and the grit and how difficult it is to wash out.  I also found it difficult to always get the right mix for what I was trying to achieve.  I wanted to try something different, but I love the translucent, natural looking quality of henna and didn&#x27;t want to go with the usual chemical mixes.  I did some research and came up with this.    I chose Golden Brown. My hair is a medium to dark brown, but I have some stand out grays, and this product did exactly what I wanted it to: it gave most of my hair a sheen and colored the grays a golden blonde color, which makes them look like natural highlights.  Surya was also easy to apply and smelled great compared to straight henna.  Easy to rinse out.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Even if I have to use it more often than regular henna, it&#x27;s much less hassle and I think the grays will be less obvious as they grow in anyway.    Edited to add:    Well, I gave up on the Surya.  Everything I wrote was true, except that the color faded with stunning speed.  I switched to darker colors to compensate, and they didn&#x27;t really last longer.  It also bled, which stands to reason.  I switched back to body art quality henna and indigo.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product, it does not work.  I have very little grey, just a one here and there.  Followed all the instructions exactly and left on for the full time. No grey coverage and no extra shine, etc.</li>
    <li> Great if you have allergies like I do. Have received many compliments on the color - golden brown.</li>
    <li> This product is so much easier than the mix-up henna.  Color looks great - hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product, yet, at the same time I will probably buy it again.  I have medium-brown hair with some light brown at the front and tips.  It&#x27;s a bit past my shoulders.  I have a bit of gray hair at my temples - it&#x27;s not super noticable unless I pull my hair back, but it&#x27;s way too much to just pluck.  Before using this I had never colored my hair before because I wanted to avoid the nasty chemicals and upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to use (shampoo, blot dry, apply, let sit, then wash out and use conditioner).  I followed the chart, and I think I let is sit about 30 minutes.  It was a good thickness so it didn&#x27;t drip at all, and it didn&#x27;t leave any stain behind on my hairline (I did apply vaseline to my hairline) or in my shower.  I used maybe 3/4 of a bottle for my hair.  This company has a video on Henna application online that may be helpful for first-timers like me.&lt;br /&gt;End result: Most, but not all, of my grays turned into a sort of gold (not blond, not brown) color.  They didn&#x27;t look like highlights, but they didn&#x27;t stick out like gray hair anymore- they just sorta blended in with the rest of my hair.  There were a handful of white hairs that stayed totally white, even though I think I applied it pretty evenly.  The areas of my hair that were very light brown before (the front and ends) seemed a bit darker brown to me, and it did seem like it gave it a bit of a reddish hue.  I did not have a single person, except my husband, notice the change!  But I don&#x27;t think many people noticed my grays before either.  But I felt like I looked better because the grays weren&#x27;t noticable any more.  I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair quality changed at all - it didn&#x27;t get silkier or anything, but I didn&#x27;t have badly damaged or dry hair to start with.&lt;br /&gt;After ~3 weeks of washing with regular shampoo every other day, it has washed out maybe ~80%.&lt;br /&gt;So, for a lazy gal like me it&#x27;s a bit of work to not cover grays completely or last very long.  But, I still dislike my grays and I am not ready for harsh chemicals, so I do plan on using it again to tide me over until I have more grays.  I might also wait and use it again before a special occasion.ke my grays and I am not ready for harsh chemicals, so I do plan on using it again to tide me over until I have more grays.

    <li> Love the color and it is healthy to use.  I feel the price is also good.  Will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I had asked for and paid for 4four bottles of Golden brown&amp;#34;.  I received three and one &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not worth my time and effort to return the incorrect one, but it was disappointing.  The product&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> First time I used this product I gave it a 4 star review but unfortunately when I attempted to use it for a second time after a month, the color did not take.  Therefore, I am changing my first review to 1 star.</li>
    <li> I sent this product back.  I picked the wrong color based on the product reviews.  I reordered in light brown.</li>
    <li> If you have lots of gray, Surya Cream is probably not for you. It fades VERY quickly. I&#x27;m about 70% gray; my original color was dark brown. After 4 washings my hair would be a different shade, going from about a 5 to a 4 in conventional dye terms. Re: the frequent claim that Surya leaves no skunk line, that can only be true if you&#x27;re covering very little gray. My roots were as prominent with Surya as with any other dye, but because Surya fades fast, the line was not rigid. Worst of all, it brought out the orange in my grays. At first it was slight, and I limited it by blending golden brown and light brown. But over several months, sections of my hair became straight-up orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction sheet says Surya is \\&quot;semipermanent...meaning the color dissipates after several washings.\\&quot; This was true only when I wanted the color to last. Once I wanted to get rid of it, I couldn&#x27;t. Having foolishly believed what I read online about Surya washing out in 7 to 9 shampoos, I stopped dyeing. After a dozen shampoos, my hair wasn&#x27;t getting much lighter--but it was turning even more orange. Twice I emailed the company for assistance at the address on the box and got no answer. I called and was told that the dye doesn&#x27;t completely wash out of gray hair and that the orange was unavoidable once I stopped dyeing. I was also told that the orange I got when dyeing regularly was the result of dyeing too often (which was necessary due to rapid fading), even though the instruction sheet says Surya \\&quot;can be used frequently with no time interval.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to go back to my natural color. The first professional I consulted about the transition refused to touch my hair; he said the only solution was cutting it all off. I then saw another pro, who will add highlights to soften the transition and partly camouflage the orange. He explained that standard color correction is indeed impossible after using this product.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for my rapidly graying hair.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the color coverage and how long it lasts if I use the single application color fixation conditioner after the cream application.  Also, it works much better if you have a neutral shampoo to remove residues and oils from your hair before applying the color.  This is so much healthier than the chemical permanent colors! I had a spot where I&#x27;d lost a lot of hair; it has started to grow back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to say that this product didn&#x27;t cover any of my gray hairs.  There is no change in my hair color whatsoever.  I used the whole bottle and left it on for 40 minutes.  (My original hair is brown, but I followed the instructions for white, hoping to cover my \\&quot;gray\\&quot; hairs, which are actually more like silver than white.)    I&#x27;ve tried other hennas before, and they didn&#x27;t affect my gray hairs either.  I thought that maybe I just wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough job with the hard-to-use powdered and solid hennas.  I thought that maybe this easy-to-use cream would produce some results for me.  But I think I&#x27;m about ready to give up on henna; I think that maybe there is just something about my hair that henna refuses to stick to.     On the positive side, the product was easy to apply and rinse off, didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and didn&#x27;t smell too bad.  So it could be a perfect non-toxic product for someone whose hair it would actually stick to.</li>
    <li> The description inside the Surya box says it is \\&quot;guaranteed to cover gray and white hair in the first application,\\&quot; but it does NOT!  I read the directions cover to cover and followed them to the letter, but not even a tint or hint of color took on my gray roots!  This is so disappointing! I had been using Light Mountain Natural Color the Gray Henna for the past five months, but was tired of waiting the three hours for the mud to cure and then following the two step process which takes about an hour and a half, so thought I would try this product, which was premixed and only took 30 minutes to supposedly work. I questioned the shortness of the time, and the fact that the directions said NOT to apply to the roots first, but to just work it in evenly with fingers, but thought I&#x27;d better do as it said, since it was \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; to work.  I am going back to Light Mountain&#x27;s Color the Gray: it may take extra prep time, but IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I have sandy-red hair--now mixed with plenty of light gray at the crown, and around the face.  Over 40 years ago, I started regularly using straight powdered henna (to intensify my red, and to add body and shine).  About 3 years ago, I migrated to Surya dyes--first, out of curiousity (because I try anything *henna*), and then stayed with it, because of its terrific ease of use.    For me, at least, the verdict is now in:  The best thing about this product is how easy and quick it is to apply, and rinse out (compared with alternatives.)  I mix this color with *Dark Reddish Blonde* and obtain a very natural-looking sandy red.  Used by itself, it simply does not cover gray (unless you&#x27;d count a dusty yellow tinge.  *Golden Brown*, um, no.)  Any of the Red/Reddish colors (which do cover gray) will turn you into Ronald McDonald (with fading pinkish tones--ew!) when used alone.  At this point, I have to apply every couple weeks--because, yes, a skunk line appears.  I get some degree of boosted shine and softness--but this IS NOT A HENNA.  Check the ingredients:  Henna extract is down near the bottom of a very long list (way behind jasmine, and even after carrot juice).  I don&#x27;t have enough chemistry to decipher the other additives.  Natural full-strength Henna (e.g., Rainbow-brand henna) is messy and time-consuming.  But also remains, IMHO, the gold standard for safety, color, shine, body, and durability.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. I love the stark quality of the color, the absence of smell and allergens, the easy application, everything! I have found the color lasts as long as chemical colors if I leave it on longer. I recommend sitting back and watching a movie while it sits, or putting it on before bed and taking the plastic cap off in the morning to rinse it out.  Cannot stress enough how great this stuff is for people with allergies/sensitivities. I cannot use chemicals because they cause migraines that last up to 2 weeks. This stuff I am perfectly fine with. Happy coloring!</li>
    <li> My hair felt awesome after the application of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used \\&quot;Golden Brown\\&quot;, and it covered my gray.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll use \\&quot;Golden Blonde\\&quot;, for more \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; color as opposed to \\&quot;reddish\\&quot; golden brown.&lt;br /&gt;Surya Henna Cream left my hair very silky and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on my hair an hour with heat.  I kept the plastic cap that came with the product  because it really retains the heat well.&lt;br /&gt;This product is .... sooooooo good!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> Henna was shipped fast. I cannot tell much difference between the golden blonde and golden brown and use either based on availability.  I use it about every 4-6 weeks. Very easy and not too messy.</li>
    <li> Easy to completely apply over my slightly-greying light brown hair every 3-4 weeks.  Good conditioning quality and natural color covers the grey.  The plastic hair covers suck, but are easy and cheap to purchase in bulk at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I LOVE 100% NATURAL PRODUCTS. THAT ONE IS PERFECT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE TO YOUR HAIR A TOUCH OF SHINE AND COVER SOME GRAYS. I HAVE SOME GRAYS AND THEY WERE TOTALLY COVERED WITH A GOLDEN COLOR, VERY NATURAL.IT IS PERFECT FOR BROWN DARK OR LIGHT NATURAL COLOR HAIR. &lt;br /&gt;INGRID</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. So much better for your hair then other chemical dyes. Have gotten lots of complements on color. Like a lot !!!!</li>
    <li> I started using Surya Henna when I became allergic to regular hair dye.  I do have to color more often--usually every 3 weeks, but I really like the product, and it covers my gray pretty well.  Tip for those with gray hair:  I apply the color, cap, and then use the blow dryer to apply heat about every 15 min.  I leave the color on for one full hour.</li>
    <li> Will only use Henna on my post chemo hair-- safe and gentle without chemicals</li>
    <li> This is best hair coloring kit for a henna product.  Been using for over a year now, and love it.  Not messy and you don&#x27;t have to use the whole product at one time.  Smells good and looks great after.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as normal hair color or even the other colors, but totally worth it for the health benefit of it.  I have had to use almost every 2 weeks or so, and I don&#x27;t wash out, just rinse with cold water 45 min after use.  I usually wait to wash my hair like 2 or 3 days later.  Looks great, very natural.</li>
    <li> This cream henna does a great job of covering grey and giving me that golden brown color I wanted for it. It does not wash out easily, and it does not look in any way like I have added color to my hair. The scent is pleasant and the color did not take long at all. Shipping was quick and efficient.</li>
    <li> Great henna, great color!</li>
    <li> Not as much color as I thought I would get, but pretty good coverage of gray.  Best of all no toxic chemicals or chemical smells.</li>
    <li> Turned my greys a blonde yellow color and did nothing for my dark brown hair.  Exactly as expected.  No smell.  only keep on 1/2 hour.  Easy shower off.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t run.  No cap for me required.  Wash off my hands easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid of hair dyes now since I got breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 150 dollar dye job would look better but at least this is sort of safer... Who knows if it safer...</li>
    <li> This color doesn&#x27;t give grey hair coverage if you have a lot of grey.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have colored my hair myself, had it done, had highlights, gone white a couple of times.  This product does what I want, which is give me an alternative to natural white hair, and not tear it up in the process : )  All of the other coloring methods have peroxide, and my hair became like straw.  I have experimented with about 5 Surya colors.  The one I&#x27;m using consistently is Golden Brown right now.  Everyone&#x27;s hair takes color differently, both in color and the way it stays or doesn&#x27;t stay.  The Chocolate doesn&#x27;t work for me at all because it turns orange as it washes out, and the dark brown ends up with a greenish or purplish highlight (depending on the lights I am in).  I like the shampoo and the leave in conditioner, but . . I don&#x27;t leave the leave-in conditioner in, I wash it out because that works better for me.  I also put the color on various ways, depending on my mood. When it was white, I followed the instructions.  Then, about every second washing, I mix a couple of tablespoons with the shampoo and leave it on while I finish my shower.  I&#x27;ve also mixed it with the conditioner, then washed it out. I&#x27;ve mixed shampoo and color, then added conditioner, then rinsed it all out. Can you tell I&#x27;m one of those cooks who always messes with recipes; on my report card they used to check the \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t follow directions\\&quot; box. I&#x27;ve mixed colors, sometimes three if I had leftovers in a bottle.  It&#x27;s sure better than any peroxide product, I&#x27;ll never go back to those; my hair is so much softer using Surya.  I&#x27;m thinking of doing what one person said, and leave it on while watching a movie to get more color.  I like mixing it with the shampoo or conditioner so I get a boost of color and shine without a glaring \\&quot;I just colored my hair\\&quot; change.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments, and I like this product, it is the best for me that I have found in 20 yrs of coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this. I have been considering using henna powder but this seemed less complicated so I tried it. purchased 2 bottles. Have natural 4b hair. first experience, did not wash hair first, applied w dye brush from root to tip.. put on plastic cap and left for 1 hour. when I rinsed it the hair felt smooth, cuticles lying down, but then I washed with a clarifying shampooo and it intstantly made my hair very dry and coarse. had to use a conditioner w a lot of slip to smooth cuticle back down. minimal coloring but it was ok.  Second time, thrillledddd w the result. Sectioned, detangled, braided in large sections and washed, towel dried and applied section by section w dye brush, put on 2 plastic caps and a knit hat early in the day and left it in for 6-8 hours  (just went about my day), rinsed and washed with Just As I Am Coconut Co-wash... hair silk dark and SHINY!!! wow... used a light leave in and did a BnC (Braid Out and Curl) very shiny pretty. At night, generously applied whipped Shea Butter and Monoi Split End repairer and \\&quot;pineappled\\&quot;. Hair fluffy, curly dark and shiny. love it!</li>
    <li> I found this henna very easy to use, no preparation needed, easy to apply onto wet hair and it did not drip too much. It was also easy to rinse it off. The package has gloves and a hair cap, not the best, but served the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The results were fine at the beginning, it covered my greys with natural brown, not reddish as other hennas. After two weeks the color suddenly disappeared, and the greys were almost completely back. They still have some brownish tint and I can probably pretend they are highlights, but this henna fades faster than I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a natural brown appearance to the hair, but may need more frequent use to keep the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product, I ordered the golden brown shade thinking that at least I would have some highlights or something but instead I got this awful shade of brown with no highlights, no anything, I can&#x27;t even call it mousy brown because even that color would have been an improvement over what I got. I know there are a lot of things that factor into it, like medications or your the way your body reacts to certain things, but this DID NOT even come close to the shade shown.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair coloring product for quite awhile. I love how it makes my hair feel and look. There is no strange scent like other henna products, in fact it smells delightful. Using the fixation cream helps it not wash out as quickly. I do have to use a dark towel for several weeks on my hair after I wash it, because the color does gradually wash out. I leave it in for about an hour, but have left it in much longer if I&#x27;ve gotten busy with something else. I have even rubbed a little into my grays at my roots and let it dry on my hair. I do have to comment that this seller was over a week late delivering it, though, and when I finally got it, they had sent the wrong color, even though the packing slip said the correct color.</li>
    <li> The Golden Brown was the perfect color for my hair.  I had lots of highlights and several shades naturally (originally blonde as a youth). I did not want my hair to look mono color and fake, But the golden brown was wonderful, so natural and the shampoos and conditioners are great. I have very dry, wavey, fluffy hair. I could not use anything harsh. I left it on for the recommended time (1 hr) but it did not really cover all the grey/white. I was satisfied with this since it did cover the most obvious areas. I may just need to leave it on longer. I would definitely recommend this since I am more concerned with health and not using things that are harmful to me. I do not need to wash my hair often because of its dryness. So this works well. This is a great option.</li>
    <li> I used this after Ash Blonde to fix the texture and tone down the red from stripped brunette hair even more.  It worked perfectly.  I would do this again because it&#x27;s so easy and natural.  You cannot ruin your hair by using this!  My advice: If you want to go lighter a shade or two, use your chosen lightener (except sun in which doesn&#x27;t mix with other stuff): use peroxide and conditioner or lemon and honey in the sun, then use Surya to correct to the shade and color you want.  It&#x27;s fun. :)</li>
    <li> I use this dye all the time. I use it only on my temple (gray hair). It lasts about two weeks before I have to reapply.</li>
    <li> Covers pretty well. Like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain the typical chemicals of other hair colors. Easy to use, although you need to set aside an hour for color to process. Can use for root touch up.</li>
    <li> love this product! my hair gets stronger and healthier if I use this hair product..</li>
    <li> I have been using my &amp;#34;personal blend&amp;#34; of this and Surya light brown for about 12 years. My hair always looks natural and shiny, no roots, no chemical damage. It does wear off fast, but that means the worst that can happen is grey streaks coming through (which looks cool: I&#x27;m well over 50 so it makes it look even more natural). I use it every 3 weeks, but since it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, and I do it at home while I am doing laundry or whatever, that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> I got tired of doing the traditional mud henna applications and decided to try this one out. Glad I did. Very easy application. Left my hair shiny and feeling soft as regular henna does without the heavy henna smell. Covered my gray. Does, like other reviews say, wash out faster - more of an issue for those of us with grayed hair - but will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Color is not the same as it used to be. I have been using it for 5 years and this time it didn&#x27;t cover any of my grays. Also, the cream itself is not dark brown as it used to be. It is more of a orange tone. I am extremely disappointed. Will not buy it again.</li>
