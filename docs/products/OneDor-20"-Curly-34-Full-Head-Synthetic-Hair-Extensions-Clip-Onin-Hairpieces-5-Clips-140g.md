<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love my new extensions.  It looks real.....I&#x27;ve been wearing it all the time and people think it&#x27;s my real hair.  I&#x27;ve actually curled it more and it looks great.  I love this company, always in keeping in touch with me.  I&#x27;m thinking of flat iron it for another look.  So far no major problems.  The only thing I hate is at times it gets a little tangled, so I just brush it out like normal hair would.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my hair extensions! I received so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Good quality, good price I definitely recommend this hair extensions!!!</li>
    <li> Over the past few months I&#x27;ve tried several pairs of extensions and they all turnt out to be horrible. They were either too thin, looked trashy, the color was way off, or the texture was all wrong. These were 💯 amazing and blended perfectly! I bought 2 just because my hair is so thick but I would say they are well worth the money. Not to mention that the earliest they were expected was Monday and I got them Friday!!💘</li>
    <li> The product is amazing! Very soft and long hair. I have never bought extension hair before and this is a good investment. The hair looks as if you spent $150. It is worth buying it for an event.</li>
    <li> Tangles WAY too easily.  Got very frizzy after just trying it on, so it really is only good for one or 2 uses.  I had a hard time clipping it to my hair, which is quite curly and should have not been difficult.  Maybe I just need more practice.  But the more I messed with this, and tried to style it, the more tangled it became.  It worked for a Halloween character I had created, along with several other hair pieces.  It was O.K. that it frizzed a bit, as per the character.  But there&#x27;s no way this can work and pass off as real hair every day.  Also, my natural curls are slightly tighter than this loose curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am looking at it now thinking...how can I salvage what is left and re-use this again?  I followed the washing instructions, but it did not help.  Some of the curls are still intact, but mostly it&#x27;s a mess of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the 1B is very, very black. A little too black for my black hair.  I&#x27;d need something with a bit of brown in it, I think.  Oh well, for 9.99, it&#x27;s worth 2 stars instead of 1.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth more than I paid for it. Im not a pro with extensions and probably don&#x27;t have high expectations but I bought these for my halloween costume, Jasmine from Aladdin. I just needed a quick extent ion for one night and these were perfect, takes one minute to put on, the snaps stay in place. Blended with my hair well and the loose curls were beautiful.</li>
    <li> It Was a gift and my friend loved it! Seller are very good they have great costumer service. I will defenatly will buy some mor from them. Item is great and price super GREAT!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Looks very fake and is very heavy pulled my hair when I wore it, Do Not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the hair! It&#x27;s so long and soft curls! And it&#x27;s not too heavy! Delivery was Fast!</li>
    <li> I loved this beautiful, is long and very practical with hooks that brings to hold, very easy to apply and remove</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, it is a lot of hair and very good quality with a human hair feel. The only flaw is that the clips don&#x27;t go from end to end of the head.</li>
    <li> It matches my hair perfectly it is also able to be curled and straightened. Makes me feel like a princess lol.</li>
    <li> So easy to put on....made my hair look thicker and fuller and the color matched mine exactly!</li>
    <li> i always like trying new extensions since my hair dosnt grow fast and love this piece it&#x27;s very good quality I will be buying from them again very satisfied👍🎀💗</li>
    <li> Fake as he&#x27;ll. Don&#x27;t get suckered into buying</li>
    <li> Beautiful.. I love them</li>
    <li> I have jet black straight hair. I had to apply hot curing iron to make sure my extension looks blend in. It arrived in about two days.  Very pretty not heavy at all.  I looks as natural as I could possibly can as a fake hair. I am happy with the purchase.  Clips stay and locked.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Easy to clip in hair.</li>
    <li> very happy with this I will bay it again..</li>
    <li> Amazing. For the price i did not think the hair would be this  nice! SILKY AND THE CURLS ARE GORGGGGGGG.</li>
    <li> This item was great the first day I had it on but it tangles to much. I would get something with better materials</li>
    <li> Very pretty and that&#x27;s one pack!</li>
    <li> Not what I anticipated it&#x27;s okay for a ponytail</li>
    <li> I was a lil skeptical about purchasing this. I must say I am highly pleased with the texture of the hair, the length, and the thickness. It was easy to use, stayed in, and blended well with my own hair. I would highly recommend of you would like to give your hair style a lil pop for a few hours.</li>
    <li> Shipping fast!!!! They look great!!!!</li>
    <li> I love them! The quality is awesome and they&#x27;re super long and curly. I would recommend buying 2 for a more full look. I just ordered my 2 more pairs !</li>
    <li> too long looks so fake</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even curl and it gets tangled too much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very long and soft but it tangles so easily</li>
    <li> Too thin doesnt look right if u have layered hair. Way too much shedding</li>
    <li> Taking the advice of other users I bought 3 pieces and it was 2 too many. I found it more natural to have just 1 piece. I feel so pretty wearing it. I recommend this to anyone who wants a more natural look. The extra pieces a friend bought off me and they love wearing it around.</li>
    <li> Love these. I got mine for length and they are beautiful. Only issue is they do get frizzy very quickly</li>
    <li> This clip in hair extension looks and feels like human hair. The hair is not overly shiny, which adds to making it look very natural. It is undetectable and comfortable to wear.  It has very secure clips to keep in in place nicely. The color was an excellent match for me. I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I will be purchasing more items from this seller.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t straightened it nor curl it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one thing to be fake but the tangling while applying and it was crazy. The tangling was untameable. It was heavy and weighed my head down. While wearing it it looked completely fake. Granted I know it&#x27;s synthetic but at least last one application</li>
    <li> Tangled Very Fast , But did arrive on time . Price , arrival date , cost , everything else seemed fine but the product.</li>
    <li> I have short hair like short a little above me shoulders. I turned my hair black. I ordered three Onesor curly 3/4. They got here I put them in. They clipped in very well. But I put three in and oh my they are so heavy!!! They are thick REALLY LONG lol Stupid Long I will have to cut them down. But three hours with them in my neck hurt and I just wanted to take them out!!! But I they are the real deal! I would keep buying them. I will post photos tomorrow! Just wait till you see them!</li>
    <li> The piece itself is fine, but good lord it doesn&#x27;t blend in with my hair in the slightest and no amount of styling seems to change that. It wasn&#x27;t a matter of color, the color matched my natural hair perfectly, it&#x27;s the texture and length. I just don&#x27;t have enough hair yet for it to blend in, length and volume wise. So I think I might use it in a wig. Can&#x27;t beat the price though, and it arrived days earlier than I expected, so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also tangles easily, which is to be expected with synthetic.</li>
    <li> This hair was surprisingly really nice and full. It&#x27;s very realistic and blends in beautifully with my own hair.  For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect such nice full hair.</li>
    <li> Tangles and frizzes Fairley easily.</li>
    <li> Great product was delivered fast!! Ordered my teenager one in red brown.</li>
    <li> The color didn&#x27;t match the picture and you can really tell the hair is fake</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. Very very happy would recommend it. My husband loved it looks really real. Funny comment but my youngest daughter that&#x27;s 10 yrs old got freaked out when I took it off all the time I had it on she was thinking it was my hair :). So yeah it looks really real :)</li>
    <li> hair is amazing looking and its perfect height</li>
    <li> Received in 3 days, these extensions look better than ones made of real hair, they look and feel amazing and I wasn&#x27;t expecting something this good for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price just bought another one.</li>
    <li> a gift to my daughter, she will use it with costumes.  I have not seen this and she seems to like it for costume wear.</li>
    <li> it was very very small piece of hair need 3 or 4 to do a head</li>
    <li> Beautiful but get a little noghty</li>
    <li> It is amazing and it looks like real hair</li>
    <li> I have been buying from several sellers on Amazon trying to find JET BLACK hair extensions just like these. But everyone only has natural black (which looks dark brown) which doesn&#x27;t match my hair. I love synthetic extensions like these. I have a pixie cut so I have to wear two of them, but they have so much volume. They blend nicely, I&#x27;ve used heat on them, they style well, they don&#x27;t tangle too much for me unless I&#x27;m wearing a scarf or hood. But I&#x27;m so thrilled I finally found them in jet black! Repurchasing for sure! Amazing for the price! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I like this product and am going to buy again. I also like that is this hair does not irritate my skin at all. For it too be so cheap it does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair, but ordered dark brown because I typically dye my hair back dark again before summer. The color matches the color I use when I dye my hair perfectly. They&#x27;re super soft and bouncy, but are way more curly than I can ever get my natural hair so I straightened them on 310 and they held up just fine. They did tangle a little bit in the process, but with a little patience, was nothing that couldn&#x27;t be combed out. They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; or have a plastic odor OR feel. If I didn&#x27;t know they were synthetic, I would think they&#x27;re real. I have a friend with a Remy set and these are actually quite a bit better than hers. Awesome for the price. Will buy again!</li>
