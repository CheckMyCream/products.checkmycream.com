      <li>I love the color coding.</li>
      <li>Could not imagine a better product for the task.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I was able to use just about all of it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>My sister bought these a couple years ago and loved them too so thought it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Excited to have travel bottles to but my shampoo in that don&#x27;t leak!  </li>
      <li>Great set of 3 oz bottles in which I put shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash - then I was able to carry on and had no trouble doing so.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re nice, pretty, and convenient to store liquids in!</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that the bottles naturally fit in your hand and that they aren&#x27;t smooth(which</li>
      <li>Easy to fill.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to refill and squeeze out the contents.</li>
      <li>Easy to fill and to write on.</li>
      <li>and this makes it easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to squeeze product out.</li>
      <li>i followed the recommendations and didn&#x27;t fill the containers completely full, more around the 80% full level and then squeezed out most of the remaining air.  </li>
      <li>You really are able to get everything out and getting product in is a very easy to do.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t fly out till next week but did try them out!</li>
      <li>The bottles have helped me travel light and still given me all of the comforts of home including shampoo, body wash, and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.  </li>
      <li>So I filled the bottles up and tried my hardest to apply pressure with the grip from my hand.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are easy to fill and to clean.  </li>
      <li>Finally found a great travel product that won&#x27;t spill my lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
      <li>: I was given these for free for review purposes however,</li>
      <li>They are soft and made of good quality material.</li>
      <li>I also love that a clear zip top pouch is included with the bottles.</li>
      <li>I am very health conscious, so I love, love, love the fact that they are BPA free</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, I love these things!</li>
      <li>A really helpful and very unique feature is the suction cup on each bottle for hands free usage.</li>
      <li>I have not traveled with them, so I am only trusting that they will remain leak proof on the airplane, but I have tested them here at home by filling them with water and vigorously shaking and have one water filled bottle, suctioned to my kitchen wall where it has remained for over two hours and is still going strong - however, while I feel that the suction is a nice feature</li>
      <li>They are top quality all the way and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat them.  </li>
      <li>Good product overall.</li>
      <li>Squeezable, good size, big opening for filling.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find any bottle that will hold really runny liquids without leakage, even using the method of putting plastic wrap around the top before tightening lid.  </li>
      <li>They are top quality all the way and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat them.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After much research for a secure product I give it a-zero the bag ripped right when I opened it not worth the money..I needed to u we it th I s . Past week for international travel.</li>
    <li> Full Disclosure: I was given these for free for review purposes however, that did not sway me in any way.  The bottles are made with amazing quality.  They have a silicone body which is soft and easily squeezable.  Not only that but it is thick enough that it won&#x27;t tear and could defiantly handle some abuse from travel.  When you screw the lid off, you have a really wide opening for easily filling the bottles with your own shampoo, conditioner, face cream or whatever you like.  I travel for a living.  Often times I am gone for only a week or two and I do not need an entire bottle of shampoo but the travel bottles you buy at Walmart or Target are always hard plastic and cheap and have never held up so I constantly travel with large bottles.  They ALWAYS leak and or crack.  The bottles by Dot&amp;Dot are so much better. Once you have filled up the tube with your product and you replace the lid, you have a little plastic snap shut lid (that also screws on and off).  You just squeeze out your product and if you are in the shower, it is easy to just stick the bottle to the wall for a second until you have your two hands free. They say not to use the suction for permanent storage on the shower wall, but even in a bath tub it is nice to have the suction cup to keep it in place for a bit.  I work on a cruise ship and if it gets rocky things fall into the bath or off the shelf. I can use this little suction cup to keep things from falling over on the ship so I really like it.  Also the little labels they have already pre-printed around the lid are easy to spin around and lock in place, but because they are also white, like the lid, can be hard to see if you have close up vision problems.  I just used a sharpie to write in the blank space on mine so I know which product is which.  They are leak proof and drip proof, and the best part - BPA FREE! You can put them in the top rack of the dishwasher too!  AMAZING! These are also 3 oz sized bottles so TSA approved. I don&#x27;t think they spared any expense when creating these tubes.  They are top quality all the way and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat them.  These also make a great gift idea for someone who travels because TRUST me when I say this, I never even knew they made travel tubes like this and I travel professionally.  Thank goodness I found these! Buy them and you won&#x27;t regret it.spared any expense when creating these tubes.

Thank goodness I found these! Buy them and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the travel bottles. The flexible silicon made them easier to fit into an already full suitcase than traditional hard plastic travel bottles. The suction cup is an added bonus. I was able to conveniently attach the bottle with shampoo to the shower wall. They are well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> These travel bottles are the bomb!  So glad we found these before our trip to Hawaii.  You really are able to get everything out and getting product in is a very easy to do.</li>
    <li> My husband has started traveling every week for work so I am on the lookout for good travel organizers and tools. These bottles fit that bill perfectly. He has had leakages with other containers. These are great!  They are easy to fill and close tightly. They are soft to the touch unlike other hard plastic containers. They have an area where you can label the contents but the different colors are a clue if you don&#x27;t want to write on them.  It&#x27;s nice that they come in different sizes because while traveling one doesn&#x27;t necessarily use the same amount of each product. We&#x27;re very pleased with our Dot &amp; Dot organizers.</li>
    <li> I think these have to be the most well thought out travel bottles I have ever come across! Not only are the colors vibrant and the design beautifully executed but they feature mini suction cups to stick them to the shower wall temporarily.  They also have the caps that prevent these from leaking. They&#x27;re very high quality and I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these bottles. *Sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> There are several outstanding things that I appreciate about these bottles.&lt;br /&gt;1) I am very health conscious, so I love, love, love the fact that they are BPA free - that was a major selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have not traveled with them, so I am only trusting that they will remain leak proof on the airplane, but I have tested them here at home by filling them with water and vigorously shaking and have one water filled bottle, suctioned to my kitchen wall where it has remained for over two hours and is still going strong - however, while I feel that the suction is a nice feature, I don&#x27;t really so myself using it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;3) I love the color coding. I will not attempt to use a label to identify the contents, but will rely on the colors to determine the contents of each bottle.&lt;br /&gt;4) They have a wide mouth and are very easy to fill and to wash.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, they are just so cute. I am going to order some more in a different size.</li>
    <li> Just got them in the mail, seem just like what is described here.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Bought these for an upcoming trip, used them as a trial run. They stick well on the shower wall &amp; u can conveniently press them as they hang to get your product out.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think they are meant to hang for long periods of time as I would find them on the shower floor if I left them clinging to the wall over night. So just take them out when you&#x27;re finished showering.&lt;br /&gt;Really love that I could get all the product out &amp; not waste any. My shampoo, conditioner &amp; body wash all slid to the big mouth opening &amp; I was able to use just about all of it.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this - would recommend!</li>
    <li> I like the size and the feel of these containers. The varied colors are helpful in determining which has what. The openings are wide enough to easily fill. I have not experienced leakage but I have not air traveled with them yet. All in all, I&#x27;d say a good buy.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried numerous travel containers that are supposedly &amp;#34;leak-proof&amp;#34;.  i&#x27;ve even tried nalgene containers from the container store.  however, ALL of the previous products LEAKED HORRIBLY during travel specifically when traveling via air.  most containers didn&#x27;t leak viscous liquids like lotions or gels but when it came to thin liquids like mouthwash, they always leaked horribly.  i even tried using plastic wrap underneath the screw tops but that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i was skeptical at best when trying these new containers but i was completely surprised and very pleased to find that these container absolutely DO NOT LEAK AT ALL!  not only do they not leak any fluid, they don&#x27;t even seem to leak any air!  i followed the recommendations and didn&#x27;t fill the containers completely full, more around the 80% full level and then squeezed out most of the remaining air.  when i arrived, after a 12 hour flight with these containers in my checked luggage, i was shocked to see them EXACTLY AS I HAD THEM prior to taking off!  they were absolutely a dream and worked perfectly.  i cannot recommend these enough!!  buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> These travel bottles are the perfect solution for those of us who use carry-on luggage.  At 3 oz. they won&#x27;t get confiscated at the security check-points in airports.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the carry-on benefits these are perfectly made for travel. I don’t like using hotel shampoo and conditioners as they are never as good on my hair as my own and heaven forbid I would ever use a hotel’s lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The wide-mouthed bottles are very easy to fill without spilling and dripping.  Made of high-quality silicone, they take a beating but don&#x27;t leak.  I was worried about them leaking since when you un-cap the lid and give it a squeeze the liquid comes out in a small but good stream. Give it a little more of a squeeze and it comes out in a solid stream. I was afraid that with the jostling that even a carry-on suitcase can take that with a little pressure from a fall, a bellman or a baggage handler, liquid might explode out the cap into my bag or suitcase.  So I filled the bottles up and tried my hardest to apply pressure with the grip from my hand.  Try as I might, they don&#x27;t leak a drop and the cap stayed in place.  Pretty impressive!&lt;br /&gt;Because of the wide mouth for filling they are also easy to clean out.  This is especially important with gooey liquids like lotions and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the little suction cup on the side.  I attached the bottles by the suction cup on the mirror in the hotel bathroom as well as the shower and pointed the bottles down for easy use.  Even when opening the cap, shampoo and conditioner don’t leak until you apply pressure.  I wondered if it would even hold water that way, to my surprise no leaks even from water.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I love these things! I will be going on an extended vacation in a couple of months and will report back then.</li>
    <li> just the right size for taking to the gym with the things I need like shampoo and conditioner and my body wash if I feel like it.  They are kind of sticky so won&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  Really glad I got them.</li>
    <li> My wife says the best travel bottles she&#x27;s ever used</li>
    <li> I love how well constructed these bottles are and that different colors come in the same pack. I also love that a clear zip top pouch is included with the bottles. I also love the fact that the bottles naturally fit in your hand and that they aren&#x27;t smooth(which helps keep them from slipping out of your hand when they get wet.&lt;br /&gt;Well done Dot &amp; Dot!</li>
    <li> The bottles are perfect and actually hold alot of product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Such awesome little colorful travel bottles.  Very durable and I love the suction on the back to put up in hotel bathrooms or anywhere you travel to!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. Item looks well made. I tested them out for any sign of leakage by filling them with tap water and turning them upside down and squeezing. So far no leakage. Will see how they hold up under travel conditions.</li>
    <li> Love these bottles!  They&#x27;re squishy so you can get all of it&#x27;s contents out.  When you can only bring 3 oz, you really want 3 oz!</li>
    <li> These travel bottles worked well. I used them for my shampoo and my soap for a 13 night cruise. So happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Did not leak!</li>
    <li> The caps don&#x27;t stay on. Won&#x27;t use them again.</li>
    <li> The bottles have a one way valve so they don&#x27;t spill. Also all quality material</li>
    <li> A lot better quality than I expected. Super soft material too.</li>
    <li> Really love these as your able to get the last bit of what you have put inside unlike hard ones. I do recommend for the frequent traveler that does not like to check baggage.</li>
    <li> These came just in time for a long trip overseas; I needed to upgrade from old 2-oz bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that they&#x27;re colored. Any attempt with a marker will eventually wear off and I can&#x27;t otherwise distinguish my shampoo from conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there&#x27;s four in the package and I only need three, I figured I&#x27;d test out the claim that they&#x27;re leak proof. The actual container is one piece of soft silicone with a kind of lip that seals with the attached lid. I filled it with water, tightened it and squeezed like crazy. No, really, I squeezed the bejesus out of it. No leaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cup works on porcelain and my mirror, just as I expect the other brands would, but I&#x27;m really puzzled why all of these manufacturers would bother. The lid is wide enough to stand up just fine. Who needs a suction cup? Skip it if you can make a cheaper version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these bottles a lot, seems like it&#x27;ll be easy to squeeze out the last drops. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re nice, pretty, and convenient to store liquids in!</li>
    <li> Great quality and comes in a nice sturdy plastic bag.  Bottles are exactly what I was seeking and will meet TSA requirements.  Very squeezable but not mushy - and super sturdy.  Surely these will last quite awhile and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> These are the best travel bottles. Easy to fill and to write on. Love that you can get four different colors in a set to help keep your items organized!</li>
    <li> Love these bottles!  It&#x27;s so much easier to get shampoo,  conditioner, body wash, etc. out of them than from the flimsy little bottles you buy at the drugstore.  Order arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> The  set of (4) 3oz travel bottles I received were packaged appropriately and arrived fast.  They are very colorful and appear to be very sturdy, while also pliable enough to be able to squeeze out the last bit of product, which is something I have had trouble with in the past with other travel bottles.  Would I trust them for thin (especially oils) watery type liquids?  Probably not.  I have yet to find any bottle that will hold really runny liquids without leakage, even using the method of putting plastic wrap around the top before tightening lid.  But for shampoo, lotions, ect., this will work quite nicely.  I also thought the nice see-through bag that the bottles came in and suction cups on the side, are a very nice touch!  I am ready to put them to the test while on vacationing in the next few weeks, and if they don&#x27;t live up to my expectations, I will update.  If they perform like I believe they will, I will be back to purchase more!</li>
    <li> Could not wait until travel time ... am using several of these travel bottles in shower now, for shampoo ... also have some ideas for other areas of the house -- no, wait, they&#x27;re for travel!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leak, work well.  Overall great product.  Minor note: suction cup will hold for minutes to hours on shower wall then fall - often in middle of night, THUMP</li>
    <li> The bottles are sturdy, have wide mouths for easy filling and I like the different colors to help me keep my products straight.  The bag they come in is lightweight, so it may not last long, but I bought the product for the bottles, not the bag.  You get four bottles for a good price.</li>
    <li> I really like the bottles. Just traveled to Alaska with them. Just wish you could label them and have it stay.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that each tube is a different color and that the bottles come in different sizes</li>
    <li> Great product but the suction doesn&#x27;t hold. I wouldn&#x27;t use the suction feature much anyways. Good product overall.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Flexible silicone bottles are so much more useful than stiff plastic ones available elsewhere</li>
    <li> Recently bought the set of 3oz bottles. Will be using it for my upcoming backpacking and extended travel this year. The quality seems really good and filling these bottles was really easy. Will update more after use.</li>
    <li> These are awesome travel bottles and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that they are cute and colorful. Their wide mouths makes filling them a breeze and I love the feel of the soft, quality silicone. The best part is that they are leak proof. These are definitely the best travel bottles I have come across and I am planning to buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this set of Travel Bottles while traveling through Europe. The design of the products is outstanding, very easy to use and dependable. My travel through several international airports and securities has been seamless as the bottles are the perfect size. The bottles have helped me travel light and still given me all of the comforts of home including shampoo, body wash, and conditioner. The suction cups work very well and are extremely helpful while staying in hotels and hostels. Even while hiking through rugged terrain I have had no problems with leaks which could have been disastrous. The materials are high quality and the colors and built in labels have been very helpful in keeping me organized. I highly recommend these travel bottles for all kinds of travelers. Dot&amp;Dot has proved another quality product for my travels and I am thankful.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles! The suction cup is built into the bottle itself. I love this feature because there is never enough space to put your toiletries in hotel showers! This is also beneficial for campers who have to share a shower. They don&#x27;t leak and are easy to open and use. I also love the fact that they are TSA approved!</li>
    <li> While I have not used these bottles for traveling yet, I am looking forward to doing so! They are soft and made of good quality material. The lids remain tight, and even have a band around them that allows you to label them as &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; etc., which is very useful. Also, the colors are lovely! I am very glad to own these bottles :)</li>
    <li> I love the high quality of these bottles. Easy to refill and squeeze out the contents. Perfect size for travel. Love the suction cups for the shower wall!</li>
    <li> Excited to have travel bottles to but my shampoo in that don&#x27;t leak!  Don&#x27;t fly out till next week but did try them out!</li>
    <li> These bottles are fantastic! Just the right size, easy to fill, and a much nicer material than the bottles you can get from CVS etc. Easy to squeeze product out. You can also attach them to a shower wall which is nice, and the different colors mean I&#x27;m never confused about which bottle holds what. They were a little more expensive than some others I looked at, but definitely worth the few extra bucks for a product I&#x27;ll use regularly for many trips to come!</li>
    <li> Really great products! : )</li>
    <li> Finally found a great travel product that won&#x27;t spill my lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill. Easy to use. Soft and flexible but sturdy.</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful for all the travel I&#x27;ve started doing with my new job. They are big enough to hold lotion, face oil, shower gel, or anything else you need while traveling. I like to use my own products on the road and this makes it easy. Everything arrived on time and just as described. I might even order a second set for friends who travel as frequently as I do.</li>
    <li> These are a great size, nice colors, stayed sealed and worked well.  My friend used one for her face toner with salicytic (spelling?) acid, and as a result it melted the plastic a bit....so be careful not to put products like that in them...I would have thought it was a given but a lot of face products do have it in them, so just double check.</li>
    <li> Squeezable, good size, big opening for filling. Yay!</li>
    <li> Tends to leak at the base..</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality and feel of the bottles. They should last for a very long time. The inner seal that prevents leakage is well designed and should work well. I have not used these to travel yet but I cannot foresee any problems. Could not imagine a better product for the task.  Update: I took the bottles to the UK and Malta and they held up very well.  Completely leak proof even in the luggage hold on the plane.  Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I travel constantly, and am always on the lookout for a way to transport liquids in my carry on –especially items in original containers made of glass, or those too large to carry through the TSA checkpoint. The Dot&amp;Dot bottles offer a great solution, providing “just big enough” capacity to meet TSA rules, in a unique and had-comfortable configuration. My pack came with 4 color codes soft silicon bottles made for easy squeezing. A really helpful and very unique feature is the suction cup on each bottle for hands free usage. This is especially useful in small hotel bathrooms with little counter space available. The four bottles come with  writable windows to identify contents, and a leak proof, drip free valve- wide opening for easy refills. I was happy to learn the items are FDA approved and BPA free. Although I have just traveled once with the bottles, they appear to be well constructed and I expect they will be usable for some time to come.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for these travel bottles as they were pricey. I love them and am ready to fly with no worries. Thoughtful features and very functional. My sister bought these a couple years ago and loved them too so thought it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of these containers and the ability to attach the bottles to the shower or mirror.  Hanging upside down they do not leak.  The bottles are easy to fill and to clean.  I purchased the 3 ounce bottles and just ordered several more in the 1.25 ounce for myself and as gifts.</li>
    <li> Great set of 3 oz bottles in which I put shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash - then I was able to carry on and had no trouble doing so.  They worked great and did not leak.  I am tempted to get some smaller ones from the same company...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Arrived promptly!</li>
    <li> Received these in two days with my prime shipping.  I have not used them yet but will be filling them up soon for my toiletry bag.  My old containers are starting to leak so I am hoping that these will fix that problem.  They seem to be great and I really like the feel of them.  Soft and pliable.  I also like that it came in a nice ziploc clear bag that will be useful for other items, or the size will work in a carry on for TSA approved items.</li>
