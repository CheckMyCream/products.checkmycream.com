      <li>Outstanding product.</li>
      <li>but I think it is causing more hair loss.  </li>
      <li>but I believe this is causing me to lose more hair.  </li>
      <li>Overall, great product for the cost!</li>
      <li>The fill in powder is pretty good....</li>
      <li>Really love this product, can be applied anytime, easy to come off when shampooing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I am able to work with it more precisely.  </li>
      <li>Since you really have to scrub to wash it out, I&#x27;m sure it will be good for swimming, though I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  </li>
      <li>Other than getting on your fingers when you scratch your head, it hides any thinning areas perfectly.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>then i do.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to use and stays on throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;the price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, covers the area, and stays put until you wash it out.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and does not rub off when I sleep.  </li>
      <li>, it was easy to use and it stayed on as promised.</li>
      <li>it was fine..</li>
      <li>I too use Joan Rivers &amp;#34;GREAT HAIR DAY&amp;#34; and it works great, but I was hoping this would cover the same, but as one reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t adhere to the scalp.</li>
      <li>It covers great and now she has her confidence back.</li>
      <li>almost 2 months I have enjoyed looking 10 years younger and not one person has noticed, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I originally bought this in brown at a CVS store but it was too light.  </li>
      <li>just make sure you get your exact hair color .</li>
      <li>Anything more elaborate than that have a professional do it.</li>
      <li>For my front hairline which just needs a bit more full thicker hair, I find this Fill in Powder to look more natural</li>
      <li>Overall a good product though.</li>
      <li>You brush it on where you want to cover the balding spots, and it blends in with your hair to give a full appearance.</li>
      <li>it really covers up making it look like i have more hair</li>
      <li>Not bad as fill in powders go.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this on Amazon (because the deal was phenomenal!), but the product itself was really no</li>
      <li>Product shipped quick and had it within 4 days or ordering.</li>
      <li>it works fast, easy</li>
      <li>Thanks so much:)</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>TOTALLY worth it.</li>
      <li>This does a good job if you have a little thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Bought some for all my sisters as gifts, I&#x27;m sure they will feel the same way.</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll keep shoppin&#x27; around ;)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still worth it because as I said, the campaglauge of the powder really covers bald spotting and thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I could use this on the back of my head also, but Xfusion is faster and better for that.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>This product works very well in covering the balding area on my crown!</li>
      <li>The black works good in covering what I need covered, but found out the dark brown blends better with my hair/scalp.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and it does  not stain the pillow  like the other product I use  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I think can be improved is the application brush, the bristles fall out easily with every application.</li>
      <li>also does not wash off with sweat only, but comes off easily with shampoo</li>
      <li>This won&#x27;t cover large areas I don&#x27;t think</li>
      <li>The short, full set of bristles helps to put the color right where it needs to be.</li>
      <li>It does the job very well....</li>
      <li>This did the trick and is very affordable.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve thought &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; would be a no-brainer, but it was a very dusty/blue-grayish color.</li>
      <li>bristles were very flimsy and didn&#x27;t blend the product AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a absolute life saver.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This does a good job if you have a little thinning hair. I use a cotton ball to apply it. After you dab the cotton ball onto the powder, tap it off so you don&#x27;t have loose powder flying around and then rub it onto the scalp. This won&#x27;t cover large areas I don&#x27;t think but but for little areas where the scalp peeks through this product makes quite a difference. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> on black hair the powder appears to be dark grayish looking -  powder needs to be blacker -</li>
    <li> The color is gray, not black.  The brush hair falls off instantly.  I can pull out many brush hair with my fingers.</li>
    <li> Arrived all crumbled up</li>
    <li> DOES NICELY TO COVER THIN SPOTS.  I JUST LOVE HOW IT BLENDS IN.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thinning hair; I use this for the handful of long, stubborn grays that reliably show up 2 weeks after I color my waist length brown-black hair. It sort of works. But for me anyway, it takes a lot of powder to darken the gray hairs which in turn always makes my hair feel a little dirty, and, as previously stated by almost everyone, the brush that comes with it is pretty much useless, shedding bristles into your hair with reckless abandon. I got another brush but it doesn&#x27;t seem to apply the powder all that well so maybe I need to try another different brush. Or maybe I should give up on the powder. Again, in a pinch it does cover the grays. But it takes a lot of powder and the excess powder makes my hair feel a little less than clean. But I guess as long as it doesn&#x27;t LOOK dirty, maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I should just bite the bullet and start coloring my hair twice a month.</li>
    <li> I really love the idea of this fill-in powder, but I don&#x27;t feel like the the black color is black enough.  My hair is jet black, with sprouting gray roots (on top and around the edges) along with thin patches of long hair in the front of my head.  The powder almost looks like a very dark gray color instead.  I love the application brush, though!  The short, full set of bristles helps to put the color right where it needs to be.</li>
    <li> This product causes the scalp to itch.</li>
    <li> The fill in powder is pretty good....I have tried others and this is about as good as the Joan Rivers kind, but if you rub or itch your scalp when you sweat, it will come off on your finger, but just sweating alone it will not run...The Joan rivers kind does not come off on my finger......After trying this in the dark brown I bought it again but in the black...my hair is very dark brown but the dark brown didn&#x27;t cover as well as the black on me...This goes on well with the brush but I&#x27;ve talked to others who use a cotton ball......I&#x27;d rate this a 4 out of 5.....It does the job very well....I have never swam in this, so can&#x27;t comment on that......I will buy this again and again.....I noticed when I bought a darker shade I use much less, also......This lasts very well....</li>
    <li> I too use Joan Rivers &amp;#34;GREAT HAIR DAY&amp;#34; and it works great, but I was hoping this would cover the same, but as one reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t adhere to the scalp. And dark brown is not dark enough. Sorry, I had to return.</li>
    <li> I used color stick and mascara type touch up and both provide better coverage than this product. It does rubbed on the pillow and it is far more expensive.  Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not a natural look for me, will look for other brands.</li>
    <li> I used a similar product which was discontinued, so this item was a perfect find!! It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful and the color match is perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s messy to deal with, but once it&#x27;s applied and I clean the bathroom counter, I&#x27;m good to go...TOTALLY worth it.</li>
    <li> Works good. Definitely covers up. Although in the summer when I have it on and am out in the sun it burns a little.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended a brand name cover-up product that &amp;#34;sprinkles&amp;#34; on fibers. I purchased that plus another powder cover up and it&#x27;s the best! You brush it on where you want to cover the balding spots, and it blends in with your hair to give a full appearance. It stays on until you wash it out thoroughly, avoiding the problem of running if sweating, rain, etc. This site offered the very best online price. However, the S/H cost almost 30% of the order. It brought the savings down, but I rec&#x27;d the products with a 2 day delivery. I would have prefered a lower and longer shipping time over the high price of speed. I would definitely come back and I recommend this product to all my 60 something friends looking for a little more hair.</li>
    <li> Other than getting on your fingers when you scratch your head, it hides any thinning areas perfectly. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great find for my thinning hair!</li>
    <li> I use this together with Xfusion.  I use Xfusion on my back of my head.  For my front hairline which just needs a bit more full thicker hair, I find this Fill in Powder to look more natural and I am able to work with it more precisely.  I could use this on the back of my head also, but Xfusion is faster and better for that.&lt;br /&gt;For almost 2 months I have enjoyed looking 10 years younger and not one person has noticed, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the questionable problem.  Not completely sure about this but I believe this is causing me to lose more hair.  I do not know if it is because my eyes have been accustommed to seeing thick full hair and when I wash it and dry it, my hair looks thin.  Not sure, but I think it is causing more hair loss.  I just want to put this out here so you can decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Stays on until you shampoo it off .. even stays on during my workouts. Will definitely order again!!</li>
    <li> it was not black, it was grey, and looked terrible in my hair, it said on the box black, not</li>
    <li> I take calcium and jelatine capsules daily and as a result my hair and nails are growing very fast. I have to color hair 2-3 times a month which is absolutely not healthy so this powder is helping me to avoid excessive hair coloring.</li>
    <li> It was all broke up on arrival &amp; was not able to apply correctly because of it being broke up.</li>
    <li> The fill in powder shows up kinda gray in your hair not black looks off  , I wish it matched better it would be a better product.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to : )</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; As an African American with thinning hair due to chemical damage from a perm, I was searching for something to cover the exposed sections in my hair. I brought this product and now I have confidence when someone looks at my hair. This did the trick and is very affordable. You have a life costumer. Try this you won&#x27;t regret!!!</li>
    <li> I am going to return these.. the last time I ordered  it the color it was fine.. this time I ordered 4 and they are all too lightUGH</li>
    <li> This product works very well in covering the balding area on my crown! It blends in well!! Thanks so much:)</li>
    <li> I sooo love this stuff ! Best thing since Joan rivers ! I used to buy hers but it&#x27;s just too expensive so I have this a shot since it&#x27;s about $40+ cheaper ! &amp; it did the same exact thing just make sure you get your exact hair color .</li>
    <li> I have a cow lick in the back of my hair, and I use this to hide it.  Will buy again....work great!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mum and she loves it. Uses it for covering grey though it&#x27;s supposed to be for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected.  I have jet black hair and this black product is more like charcoal black so you could clearly see that i had placed something in my hair.  That is not the point.  The point is to hide,not show.  Someone mentioned going to walgreens and finding the blackest eyeshadow powder without the glitter that you can find...so i did.  Found one for a dollar.  Works perfectly well!</li>
    <li> Not bad as fill in powders go.  Does not last very long, however. Need to apply daily.  But for small areas, it will do the trick.  But so will hair mascara from the 99 cent store, or Topix.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for thinning hair.  I have tried to reorder, but it is always out of stock.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. I didn&#x27;t expect it to hold but I brush it on once my hair has dried and it stays until the next washing. Really helps when I am too tired or too busy to dye my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product not knowing if it would really work or not. I am a very happy customer...it works fast, easy and I am so happy with it. It covers in the think spots and makes my hair look so thick and full. I will be a long time customer.</li>
    <li> Despite the reviews I think it&#x27;s great. I have thining on top of my head and it bothers me a lot. This helps fill it in and nobody knows. I recommend it</li>
    <li> This product is really bad to buy online. When my mom recieved it , the little box was opened and had powder all over the place and it wasn&#x27;t ups or anything cause the brown box it came in was in good shape... it was tje company that sellls the product that didnt close it correctly</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I suffered from severe post pregnancy hair loss, hair loss so bad that I was left with two large bald spots on my forehead! Product shipped quick and had it within 4 days or ordering. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and a little goes a long way. The only thing that I think can be improved is the application brush, the bristles fall out easily with every application. Overall, great product for the cost!</li>
    <li> This one is good but not great.  There is some effect for my hair, so I stop using it. You should try!</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer of this Fabulous product twice now and don&#x27;t plan on using any other filler than this one. Product is very effective I am a male with thinning hair and this fill&#x27;s in the spots I need to be secured stays in all day rain or shine! Only comes out when you wash it out so having a bad day need to rest off from a long night out on the town don&#x27;t want to waste your time with a string your hair and re-doing it this is a absolute life saver. Instantly using this I&#x27;ve also notice hair my hair strengthen because of the exclusive ingredients would definitely recommend it. Seller is prompt and professional and does business the right way the first time seamless.</li>
    <li> This is a good cover up for thinning spots in my hair.  Looks natural  and covers up the spots well.</li>
    <li> When the description said &amp;#34;rain proof and sweat proof&amp;#34; I thought that meant the color didn&#x27;t come off on your hands and sheets.  That isn&#x27;t the case though.  Basically, if done right, this product works well to cover areas of scalp (baldness), dark roots, and all-around problems on head.  However, it will come off onto your hands and nails if you scratch your head, and it will make marks on your light colored sheets if worn to bed so be careful.  It&#x27;s still worth it because as I said, the campaglauge of the powder really covers bald spotting and thinning hair.</li>
    <li> It does work and it is less expensive. I do recommend people to buy it. It is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Messy, powdery and  does not really give a good coverage.  Maybe it will for other hair type.  Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this in brown at a CVS store but it was too light.  I end up buying it from Amazon, in the black color. It does help fill in the gaps but if you tend to flip your hair, or go out in the rain,  it will rub off on your hand. Overall a good product though. I will continue to buy this!</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this product!  Very reasonably priced as opposed to the other brands out there!</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; the price is right too!!!  Don&#x27;t have to color as often &amp; it&#x27;s good for your hair too!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the BLACK.. But what they are selling as black is actually GRAY being labeled as black... Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product because this GRAY power (supposedly black) will NOT cover your gray nor cover any thinning areas.. I do NOT recommend this product nor will I buy it again.. Being that it&#x27;s GRAY instead of BLACK, it goes on almost invisible compared to the Joan Rivers brand which is actually black and does do a great job</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair right above my forehead(all the women in my family have it). This product works great to cover in the gaps. It is easy to apply and does not rub off when I sleep.  I haven&#x27;t worked out in the gym yet, but I can&#x27;t see that this would run off if I sweat, I have done yard work and didn&#x27;t have a problem.  It makes me even look my age or even younger .  I also have gray hair along my hair line and this too works great to cover that up in between my hair colorings. Bought some for all my sisters as gifts, I&#x27;m sure they will feel the same way.</li>
    <li> I use this powder to fill in patches in my beard. Works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t run or smudge until you wash it out with soap. Totally happy with how full my beard looks now.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, works better than toppik hair fibers and is less expensive. I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I had a small spot that was shaved and I needed something to cover up that spot, it was easy to use and it stayed on as promised. I have only used it once, we will see how it holds up in the hot summer!</li>
    <li> good product, delivery on time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this on Amazon (because the deal was phenomenal!), but the product itself was really no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered in it &amp;#34;soft black&amp;#34; (since my hair is naturally that color) and was really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The color of the powder simply didn&#x27;t look natural and the brush was of rather poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were very flimsy and didn&#x27;t blend the product AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, great price, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product itself to anyone.  Guess I&#x27;ll keep shoppin&#x27; around ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and it does  not stain the pillow  like the other product I use  the color match my scalp perfectly</li>
    <li> Nice powder and it came with a big brush to use but the powder was broken up a little when I recieved it bit that didnt effect the use of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. When she gets nervous she picks at her hair. This is just what she needed. It covers great and now she has her confidence back. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> As I licensed professional I can say that products like these are a waste of money. There is no quick fix when it comes to hair color. You could just go to your local beauty supply and get some professional quality hair color the same color of your hair or darker. Never lighter. Or even a semi permanent color (lasts 4-6 shampoos). For about $5 it&#x27;s less trouble and your hair will thank you for it. Just have someone help you apply it to the back. Leave it on for 30-45 minutes for resistant gray. Anything more elaborate than that have a professional do it. Hair color is complicated and involved many factors including chemistry and everyone&#x27;s hair structure is different. There is a reason someone has to be licensed to perform this task. Also every licensed professional is not a color expert. Trust me it&#x27;s more complicated than you think. Sorry there&#x27;s no easy fix. Wish there were. But why waste your money on products that don&#x27;t work. These products are basically just eyeshadow. I don&#x27;t care whose name is on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually going to start ordering the dark brown.  The black works good in covering what I need covered, but found out the dark brown blends better with my hair/scalp.  Thank you for the help!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look natural it&#x27;s powdery and like a faded off black color when when black jeans fade.not a fan of this stuff .</li>
    <li> it really covers up making it look like i have more hair then i do.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to use and stays on throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;over all a good product. . .</li>
    <li> Really love this product, can be applied anytime, easy to come off when shampooing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Hides my bald spit well.</li>
    <li> Worked well and stayed on for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I liked the powder okay and don&#x27;t need to use it at this time. It worked out okay for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, covers the area, and stays put until you wash it out.  Since you really have to scrub to wash it out, I&#x27;m sure it will be good for swimming, though I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  Over the years I&#x27;ve used a number of products.  This one is the best.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this for my slightly thinning hair part...bad idea. The powder&#x27;s consistency and the brush seem like decent products, but the color itself is very fake-looking. I have black hair, and the black color product made my hair part look like I had a skunk streak. In fact, I tried it a few days after I got my roots dyed, and it made my hair part look like I hadn&#x27;t had it done in a while. I would&#x27;ve thought &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; would be a no-brainer, but it was a very dusty/blue-grayish color. I won&#x27;t be buying again or recommending.</li>
    <li> this product builds my confidence and covers the spot in my head in which hair is thinning. also does not wash off with sweat only, but comes off easily with shampoo..bought 3 of this already. great product!</li>
    <li> A woman&#x27;s hair is her crown and as exaggerated as this may sound its true.  There is a confidence a woman gets with their hair (that when you lose some you understand this statement) something a man could never understand.</li>
    <li> Awesome product ,excellence cover, incredible product, I love it. Thank you so much, is the only product I&#x27;ll purchase, and highly recommended.</li>
