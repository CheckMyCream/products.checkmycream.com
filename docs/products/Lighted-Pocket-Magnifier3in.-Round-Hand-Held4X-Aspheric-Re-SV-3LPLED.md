<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a good magnifying glass.  I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, though, since it is the first I&#x27;ve bought.  But after loads of research, this was the best I could afford.  Everything is crystal clear and the magnification is more than I imagined 4x&#x27;s to be.</li>
    <li> The magnifying glass is fine, but the light doesn&#x27;t work.  And the item is not worth the effort to return.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. The light make it easy for me to read the print. I carry it ib my pocketbook.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 94yo mother for several reasons. It is lighted, has a fairly large reading diameter, It uses easy to find and inexpensive batteries, and the batteries are easy to install. She tends to leave the light on when she&#x27;s not using it so she goes through a lot of batteries. Other magnifiers I have gotten for her were either too difficult for her to install batteries or the batteries cost more than the magnifier. The one magnifier I found that only lighted up when you held down a button was great initially but the button broke after only a month&#x27;s use. This is a good magnifier as far as clear magnification goes but I wish the light was better. With only the one bulb at the bottom of the glass, it lights the reading area in an irregular pattern - very bright in some places and not so good in others. Overall it&#x27;s good (and probably great for some people) but not the greatest for my mom..</li>
    <li> needs to be a little stronger for me</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my Mother in-law who is visually impaired.  It was shipped quickly and is as advertised. It is light weight and easy for her to use it also has enough magnification and light.  I am very pleased with the distributor and the product.</li>
    <li> Too bad this is not available now. It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to write a brief review expressing my pleasure with this product. It is neat, sturdy and inspires confidence.  It is a relief to receive this product after a number of disappointments with other magnifiers of similar price and design.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because of the higher  magnification or the brighter light, but I bought this for an elderly woman with  macular degeneration, and she really preferred  the Ultraoptix over the eight (count &#x27;em) other magnifying glasses I&#x27;ve gotten her over the past few months. The single light on the back is bright, but it&#x27;s easy to cover it up with your finger accidentally as you are holding  the handle , so it takes a little getting used to . With 4x magnification, reading seems much easier for her, and the area of coverage is large enough that you can read text more easily ( rather than going word by word as you have to do with tiny magnifiers. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying this one if you&#x27;ve been shopping around for something to enhance and brighten the &#x27;reading experience&#x27; for someone with vision problems.  The other positive review I can offer is for the Vivitar two-pack - nice lenses without a lot of distortion, and those have several good bright lights all around the circle of glass rather than one, but ... the magnification strength is lower on the Vivitars than on the white UltraOPtix LED model.  If vivitar made a 4 or 6 x magnifier (maybe they do?), it would be a winner, because the build quality is higher and it seems like a nicely produced magnifying glass. One note - these all take AAA batteries - not the standard AA.  If you are buying this as a gift, or even for yourself, you might want to add a pack of batteries to the order as well -- people usually have extra AA in the house -- but AAA may not be as readily available, and it will save a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> I use one to read nutritional information on grocery products, as well as for other necessary information that frequently needs both magnification and light ~</li>
    <li> great magnification. very bright light. change batteries easily. great for older folk who have trouble seeing the fine print.  great price. lasts for years.</li>
    <li> Bought two different brands, one large, one small, this one is the best for being handy, light and not taking too much desk space. The plastic does not touch the table due to the rim around the circumference, so it does not scratch.</li>
    <li> Really great product - I&#x27;ve had one for almost 2 years and just bought another, so I have them in different parts of my house.  Good magnification, clear image, very minimal distortion at edges, and a good, strong LED light.</li>
    <li> Nice 4X lighted magnifier. Gave them away for Christmas presents to my optically challenged friends and relatives. They loved them.</li>
    <li> Great for storing in a small space.  Just what I needed.  Quick and easy transaction.</li>
    <li> I purchased this magnifier for my mother who has macular degeneration.  I had purchased about four or five previous magnifiers each at FAR higher cost.  Surprisingly this is the absolute best...it has the perfect combination of magnification and lens size...all of this for an amazing price of only $11.00.  Since then I have gone on to purchase several more of these for others who live in her assisted living facility who also have AMD.</li>
    <li> I purchased this magnifier for someone who has macular degeneration.  It has a higher power of magnification and as bright an led light as a lower power, more expensive magnifier that she was using.  She is very pleased with the magnification, the brightness of the light, the size of the lens and the ease of use.  I have since ordered her another one to carry in her purse.</li>
    <li> Breaks easily. Have to keep buying replacements.</li>
    <li> I have vision problems and use magnifying devices all the time, daily in fact. Eye glasses are not enough in my case. So I have  magnifying glass&#x27;s all over the house, in just about every room. I prefer the lighted magnifiers and prior to this purchase my favorites were the Vivitar&#x27;s (can also be bought on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are about twice the cost of the Vivitar brand but much higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;The UltraOptix uses one bright white led powered by 3 AAA batteries, produces a clear white light. This really works well to light up what you are looking at. In comparison, again the Vivitar uses 6 white LED&#x27;s that on the high setting produce a yellow light at half the brightness of the UltraOptix. So if like me you need all the light you can get I highly recommend the UltraOptix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass itself is also quality with no waving effect found in the really cheap magnifiers. At four times magnification they are not great for reading a great deal. Say for example, one of those tiny instruction sheets that come with many Chinese products (you know what I am referring to). A magnification of 2.5 to 3 is plenty for such a task and you get to see more words per inch with a lesser magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What these are really useful for are those tiny printed items. Like labels on medication bottles, serial numbers on small objects or very small labels. Items where quality, magnification and amount of light provided are more important than the quantity inside the field of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these, especially for those of us that are older and need all the help we can get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these types of magnifiers and this is the best yet. It&#x27;s got a 3 inch lens so you get a wide field of view and very bright light. Very clear optics too. I find myself grabbing it just to use as a flashlight sometimes.</li>
    <li> Nice size for in house use or pocketbook.  Low distortion (impressive for a 4x magnifier), high quality plastic. comfortable to hold.  The light really adds to it and uses three AAA batteries so keeping it lit will be cheap and easy.    Highly recommended  (Don&#x27;t bother with the similar German one at 4x the price --- it can&#x27;t be much better and could be made in the same factory.)    Nice to see a well made items for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great small magnifier for those needing a little help!</li>
    <li> You have to hold it at just the right distance to get the focus right.</li>
    <li> I desired a new magnifying glass for studying the detail on antique postcards and to read a couple of low quality books I own. They&#x27;re basically smeary looking photocopies of old newspaper clippings. Fascinating, but hard to read. I have an attractive magnifying glass I bought elsewhere. It&#x27;s unlit and has a metal frame and wood handle. Top heavy. Ugh. I love to read in bed and had to hold the book so light would hit it and then fight the annoyance of the boat anchor on a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This magnifier is just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;1. lightweight and balanced well&lt;br /&gt;2. distortion free&lt;br /&gt;3. strongly lit&lt;br /&gt;4. haven&#x27;t had to change a battery yet&lt;br /&gt;5. low price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can sit anywhere in the house in low light and study the details on postcards, stamps, and cancellation marks. It has also come in handy in dozens of other situations like reading the numbers on button batteries. These would make a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: tonight \\&quot;Mr. Cypressgreen\\&quot; got three tiny splinters in his hand after we moved slabs of bamboo flooring. He was unable to get them out, then remembered that I bought this glass, and asked for it. Shortly thereafter, he retuned it to me (no splinter less) saying, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you paid for this, but it&#x27;s worth every dollar!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love this magnifying glass! Works great! I&#x27;ve bought a few for my mother and for myself.  Arrived quickly. Perfect transaction in every way!</li>
    <li> Light has been iffy.  Almost like a short in it.  As long as I have good lamp around, it works</li>
    <li> Good present for the elderly.  My parents and even my neighbor like it. Considering buy a couple for myself.  Uses good ole fashion batteries instead of button or coin like batteries.. so much better.</li>
    <li> I already have one of these magnifiers and like it.  This one came with a non-functioning light, despite using brand new batteries.  I returned it and probably won&#x27;t order another.</li>
    <li> Convenient to keep on my desk for quick use</li>
    <li> Works Great but I had to open it and adjust the contact to make it work correctly.  It could use a little more powerful light and maybe a temporary push button so it doesn&#x27;t stay on by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it works great for its size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m farsighted and wear progressive lenses, but oftentimes even the reading segments of my eyeglasses aren&#x27;t quite enough.  This magnifier provides optimum clarity with minimal distortion.  Along with its generous size and bright illumination, this handy little item is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Very simple but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, the quality is good, and the price is right. Illumination is bright and proper for the field of magnification, and the lens provides sharp focus.</li>
    <li> This magnifier worked well for about 3 weeks.  Then the light stopped working and that made it almost worthless.  There is no way of changing the bulb and it is too late to return it.  I am not happy with the long term quality of the product.</li>
    <li> This magnifier was purchased for my 88 year old father who has lost vision in one eye.  The magnifying strength and the bright light were just right for reading.  This magnifier is easy to grip and fits in his shirt pocket.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for, arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Lights up and helps perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to any one looking for a magnifier this strong</li>
    <li> It is everything everyone said it was and more.  I can really see well when I use it and will always use it when I read.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this magnifier. It has a clear well lit viewing area that focuses across the field of view instead of just the center. I bought 3 and use them in my lab and desk at work.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOTHER AND SHE LOVES IT</li>
    <li> I purchsed these to replace a broken one I bought from my eye doctor at a cost of $80.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference between them.  This maginifier looks the same and works the same.  At this price I puchased many of themn to leave in the RV, Shop and around the house.  I am legally blind and can&#x27;t read anything without these.</li>
    <li> Better quality than the Vivitar two-pack that I bought.  Even though it has just the one LED, it&#x27;s enough illumination for my liking.</li>
    <li> This item is very good!  It lights up the object nicely and magnifies it well.</li>
    <li> This is the best lighted 4X power magnifier I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I&#x27;m older and glasses just don&#x27;t work well for me, so I use this whenever I need to read tiny print.  I keep one of these in several places in our home, so it&#x27;s always handy.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ll order another one!</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my father.  He already got 2 power magnifier which is not powerful enough for him.  He said this one is about the same as what he current got.  He inserted the batteries but could not close the cover.  He had to use the rubber band to tie around it.</li>
    <li> Just a really nice magnifier, with a led light, my wife and I are getting a bit older, so this is just what the doctor ordered, for those up close tasks.  Very pleased.  Simple easy to use, practical, good light and good magnifier</li>
    <li> This thing has a wide field of view and a decent light. I use it all the time but you have to remember not to just lay it around anywhere as the lens is easily scratched.</li>
    <li> I bought four different lighted magnifiers for my 94 year old Dad.  This is the one he likes the best.  The led is very bright and the magnification very good.  He has macular degeneration so reading the news paper can be difficult.  This magnifier works well for him.</li>
    <li> It does just what it says it will.  Wonderful aid for aging eyes.  Works even without the LED light on, but that helps when you need it.</li>
    <li> Attractive design. Sleek and simple. Magnifier can be stored in original packaging to safely protect lens from scratches. (Package has sliding card as the backside of the plastic package.) Product has great focus to view small items. Appropriate lens size for a quality magnifier. 1 LED light under product works well and significant enough to view what you want to see. 3 AAA batteries required in this magnifier will last years powering 1 LED. Happy viewing.</li>
    <li> Good for reading the microscopic labels that seem to be everywhere, including instruction manuals.  What do they think we have microscopic eyes?</li>
    <li> Good clear lens, shipped almost instantly. Nice bright LED all in all a great product. The lens is large and good for looking at photographs</li>
    <li> I have macular degeneration and this is the best magnifier I have. I have a collection of magnifiers and his one is the best:  right size, perfect magnification. I bought six to keep two at the office, one at the car, one at home, and two reserved for future use  :-)</li>
    <li> defective&lt;br /&gt; switch does not work and light doesn&#x27;t go on&lt;br /&gt;4 power is good</li>
    <li> These are getting hard to find.  This one has a very bright LED bluish light, so if you don&#x27;t like that &amp;#34;cold bright light&amp;#34; look you may not care for it, but that does make things easier to see.  The magnification is very good and it seems very well built for the price.  Been using mine for about a month, it still works great and no problems thus far.</li>
    <li> 3rd one I purchased. If you use it for electronic repair or similar, it&#x27;s great choice. For reading it&#x27;s way too strong.</li>
    <li> I know some folks who have vision difficulties and found these to be an appreciated gift.  Having the light built into the magnifier makes it possible for them to read.  So many of us take that ability for granted and it&#x27;s nice to help others.  I plan to purchase more of these.</li>
    <li> My mom and my aunt have very limited vision.  This magnifier really helped them to be able to read different printed materials - newspapers, bills, menus,etc.  They love it!</li>
    <li> This 4 times magnification UltraOptic with a build in light really is an excellent product to have for serious close up when reading very small texts.</li>
    <li> The lamp is bright white so I painted it with red nail polish in order to preserve night vision when using a star map.  The 4X magnification is just enough to read the maps and the tiny symbols under a dark night sky.  No need for reading glasses :)&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it a 5th star because it falls apart if it&#x27;s dropped, spilling the batteries and the flimsy little cover, out there in the darkness.  I had to secure the battery cover with tape.&lt;br /&gt;A buyer should note that there is no way to attach a lanyard so one could hang the device around their neck, which would add convenience as well as security.</li>
    <li> When the item was ordered the first two orders went to the wrong addresses, even with the correct address on the packages.. USPS must be having trouble finding cheap good help...  The seller did not give up and sent a third package and went UPS instead, which has good help, all on their dime.  The picture of the magnifer doesn&#x27;t do it justice, I thought it would be much smaller, micro, but it was the right size for checking electrical components,with very small part number stamps, with a good-clear image, definetly worth the money and the seller made every possible effort to make sure I got what I paid for...:D</li>
    <li> She drops hers several times a day, and this one holds up to all the abuse. The light still comes on, the battery compartment stays closed- all around rugged item, and the lens is also good.</li>
    <li> While I would not want to use this or any similar magnifier to read a book or article, it is perfect for deciphering the small print that seems to be more and more prevalent on labels etc. these days.  Extremely clear, particularly if the light is used.  Like others, I have found this to be the best magnifier that I have had.  Hard to imagine that you will not be happy with it.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother, who has severe macular degeneration. She said it was one of the best magnifiers she has used. Provides very clear, non-distorted print for reading the newspaper. She also really liked the bright LED light on it. It also is truly a 4x magnifier. I may buy her another one to keep in her purse for reading menus, etc.</li>
    <li> My uncle mentioned that it was taking him longer to read his papers because he couldn&#x27;t see them as well as he used to.  I ordered a 3X and a 4X LED lighted magnifiers for him for his birthday.  He loves them and can use either to read his reading materials.  My aunt loves them, too, because they make him happy.</li>
    <li> Very good magnifying power for its diameter, and pretty accurate in the advertised power rating. Switch is not flimsy (like many).</li>
    <li> My mom, who has macular degeneration needed a new magnifier.  She bought one of those expensive models which promptly broke.  This new $12 magnifier is great and does an equal job of assisting in her.</li>
    <li> It appears to be 4x and is a handy magnifier that is easy to find and easy to click on. No problems, thanks!</li>
    <li> UltraOptix Round 4X Magnifier has a large, optically clear lens and bright white light combination that work great for my friend with macular degeneration. It has true 4x magnification with a large lens that is hard to find. Also, it is so lightweight it can be used for comfortable letter reading or grocery shopping.</li>
    <li> The product is ok, but I feel there are better out there (if you can suffice with a 3x) then go with the 3 pack vivitar magnifiers.&lt;br /&gt;The single led light design does not allow for a good spread of light over the area of magnification, its more just projected out without much concern as to where the beam of light is going.</li>
    <li> This has nice light and I was extremely happy with it</li>
    <li> I bought this magnifier for my 81 year old Mother. it is easy for her to use and she loves that it has a light option on it.</li>
    <li> This magnifier is ten times better then the one I previously owned.  I needed to be able to see the numbers on the inside of my glasses, and as you know if you wear glasses, the numbers are very small.  This magnifier, not only allows you to see the numbers, it has a LED light so you can see them more clearly.  It&#x27;s also great for very small print like on the back of a DVD.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple desktop magnifier for reading the marking on electronics components and this works great. The led is a little on the blue side in color so this seems to make the writing on circuit boards jump out, which is a nice plus. The lens is good quality and the focal distance makes it very easy and pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of negatives, the light switch is a slide type on off rather than a push button, so it&#x27;s easy to put this magnifier down and forget to turn the light out. The other is it doesn&#x27;t come with batteries, which surprised me as everything seems to include them now.</li>
    <li> Just very nice. I am a low vision person and find this to be very useful, although sometimes I need a bit more than 4X.. Still, I will orde anothe in order to have one by the easy chair and one in the office. Glass lens is resistant to scratching.. The light does not give equal illumination accross the full width of the magnifier; it is bright at the center and fading toward the edges. Powered by 3 AA batteries, I use alkaline rechargeables.</li>
    <li> My Dad is a stamp collector in his 80s and was so excited to receive this magnifier. He said it was the best one he&#x27;s ever had, especially with the LED light feature.</li>
    <li> Simply love it! Very fast shipping and made very well. If you need one definitely get this one!</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time to read serial numbers.  It works great.</li>
    <li> This magnifier has an aspheric lens - that gives you clear, sharp, even magnification ALL AROUND - even to the edges. It is a splendid magnifier - I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If I were to change anything - I would make it square. It would balance easier if needed to stand alone. Just me</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these that I&#x27;ve purchased and I think they&#x27;re great. They&#x27;re easy to hold, give off a good light and the batteries last a long time. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as an alternative magnifier to the one that came with my compact OED micro-print dictionary.  The original has slightly better optics (less bending/curving of text) but needed its own light source. Or being 62 and far-sighted, I needed a separate light source.  And the original magnifier required you to be directly over the dictionary, which required bending over which is difficult for me as I have had 3 back surgeries.  But with the UltaOptix I can view without bending over as much or needing a separate light source.  As Meat Loaf said, 2 out of 3 ain&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Very poor light for this magnifier.  The magnification is correct, but it won&#x27;t work for my needs.  sent it back.</li>
    <li> A truly outstanding device!  The light is bright and thoroughly illuminates the magnification field, which is remarkable for its crystal clarity from edge to edge.  Unfortunately, this is not a consistent feature in magnification devices but you will find it here.  I plan to buy a couple more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mom - magnifies well, and the light is strong and angled perfectly so it shines right on the area you are looking at. However the viewing area is a little small and because of the strength the outer area gets distorted so the actual viewing area is rather small.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight powerful magnifier.  The LED provides lens-wide light.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> This works very well for me.  A good but reasonable level of magnification, easily held relatively near the small print I&#x27;m reading.  I am very pleased with this magnifier.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave these as gifts they are wonderful</li>
    <li> I am very visually impaired from retinal disease and did not think this inexpensive magnifier would help me.  But thanks to those who reviewed it I tried and am pleasantly surprised.  This is not the first device using LED light that has greatly improved my life.  I have small powerful flashlights and an electronic magnifier, all use LED light and all have helped me tremendously.  This handy lighted magnifier is useful for seeing many things and eliminates the need to get out the larger bulkier electronic magnifier for every encounter with hard to see items.  It is truly useful even for me.  I also like that it is white - it&#x27;s easier to find on a tabletop or in a drawer.</li>
    <li> This is grest for intticate work cause the light really helps to see a lot of detail and my poor old eyes need alot of extra light these days. Easy to use and.esdy to take with.me anywhere i go i can finally see what i am ordering in resturants dim lighting. Thank you</li>
    <li> Too expensive. Should be $5.00 less. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to hold, relatively large, scratch resistant strong plastic, and a good LED.  Distortion is low as the 4x lens is aspheric.  Even more importantly, the light runs on AAA batteries, not expensive and hard to find button batteries.  No sharp edges.  Ambidestrous.    Recommended.  We may get another one or two.</li>
    <li> Good quality , magnification and durable - Especially for the price</li>
    <li> This is the best 4x LED Magnifier you will find for $10&lt;br /&gt;Takes qty&#x3D;4 AAA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time with 2x, not functional.</li>
    <li> Great find.  The off/on switch is very hard to use for the elderly who don&#x27;t have a lot of strength.</li>
    <li> I would like on to magnify the whoe page.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Seems stronger than the rated 4 power. This is the second lighted Magnifier I&#x27;ve had and this one wins, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;The light is located in the perfect spot and is strong enough to light up the entire magnified area. I&#x27;ve actually used this a couple of times to take splinters out of my finger(using tweezers, not the magnifier).</li>
    <li> Bright enough and it should help mom see the small print better. Its nicer than the old one that broke. Takes 3 AAA batteries.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my third one and now have one in kitchen, one by my computer and one in my reading chair.  I may get another for my purse. They do the job for me and I am completely happy.  Are they available in a stronger magnification?</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading the great reviews, but thought it odd that people would take the time to write a review for a magnifying glass. After I received the magnifier, I can see why. It is excellent and a bargain.</li>
    <li> Great for reading . Quality looks good. Very strong &amp; durable. I would suggest this product to others. The led light works great.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these for my three grandsons, whom I&#x27;ve gotten started on coin-collecting. Their Christmas gifts will include these illuminated magnifiers, coin folders and bags full of pennies, quarters, and gold presidential dollars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 95 year old dad who suffers from macular degeneration.  He really likes it.  He can read the headlines from the newpaper with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 89 yr old mom, whose eyesight is failing. We had purchased a 3x magnifier last year, but it was no longer strong enough for her to read the paper.  We installed batteries, turned on the light, and she grabbed the newspaper. When I heard her exclaim &amp;#34;I can READ it!&amp;#34;, like a kid on Christmas morning, I was so pleased.  It is truly 4x, it does work great.  She says the light switch is little hard to turn on (for her), but she loves it!</li>
    <li> The 4X works better than a 5X I have because the light seems to be evenly distributed over the screen area.  Uses 3 AAA batteries rather than the expensive button batteries used i some magnifiers.</li>
    <li> Had read lots of reviews for magnifiers--some commenting that the magnification strength was frequently not as advertised.  This one delivers.  The magnification is great--the LED light is helpful.  We ordered 2 hoping they would be good, and they were.  We&#x27;re very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard for a magnifier with an LED light and more magnification than just 2X or 3X.  This one is lightweight with good lighting and the 4X magnification works well for fine print, coins, etc.  Would like one with just a bit larger glass and magnification area, but those are very costly.  This one does the trick.</li>
    <li> This  item was purchased for my mother, so my review is based on her comments.  She said that it had a good grip, it was easy to use with minimal to no distortion.  She especially loved that it used AAA batteries instead of the watch batteries that are such a pain to replace not to mention the cost.  She was quite satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> I have macular degeneration and this magnifier has been the most helpful one for me to read with.  It has a bright light and the magnification is not distorted at all. I would not hesitate to buy another one.  I have three and I keep them in different parts of the house so I have one at my fingertips when needed.  A good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Not very bright and a cheap lens and button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 4 different brands/styles of lighted magnifiers and this was the second to worst one. Look at the Super Bright 75-MG7616 6 LED 4x Magnifying Glass. That one was by far the best and even a much better value at 3 for under $10.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and this one of my favorite magnifiers out of all that I have. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice little magnifier with a light.</li>
    <li> I have to use a Magnifier because of my Macular Degeneration... This one works really well for me...</li>
    <li> Great magnifier at a good price. I use it regularly to check out the coins in my collection. Item was delivered on time in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my aunt after her eye surgery and she loves it.  She uses it for reading small letters!!!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this magnifier.  The light is a great addition and it does not distort the object being magnified too much.</li>
    <li> My Mother-in-Law is legally blind and with what little site she has needed a magnifier to read the old one broke so this one works great for her.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it except the size.  I have Macular Degeneration, so the light is very important, but I would rather that the Magnifier be larger.  The 3&amp;#34; diameter doesn&#x27;t cover enough area while I&#x27;m reading a page.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she really likes it better than some of the others she&#x27;s tried.  Uses regular batteries, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> good size for maps, phone books and prescription bottles.  it has a good light and is easy to use.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very bright with the light so I can see very tiny letters on my watch battery to see what model is used so I can replace them. Also good for my Dad to use it to read newspaper.  I bought 2 and I love it. Good quality.</li>
    <li> The light is extremely bright.  In fact, it can be used for reading indoors at home or in a restaurant or it can be used outdoors to &amp;#34;lead a path&amp;#34; for someone unsure of the way in dim light.  The ability to turn on the light without it getting in your eyes is a real plus.  I just wish the magnifying part were larger.</li>
    <li> True 4x magnification. Others I&#x27;ve tried are either too low, too small, or do not point light in the right spot. This one works best for the money. I liked it so much after buying my first one at Frys that i bought several more from Amazon.</li>
    <li> The quality of this is poor. It&#x27;s bulky and not a good feel in my hand. The handle is way too big compared to the lens. Also, the handle is cheap and it appears to be defective (battery cover keeps popping off). I personally don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have macular degeneration and have been buying magnifiers. I wanted both width and power. This is reasonably wide ( 3in) and it advertised 4x. If you have bought magnifiers you know that what they say is not always what you get. This was advertised as 4x and it really is - also is distortion-free even though the lens is plastic. I recommend it to all you AREDs victims out there.</li>
    <li> The large area and the aspheric lens are nice. No distortion and even focus. Lots of chromatic aberration though, as you move your eyes closer.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not an achromat, so that&#x27;s expected.&lt;br /&gt;The LED light is not very bright, it&#x27;s very bluish and the battery contacts are a bit flakey.</li>
    <li> Very utilitarian, but quite effective.  Plastic lens will likely be easy to scratch, so I will clean infrequently, and use only soft cotton, not paper.  The only problem is that the switch for the light sometimes requires a bit of an extra tweak to cause the light to come on.</li>
    <li> Awkward product,  takes 3 aaa batteries and glass is hard to focus&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend product to anyone  GB</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and let&#x27;s me read the fine print just fine.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this same magnifier for my elderly mother who depends on it as she has macular degeneration.  We have been going to the \\&quot;blind\\&quot; store and paid around $35.  Amazon had the exact same magnifier for $13  wow!  I bought two for her as she always seems to misplace them.  Lesson learned for me to always check Amazon first.</li>
    <li> Certainly this is one of the better economy magnifiers....I would say it&#x27;s THE BEST one I&#x27;ve bought to date.  It is great for looking at small sections of something difficult to make out.  I wish there were something full-page that was maybe only 2x power...just enough to lay on top of a newspaper and move only a few times while reading an entire article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know of such an item that was 4 or 5 star eligible, and affordable at the same time ??</li>
    <li> I have ordered three of these for my vision-impaired mother.  Very pleased at first, but within about 6 months the switch for the light stops working.  Not so useful without the light.  Too bad, since we like everything else about the magnifier, which can be hard to find in a 4X power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to almost repair two of the switches by inserting a bit of folded foil to create a better connection. Very fiddley, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE__&lt;br /&gt;Optix was very responsive and offered to repair/replace the magnifiers.  A very nice company to deal with.  THIS IS A UNIQUE magnifier with a nice price, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This magnifier  is well made and very handy. The lens is almost 3 inches in diameter.  I bought another one for my friend.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 93 year old mother who has a hard time seeing.  I would have liked a larger lens but she is using it.</li>
    <li> Great little glass.  It&#x27;s distortion free and the light even does a good job of illuminating the work.  May not be great for reading because of the size; but for examining small items it does just fine.  I believe it is a true 4X when compared to the 2X I was using.</li>
    <li> Great for reading small print on bottles. I even have other magnifiers this works best because of the light should of got it sooner. I couldnt find one in the stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 98-year-old mother who is legally blind.  She has found it adequate for reading notes, telephone numbers, making lists--anything covering a small area.  The bulb is bright enough for her to see the print.  We recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had and used many magnifiers over the years for my work as an Electronic Engineer. Circuit boards have been shrinking for decades and it is difficult to see/inspect many of the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and ordered this one because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews and was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This magnifier is great because:&lt;br /&gt;a) Low cost for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;b) No distortion.&lt;br /&gt;c) Easy to focus.&lt;br /&gt;d) Excellent lighting. Bright white LED evenly lights magnified area.&lt;br /&gt;e) Shape and size of the body/handle makes it easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;f) LED lighting means batteries will last a LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;g) Magnifier lense is a good size at 3\\&quot;. Not too big or small although I would be interested in a larger version for a work table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all the reviewers that took the time to post their opinions.&lt;br /&gt;See my photo from Wikipedia that explains what an aspheric lense is and why it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful to you, please click \\&quot;yes\\&quot;. Thanks</li>
    <li> finally, I can read after my cataract surgery. I can read the paper, smaller print,and the numbers on the medicine bottle. This is wonderful for people like&lt;br /&gt;me who have high myopia  and macular degeneration. This is an excellent gift&lt;br /&gt;for seniors and low vision persons.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I bought this based not only based on the reviews here but on reviews on others that led me back here. I wear contacts for far vision and 3.5 reading glasses for near vision. Still, I was having trouble seeing things. (Did I mention I am only 43!!!!!) I have found that there is a certain way that this need to be held for me to see what I want to see. Once purpose I wanted them for was when the news shares a story only on my phone, which isn&#x27;t a small phone, and I want to see the picture. I turn the phone sideways so it is bigger and then use this. It does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really like it but it seems to be a dust collector and I SWEAR our house stays clean!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unimpressed with the LED light. I LOVE LED lighting!! We have changed many of our lights  to LED and have an LED fridge. But this has 1 LED light and it is really in the handle, close to the lens. it is helpful but not as helpful as it could be.</li>
    <li> I bought this magnifier for my mom who has macular degeneration. It took a while for her to get use to, but now  I see her using it most of the time although she still relies on her older magnifier.  The light is very helpful to highlight certain things that she is looking at..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clear, and the light doesn&#x27;t eat up batteries. But if you drop it, the parts will go everywhere. Luckily it goes back together easily, so far.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law had tried many different magnifiers to help her read with no luck. She is in her mid-eighties and has macular degeneration. I bought this one based on the good reviews and she loves this magnifier. She says she can read much better with it, and especially likes the light. She says she can see much more clearly than with magnifiers that claim to have similar magnification levels. She wishes the glass was slightly larger, but says that is just a minor issue, she just moves it across the page as she reads. She has always been an avid reader and this has enabled her to continue to enjoy books. I just ordered her a second one for her purse and another one for my parents.</li>
    <li> Came well packaged and in expected time.  Hard to rate as I gave it as a gift so I don&#x27;t really know how they liked the product.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase magnifiers from a low vision site, but this is just like one of theirs for much less money.  Excellent item and a great value.  I would  definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this magnifier, my eyes are killing me and I couldn&#x27;t read my Bible and hoped this was my answered prayer. None of the words were clear and it all was distorted and blurry, it didn&#x27;t help at all and I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> Great magnification power, built to last. I bought two! I keep one by the TV stand and one by the bed stand.</li>
    <li> Very useful in the kitchen...to see labels on boxes that are written so small to be read.  You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve  found handy vision aid magnifier.  Quality made, good optics.  One  product I&#x27;d highly recommend, since I use it daily.  Also available, a pocket version with  higher magnification.</li>
    <li> The led light is minimal and there is no magnifier within the magnifying glass to help magnify small items.  The magnifying glass portion is difficult to hold at a distance that one can focus without distortion on an object.  You can enlarge small print but only in small areas at a time as the distortion around the area is pronounced and annoying.  The magnifier is not worth the price in my opinion due to those quality issues.  It takes 3 AAA batteries and I have not had the item long enough to evaluate how long the batteries hold for the amount of usage as I only use this under the most necessary circumstances. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works quite well. The light really adds to the effectiveness of the magnifier. A nice large viewing area makes reading easier. It appears magnification is accurate (definitely greater than 2X magnification, at least), and the glass doesn&#x27;t appear distorted. Great for those over 40 with declining eyesight. Small enough to easily carry in a purse yet large enough to effectively help read smaller print or see more detail when needed.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it.Have since bought several more to give away as gifts</li>
    <li> Nice light, glass could be larger would be easier</li>
    <li> My mother is an avid reader, but even with an iPad, she now has trouble reading. She loves the magnifier, which does not solve the reading problem in general,  but does make specific areas visible.  She also likes the lighted feature, especially in restaurants where menu reading can be difficult due to low light. It is small enough to carry in her hand bag, and she likes the feel of it better than the rectangular one which I had previously ordered.</li>
    <li> The item works well and met expectations. I would recommend this glass to anyone needing or wanting same. The price is right.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to use</li>
    <li> This is way better than the metal illuminated dome magnifiers all over Amazon.  It&#x27;s well made and does the job.  I use it with my young kids when we need a closer look.</li>
    <li> the lighting is great and very easy to use. I use it all the time for reading,it is also very lightweight</li>
    <li> My mother in lae is very pleased with this item.  I offered to order a more expensive one from her eye specialist, but she declined, saying this one was ideal.</li>
    <li> The magnifier works very well it was exactly what I ordered.  I would recommend it to a friend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked great</li>
    <li> Purchased for a relative with macular degeneration who has very limited vision. She uses it to read mail and other written material and to view pictures. This is easy-to-use, has good magnification power, and is much less expensive than other models that are not much more effective. The lights are bright and really make the text (or pictures) stand out. I plan to buy her another one to keep in her bedroom.</li>
    <li> product works as describes. Would recommend this to those low vision. Magnification works well too so go ahead and make the purchase.</li>
    <li> Light is bright, magnifying glass is a good size, easy to hold. Very little distortion left to right so you can read a whole line at a time of that tiny print on the back of packaging. Too bulky to carry around in a purse or pocket, but perfect to keep in the kitchen or on your desktop. The battery compartment is a bit stiff to open, but not impossible. Same is true for the on-off switch, a bit stiff to slide. But there&#x27;s no possibility of anything accidentally turning it on and wearing out the batteries if you keep it in a drawer. Overall, I&#x27;d give it a 5+</li>
    <li> I am 60 ,so my eyes are not what they used to be . If I am in a dimly lit restaurant where the menu is written in tiny letters-I have to ask my 41 year old Husband to translate LOL. NO more! MY Husband (who is about 20 years away from needing this magnifier )said &amp;#34;let me see that thing&amp;#34; when I handed it to him he said Holy S _ _ t!-I can even see the pores on my hand where the hairs are coming out of the skin! Children-they&#x27;re so easily fascinated. Buy this magnifier, you&#x27;ll thank me!</li>
    <li> This is my Mom&#x27;s 2nd Magnifier. The 1st one won&#x27;t stay on anymore unless you hold the button down, so she requested another one (1st one is still usable).&lt;br /&gt;She carries it in her handbag so she can read the menu at restaurants when we go out. Very often the lighting is very dim and this lighted magnifier helps her a lot.</li>
    <li> For 84 year old grandmother who is losing eyesight.  She loved it and it really helps with small print.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these next to my desk to read labels and directions with tiny print. The magnification is adequate, the light is handy, and mine has already survived several drops to the floor. Unlike the magnifier I replaced, this one allows you to change out the batteries when they wear out.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this powerful magnifier every day.  Don&#x27;t know what he would do without it.</li>
    <li> We have only used it for a month.  It is good for sorting out small objects. Light is bright and 4 power is useful.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 92 year old mother who has macular degeneration. Finding the right magnifying glass for her is a challenge. It can&#x27;t be too heavy (heavy is a different definition at her age), needs a good light source and has to have a wide enough lens to make it practical for reading a book or magazine. After a lot of searching on Amazon and reading many reviews, I selected this one. She says it&#x27;s perfect on all counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was perfect for me. It goes without saying that free, fast, dependable shipping thru Amazon Prime is always on point.</li>
    <li> If the handle was longer and thinner, it would be more comfortable to hold for&lt;br /&gt;extended periods. Also index finger would be less likely to inadvertently cover&lt;br /&gt;light.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I like the larger lens and use of AAA alkaline batteries vs lithium buttons. My reason for not giving it five stars is that it is overpriced.</li>
    <li> This magnifying light is exactly as advertised. It seemed larger in the picture than it is in person but that&#x27;s my bad because the measurements were right there in the listing. The light is nice and bright and the image is clear.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a 100 year old lady. She was pleased with the magnification but wished the viewing area was larger. It was difficult for her to read large words as the whole word did not show.</li>
    <li> Fairly sturdy but the 4x magnifier isnt powerful enough.I needed 10x.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would have paid more to have a larger rectangular  view, since the round view limits the total viewing area. Great for labels, or when needed to read limited sized sentences. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m legally blind and have been using reading magnifiers since I was 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily as good (if not better) as magnifiers I used to pay $100+ for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this magnifier to read fine print on charts that my husband has, as well as, fine print on bottles of medicine. The (4 X) magnification is just right. The light shines in the correct spot too.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband love this thing. The added LED is a huge bonus in low lights.  He uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I use this for smaller print in mail or newspaper, books, etc.  Actually anything!  It is easy to hold and comfortable to hold.  The magnifying area is not too big but large enough to encompass a nice area of small print.  Light is aimed perfectly as you scan the reading material.  It is exactly what I wanted and it works beautifully!</li>
    <li> Works great. Would work even better in an oblong shape.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent magnifier.  It took some searching to find one on Amazon that is larger in diameter, more powerful magnification than 2x, and lighted.  This one is all of those and good quality.  The part that magnifies seems to be glass, although I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;The lights are very bright.  I&#x27;ve purchased other magnifiers here on Amazon, some good, some not.  This is one of the best.</li>
    <li> My low vision Mom needed another magnifying glass....  This is simple for her, she carries it around in her walker basket.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this!  The light makes this magnifier perfect for small print and for reading print in unfortunate light colors against a white background.  (Why on earth doe they do that?)  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a 4 inch 3 power magnifier instead it is a 3 inch 4 power.  Hard to use, too small and too much magnification.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model magnifier along with a rectangular model for my mother-in-law to choose between while trying to read the newspaper with her failing eye sight.  She chose the rectangular model so I kept this one at my home for those times that I have really small print to deal with.  It has great optics and doesn&#x27;t blur the words around the edges of the round shape.  Also it is lighted which is a plus although I did have to add my own batteries to get it to work (3-AAA size batteries), would have been nice if it had a storage sleeve but that wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Just followed the best review on this product and he was spot on. Pay the extra money now and you only need to buy one.</li>
    <li> works great.  bright light.</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Eyesight got worse so had to purchase one with more magnification.</li>
    <li> I bought this and two others, the mini, for mom.  She did not like the mini at all.  This one is good she says, but wishes the magnifying glass size was larger.</li>
    <li> My favorite magnafier</li>
    <li> Fits well in my purse pocket. Very handy when I need to look for a price in the store. I take it everywhere</li>
    <li> Good for someone with macular degeneration</li>
    <li> Really helps me since I have advanced MD</li>
    <li> a little chintzy compared to the quality of the carson, but still a good build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m keeping this over the [[ASIN:B007MKQP82 Carson Pro Series MagniFlash Aspheric LED Lighted Magnifier and Flashlight]] because the viewing area is twice as wide and the magnification is clearer and doesn&#x27;t distort as much as the carson does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see pictures for comparison.</li>
    <li> Luv this magnifying glass and light. Great for reading small lettering.</li>
    <li> quality, value , and speedy shipping. Combines shipping charges for multiple items reducing shipping cost.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother. The light is bright and makes reading easy, the lens is small enough to take anywhere. I would recommend to anyone with vision problems. And my mom likes it. :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reluctant to buy one of these online, but I read numerous positive reviews on this particular one. I took a chance and bought two. Good decision, they&#x27;re great! I leave one at work and one at home. They help reading fine detail in low light conditions, which I seem to do frequently.</li>
    <li> IS WHAT I EXPECTED. NOTHING FANCY, BUT LIGHTS UP THE PRINT YOU ARE TRYING TO READ AND REASONABLY MAGNIFIES THE PRINT</li>
    <li> Bought the 4x lens for my mother, who has macular degeneration. She is happy with the lens as she could read the small print on the box, something she&#x27;s been unable to do for a long time. Made the room dark to test the LED and that worked great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it five stars if it came with a carrying case or pouch to prevent scratches. Three AAA batteries look excessive but NOT a deal breaker.</li>
