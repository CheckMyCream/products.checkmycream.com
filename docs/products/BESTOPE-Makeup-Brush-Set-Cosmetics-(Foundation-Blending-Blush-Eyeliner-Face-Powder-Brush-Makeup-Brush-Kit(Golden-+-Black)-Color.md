<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was nervous to buy these but once they arrived came on time, packaged great, &amp; so amazingly soft! There great if you love doing makeup, contouring, blending! MUST GET FOR SUCH CHEAP PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend these brushes for anyone who is on a budget or just wants to save money. These brushes are really soft although they do have a strong smell when you first get them but nothing a good wash can get rid of. They haven&#x27;t shed on me.  The only bad thing I do have to say is the small flat top brush had a couple of stiff hairs I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had this problem. They&#x27;re great for applying foundation, blush/contour, concealer. Trust me because I really depend on the reviews whether or not I will buy an item.</li>
    <li> Got these brushes a view days ago and I am absolutely loving them! Thank you bestope for providing these wonderful brushes at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Flawless application and minimal shedding (1-2 hairs maybe), Slight smell when removed from shipping packaging but smell went away after a few hours. Very soft yet firm for precision application. Great beginner/everyday/studio brush set. Buy these you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> i really like the brushes and it&#x27;s really nice quality. when i got the brushes they had a smell to it like paint but after i washed them the smell went away. one of the handles already came off the brush but i can fix that with glue. i have the sigma f80 and f84 and these brushes are not as dense but i can say that&#x27;s a good thing. i had to replace my sigma f80 twice because all the sigmax fiber came out. the sigma sigmax brushes are so dense so its a pain to clean the product out of the brush.</li>
    <li> I am very obesessed with makeup and im always looking for a good sigma brush dupe. And i&#x27;ve found the best one on the market! When the brushes came in the mail they smelled a bit like paint but minorly. I tested the brushes and they also had flawless application! And no shedding! I will be purchasing more of these so that i can use them on clients!</li>
    <li> I honestly fell in love with these brushes. The quality is so good and they are ao dense. They leave your foundation looking flawless. They are my absolute faves. Thank you Bestope for providing us with high quality brushes for an affordable price. You guys rock!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Have had them maybe 2 weeks already and no issues so far. They don&#x27;t shed, didn&#x27;t smell upon opening which is a problem for most manufactured brushes. Are an awesome dupe for Sigma brushes and a much better price point! Washed with olive oil and soap didn&#x27;t shed or lose shape! Best purchase, considering I&#x27;m very picky and didn&#x27;t get to physically try them before buying. Will def buy another maybe sets for my kit!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really good and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I love love this brushes.. good quality. I washed them so many times and they are still really good.. i have the real technique and i do t even use them bc this are my new favorite..i will be reordering again so i have extras..</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing dupe for Sigma brushes. I use them all daily and have yet to have issues. Will definitely buy again if I need to, although from how these are holding up it will be a long time before I need to!</li>
    <li> Amazing Brushes! you won&#x27;t be disappointed. They are now my go to brushes. They blend soooo well.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with these brushes at all.  POINT 1: They are not dense at ALL.  They look like the Royal Care Cosmetic brushes, but they are less dense than the RCs.  My daughter bought the RCs, and I fell in love with the flat top brush.  I was hoping to get more for my money.  SHAME ON ME!!!  POINT 2: There was also a strong smell, which many customers describe from other products.  So, expect a strong smell.  POINT 3: They are extremely soft, but not in a good way.  The bristles bend with the slightest of touch.  The RCs are also soft, but they are plush, sturdy and dense.  The brushes actually feel like regular soft paint brushes.  POINT 4: Shipping was GREAT, it took between 8-10 days to receive.  This time was much shorter than the 30 days that was stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final conclusion.  Although the shipping was great, I cannot apply foundation with shipping.  I will be returning and buying the RCs, both sets.  :(</li>
    <li> These brushes are great but aren&#x27;t as dense as I thought they would be. The softness is comparable to ecotool brushes. Overall a good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> 2 thumbs up for this brush set!! They are great brushes, soft synthetic bristles and sturdy handles and I must mention its amazing price. I do wish they would be a tad softer since I have sensitive skin but for the most part, Its a great starter set!</li>
    <li> love these brushes, their nice and soft, money well spent</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes on a whim. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on Sigma or MAC brushes so I thought I&#x27;d try this out.  I was pleasantly surprised. They arrived 3 weeks early and were packaged and handled properly. They were in perfect condition. The bristles are extremely soft and firm. I was really impressed when I used these brushes. My skin looked flawless. My foundation went on gently and lightly. Fantastic coverage! They even washed extremely well and dried back into their original shape. With all kabuki brushes, there is a tiny bit of shedding. I was impressed that these brushes had minimal to no shedding whatsoever! Typically, I am very hard to impress. But I&#x27;m quite pleased and recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend to much money on makeup brushes so I bought these ones and they work fabulously.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes and the price is right. I will be purchasing another set.  Good quality if you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these brushes! They make me regret buying my sigma brushes they are an amazing dupe and the price cant be beat!</li>
    <li> These brushes are thick and great and everything that I was looking for. They do have a weird smell coming right out of the bag, but that goes away after a few days. Easy to clean and I&#x27;ve experience no shedding so far, but I only use them a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> i was kind of nervous of how good of quality the brushes would be due to the super low price but i have to say im loving these brushes they leave your face looking flawless, definatly worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever!!! I will be placing another order. The brushes are really good quality, comparable to sigma brushes. theses brushes are soft just like the eco tool brushes. I am so excited about these makeup brushes, best deal out there.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes!</li>
    <li> Very nice, absolutely no shedding so far. They came just a few days after I ordered them! For the price they were an amazing deal, only con is that when I received them there was a very strong paint smell. VERY strong. However, once I took them out of the plastic and disposed of those and the pink carrier bag they came with, the stench was gone, so it wasn&#x27;t the brushes themselves that smelled of it. Overall couldn&#x27;t be happier with them!</li>
    <li> I think these are great. They pick up powder well &amp; its not rough on my skin at all. The brushes (I only use 2; not a huge make up fanatic but i wanted this as a &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34;) are soft yet sturdy. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with any of the bristles falling.</li>
    <li> More like 3 and a half stars since the bristles are not as tightly packed as I would like and the cut of the brushes is not precise either. But then again, at this price, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They&#x27;re even better than what I expected. They came on time within five days. Super cute. I love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love... the only thing to make it better: 2 eyeshadow blenders</li>
    <li> Good set of brushes! Washed it after use and the hairs are intact.glad i brought them.</li>
    <li> Good quality and you cant beat price</li>
    <li> The best brushes for the money!! My eye shadow goes on so beautifully! I recommend this product to anyone that wants good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I would have given these all five stars but one of my brushes has a dent in them but I have already washed them because when I got the brushes in the mail today, it spelt like paint but after washing them the smell went away. So I don&#x27;t think that I can return them but other than that these brushes are very soft  and they retained there shape very well after being washed.</li>
    <li> I use them daily I have never had a problem, the bristles are fully intact &amp; they blend amazing</li>
    <li> Really good brush ,excellent price i would buy again from the seller AAA+++</li>
    <li> I received my brushes today and needless to say I&#x27;m in love! Packaging was nice and delivered on time. The brushes were EXTREMLY soft and fit nice in my hand. I washed them right away and they maintained softness and didn&#x27;t shed, AT ALL. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I will definitely soon.</li>
    <li> I like brushes when not a hair poke in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;And this is exactly why I give them the rating for they are so soft.&lt;br /&gt;And pocket friendly as well.&lt;br /&gt;Please continue on providing quality merchandise with practical prices.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to all who loves face brushes.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy these but 12.99 free 2 day shipping with Amazon prime? Couldn&#x27;t beat it! I got them right on time through usps. The packaging is basic, comes in a little then pink tote with a plastic zipper like a zip lock. Every single brush was super soft, I&#x27;ve never tried the sigma brushes and I won&#x27;t be either.  The brushes are that amazing they blend so well its easier now for me to get the flawless look with out spending soo much time. Love em!!</li>
    <li> These are fabulous for the price! The brushes are very soft and apply make up beautifully! They came in a case which was more or less a cloth zip lock bag, nothing fancy. The brushes did have a paint like smell to them but I washed them as soon as they got in and the smell was gone and they held their form very well. Overall I am beyond pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Lovveee!! And they came earlier than guaranteed date !</li>
    <li> Great brushes, I have only used once but so far I love them, especially the flat top kabuki for my foundation. Very soft. I will probably be buying more for gifts. I would never spend $20 on a single brush so this is definitely an awesome deal.</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any fallout with the bristles. They clean easily, and they are dense. I use the smaller brushes for eye-shadow and they work like magic. One of the brushes looks exactly like another brush of the same size, so I don&#x27;t like that. No real cons so far.</li>
    <li> So excited to have found these.  There is no need to spend $25+ on a single makeup brushe when you can buy this set for $12.  The brushes look and feel great.  They are sturdy and soft and appear to be well made.  I suppose the real test will be in how long they last but I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
    <li> I have several different makeup brush brands. The highest end is sigma, lowest being elf. This is a great deal. The bristles are soft. Gives me a flawless application. And the price is not beatable! Sorry for the late review! And thanks so much.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really good a bit more stiff then I thoght so they&#x27;re mostly good for foundation not powder if you have dry skin . Good in general:)</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. There was a bit of a smell when I first opened them but after airing them out they smelled fine. They&#x27;re so soft, but they pick up the make up so well! Even the cheap make up where the pigment is horrible! I&#x27;ve actually stopped using the MAC brushes that I have to use these. So worth it for the price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and for a good price!! The bristles are nice and soft and there&#x27;s hardly any shedding!! I love them.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. I wish there was an eyeliner brush with this set but I knew it didn&#x27;t have one. I would definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> I received my order in a timely manner, in addition, the brushes did not have a bad smell (as other reviews mentioned). Furthermore, the brittles are soft and not stiff.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 4 statrs because they are not labeled, as to what their function is (I&#x27;m a beginner, so I&#x27;m kinda lost), and there wasn&#x27;t a brochure or  anything indicating which did what.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. Although, if you&#x27;re a beginner you&#x27;ll have a tough time figuring out which one to use for powder, liquid foundation, blush, ect.</li>
    <li> BEST SYNTHETIC BRUSH EVER!</li>
    <li> This set is excellent. The quality of the brushes is very impressive. Extra soft, plush, and cut evenly. There was minimal shedding before and after I washed them. For me, the brush hairs are dense, but still flexible and easy to move smoothly along the skin in any motion. One of the smaller concealer-type brushes did break (the brush head fell off the handle), but I was being very rough with it during a wash, so I can&#x27;t really fault the brush. I would and will buy more from this company in the near future.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes in the mail and it got to my house pretty quick and the brushes look like their great quality for such a great deal!  Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Although Sigma Brushes are more expensive and better in quality (more dense bristles) - these are very good cost conscious alternatives. You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I use these when my Sigma brushes are being clean. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! Defiantly a dupe for some high end brushes</li>
    <li> Great product! Use it everyday and they have proven to be much better than my old makeup brushes. Must clean the brushes upon arrival, but once you do, they are perfect!</li>
    <li> They came in good timing , I just used them this morning they are amazing and I&#x27;m a make up artist they are wonderful I&#x27;m so satisfied I recommend these to anyone !!! Love love love</li>
    <li> These are lovely for the price. I find that they&#x27;re comparable to the everyday minerals brushes (which happen to cost much more). They do have a chemical like smell. I would suggest washing these before use. The bristles are super soft, however they&#x27;re not as dense as I would like them to be, they did achieve the look I was going for and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with blending, streaks or shedding. Although, I did find that some brushes have bits of hair popping over the top of the general shape of the head. Easy enough to trim but curious given that I&#x27;ve only had them for about a week at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought from : BESTOPE</li>
    <li> The shipping for this product was very fast and packaged wonderfully. Although there is a chemical smell to the brushes it was not a problem I just washed the smell right out and the brushes stay soft no matter what! I have not had any problems with the hairs falling out or the brushes breaking or being loose and I was especially skeptical about those things happening because of the bad reviews I read before I purchased the brushes. Overall I LOVE these brushes and I will always go back to them!</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING. They came individually wrapped, and the brushes themselves just look professional. They are very very soft and so firm! I absolutely love them. They have a Sharpie smell to them but I could care less because I like odd scents. This is one of the first bargain (for the flat top kabuki) brushes that the makeup actually sits on the brush and doesn&#x27;t seep in because it&#x27;s so thick! Love love love. Def will re-order when necessary. Don&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> I got them and I was nervous at first but i loved them i compared them to my real technique brushes and they feel just as soft, the handle brush is great quality for the price I totally recommend</li>
    <li> the brushes i use are really soft and do not sheer. I do not use them all but they are really good for what i nedeed them</li>
    <li> I ordered this brushes about a week ago and I was skeptical at first on what I was going to receive. I had bought brushes in the past but never online. I usually get the ELF brushes or eco tools brushes. When I got the package I was amazed at the quality and softness of the brissles. They look and feel like high quality makeup brushes. At first, my package was short 1 brush and I contacted amazon. The problem was fixed within minutes. I received what I was missing plus more. I am soooo happy I made the purchase. I recommend this brushes to anyone over spending hundreds of dollars over other high end brands when these do the work. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes today thry seem like great quality</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. They are really soft and don&#x27;t shed much. Great quality! I expected them to have a low quality because of the price, but they proved me wrong, lol.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft, and they blend makeup perfectly. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the handle came off of one of my brushes, but it&#x27;s nothing that some super glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about ordering this set because of the mixed reviews. I was looking for something similar to what bh had on their site, because the set they had were sold out. I&#x27;m glad I got them. They have a smell to them, but that&#x27;s like most brushes you order and get by mail. It will go away once you let them air out or clean them. It isn&#x27;t as dense as my coastal scents or MAC, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. Especially for the price you pay. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it being flimsy. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Always receive compliments on how good my make up looks! Thanks to these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice for the price. I purchased a similar set a month ago, but paid three times as much. I wanted to have a set with me when I travel and thought for $13, this was a deal too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the handles are a good weight and the bristles are soft, I did notice the brushes were not has dense/stiff as the other set I purchased. These shed a little more than my other set as well, which is why I am only giving this set 4 stars. I haven&#x27;t used these yet, so I cannot atest to their performance. But as a back up set, these should be fine. The brushes I will likely use most often will be the flat head, round and tapered kabuki. The smaller brushes I will likely use for shadow and concealer applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes for people just beginning to use make-up or to keep as a secondary travel set. Can&#x27;t be the $13 price tag!</li>
    <li> I was about to cave and buy the Sigma Sigmax line, but came across these. They are almost be can&#x27;t dupes plus two extra brushes. The quality is excellent for the price and they arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived on time and beautifully wrapped. I was extremely pleased with the quality- they are a good weight with no shedding and they are incredibly soft. My makeup application looks beautiful using these brushes especially the eye shadow blending brushes. I am keeping these brushes on display because they look so nice! They  add glamour and sophistication to my vanity table. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase! For more pictures and info check out my blog post:[...]</li>
    <li> these brushes are a dupe for sigma brushes, but the only think that differs is that they are not as dense as sigma brushes. but they are great, they give you a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with them. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Very good parchase I love it</li>
    <li> I love them. My make up goes flawlessly with them. The only problem is that I don&#x27;t know what some of the brushes are for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes. They&#x27;re so soft and blend all my makeup so well. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them!</li>
    <li> I simply do not understand how anyone could rate these brushes anything less than 5 stars!! I received them quickly &amp; they were packaged nicely in a bubble envelope. Each brush was individually wrapped in plastic so they arrived in perfect condition. I was shocked at the size &amp; quality of the brushes. These are not those thin, cheap, plastic brushes that normally cost the same price! They are real wood so they have a nice weight &amp; chunky size. They feel fantastic in your hand. They are super soft. I was looking to replace my worn out &amp;#34;hodge podge&amp;#34; makeup brushes &amp; I couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice! The best part is I didn&#x27;t break the bank doing so! I cannot believe I only paid $12.99 for these! This is a wonderful assortment of face &amp; eye brushes for perfect makeup application. There are no impractical &amp;#34;oddball&amp;#34; brushes that you find in a lot of sets. It is so nice to have a complete, practical set of brushes with a nifty zipper bag (which was included!) to store them. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with them &amp; the excellent service. I only wish I had ordered them sooner!</li>
    <li> Great coverage with liquid and powder foundation and very soft.  They have a somewhat chemical smell to them.  Washed with soap and water, but there is still some residual chemical smell.  If that could be eliminated, they would be fantastic.</li>
    <li> They are super soft and leaves my makeup flawless.</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes!!! Better than anything I&#x27;ve bought from ulta, and I love how many different sizes and types there are. The contouring brushes are perfect, and they are the softest brushes I own. Even my boyfriend loves to drag them on his face because they feel that great!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I&#x27;ve been using them every single day since I got them about a month ago. They&#x27;re soft, but dense. Also, they don&#x27;t shed which is HUGE for brushes this inexpensive. Shipping was great. They arrived early and they were nicely packaged. These are great for beginners or more experienced people like myself. I am extremely pleased with the quality, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> The set is a good deal. They are well made and stylish.</li>
    <li> Great brushes at a great value!</li>
    <li> These are some of the softest brushes I have ever used. I definitely didn&#x27;t need any more brushes as I already have too many, but these are fantastic. I washed them before use and there was absolutely no shedding and they kept their shape. For the price and the quality, I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes and they were delivered immediately. I got them the very next day after I ordered them. Shipping was very fast. The brushes are great. I would say they&#x27;re the quality of sigma but they are really good brushes. I love them and I would suggest purchasing this set as they are a lot cheaper then Sigma.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought these brushes for me as a gift. I have been looking for a flat kabuki after seeing my friend and MUA on YouTube using them in some of her makeup tutorials. She always has flawless application and I wanted that too! I was going to buy the brushes from MAC, but at more than $50 a pop I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it. I still wanted the high quality that MAC provides, but at a less expensive price.  Well I got it. I might even go as far as saying they are better than the MAC face brushes I have. They arrived so quickly, and were wrapped up individually as well as another wrap around all four brushes. They were in amazing condition, they are sturdy and well made. The bristles have had no fall out for me. They are also SO incredibly soft, they feel amazing on your skin. They pick up my liquid foundation and blend seamlessly. As for blush and bronzer, they are very thick and bushy and pick up a lot of product, so I have to tap it off before applying but it looks great once I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m very happy with my gift, I will order more brushes from this company. I got the four piece kabuki set I&#x27;m gold. I would totally recommended these to anyone, and the high quality for the price!? Girl, if you don&#x27;t get these you&#x27;re crazy! You&#x27;ll love them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> The product is nice and the brushes are soft. The reason I gave it fours stars was the price and I wish there had been asomething included to tell me what each brush was and how best to use it.</li>
    <li> The brushes were amazing !üòÅ</li>
