      <li>It smells really good, and has a powdery note to it.</li>
      <li>I must admit, I bought this fragrance because I liked the bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually not one to do that, but I was impressed that they weren&#x27;t lying lol and it smells amazing, the scent is a mixture of fruity/ fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Great affordable perfume and the bottle is super cute, reminds me of a gem</li>
      <li>I love this perfume it was deliver in time.</li>
      <li>I am not a big fan of musky perfumes so this is PERFECT.</li>
      <li>Maybe the perfume would be better.</li>

      <li>my husband love the smell</li>
      <li>La volver&amp;iacute;a a comprar, Recomendadisiiima! :)</li>
      <li>Well, I love it, but my husband hates it on me.  </li>
      <li>This is what my boyfriend requires for me to be sexy.  </li>
      <li>When I first spray it on, though, it smells fruity and happy and makes me smile.  </li>
      <li>I love it and for those who want this unique smell they should get it to.</li>
      <li>then it mellows out into a nice smooth fresh scent sort of like bath and body works malibu heat</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t ask much more of a perfume than making you smile :)</li>
      <li>This scent is strong and stays for days.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that it is a perfect soft blend of fruits, musk, flowers and freesia.  </li>
      <li>A very fresh, sweet, fruity and almost sparkling because of the fresh fruits in the top note.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s what the fresh scent reminds me of!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fruity and sweet but not in an overpowering way.</li>
      <li>The sweetness isn&#x27;t like a candy gourmand sweet either, and it doesn&#x27;t smell synthetic at all.  </li>
      <li>, IT&#x27;S SWEET .</li>
      <li>Personally I found it to be very appealing on her.  </li>
      <li>Not overpowering but fresh.</li>
      <li>It is a soft, exquisite and delicate perfume.</li>
      <li>You smell the fruity first</li>
      <li>Most perfumes don&#x27;t last well on me, and this one is no exception.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent,but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mouthwatering and luscious!</li>
      <li>Suitable for a young woman to warm climates exhibiting excessive because it is not sweet nor strong.</li>
      <li>This i love more then other red boxed Live.</li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t change much so</li>
      <li>Very satisfaced with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I really like this perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fun and flirty and it lasts an unbelievably long time.  </li>
      <li>I COULD&#x27;VE SPENT 6.00 ON A BODY MIST AND SMELLED SWEET MUCH LONGER.</li>
      <li>Since Live Luxe isn&#x27;t really sold in too many stores anymore it was hard but</li>
      <li>I finally found a perfume I really like!</li>
      <li>I tried it in the store, but it was late in the day, and after shopping like most, women I took my bath.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave this 4 stars, is that this parfum doesn&#x27;t stay with me very long, so it won&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>

<li> BUT, IT DOESN&#x27;T STAY ON NO MORE THAN 20 MINS.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Delivered in a timely manner. I love the scent,but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last. Maybe the perfume would be better.</li>
    <li> I bought the parfum spray and body cream on the recommendation of a friend.  The notes are nothing like what I usually choose, (I&#x27;m in the \\&quot;chypre\\&quot; family usually) and I knew this, but I thought I&#x27;d try something a little different.  Well, I love it, but my husband hates it on me.  Maybe it&#x27;s just too different for him from what he&#x27;s used to smelling on me.  So, I wear it when we&#x27;re not going to be together.  Most perfumes don&#x27;t last well on me, and this one is no exception.  When I first spray it on, though, it smells fruity and happy and makes me smile.  You can&#x27;t ask much more of a perfume than making you smile :)</li>
    <li> I finally found a perfume I really like! I actually have a story behind this Live Luxe to haha. About 3-4 years ago some friends and I were going through the mall and I think we went through a Macy&#x27;s and well, you can&#x27;t help but to smell some of the perfume samples. We were in a hurry though so I remember being attracted to some weird bottle with all these colors on it and quickly spritizing a bit on my arm. On the way home I could NOT STOP SMELLING IT. It smelled so good. I have been searching for it on the side these last years and only going by the scent and bottle. Since Live Luxe isn&#x27;t really sold in too many stores anymore it was hard but thankfully the internet and Amazon came through for me!!! It&#x27;s fruity and sweet but not in an overpowering way. I am not a big fan of musky perfumes so this is PERFECT. It last&#x27;s for a bit. I do refresh after a few hours. I love it and for those who want this unique smell they should get it to.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars, is that this parfum doesn&#x27;t stay with me very long, so it won&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked. I tried it in the store, but it was late in the day, and after shopping like most, women I took my bath. So I really never knew it wouldn&#x27;t stay with me. I have had these px&#x27;s before, so it isn&#x27;t the parfum&#x27;s fault or the seller&#x27;s. It smells really good, and has a powdery note to it. Go for it unless you have had the same px that I have.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I bought this fragrance because I liked the bottle. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that it is a perfect soft blend of fruits, musk, flowers and freesia.  This is beautiful day time or sport fragrance for women.</li>
    <li> my husband love the smell</li>
    <li> I had to listen to customer feedback before buying as many had said it smelled delish. I&#x27;m usually not one to do that, but I was impressed that they weren&#x27;t lying lol and it smells amazing, the scent is a mixture of fruity/ fresh scent. You smell the fruity first then it mellows out into a nice smooth fresh scent sort of like bath and body works malibu heat that&#x27;s what the fresh scent reminds me of!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume in fear ever since I buy fragrance without testing it on my skin change too. I have been delighted. It is a soft, exquisite and delicate perfume. Suitable for a young woman to warm climates exhibiting excessive because it is not sweet nor strong.</li>
    <li> I COULDN&#x27;T WAIT TO RECEIVE THE PERFUME DUE TO REVIEWS. WELL, I LEARNED THE REVIEWS ARE HALFWAY TELLING THE TRUTH .YES, IT&#x27;S SWEET . BUT, IT DOESN&#x27;T STAY ON NO MORE THAN 20 MINS. THEN IT GOES FLAT. I COULD&#x27;VE SPENT 6.00 ON A BODY MIST AND SMELLED SWEET MUCH LONGER. THE BOTTLE SHOULD BE A MINIATURE</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on the reviews I read on another site. It has a the type of juicy fruity scent that I can&#x27;t resist. It&#x27;s very mouthwatering and luscious! I recommend if you like fruity somewhat tropical type scents.</li>
    <li> Great perfume perfect xmas gift my best friend love. it and came just in time before xmas</li>
    <li> This scent is strong and stays for days. Great affordable perfume and the bottle is super cute, reminds me of a gem</li>
    <li> Amo esta fragancia! es dulce y duradera! Me lleg&amp;oacute; en perfectas condiciones, gracias! La uso a cualquier hora y en cualquier ocasi&amp;oacute;n. La volver&amp;iacute;a a comprar, Recomendadisiiima! :)</li>
    <li> A very fresh, sweet, fruity and almost sparkling because of the fresh fruits in the top note.  The sweetness isn&#x27;t like a candy gourmand sweet either, and it doesn&#x27;t smell synthetic at all.  I think of a summer night out on the town with this fragrance.  It&#x27;s very fun and flirty and it lasts an unbelievably long time.  The scent doesn&#x27;t change much so what you smell in the beginning will be what stays with you during the time you wear it.  I&#x27;m really happy with this perfume and I would recommend it to anyone who likes youthful perfumes. Also, I&#x27;ve heard this is a dupe for Ralph by Ralph Lauren.</li>
    <li> This is what my boyfriend requires for me to be sexy.  I try all the perfume in the store this is the one.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it!  Personally I found it to be very appealing on her.  I will buy it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> This i love more then other red boxed Live. Recommending it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume it was deliver in time. I will order I again, only this time a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> Not overpowering but fresh. It reminds me Tommy Girl fragance. I really like this perfume. Very satisfaced with my purchase.</li>
