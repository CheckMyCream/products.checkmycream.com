      <li>Adorable!</li>
      <li>It looks okay, but it does not look like the picture at all!</li>
      <li>and I liked what I had ordered before.</li>
      <li>I used a pair of pliers to remove the dangling piece very easily.</li>
      <li>Love this item.</li>
      <li>and people just love it.  </li>
      <li>but I am glad they did show some customer service, my seller review is gone and can&#x27;t be changed so I am reflecting the info here</li>
      <li>THEY ARE OK, I BOUGHT 2</li>
      <li>I love it, but it could be distracting.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Very beautiful accent to a sock bun or french twist.  </li>
      <li>I think this is okay for the money you spend.</li>
      <li>The item itself is exquisite and stylish, and I would definitely recommend it</li>

      <li>Very pretty, quality could be better but</li>
      <li>but hey, it was cheap.</li>
      <li>I will enjoy this piece well.</li>
      <li>Adds some unique pizazz to my work clothes.</li>
      <li>It holds my (fairly fine) hair in a twist, but if I want the top to stay higher than the bottom, I&#x27;ll pin the stick near the top.</li>
      <li>Looks absolutely fancy and stunning in the hair.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it was, better than expected.  </li>

      <li>I hope to get more in different colors.</li>

      <li>High quality , sturdy and pretty!</li>
      <li>THEY ARE ALSO VERY TOP HEAVY</li>
      <li>They really dress up a crochet neck scarf.</li>
      <li>a described, not usable for what it is, but is lovely in other ways, I am using it still just not for what it was intended.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, a little cheap looking</li>
      <li>If you look really close at the close up, you can see that the large tear shaped gems are more of a reddish purple and the smaller gems are a VERY pale purple.</li>
      <li>I bought another one a different color and a stone came out the first day</li>
      <li>This hair stick was larger than expected and VERY pretty.  </li>
      <li>I will say that you are getting what you pay for, the pin may bend depending on how thick your hair is, but it is easily bent back and not prone to breakage.</li>
      <li>decoration is pretty heavy.</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the rhinestones or the dangling chain yet (only have worn it a few times so far).</li>
<li> , I think it is shady to remove reviews to keep your ratings high, I had stated the following&lt;br</li>
<li> Being made of metal, it is very sturdy and won&#x27;t break off when putting up thick or long hair.  </li>
<li> I bought it for a friend because I had a limited budget</li>
<li> *Seller give me a partial refund, I am not sure I would use them again, as they suppressed my seller review, claiming it was a product review but look at the seller reviews that they have listed, the majority are clearly product reviews.</li>
<li> It also held my hair firmly, which is quite a trick.</li>
<li> Mine came in the mail and had a jewel missing and it was nowhere in the package.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times already</li>
<li> The head is a bit heavy, but I can work with it.</li>
<li> The red one looks exactly as pictured, but I was shocked by the color of the purple one!</li>
<li> The small gems on the tassels do not match either as they are a very dark purple.</li>
<li> THEM THROUGH, THEY CAN NOT JUST BE TWISTED UP AND HELD BY THEMSELVES LIKE OTHERS</li>
<li> I also like to wear it with a casual outfit as a surprise embellishment.</li>

    <li> Very beautiful accent to a sock bun or french twist.  I used a pair of pliers to remove the dangling piece very easily.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, a little cheap looking but hey, it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shawl pin! I ordered it in a couple of different colors. They really dress up a crochet neck scarf.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these, one red and one purple. The red one looks exactly as pictured, but I was shocked by the color of the purple one! If you look really close at the close up, you can see that the large tear shaped gems are more of a reddish purple and the smaller gems are a VERY pale purple. The picture looks like they are about the same color, but the colors are dramatically different. The small gems on the tassels do not match either as they are a very dark purple. It looks okay, but it does not look like the picture at all!</li>
    <li> This was an inexpensive item for me.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times already and people just love it.  It was well packed and arrived quickly, just as an added bonus.  It also held my hair firmly, which is quite a trick.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. The stick is very beautiful and shiny. The head is a bit heavy, but I can work with it.</li>
    <li> I think this is okay for the money you spend. Mine came in the mail and had a jewel missing and it was nowhere in the package. I got the other multi colored one and it had all of its jewels so if you want to take the risk you might get one without a jewel or a good one.</li>
    <li> This hair stick was larger than expected and VERY pretty.  Being made of metal, it is very sturdy and won&#x27;t break off when putting up thick or long hair.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the rhinestones or the dangling chain yet (only have worn it a few times so far).</li>
    <li> This item came as is. Gems are exactly pictured. It holds up my hair well for me. I will enjoy this piece well. I hope to get more in different colors.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and well made. Looks absolutely fancy and stunning in the hair. I also like to wear it with a casual outfit as a surprise embellishment. The chain has not caught in my hair. It hold my medium-long hair in a bun all day.</li>
    <li> Prettier in person.  Love this item.</li>
    <li> Very good quality especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I received it today..... I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it was, better than expected.  High quality , sturdy and pretty! Very happy with my purchased.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, quality could be better but for the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE OK, I BOUGHT 2 THEY ARE VERY SHORT FOR HAIR STICKS THEY ARE ALSO VERY TOP HEAVY YOU CAN NOT USE THEM TRADITIONALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ELASTIC IN TOUR HAIR TO ANCHOR THEM THROUGH, THEY CAN NOT JUST BE TWISTED UP AND HELD BY THEMSELVES LIKE OTHERS CAN I TOOK OF THE TASSEL PART TO PREVENT THEM FROM TANGLING IN MY THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT 2&#x27; LONGER ******************Seller give me a partial refund, I am not sure I would use them again, as they suppressed my seller review, claiming it was a product review but look at the seller reviews that they have listed, the majority are clearly product reviews.They did not like that I had given them 2 stars. but I am glad they did show some customer service, my seller review is gone and can&#x27;t be changed so I am reflecting the info here, I think it is shady to remove reviews to keep your ratings high, I had stated the following&lt;br /&gt; Your feedback comment:&lt;br /&gt;Not a described, not usable for what it is, but is lovely in other ways, I am using it still just not for what it was intended. the pakaging was sturdy and the item came quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to be honest and positive, please compare my review to those on the seller page mine is no different.</li>
    <li> Adorable! I bought this one and the same one with red.&lt;br /&gt;The decoration is pretty heavy. It holds my (fairly fine) hair in a twist, but if I want the top to stay higher than the bottom, I&#x27;ll pin the stick near the top. Without that, it sits horizontally in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hanging jewels swing and click when I move my head. I love it, but it could be distracting.&lt;br /&gt;Very pretty! Adds some unique pizazz to my work clothes.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece, nicely decorated.üòç</li>
    <li> Just received it, have not used it yet, but it is a beautiful deep purple.  I bought another one a different color and a stone came out the first day, I hope this doesn&#x27;t happen to this one</li>
    <li> This was everything I was looking for. I bought it for a friend because I had a limited budget and I liked what I had ordered before. I will say that you are getting what you pay for, the pin may bend depending on how thick your hair is, but it is easily bent back and not prone to breakage. The item itself is exquisite and stylish, and I would definitely recommend it</li>
