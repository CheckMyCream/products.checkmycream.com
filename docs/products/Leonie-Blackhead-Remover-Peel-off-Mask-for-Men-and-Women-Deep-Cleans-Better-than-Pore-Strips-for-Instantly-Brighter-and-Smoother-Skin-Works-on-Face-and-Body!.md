      <li>A great product.</li>
      <li>Skin looked amazing after!</li>
      <li>Okay product , will use until finished but will not buy again.</li>
      <li>This was something new I found by chance on Amazon that had good reviews.</li>
      <li>Gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>Afterwards it leave my face clean and oil free.</li>
      <li>So worth it!</li>
      <li>Have no choice to agree with all the positive selling points touted by this seller and the product.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than strips as you decide for yourself where the product is used and in what shape.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>This is a cool product.</li>
      <li>Scent is pretty strong and made my eyes tear up.</li>
      <li>The remnants do wipe off surprisingly easy with a damp cloth and it dries fast.</li>
      <li>It did remove some dry skin that was peeling, which is good.</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time and I  was amazed at how it really clings to your skin and lifts out the impurities and afterwards my face felt very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>skin is horrid, and after a few uses over a two week period my skin is the clearest and most healthy looking it has been since pre-puberty.</li>
      <li>This worked really well!</li>
      <li>It made a noticeable difference with the first use</li>
      <li>I shopped around for a long time looking for a strong pull off mask and finally found one I love.</li>
      <li>May help someone else, but don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really doing anything for me.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, definitely not for light complexions.</li>
      <li>Product didn&#x27;t really do what it said.</li>
      <li>I really like this mask.</li>
      <li>The mask really does peel off and it peels in one piece.</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>It does take off the layer of dead skin cells which is nice</li>
      <li>My son (13) has had a nose full of blackheads for the last year.</li>
      <li>It definitely grabs the fine hairs on your face and stings to pull it off, especially the first application.</li>
      <li>It not only keeps my skin clear and smooth, but I particularly love it for pulling dead and flaking skin off my face.</li>
      <li>We have tried EVERYTHING to clear his skin up.</li>
      <li>and I had no reaction even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I do see some old skin cells being taken from my skin after the peel</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft, too.</li>
      <li>I am not seeing the benefit, other than it looks neat on and fun to peel off.</li>
      <li>Only have to use it once a week, so I feel the tube will last a decent amount of time.</li>
      <li>It barely pulled anything out of my or my boyfriends skin.</li>
      <li>There is not a single blackhead left.  </li>

<li> I have only visibly noticed 2 blackheads removed as you would see on Biore strips, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any less on my face.</li>
<li> There was a slight tingly sensation that went away shortly.</li>
<li> The only thing that may take some getting used to is the pulling of your skin on your face when peeling off the mask and it dries on tight.</li>
<li> Certainly not at this price point.</li>
<li> I have used it 3 times and also using some other products.</li>
<li> but I notice the peel is not strong enough to pull black heads that a little bit ligger in circumference.</li>
<li> Do not buy this, dosent remove the black head .</li>
<li> but it was supposed to remove black heads</li>
<li> It dried and felt tight.</li>
<li> The black color sunk into my pores!</li>
<li> Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
<li> Peeling it off was not hard at all, and you felt it rip the nasty stuff from your pores (without damaging your skin of course).  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!</li>
<li> Horrible!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My son (13) has had a nose full of blackheads for the last year. We have tried EVERYTHING to clear his skin up. This was something new I found by chance on Amazon that had good reviews. We used a dime sized blob and 15 minutes later peeled it off. There is not a single blackhead left.  Amazing product!!!!! We will be stocking up.</li>
    <li> So worth it! My skin is so soft and it took the extra gunk out of my pores and it doesn&#x27;t smell icky at all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works so well!!!!!  I use after I wash my face but before I put on my moisturizers. There was a slight tingly sensation that went away shortly. It dried and felt tight. Peeling it off was not hard at all, and you felt it rip the nasty stuff from your pores (without damaging your skin of course).  I use a spin brush thing when I wash my face. I was impressed with the result of that and I won&#x27;t never use it. But this mask gets what the brush cant get and that is stuff deep inside your pores. I use it on my nose and chin (my problem spots), this made them even softer than the spin brush (and I didn&#x27;t think my skin could get any softer!)  Adding this to my skin care regime is the best thing ever!!!</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t really do what it said. It barely pulled anything out of my or my boyfriends skin. It does take off the layer of dead skin cells which is nice but it was supposed to remove black heads and it didn&#x27;t do that. Won&#x27;t be buying again. Certainly not at this price point.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! Hurt like hell trying to peel it off. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I am a male in his 20&#x27;s. I really like this mask. I shopped around for a long time looking for a strong pull off mask and finally found one I love. It not only keeps my skin clear and smooth, but I particularly love it for pulling dead and flaking skin off my face. Afterwards it leave my face clean and oil free. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have no choice to agree with all the positive selling points touted by this seller and the product.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than strips as you decide for yourself where the product is used and in what shape.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is horrid, and after a few uses over a two week period my skin is the clearest and most healthy looking it has been since pre-puberty.</li>
    <li> This really works. I use it on my nose and the pores get cleaned and shrink close. Leaves skin soft, too. Only have to use it once a week, so I feel the tube will last a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> Works great! Gentle but effective. It made a noticeable difference with the first use and I had no reaction even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A great product. It brightens my skin and removes a lot of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and plan to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is doing anything or not. I have used it 3 times and also using some other products. I have only visibly noticed 2 blackheads removed as you would see on Biore strips, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any less on my face. My kids think it looks neat on and like to watch me pull it off. It definitely grabs the fine hairs on your face and stings to pull it off, especially the first application. Scent is pretty strong and made my eyes tear up. Smells like a cross between Oxy face wipes and nail polish remover to me. It did remove some dry skin that was peeling, which is good. Not sure if I will buy again. I am not seeing the benefit, other than it looks neat on and fun to peel off. The remnants do wipe off surprisingly easy with a damp cloth and it dries fast. May help someone else, but don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really doing anything for me.</li>
    <li> Skin looked amazing after!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves loves loves it. loves the way it makes her skin feel as well</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, definitely not for light complexions. The black color sunk into my pores!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this, dosent remove the black head .</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time and I  was amazed at how it really clings to your skin and lifts out the impurities and afterwards my face felt very smooth and soft. The only thing that may take some getting used to is the pulling of your skin on your face when peeling off the mask and it dries on tight. Otherwise this product met my expectations</li>
    <li> This worked really well! My boyfriend and I have been using this whenever we needed to!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Best mask ever!</li>
    <li> This is a cool product. You use your fingers to cover &#x27;problem areas&#x27; or overall face. The mask really does peel off and it peels in one piece. I do see some old skin cells being taken from my skin after the peel but I notice the peel is not strong enough to pull black heads that a little bit ligger in circumference. I will try to thicken the mask in those areas.. Okay product , will use until finished but will not buy again.</li>
