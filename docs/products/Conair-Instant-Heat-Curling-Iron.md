<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> exactly what i had hoped it would be. i just love it.</li>
    <li> This works very well making the small &amp;#34;ringlets&amp;#34;. just 1/2&amp;#34; is perfect for long or shorter hair.</li>
    <li> We couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere. My wife just was not satisfied with other types of curling irons. You saved the day.</li>
    <li> A great hard-to-find instant heat 1/2 inch hair curling iron.</li>
    <li> have used this model for years - very well made, lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I had fot years like this and it finally gave out so I ordered another one I love this produCt</li>
    <li> Conair never lets me down with their products.  I like that I can change the settings and that it has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; setting.  I also like the 2 hour automatic shut off</li>
    <li> REALLY NICE AND FAST SERVICE</li>
    <li> Great variety of temperatures, heats up fast and a size that is hard to find.</li>
    <li> Works fine...so hard to find a small barrel hair curling iron.  This one heats up very quickly and does a good job.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for short hair</li>
    <li> Good curling iron for price, heats up fast.</li>
    <li> IT HEATS UP FAST. NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR. I WISH IT IS A BIT SHORTER (TRAVEL SIZE) SO I CAN FIT IT IN MY VERY MINIMAL LUGGAGE.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron, really fast to heat up and the thing I like the most is it has a swith to turn it on so that I can plug it in and then turn it on and off as I like.  The whole transaction of the purchase of this item was just perfect.  Quality, price and delivery were just great.</li>
    <li> Excellent curling iron!</li>
    <li> stopped working after a week, the customer service is horrible, the warrenty is for as year but you have to pay shipping.I will not recommend Conair products, nor will I purchase them again.You get a faulty product the company should replace at absolutely no cost</li>
    <li> nice for curls,short hair</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but the barrel of the curlers is longer than it appears in the photo and I like a shorter barrel.  The older models of this product came with a shorter barrel and I find it easier to use - my personal preference.</li>
    <li> Love this 1/2 curling iron. It&#x27;s just the right size. Thank you for having them in stock. They weren&#x27;t available locally.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old 1/2\\&quot; barrel curling iron, but stores only carry straighteners now.  Found what I needed - a replacement Conair product.  What I love most about this appliance is the ability to change the temperature on the barrel.  It has made all the difference in my ability to curl my hair and have it stay curled!  Thank you for a wonderful product!!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron. Others don&#x27;t match up. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well for very short hair. This was just what I was looking to for to use on my not so curly hair.</li>
    <li> Works great for short hair. Heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best 1/2 barrel curling iron I have ever found and cannot find it in stores.  I have curly hair and love to use this to help on days when some of the curls need a little more spring.  So, I bought two</li>
    <li> Needless to but I never was so happy to receive the curling iron - conair is the only iron I use , for my hair is short and the ceramic is not for me. my irons usually last about 10 years or more, so you can see why I keep coming back to Conair.  Thanks for your help.</li>
    <li> Pro-&lt;br /&gt;-Fast heating&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple heat seating&lt;br /&gt;-Durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con-&lt;br /&gt;-The inside spring rusted and broke after 4 years of usage.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my elderly mother&#x27;s thin, fine hair. It heats up in seconds with the turbo button and I like that I can control the heat since her hair has gotten so thin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a small curling iron for years.  I just curl the top and sides of my hair, it finally gave up the ghost.  I searched and found this one, it seems to be working just fine, but don&#x27;t like it quite as well as my old one.</li>
    <li> My mother likes her new curling iron- it&#x27;s the exact size she wanted and it curls her hair, the way she likes.</li>
    <li> Great iron for travel or use at home.  Traveled with no problems in Europe.</li>
    <li> The 1/2&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for styling short hair.  I also like the quick-heating features.  Small circumference curing irons are hard to find, and the fact that it was available so readily on Amazon was a major plus - no telephoning around or driving from place to place to determine it&#x27;s availability. Because of Amazon&#x27;s Prime Membership, it was delivered within 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I recieved this curling iron today and I got the 1/2&amp;#34; barrel. I am highly impressed. The cords don&#x27;t tangle as much as I thought they would and there is a soft, good grip for the handle bar. The clamp really holds the hair which is GOOD! It actually does heat up in 30 seconds. I put a picture of how I recieved the packaging. (Of course it came in a box.)</li>
    <li> Wow; this baby really DOES heat up instantly! I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; claim; I&#x27;ve never had a heating iron that didn&#x27;t take less than ten minutes to get hot before, and curling irons have always been so frustrating to heat that oftentimes, I&#x27;ve had to skip curling my hair because I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t have time to wait for them to get how enough to use. This thing gets so hot that I can even curl my hair when I&#x27;m in a major rush! Moreover, it gets SO hot that I can even set it to get hotter than I&#x27;d normally set a curling iron and simply curl for less time than I normally would. I recently cut all my long hair off so that I have less than two inches of hair now (long, sad story), and I just ZIP! ZIP! ZIP! with this iron, and I look awesome in about two minutes. And it&#x27;s so CHEAP! Holy mackerel, what a bargain! If technology keeps up at this pace, I expect that my next curling iron purchase, I&#x27;ll have a curling iron that gets how before I even turn it on!</li>
    <li> My curls come out so tiny, I love this curling iron. I have thick hair and it works with it very well.</li>
    <li> This Conair curling iron is the best.  I had one previously and could not find the Conair in the stores, only  on Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very nice when need one. The barrel is just a perfect size.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product because it took forever to heat up, and it is not ceramic so it burns your hair. I also didn&#x27;t like that it never really curled my hair, it just made simple ridges in my hair, in my opinion this product isn&#x27;t worth the 5 star rating. I would perfer you to but the Infinity Pro hair curler, I liked that one WAY better then this.</li>
    <li> Great iron! Heats up in a matter of seconds! I loooove it. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The only one I ever liked better is no longer available, this was an very good substitute and I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and very straight.  This curling iron is the only one which works on my hair and I was very excited to find it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.  I had not been able to find the 1/2-inch size in any store.  I was so glad to discover it was available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says. Heats up fast, very light-weight. Good cord coverage, and length. I will purchase another one of these, in a different size.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. I&#x27;m a hairdresser &amp; use it to &amp;#34;set my weekly &amp;#34; gals in tight lil curls! Love the fact that it automatically turns off when not in use and takes less than a minute to get hot. Don&#x27;t stop carrying these Irons please! I can&#x27;t find this size in stores. Thanks</li>
    <li> Have used this type of curling iron for ever and the barrel was always smooth....this barrel is ionized (sp) and the hair does not glide through the curling very well....disappointed.</li>
    <li> Yes, the curling iron has the correct diameter needed to curl short hair. The cord does not get tangled thanks to the special pivot device on the end of the curling iron. It also heats up quickly and stays on long enough to get the hair style I desire. I am very happy with the purchase of this model curling iron.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Used it for small curls for my daughters hair instead of rollers for her Irish dance competition.</li>
    <li> I already owned a 3/4&amp;#34; Conair curling iron but needed a smaller gauge one.  I read the reviews and was surprised by the negative ones.  The reviews don&#x27;t seem to distinguish among the different sizes, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with both mine.  No problem with the swivel feature.  Cord length is suitable if you have a wall electric outlet above the vanity or sink level;; probably not it you&#x27;re trying to use a low-down wall outlet.  The device may also not be suitable for thick hair as it may not heat the outer layers of hair sufficiently.  I have thin hair and it gives me great curl.</li>
    <li> I wanted a curling iron narrower than one inch.  This iron is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Heats fast and cools quickly and has a metal guard to hang on a&lt;br /&gt;hook or let the rod rest as on a saddle.  Good item.</li>
    <li> Exceeds my expectations for performance, and is priced right.</li>
    <li> Not good. Very disappointed, does not get hot enough to make a curl.</li>
    <li> Conair has always been a good product.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron because it does heat rapidly and it does the job quickly. Temperature changing ability is a great feature.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works so well and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. It&#x27;s almost identical to a similar one I&#x27;d had for a few years that suddenly stopped. It&#x27;s so hard to find this size but, once again, Amazon came through. Heats quickly, cord is a perfect length and doesn&#x27;t tangle. If you are looking for this size, don&#x27;t waste your time looking around. This is the one you want.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find this curling iron on Amazon. It is difficult to find this 1/2&amp;#34; rod. The reason I chose the Conair is that I read that it heats faster than others I have seen advertised. I love it!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time and it works great. I have very short hair and needed the 1/2 inch curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; my natural Curls. it really does heat up in 30 seconds!</li>
    <li> It was the size and had the features that we wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this curler at least 2-4 days a week and it works perfectly even if I hold the curl for 5 seconds. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I needed a 1/2 inch curling iron and this one works just fine for my needs.  I have one of the same model in the one inch and I liked it, so ordered the same model in the smaller size.  I like that it turns itself off after a certain period of time because I often forget to do so.  I also like that you can adjust the heat or strength of curl.  I have had many Conair products over the years and have been satisfied with all of them.</li>
    <li> There were no problems with this order</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my girlfriend, just what she expected and it gets HOT fast. Great size, wasn&#x27;t in any of the stores she looked at, only larger sizes.</li>
    <li> I love this little tiny curling iron for doing my daughters hair for her dance recitals. It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but it gets plenty hot and does the job well.</li>
    <li> I have ussed a lot of ccurling irons in in life and I believe this is the best one yet.  The curls are great and the best part is my hair does not stick to the iron at all.</li>
    <li> Spent 3 weeks in Italy on vacation. 17 different towns. Lots of different hotel configurations. This curling iron worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Great heat control, comfortable. Bought two sizes. Super happy.</li>
    <li> Was really happy to find this item online.  Was not available in stores.  Have a couple of other sizes of this product &amp; love them.</li>
    <li> Found this curling iron at a thrift store, it works super fast &amp; gets HOT!! Mine just went out, had to get another one!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second Conair curling iron I&#x27;ve bought .  My hair is short and does not hold the curl well, so I like the higher heat settings this curling iron has.  I don&#x27;t use it every day because with the 1/2&amp;#34; wand and the higher heat my hair will hold the curl for 2 days. I like the fact that the iron turns itself off after an hour as I don&#x27;t always remember to unplug it after every use.  A very fine product.</li>
    <li> works just great and would like to get another one to keep in my suitcase when we travel, so I wouldn&#x27;t forget it</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron for those of us with really short hair.  It really does get hot very quickly and stays hot pretty consistently.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find 1/2 inch curling irons in the stores, so I was thrilled to find one on Amazon.com  It works great!</li>
    <li> I need a small one like this, and they are difficult to find in local stores. Conair works well and I use them forever it seems, before needing a new one.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use this curling iron on my entire head, it comes in very handy when it come to those ends of hair that insist in sticking up here and there.  The temperature adjustment is a very nice feature.  I have purchased this item twice so far.</li>
    <li> i absoluately love this iron.  I already had a similar one in a large size which would not accommodate my thinning hair&#x27; my smaller iron did not have the turbo boost function and did not get hot enough.  This iron hit a home run for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great for short fine hair.  Long cord with stable rest.  Variety of temperature to choose from.  I love it.  Can be used in Europe without adapter.</li>
    <li> A good iron...works very well. Controls difficult to manage by a low vision person (wife) but once established no,need to change so is o.k.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great !  Takes care of all the shorter areas of my hair.  I love that it heats instantly and when I forget to turn it off,  it turns off by  itself.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly, does a great job on my short, thick, course hair.  I like that you can set the curler on different temperatures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no hairdresser but this managed to do the trick and create curls!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awesome....... I do sometimes hit the power button accidentally.....kind of in a bad spot....but other than that We love it!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is being used in a local beauty shop daily, its a good piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> Works fine and capable of making curls with my SHORT hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron! It heats up to a very hi heat so the curls last a long time.. i use this curling iron every other day! Curls stay until i wash my hair!</li>
    <li> great product! still works after all this time!</li>
    <li> Wife found that usual curling irons accumulate hair sparay on the tube but the ceramic iron does not.  This works great, stays clean and is small enough for travel.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these curling irons before and really liked it. It is hard to find this 1/2 inch curling iron in any store so I went to the internet.  It&#x27;s a good solid product, heat level can be controlled, and it fits in your hand for convenient operation. Will buy same one again if I need to.</li>
    <li> Its replacing my other Conair I love this curling iron</li>
    <li> This came quick and packaged just like I bought it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything seems fine with it and I like that it has the turbo heat button. Great curling iron for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister.  I have one -- in fact, I have 3 (this one, plus another size and a brush-type).  This brand is so great because it heats up quickly and saves me a LOT of time in fixing my hair.</li>
    <li> I like the temperature control on the heat setting, and auto shutoff safety feature.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would improve about this reasonably priced curling iron is the Heat Setting Numbers.  After a period of use (a few months) the little white numbers simply wear off.  That&#x27;s not a good thing for multiple users of the same iron.</li>
    <li> had my first one for years, repeat buy</li>
    <li> does the job, turns off when it gets too hot or when its been on too long (which is good because i have a bad habit of walking away and forgetting things like this) a+</li>
    <li> This is a nice and inexpensive curling iron.  There is nothing fancy about it.  I use it to make spiral curls.</li>
    <li> Could&#x27;ve bought one for the same price locally.</li>
    <li> It has the option so you can choose the heat setting accordingly to how easy your hair curls, which I found handy. It only takes 30 seconds to heat up, unlike other curling irons and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
    <li> The wife likes it and if she is happy, I am happy. What else can you say about a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This curling iron that i have purchase from amazon was the best curling iron I have ever owned...I really loved it.</li>
    <li> I have several of the Conair Instant Heat Curling Irons and have used them for many years.  They work great and last a long time.</li>
    <li> A replacement for my wife&#x27;s worn out Iron.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> wish i got a ceramic so it doesnt mistreat my hair. have to be extra careful... you can easily burn yourself.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair curling iron. I bought this one because I already have one in another size and just love it. It is reasonably priced, has adjustable heat and heats up quickly. It has auto-shut off after 20 minutes or so which is great because it does turn off if I forget it, but not so quickly that it shuts off before I want it to. I highly recommend these curling irons.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of curling iron for many years.This is a great iron heats up fast,works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is working very well.  I have another one by Conair that died in a suitcase during a trip, and I really liked it, so I wanted to replace it with another one made by the same company.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I have very fine, very short hair that has never been able to hold a curl. Not only is the barrel small enough to curl my ultra short pixie, the curls last all day! The best I&#x27;ve gotten before is a few hours. It does heat up quickly, which is great because I&#x27;m not one for spending a huge amount of time on my hair. I would buy this again - in fact I&#x27;m considering buying another for my mom!</li>
    <li> I purchased this same curling iron previously at Target and I have trouble getting it to work.  Seems like there is a short in the connection.  But, this one that I bought through Amazon is great.  Works perfectly.  I am sorry I didn&#x27;t return the first one to Target.</li>
    <li> Great price, heats up quickly and curls quickly.  I use mine on the high setting and it hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair, but I also don&#x27;t hold the curler against my hair long.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Easy to use and just right to style my Mom&#x27;s short hairstyle. Great to have all those heat settings.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best one I&#x27;ve ever found!  I hope they never discontinue it!  The auto shut off feature helps to keep my sanity as I hurry to leave for work in the AM.  It has so many levels of temperature and you can use the green light to \\&quot;up\\&quot; the heat and get the best results!</li>
    <li> I got this because I do not like big curls just wanted something to curl the hair by my face when I have it up, it worked for exactly what I wanted. Gets hotter than expected but then again duh, its supposed to be hot.</li>
    <li> prompt delivery. will buy again</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size. I love always being able to find whatever I need at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! This curling iron heats fast, it was a great price, and I received it within days</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years. Always dependable. Heats accurately according to number selected. It lasts forever and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Adjustable temp, including up to Very hot, works great. Last iron I had didn&#x27;t get hot enough for my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> The wife was happy with it</li>
    <li> quick and easy to use.  Like the adjustable temp setting...so I don&#x27;t fry my hair too badly.  only wish I could find this in a butane model...I still don&#x27;t like the cords on curling irons-even though it swivels..otherwise 5 stars...and great buy.</li>
    <li> Super curling iron!  Great service from supplier.</li>
    <li> Great service.  The best iron for difficult, straight hair.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ! I have had this curling iron forever and was crushed one day when it would not heat up. Ordered another one from Amazon and the old one started again. Glad I have backup now !</li>
    <li> Ine of the best curling irons I have ever had. I like the fact that I can adjust its temperature. This makes curling much faster.</li>
    <li> one of my daughters hair won&#x27;t hold a curl with hot sticks but we want a tight curl so this was the perfect sized iron, and it gets hot very quickly.  And her hair will hold a tight curl with it.</li>
    <li> I like that this curling iron heats so quickly.  The 1/2inch size is just right for my shorter hair style.</li>
    <li> Good buy.  It heats up very quickly and has many settings for heat.  It is everything I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> I like the temperature controls to adjust for different hair types.  Warms up really fast. It&#x27;s easy to style with.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find a curling iron with such a small diameter. Only buy this if you want tiny tight spiral curls. This one heats up instantly. It holds the hair firmly. I like that the dial heat setting goes from 1 to 25 as my thick hair requires the 25 setting.</li>
    <li> The iron heats up quickly and seems to be good quality.  The buttons are well built, easy to understand and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any curling iron, it does take quite a while to cool down, which is frustrating, but true with any product like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is probably about 6 feet, which is a nice length to work with.  The cord is a little stiff, so it has curled a little too much now that it has been stretched a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Curling hair. It worked as I thought it would.  No problem, it worked just fine.  I don&#x27;t know what else you need to know.</li>
    <li> I looked in the stores for this sized curling iron and was unable to find it.  Just what I need for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron. It heats ups quickly and curls your hair in just a few seconds. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Gets hot almost immediately; Nice curls;&lt;br /&gt;con: Creaks when you open the clip;</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Not the size I expected</li>
