      <li>Very nice tweezers.</li>
      <li>I am really glad I did because I am very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>The cushioned grip is great - it makes them super comfortable and also ensures that they are best positioned in your hand to get the tweezers at the perfect angle for hair</li>
      <li>good quality</li>
      <li>These tweezers are superior to others I have used.</li>
      <li>Excellent tweezers, as others have stated, easy to use, great grip and can take out more than one hair at a time.</li>
      <li>work fine, great grasp, good precision, good price.</li>
      <li>I am also very pleased with Coco&#x27;s Closet&#x27;s customer service.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
      <li>These tweezers are amazing.</li>
      <li>nice product.</li>
      <li>They voluntarily insisted on sending me a new pair, and they are superb!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it, it&#x27;s comfortable and does what it&#x27;s supposed to lol.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend these tweezers!</li>
      <li>They have a non-slip grip which is very important to me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with them.</li>
      <li>I did suggest to Coco&#x27;s Closet that they look into a more protective packaging for the tweezers to prevent this from happening to someone else.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the tweezers.  </li>
      <li>But you would think that most tweezers do just that.</li>
      <li>Makes it feel much better on my hands.</li>
      <li>the larger no slip grip is awesome.</li>
      <li>I am used to tweezers with more tension</li>
      <li>I love these tweezers.</li>
      <li>they are my favorite tweezers.</li>
      <li>I do not care for these tweezers as they might help my arthritic hand grasp the tweezer better, but if they were smoother on the tip, it would be much better.  </li>
      <li>so I can hold them better</li>
      <li>so well that I immediately ordered two more.</li>
      <li>They are so finely and correctly filed and aligned that they grip even very fine hair.</li>
      <li>And this is the most important feature for any tweezer.</li>
      <li>Looks like well made but very pointed  edge and does not grab  good on thinner hair</li>
      <li>Love these, a bit pricey, but their exactness makes it worth it!</li>
      <li>These are super easy for me to use with my elbows to pluck my eyebrows since I don&#x27;t have hands!</li>
      <li>It makes them so easy to hold and use.</li>
      <li>This is an exceptionally easy five star product.</li>
      <li>They are really easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>They are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used!</li>
      <li>I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice pair of tweezers at a decent price!</li>
      <li>The problem is, nearly every tweezer I have bought only worked marginally well at best, and most didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>They fit comfortably in my hand.</li>
      <li>Most of the tweezers I have are have finer needle like tips which are good for targeting individual hairs, but not so great for removing multiple hairs from an area at once.  </li>
      <li>it is just a problem I have with my right hand; so I&#x27;m sure it would not be a problem for others who do not have arthritis or carpal tunnel issues in their hands.</li>
      <li>Not only does this set of tweezers work, they work remarkably well.</li>
      <li>the unique design makes it easier to grip the tweezers in my hand as well.</li>
      <li>These are user friendly.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for small hairs ...</li>
      <li>These are perfect for the multiple hair tasks - when you need to quickly clear an area that has been neglected or just clean up the super fine hairs that I seem to always get between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Tweezers are an essential tool in our house and it seems like I can never find a pair when I need them the most, so I was excited to have a chance to order these through a promotion in order to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
      <li>, the reviews are true.</li>
      <li>so I was able to get my favorite (blue).</li>
      <li>Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve found good tweezers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for good tweezers for a long time and tried almost every brand.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
      <li>Some tweezers either don&#x27;t have the right slanted angle....</li>
      <li>Great for getting the little buggers too!</li>
      <li>The larger grip makes it easier to handle and they have sharp ends that close perfectly to get the hair our the first time.</li>
      <li>I have carpal tunnel problems in my right hand; so I have bought several tweezers to see if I could use them better than what I have.  </li>
      <li>Nice tweezer but feels loose.</li>
      <li>There is no question but that they are the best pair I&#x27;ve ever used, and they even outperform the pair from Germany that I bought a few years ago (although marginally so; those are also very good tweezers, but they are impossible to find).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>or they slip on the tiny fine hairs and can&#x27;t get a grip!</li>
      <li>And I love that they come in different colors</li>
      <li>They do exactly what they are supposed to do: tweeze.</li>
      <li>and I really lucked out this time!</li>
      <li>The rubberized insert, while not necessary, does help with comfortably gripping the tweezers, and also help aid precision tweezing.</li>
      <li>These came super sharp and able to grab hairs that a drug store tweezers couldn&#x27;t touch.  </li>
      <li>Due to this, I need a great pair of tweezers for my daily pluck.</li>
      <li>I have to usually buy 3 pairs before I get a good one</li>
      <li>My tweezers were shipped with a four-pound canister of popcorn in a large box with no cushioning so they were slammed repeatedly in transit, and their precision suffered.  </li>
      <li>I love the sparkly blue finish - they&#x27;re by far the prettiest tweezers that I have owned!  </li>
      <li>A huge plus is the spot in the middle that your fingers grip.</li>
      <li>These tweezers work really well and</li>
      <li>But they really don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>works very well.i recommend</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t just the fact that the sharp edges keep a grip on the hairs that makes them my favorite.</li>
      <li>these ones do the job right with no slipping.</li>
      <li>(I have a little bit of hair above the eyebrow that, if I don&#x27;t tweeze it, I begin to look like Crusty the Clown, and, like most men,</li>
      <li>Not bad, just odd.</li>
      <li>Because it was difficult to see exactly where the root of the hair was, with these I was able to just target the general area where I could feel the hair was growing</li>
      <li>These tweezers are slightly larger than ones I normally use so I was hesitant to try them</li>
      <li>also love that the wide surface makes it possible to get those really stubborn, hard to pinpoint hairs!  </li>
      <li>If I am not very careful, I will end up pinching my skin, causing it to bleed.  </li>

    <li> Tweezers are an essential tool in our house and it seems like I can never find a pair when I need them the most, so I was excited to have a chance to order these through a promotion in order to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.  I had a hard time choosing which of the pretty color and pattern options to choose and ended up deciding on the blue ones.  I love the sparkly blue finish - they&#x27;re by far the prettiest tweezers that I have owned!  The cushioned grip is great - it makes them super comfortable and also ensures that they are best positioned in your hand to get the tweezers at the perfect angle for hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the wide angled tweezing surface.  Most of the tweezers I have are have finer needle like tips which are good for targeting individual hairs, but not so great for removing multiple hairs from an area at once.  These are perfect for the multiple hair tasks - when you need to quickly clear an area that has been neglected or just clean up the super fine hairs that I seem to always get between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the wide surface makes it possible to get those really stubborn, hard to pinpoint hairs!  I had a single hair growing on the underside of my chin that was driving me crazy - I could feel it every time I happened to run my hand over that area, but had been trying and trying with no luck with my other tweezers to get it.  Every time I tried, I just came up with an empty tweezer grip.  I tried these tweezers and voila, within less than 5 seconds that pesky hair was gone!  Because it was difficult to see exactly where the root of the hair was, with these I was able to just target the general area where I could feel the hair was growing and it then did the job perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers!! I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice pair of tweezers at a decent price!</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers, as others have stated, easy to use, great grip and can take out more than one hair at a time. Very good quality and best&lt;br /&gt;tweezers that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve found good tweezers. Love these, a bit pricey, but their exactness makes it worth it! Great for getting the little buggers too!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing. They do exactly what they are supposed to do: tweeze. But you would think that most tweezers do just that. But they really don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been buying tweezers of all types for years and years, all different brands, different styles. (I have a little bit of hair above the eyebrow that, if I don&#x27;t tweeze it, I begin to look like Crusty the Clown, and, like most men, have ear hairs that, if they are not attended to, over time begin to look like tree limbs growing out vertically.) The problem is, nearly every tweezer I have bought only worked marginally well at best, and most didn&#x27;t work at all. So, I purchased these with a well honed skepticism, but it was hard to deny what I was reading on the reviews. So, I purchased one, and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the reviews are true. Not only does this set of tweezers work, they work remarkably well. They are so finely and correctly filed and aligned that they grip even very fine hair. And this is the most important feature for any tweezer. The rubberized insert, while not necessary, does help with comfortably gripping the tweezers, and also help aid precision tweezing. There is no question but that they are the best pair I&#x27;ve ever used, and they even outperform the pair from Germany that I bought a few years ago (although marginally so; those are also very good tweezers, but they are impossible to find).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work so well that I immediately ordered two more. THANK YOU for someone FINALLY making a pair of tweezers that work! And the price isn&#x27;t bad, either. This is an exceptionally easy five star product.</li>
    <li> Poor quality :( Scrached my face &amp; didn&#x27;t grab hairs at the root, just broke them off. I called because they asked you to before writing a bad review; but I still had to pay for return shipping. I should have listened to some of the other bad reviews before wasting my money.</li>
    <li> They get the job done.  Perfect for small hairs ...</li>
    <li> I may have ordered the wrong item, BUT I don&#x27;t ever use a slanted tip tweezer.  It was awful, hard to hold and squeeze, and it had to be&lt;br /&gt;used several times on one hair in order to get a grip.  Its too much trouble to send back so I gave it away.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for good tweezers for a long time and tried almost every brand.&lt;br /&gt;These work fine, great grasp, good precision, good price.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Size is great, the grip is very nice, didn&#x27;t even know I needed or wanted it, but now I won&#x27;t have tweezers without grips.  These are user friendly.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers.  One of the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> awesome for the uncoordinated</li>
    <li> Nice tweezer but feels loose. By loose, I mean it doesn&#x27;t take much force to press the tweezer closed. I am used to tweezers with more tension so it feels a little odd to me. Not bad, just odd. However, if you have arthritis or other hand pain, you might appreciate the &amp;#34;loose-ness&amp;#34; of this tweezer.</li>
    <li> These are super easy for me to use with my elbows to pluck my eyebrows since I don&#x27;t have hands! I strongly recommend these tweezers! They grip hairs perfectly! I have to usually buy 3 pairs before I get a good one and I really lucked out this time!</li>
    <li> works very well.i recommend</li>
    <li> I usually prefer a narrower, sharper slant tweezer but those were costing me $30, so I thought I would give these a try. I am really glad I did because I am very happy with them.  I am also very pleased with Coco&#x27;s Closet&#x27;s customer service. My tweezers were shipped with a four-pound canister of popcorn in a large box with no cushioning so they were slammed repeatedly in transit, and their precision suffered.  I figured I had learned a lesson (duh!) not to place orders for incompatible items on the same day.  I did suggest to Coco&#x27;s Closet that they look into a more protective packaging for the tweezers to prevent this from happening to someone else.  They voluntarily insisted on sending me a new pair, and they are superb!</li>
    <li> Looks like well made but very pointed  edge and does not grab  good on thinner hair</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the tweezers.  They have a non-slip grip which is very important to me.  I have no problem finding tweezing the unwanted hairs.  My only suggestion would be to make them a bit less sharp.  Once or twice, I pulled off a bit of skin as well as the hair.  Over all I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> These are great. A huge plus is the spot in the middle that your fingers grip. Makes it feel much better on my hands.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are slightly larger than ones I normally use so I was hesitant to try them but I&#x27;m so glad I did! These tweezers work really well and the larger no slip grip is awesome. It makes them so easy to hold and use. And I love that they come in different colors so I was able to get my favorite (blue).</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers. Sadly, I am a woman who has to deal with a lot of unwanted facial hair.  Due to this, I need a great pair of tweezers for my daily pluck. These came super sharp and able to grab hairs that a drug store tweezers couldn&#x27;t touch.  My only drawback is that I have only owned them a couple months and they already seem to be losing some of their edge. That being said they are still miles above your average tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have carpal tunnel problems in my right hand; so I have bought several tweezers to see if I could use them better than what I have.  The problem I have with this tweezer is that the tip is rough like the others I have purchased.  If I am not very careful, I will end up pinching my skin, causing it to bleed.  I do not care for these tweezers as they might help my arthritic hand grasp the tweezer better, but if they were smoother on the tip, it would be much better.  I am still on a search for a pair that is larger so I can hold them better but ones that do not cause bleeding...it is just a problem I have with my right hand; so I&#x27;m sure it would not be a problem for others who do not have arthritis or carpal tunnel issues in their hands.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are very good.  They fit comfortably in my hand.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are superior to others I have used. Some tweezers either don&#x27;t have the right slanted angle....or they slip on the tiny fine hairs and can&#x27;t get a grip! these ones do the job right with no slipping. they are my favorite tweezers. It isn&#x27;t just the fact that the sharp edges keep a grip on the hairs that makes them my favorite. the unique design makes it easier to grip the tweezers in my hand as well.</li>

    <li> nice product. good quality</li>
    <li> Very nice tweezers. The larger grip makes it easier to handle and they have sharp ends that close perfectly to get the hair our the first time. Well made. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  They are really easy to hold.  They are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used!</li>
    <li> They are alright. They are really sharp and scratch/pinch my skin which I do not like. I do like the grips though.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, it&#x27;s comfortable and does what it&#x27;s supposed to lol.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purche.  Good price, excellent quality and design.</li>
