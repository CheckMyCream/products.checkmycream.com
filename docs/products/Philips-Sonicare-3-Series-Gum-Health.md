      <li>...of all the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes I have bought, this is my favorite!</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This model touts 31,000 strokes a minute and has a slim grip handle that works for almost anyone, which is nice for both kids and adults.</li>
      <li>It could benefit from its own button rather than sharing the power button.  </li>
      <li>Nice feature.</li>
      <li>kind of grungy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It arrived in lightening-fast time and was very easy for my 90-year-old mom to set up and use.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel very clean and smooth when I am done brushing, and I think it is doing a great job.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel very clean and smooth when I am done brushing, and I think it is doing a great job.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, a great value and excellent product.</li>
      <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the water retention/mildew problems of the old design.</li>
      <li>those toothbrushes aren&#x27;t really that great, built more around marketing a toy/brand than making an actually good toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Does a nice job, teeth and mouth feel very clean and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>Handle very comfortable and like the levels of brushing strength.</li>
      <li>toothbrush is really easy to use, which can be nice in a time when some toothbrushes literally come with things like applications to help you brush.</li>
      <li>I wish this feature could be turned off, but I do end up more awake after using it....</li>
      <li>am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I used to use a Oral B electric and this one is leaps and bounds better.</li>
      <li>This one is okay.</li>
      <li>After my dental hygienist insisted I take better care of myself</li>
      <li>It sells around here for $30 - $50 more than I paid.</li>
      <li>and it is better at plaque removal etc etc.</li>
      <li>That is not something you can say about many companies, and the experience has always stood out in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can tell with the Sonicare I am doing a much better job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Prior to using Sonicare I had used Oral-B power toothbrushes for 15 years or more.  </li>
      <li>Would return if I could for sonicare&#x27;s better model</li>
      <li>Love the Sonicare 3 series.  </li>
      <li>and the timer helps control brushing time, which is so helpful for college students( like me) and people with a rush morning routine since it can effective clean teeth in 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you charge your brush in advance so that you can enjoy brushing your teeth whenever you want.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a very distinct difference between the &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; technology used in this brand of toothbrush versus the &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; sort of feeling from many powered/mechanical toothbrushes</li>
      <li>Basically the rep doesn&#x27;t care if you bougt a sonicare that has a huge gap and makes a lot of noise.</li>
      <li>This rechargeable toothbrush delivers a light, comfortable brushing experience but seems to get the job</li>
      <li>enjoy this tooth brush.</li>
      <li>Great toothbrush overall.</li>
      <li>It has my favorte feature, the 30 second time for each quadrant of your mouth, plus it has a great &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; mode that baby steps one into using a Sonicare brush.</li>
      <li>It just feels and sounds cheap.  </li>
      <li>is a nice light but powerful toothbrush that really helps to make it easy to clean your gum line.</li>
      <li>The time needed to clean my wisdom teeth is shortened significantly and I have&#x27;t got anything stuck between my teeth for days.</li>
      <li>and couldn&#x27;t be kept clean.  </li>
      <li>I find that without this feature I don&#x27;t spend even amounts of time, and so some areas aren&#x27;t as clean as they should be.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I teeth feel clean and polished.</li>
      <li>My teeth felt so clean.</li>
      <li>Dental hygienist noticed I was not doing a good job cleaning the left side.  </li>
      <li>I also love the three strength mode since I can choose how much cleaning I want according to my need.</li>
      <li>We got this Sonicare for our almost 8 year old boy, who has loved automatic toothbrushes ever since he got his first Thomas the Train one 3-4 years ago.</li>
      <li>I also got one for my hubby and we both love our new Sonicare toothbrush!  </li>
      <li>What we discovered quickly is that a) kids outgrow those phases quickly</li>
      <li>the rep said that it is designed to have that gap and is really noisier because it has a more powerful motor for plaque removal.</li>
      <li>Last more then 3 weeks before I have to recharge!</li>
      <li>wife bought the Healthy White Series 5 and it sounds fine.</li>
      <li>unless you have a special situation for which you need the higher end sonicares,  check out the 3 Series.  .</li>
      <li>I already own a Sonicare 2 Series Plaque Control brush, so in this review I will compare the &#x27;3 Series Gum Health&#x27; (this brush) with it, and also compare it with the Oral-B power toothbrushes I used for 15 years prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Actually fun to use, with features</li>
      <li>This is a useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;Level</li>
      <li>This does a much better job than the old one.</li>
      <li>This is our second one - teeth feel very clean!  </li>
      <li>The head is small and therefore it can easily reach my wisdom teeth without any fuss, the vibrations seem to be doing a good job of getting in between my teeth</li>
      <li>Luckily it started gently at first and then ramped up the intensity over time.  </li>
      <li>Original purchase was very noisy.  </li>
      <li>Not even a slight positive thing to say like, hey customer don&#x27;t worry about that gap thing because that is great toothbrush</li>
      <li>Oh oh, ...that&#x27;s right</li>
      <li>I absolutely love his product and will never go back to the old style, let alone brushing manually; it is just so much more efficient.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable on the teeth and gums; I appreciate the Quadpacer option (beeps every 30 seconds to denote switching to a different region to brush) -</li>
      <li>Most importantly, these clean just as well as more expensive types of toothbrushes, which is my one imperative buying</li>
      <li>This model claims to be 3x or 6x higher speed and</li>
      <li>The Sonicare solved this problem within the first week.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my boyfriend because he likes using my sonicare healthy white.</li>
      <li>I had the Sonicare Series E prior and like this one even more.</li>
      <li>and I love the feature that the tooth brush turn off after a period of time telling you that you have done enough brushing.</li>
      <li>First one lasted about 3.5 years.  </li>
      <li>The Sonicare solved this problem within the first week.  </li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re patient and willing to adapt, you may be rewarded with some of the benefits I&#x27;ve noted above.nd the chief reason I switched from Oral-B to Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>Someone asked this in the Q&amp;A section, so I guess this problem was consistent.</li>
      <li>I could tell the difference immediately when I first used it.</li>

    <li> This rechargeable toothbrush delivers a light, comfortable brushing experience but seems to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice light but powerful toothbrush that really helps to make it easy to clean your gum line.</li>
    <li> Great electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> Dental hygienist noticed I was not doing a good job cleaning the left side.  Apparently, I got a little lazy in my manual brushing.  I can tell with the Sonicare I am doing a much better job.</li>
    <li> Could not believe the difference in the way my teeth felt after brushing.  A great way to take care of your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have now tried quite a few electric toothbrushes and I must say this is the best. The head is small and therefore it can easily reach my wisdom teeth without any fuss, the vibrations seem to be doing a good job of getting in between my teeth and I love the feature that the tooth brush turn off after a period of time telling you that you have done enough brushing. I would, however, say that the three speed settings are gimmicky, I can&#x27;t really work out when I will need to change the speed, as such the older version of this toothbrush I imagine will do the trick just as well, but may not cost you as much.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I get this. I am pleasantly surprised how much I like it. My teeth never felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  I had been using a simple spin brush but this makes my teeth feel much cleaner.  Looking forward to my next dental appointment!</li>
    <li> Original purchase was very noisy.  Returned to Philips for a replacement.  Bad news is that replacement is just as noisy.  Sounds like it is slowly destroying itself.  Hope I am wrong.  The unit does a good job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought this toothbrush for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift. It arrived in lightening-fast time and was very easy for my 90-year-old mom to set up and use. We are very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older model that I had just worn out.  This model claims to be 3x or 6x higher speed and honestly, I really noticed the difference.  Though my old brush was, well, old this one&#x27;s battery lasts a long time between charges and my teeth come out feeling polished not just brushed.  I especially like the built in timer:  Like other models, this one gives you a signal to move from one quarter to the next while brushing.  This way you tend not to take short cuts and you spend time on each and every one of your teeth.  And don&#x27;t forgot those guys way in the back!  (If you do they will angrily let you know they&#x27;ve been neglected after a while.)</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because I stuck with an Oral B Vitality toothbrush way too long but I think this one is great. Very comfortable on the teeth and gums; I appreciate the Quadpacer option (beeps every 30 seconds to denote switching to a different region to brush) - I feel like I&#x27;m doing a much better job in terms of brushing long enough and focusing properly on all areas. Holds an excellent charge, so you can take it on a trip (includes travel case) and leave the charger home (I got four days on a trip &amp; didn&#x27;t notice any dwindling in the charge). There&#x27;s a very distinct difference between the &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; technology used in this brand of toothbrush versus the &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; sort of feeling from many powered/mechanical toothbrushes (I again reference my previous Oral B, which felt like a sander by comparison): this allows for a high degree of comfort when brushing. I debated between this one and a HealthyWhite: ultimately chose this b/c of the sensitivity settings that I can adjust on it. I have very sensitive gums so I keep on the lowest setting: still scrubs my teeth very well without beating up my gums.</li>
    <li> After my dental hygienist insisted I take better care of myself I found this on lightning deals. It sells around here for $30 - $50 more than I paid. Actually fun to use, with features like 30 second &amp;#34;warnings&amp;#34; and a travel case. After initial charging it retains it&#x27;s charge more than four weeks later. I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Love Sonicare toothbrushes!  This is our second one - teeth feel very clean!  Bought the Oral B version and returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> Previously had a series E, and found the handle more comfortable (larger / easier to grip). I would purchase a Sonicare toothbrush any time. I teeth feel clean and polished. The only reason I did not purchase a series E style is its lack of quad timer.</li>
    <li> I replaced an ancient (and dead) Philips Sonicare with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a all the features you need.  (I never used the bells and whistle the more expensive versions use.)</li>
    <li> I think it brushes well! For the longest time I have been using Oral B and I decided to try Sonic. I gave it a one star for the fact the once you take it out of your mouth without turning it off, let&#x27;s say to change position or stroke of rinse.....it splashes everywhere....sorry for the description but it&#x27;s the truth. So it is kind of yucky! Don&#x27;t know if I can return it after being used a couple if times....might just have to toss it! It&#x27;s irritating!</li>
    <li> I bought this at the request of my dental hygientist. I have been using it about a month. I use it three times a week as recommended. You don&#x27;t need the bells and whistles of the high end models. The two minute smart timer feature with quad timer buzzes each 30 seconds to tell you to brush a different quadrant of your mouth. Nice feature. Unit comes with only one toothbrush. The replacement toothbrushes from Sonicare are expensive. I&#x27;ll be interested to see what my next dental exam shows. zoz</li>
    <li> makes too much noise not as good as my previous model HX6921/30 flex care plus. Would return if I could for sonicare&#x27;s better model</li>
    <li> I already own a Sonicare 2 Series Plaque Control brush, so in this review I will compare the &#x27;3 Series Gum Health&#x27; (this brush) with it, and also compare it with the Oral-B power toothbrushes I used for 15 years prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a comparison amongst some of the current Philips Sonicare brush models:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 1: Philips Sonicare 2 Series Plaque Control (BASIC) - It cleans and tells you when 2 minutes are done, and that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;Level 2 (This Brush): Philips Sonicare 3 Series Gum Health - All Philips Sonicare brushes are \\&quot;Gum Health\\&quot; and this one doesn&#x27;t do anything that promotes gum health that the other models aren&#x27;t doing.  This model is like the Level 1 Basic brush, but adds a nice travel case, it allows you to adjust the intensity, and it has Quadpacer technology which guides you through equal 30 second periods for each quadrant of your mouth.  This is a useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;Level 3A: Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite - Builds on the Level 2 brush by adding a Whitening Mode and Sensitive Mode, but you lose the ability to control the intensity if that&#x27;s important to you.&lt;br /&gt;Level 3B: Philips Sonicare FlexCare Platinum - Builds on the Level 2 brush by adding a Gum Care Mode and Whitening Mode.&lt;br /&gt;Level 4: Philips Sonicare DiamondClean - Has all of the features except for the ability to control the intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the biggest difference between the basic Sonicare 2 Plaque Control brush and this one is the ability to control intensity, the Quadpacer technology, and a travel case.  If you travel, the travel case is very useful because it protects the brush, keeps your brush head from coming into contact with other items in your travel kit, and it keeps the brush from accidentally turning on and draining.  Nothing worse than getting to your destination and having no charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quadpacer feature is the most useful added feature in my opinion, because it breaks down the two minute brush cycle into 30 second intervals so you know how much time to spend on each part of your mouth.  I find that without this feature I don&#x27;t spend even amounts of time, and so some areas aren&#x27;t as clean as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intensity control is a nice idea for people with a sensitive mouth to &#x27;dial down&#x27; the strength of the brush.  It could benefit from its own button rather than sharing the power button.  When you turn on the power button, the brush starts at whatever intensity level was last used.  But if you hit the power button again while you are brushing, it changes the intensity level, rather than pause the brush cycle.  The power button steps through the cycle like this.  Touch #1 &#x3D; On, Touch #2 &#x3D; one level stronger unless you are already at level 3 then it goes back to level 1, Touch #2 &#x3D; one level stronger, Touch #3 &#x3D; one level stronger, etc.  You have to keep pressing it until it gets back to level 3, then one more touch allows you to pause your brush cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, given how long these brushes last, to me it is worth the premium to go ahead and get this brush instead of the basic model.  It only ends up costing you about $5 a year more to get the travel case and Quadpacer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, some notes on Sonicare vs. Oral-B:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using Sonicare I had used Oral-B power toothbrushes for 15 years or more.  I figured Sonicare and Oral-B were probably about the same, just different manufacturers.  Boy was I wrong.  The Sonicare uses a totally different method to clean teeth.  Instead of long gentle circular strokes, it is a very intense vibration that sounds like you have angry bees in your mouth.  I didn&#x27;t know if I would like it at first.  Truthfully, it made my lips numb at times.  Luckily it started gently at first and then ramped up the intensity over time.  After only a month of using Sonicare, I had no visible plaque, and my gums that were normally red in spots were instead a very healthy light pink.  That was a problem I struggled with for a long time, and the chief reason I switched from Oral-B to Sonicare.  The Sonicare solved this problem within the first week.  My teeth feel very clean and smooth when I am done brushing, and I think it is doing a great job.  My dental hygienist has noticed the difference too, especially in my gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare brush itself takes some getting used to, especially if you come from the Oral-B world.  The brush head is a different shape (not round), the vibration is different, and the ergonomics of the handle are slightly different.  In my honest opinion Sonicare is not quite as good as the Oral-B ergonomically because it has a straight, hard, smooth body instead of an angled body with soft rubber grips on the front and back.  This brush is downright slippery, and I find I have to keep my wrist at a really tough angle to reach various parts of my mouth.  But if you&#x27;re patient and willing to adapt, you may be rewarded with some of the benefits I&#x27;ve noted above.nd the chief reason I switched from Oral-B to Sonicare.

    <li> I got this for my boyfriend because he likes using my sonicare healthy white. This one is okay. The vibrations are a little louder, and the toothbrush is harder to hold. Considering this one is half the price, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> My best toothbrush ever! I also got one for my hubby and we both love our new Sonicare toothbrush!  I personally feel that my teeth are a lot cleaner and shinier now. Safe to use on my veneers too, which was my initial concern prior to purchasing. I agree with the other reviewers that this toothbrush is noisy. It is, especially Intensity 3. Pricey for a toothbrush but definitely a great investment.</li>
    <li> So far, it is working very, very well.  I have no reason to change the batteries.  Oh oh, ...that&#x27;s right, it does not work with batteries!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints... It like having the dentist doing the cleaning everyday...  Maybe, just maybe I could miss my six-month checkup.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied.  Thank you.  Avis</li>
    <li> Phillips is a brand I immediately recognize for reliability, and it is the one my wife swears by. The Sonicare series itself has been a mainstay within our home for the past couple of years now, both because they work and because they have some affordable models compared to other brands.  We began using these while trying to instill better dental hygiene practices within every member of the household and having a dentist recommend not only electric but a Phillips model.  Since then, we all use electric toothbrushes and at least one member of the household uses the Phillips brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Phillips as a company goes, they actually do stand by their products. Speaking from experience, we had an issue with an electric toothbrush around a year ago, and I was forced to contact the manufacturer to voice my needs and dissatisfaction. Not only were they polite and extremely helpful, they made getting a replacement easy. That is not something you can say about many companies, and the experience has always stood out in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is really easy to use, which can be nice in a time when some toothbrushes literally come with things like applications to help you brush. Depending on the model, those can be interesting and helpful, but sometimes you just want to brush your teeth without having speed recommendations, schedules, and other things attached. This model touts 31,000 strokes a minute and has a slim grip handle that works for almost anyone, which is nice for both kids and adults. There are three settings depending on need and, frankly, on how fast you want to use up the head on your toothbrush. I like the sensitive setting for gum use quite a bit personally, and the toothbrush recalls what setting you used last time and continues on it on the next go. The settings are easy to use, you simply tap the button rapidly two times and it moves forward. Most importantly, these clean just as well as more expensive types of toothbrushes, which is my one imperative buying factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this to the series 2 model, you will notice some differences, especially when it comes to charge. I have noticed this lasts about 1/3 longer than the other model, which is nice for people (like myself) who are forgetful when it comes to charging. It also has a quad timer to help remind you to move to a different part of the mouth roughly every 30 seconds. That is especially helpful with kids and can be with adults, especially when you are tired or not feeling that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The toothbrush comes with a charger, a head, and a carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this model a lot.my one imperative buying factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this to the series 2 model, you will notice some differences, especially when it comes to charge.

    <li> Absolutely love this brush! I feel so disappointed that manual toothbrush cannot effect clean my wisdom teeth and the crevices between my teeth, which makes my teeth prone to get food stuck between. I buy this toothbrush just thinking that the high frequency will do what I want and surpringsingly it does. The time needed to clean my wisdom teeth is shortened significantly and I have&#x27;t got anything stuck between my teeth for days. Yesterday I was surprised that the plaque on my teeth finally began to fade. Besides, the small head fits my small mouth really well and the timer helps control brushing time, which is so helpful for college students( like me) and people with a rush morning routine since it can effective clean teeth in 2 minutes.I also love the three strength mode since I can choose how much cleaning I want according to my need. I use the first, or the softest, mode for everyday and the second or third when I have a lot of meat. The only complain is the battery that takes 24 hours to be fully charged. In a word, it is a very effective toothbrush with an affordable price. Just make sure that you charge your brush in advance so that you can enjoy brushing your teeth whenever you want.</li>
    <li> A little disappointing.  I read the reviews about the head rattling.  I thought I would try it anyway, hoping it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me.  Just like the reviews stated, it rattles, like the head doesn&#x27;t fit properly.  I tried different heads, but the same rattle.  It just feels and sounds cheap.  I should stay with my older screw on style head.  I was just trying to get away from the nooks and crannies of the older style that got kind of grungy.&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought the Healthy White Series 5 and it sounds fine.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mother in law. She really loves it and recommends it.</li>
    <li> Love the Sonicare 3 series.  I&#x27;ve had several Flexcare Plus setups in the past--the base unit was  impossible to keep clean , and the bulb inside the unit always blew. It took up too much room on my counter. and couldn&#x27;t be kept clean.  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I looked for an alternative and found just the thing in the 3 series.  I&#x27;s a snap to keep clean, since it&#x27;s just the brush handle and a tiny recharger that the base fits into. It takes all types of brush heads, including the diamond  shape; has 3 modes from less to more intensity; has a y small footprint on the counter;  and is way cheaper than higher end models. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unless you have a special situation for which you need the higher end sonicares,  check out the 3 Series.  .</li>
    <li> After 10 years, I thought that I should get a new Sonicare. This does a much better job than the old one. Plus the replacement brushes are much less of an investment.</li>
    <li> Might say it feels cheaper and flimsier, but perhaps it was designed to be lighter and sleeker than our previous Sonicare. Brush head is much smaller and the unit doesn&#x27;t trap as much gunk between the joints.  Does a decent job. Battery seems to last much longer between charges. Lots of speed options but I find the higher speeds are too loud and annoying. If you like these design features you willl like this brush.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, if you don&#x27;t mind the sensation; but I do.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job, teeth and mouth feel very clean and refreshed.  Time will tell if it does help with placque.  My dental hygienist will let me know at my next appointment!</li>
    <li> Really?  It&#x27;s a toothbrush</li>
    <li> My 3rd or 4th Phillips Really like the through cleaning I get with it</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush but as many reviewers here, there is a huge gap between the brush head and the base which makes that loud noise (even louder with my old old sonicare essence). I also called sonicare as one of the suggestions here but the rep said that it is designed to have that gap and is really noisier because it has a more powerful motor for plaque removal. I asked about the rubber rings as suggested by other reviewers but they don&#x27;t make it anymore. Basically the rep doesn&#x27;t care if you bougt a sonicare that has a huge gap and makes a lot of noise. She speaks like, you bought it, live with it. Not even a slight positive thing to say like, hey customer don&#x27;t worry about that gap thing because that is great toothbrush and it is better at plaque removal etc etc. well nothing. She&#x27;s not friendly at all. So does anyone know where we can get one of those rubber rings for this model?</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare.  The first lasted only about 2 years so I&#x27;m hoping this one will last longer.  It&#x27;s a little noisy at the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; level, but other than that, I like it a lot.  As other reviewers have said, there&#x27;s something about how clean your mouth and gums feel after brushing with this toothbrush.  I would have given it a 5-star rating however, I&#x27;m a little concerned about how long it will last and the noise factor.  Other than that, a great value and excellent product.</li>
    <li> Handle very comfortable and like the levels of brushing strength.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the older Sonicare design and I do like this new, slimmer model. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the water retention/mildew problems of the old design. I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduced vibration or effectiveness compared to the older design unlike some users. The one thing I dislike is the quad-pacer feature that it seems cannot be disabled. It changes the vibration frequency momentarily as a reminder to move to a different region, but it always startles me. This is a bit unpleasant early in the morning while still sleepy - it always make me jump. I wish this feature could be turned off, but I do end up more awake after using it....</li>
    <li> This is the first Phillips Sonicare product I&#x27;ve used and I was immediately blown away. Prior to using this product I was using the less expensive battery operated type tooth brush. There is no comparison between the two types. The Phillips Sonicare is much more quiet, less bulky and much more efficient. I could tell the difference immediately when I first used it. My teeth felt so clean. The feeling was similar to the one you have after visiting the dentist and getting the plaque removed. It is just a great addition to your self help needs for maintaining a nice set of teeth and gums. The brushing is characterized by the speed with which the bristles turn. One might think that this might hurt your gums but nothing could be further from the truth. It is vigorous but gentle on your gums. I absolutely love his product and will never go back to the old style, let alone brushing manually; it is just so much more efficient. If you are looking for a new tooth brush definitely buy this one because you won&#x27;t be let down; it is an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> enjoy this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> This a great product.  I highly recommend these to any family, in short, it works.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush overall. I used to use a Oral B electric and this one is leaps and bounds better. There is a gap on mine that adds a little more noise but it doesn&#x27;t affect the brushing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Phillips&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question&lt;br /&gt;There is a noticeable gap between the base of the brush head and the top of the toothbrush handle. I&#x27;m not able to get the brush head all the way on. Is there something wrong with the toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answer&lt;br /&gt;It is normal to have a small gap between the bottom of the brush head and the top of the handle where the shaft is located. In fact, the gap is necessary, because the brush head must be free to move in order to deliver the brushing action needed to clean your teeth. However, even though there is normally a gap between the brush head and the top of the handle, the brush head itself should not be a loose fit on the handle, nor should it slip down the drive shaft during use. If this occurs, it can often be corrected simply by installing a new brush head on the handle. If the looseness persists after you have tried several brush heads, or the drive shaft is loose, contact Sonicare support to discuss your issue.</li>
    <li> Dentist told me that I needed an electronic toothbrush and suggested this one. So glad she did! My teeth feel so clean!!! I love that it beeps to let you know when you completed an area of brushing and the battery charge is amazing! Last more then 3 weeks before I have to recharge!</li>
    <li> ...of all the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes I have bought, this is my favorite!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Kinda disappointed in this model as the battery lasts about half as long as my prior sonicare. Seems like I get 3-4 days before it starts beeping that its hungry. Average day I use it 3x. Old model was closer to 8-10 days.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This is my third brush.  First one lasted about 3.5 years.  Previous one lasted just under three before it stopped taking a charge.  I should have known that a unit under hundred bucks was going to not be the same as the others. This one has a noticeable noise difference (louder) and the charging base that it comes with is actually too small to hold the brush upright (so using my old one). Also no where to put the excess cord.  If it wasn&#x27;t such a pain, I would return this.</li>
    <li> I have had several electric toothbrushes, including others by Sonicare. This one is my favorite. It has my favorte feature, the 30 second time for each quadrant of your mouth, plus it has a great &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; mode that baby steps one into using a Sonicare brush. Many people try out Sonicare brushes and stop using it after a short amount of time because they find it too intense. The training mode gradually increases the speed and pressure over ten uses to let you get used to the difference. My mouth has never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> We got this Sonicare for our almost 8 year old boy, who has loved automatic toothbrushes ever since he got his first Thomas the Train one 3-4 years ago. What we discovered quickly is that a) kids outgrow those phases quickly so you go from Thomas to Transformers to Power Rangers to whatever and b) those toothbrushes aren&#x27;t really that great, built more around marketing a toy/brand than making an actually good toothbrush. So, we told him we&#x27;re upgrading him to Big Boy toothbrushes and got him this Sonicare. (My wife and I have been using a different model Sonicare for years, but we thought it&#x27;d be easier to keep a separate one for him, for a number of reasons including he uses a different bathroom to brush his teeth than we do.) So anyway, long story short, he loves it. We got him some easily removable stickers to put on the handle, so he can customize it and then remove the stickers when he gets bored with them. He loves the idea of using a toothbrush for grownups. The brush head is pretty small so it&#x27;s ideal for kids. It&#x27;s been a perfect upgrade, and I encourage it for kids and adults alike</li>
    <li> It is everything I expected it to be.  I had the Sonicare Series E prior and like this one even more.</li>
    <li> Someone asked this in the Q&amp;A section, so I guess this problem was consistent. There is a large gap between the base and head, that&#x27;s causing noise more than usual. I don&#x27;t think this is normal, and could be a design flaw that was not corrected before releasing to the market.</li>
