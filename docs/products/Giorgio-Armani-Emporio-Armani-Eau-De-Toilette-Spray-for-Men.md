<li> Long story short....</li>
<li> it&#x27;s timeless since its been around for a long time.</li>
<li> Not sure but may be a Chinese knock off.</li>
<li> but it seems like the perfume is watered down.</li>
<li> Some of the reviews I have read on this say that the scent seemed watered down or tampered with.  </li>
<li> I read couple of reviews about receiving water down product, but took my chances anyway as it was shipped and sold from Amazon, not to mention I put my trust for Amazon for the test.</li>
<li> , it was like a time machine to the past.</li>
<li> He had been looking for the Emporio Armani cologne the past 2 years, but couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the department stores</li>
<li> Too bad new production of this product has stopped.</li>
<li> I usually Stink!</li>

    <li> My husband and I love this cologne! Fast shipment and no problems!</li>
    <li> Not sure but may be a Chinese knock off. Even had Chinese writing packaging. Smells a little different than the original too but pretty close. It was discontined by Armani 2 or 3 years ago. Don&#x27;t know why... It was the most sensuous sent for a man... Ever!!! Please Armarni, bring it back! Can&#x27;t resist my man when he wears it.</li>
    <li> By far the best cologne I have ever found!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 15 years.  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Rahim</li>
    <li> Smell amazing on my husband. He has been wearing this since I met him over 10yrs ago.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting cologne and it is toilet water, not as strong as my current bottle. Looks the same but not as fragrant.</li>
    <li> as described, very pleased !</li>
    <li> I usually Stink! But now I Smell Great! Seriously I get a bunch of compliments about this scent! Spot on Perfection!</li>
    <li> The best of the Armani line, in my opinion.  You CAN NOT beat the price.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend.  He had been looking for the Emporio Armani cologne the past 2 years, but couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the department stores (Macy&#x27;s discontinued it, couldn&#x27;t find it at others).  He was about to purchase it at one of those generic perfume stores, but I vehemently advised against it because my sister-in-law received watered-down products from those types of stores before.  When finally, we came across a &amp;#34;Perfumania&amp;#34; and they had a sample.  It smelled different at first, but after aerating a few minutes, the true smell came to life.  He told me all the memories came back to him, it was like a time machine to the past. He sniffed the sample paper until the scent no longer was there. I could tell he was excited because he was sniffing the sample every 5 seconds and almost looked like a drug addict getting high off of his next fix of nostalgia (and maybe a bit of help from the chemicals).  We&#x27;re on a tight budget, so he didn&#x27;t want to splurge on a seemingly frivolous addition to his toiletry kit; but seeing how happy the scent made him, I couldn&#x27;t NOT do anything about it.... So, I found it on Amazon. We had a gift card (Xmas present) and my Chase rewards paid for a portion, so in the end I only paid about $15 for the remainder.  I was skeptical about purchasing this online and not directly through Armani or an official store, but this was a great gamble! The product is just like the original and he is extremely happy with it--as am I. He smells great, it masks any foot odor (ladies, you know what I&#x27;m talking about) and it brings back the memories of when we first met.  Great plus: it&#x27;s 3.4 oz, so you can bring it on the plane! He leaves tomorrow for Chicago and was worried they may confiscate it because it appears larger, so I just printed the receipt w/the information about the container so that he can show the airport workers. This may be overkill, but all the work we did to find it, I don&#x27;t want it to be confiscated at the airport. Long story short....it&#x27;s great!port. Long story short....it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance it&#x27;s timeless since its been around for a long time. It&#x27;s a great gift for that special someone .</li>
    <li> very nice parfum,great price</li>
    <li> My wife love this parfurm(cologne) on me</li>

    <li> Marvelous Cologne, arrived promptly.  Exactly as purchased in the High end retail store!</li>
    <li> Giorgio always smells nice</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriends birthday.. Love the way it smells on him.</li>

    <li> Best price I could find!  Even the outlet mall was more expensive.  Fast delivery and my hubby smells great!!</li>

    <li> Cannot find this item in stores, but it is my son&#x27;s favorite.  Leave it to Amazon to have it for his Christmas gift.  He loved it.</li>
    <li> the best cologne to me</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend and brother and it smells really good my brother loves it and my boyfriend too.</li>
    <li> It looked sealed when it came but it is most probably a fake. I do not see how they did it but it seems like the perfume is watered down.</li>
    <li> This is nothing like the original. It is not even a good knock-off. Save the money. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> smells like heaven best cologne out there for sure !!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Came on time.  We&#x27;ll packaged.  Brand new condition.  Exact product as advertised.</li>
    <li> good smelling cologne!</li>
