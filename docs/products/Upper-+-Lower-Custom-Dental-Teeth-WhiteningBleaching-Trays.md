### Positive Reviews

      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>I have learned to apply the perfect amount of gel to minimize leaking and I have also perfected the cut on each tray by trimming any excess material that would cover the gum tissue so that the gel can be wiped off the exposed tissue after the trays are put on.</li>

      <li>I have used the kit twice since yesterday and my teeth are 4 shade lighter, I can measure this with a teeth whiting chart the provided with my kit,I found that really handy.</li>

      <li>They fit perfectly and the whitening system worked without too much burning or sensitivity to the bleach it used.  </li>
      <li>.. you get a great fitting product.. been using it so much and the results are amazing..</li>
      <li>Very comfortable compared to those DIY heat-molded trays.</li>
      <li>so are very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>im gonna come back and give a stinky review though :D</li>
      <li>They are working and that is nice, but the fit isn&#x27;t as form fitting to my bite</li>
      <li>These are a million times better than the self mold trays.</li>
      <li>The trays are much more inexpensive than what my dentist charges.  </li>

      <li>Great service, fast delivery (1 wk), quality product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it will work for me to use the top tray for whitening as it does not sit close to my top teeth at all.</li>
      <li>so we can track how many shades</li>
      <li>had a lot more play than 20 seconds when mixing the molding putty.</li>
      <li>The turn around time is more like 6 weeks though</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re way thinner and also keep the whitening gel out of my mouth for the most part.</li>
      <li>Hopefully the trays from this kit will work with the better whitener.  </li>
      <li>Smile Bright after hearing so many reviews about them</li>
      <li>and he said my teeth trays are much better made than his.</li>
      <li>These are more a rubber mold feel.</li>
      <li>and they seemed the most reputable-</li>
      <li>After all, you&#x27;re putting this stuff if your mouth, so you want to make sure it&#x27;s safe and coming from a reputable seller.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent results, I love it. Staff promptly answered questions regarding impressions and using the gel. Don&#x27;t be scared by the strength, a worthwhile bleaching gel will irritate gums a little or cause some tooth sensitivity, but within a few hours that goes away. I use it every 2-3 days to give some recovery time, and I am also targeting a specific tooth which darkened from an injury 25 years ago where the root calcified over.  Even the darkened tooth has whitened considerably and is not even noticeable unless close-up now, and I have just starting using this system.  I know my dentist will be surprised the next time she sees me, we have talked about whitening my teeth for quite some time or doing a bleaching root canal or veneer for the darkened tooth - not necessary anymore!  :)</li>
    <li> Great service, fast delivery (1 wk), quality product. Will last for so long bc you don&#x27;t need much at all for application. Bought with remineralization gel and no sensitivity. Quality A+.</li>
    <li> IT WORKED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FRONT TEETH, BUT NOT IN THE MIDDLE, NOT HAPPY BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL YELLOW</li>
    <li> this company did a nice job in making my molds. they were very easy to do and the instructions were great</li>
    <li> The trays fit perfectly! I would definitely recommend this company to anyone who wants to whiten their teeth.  There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in the dentist office for the same product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this system not knowing what the quality would be.. I was very surprised that it was a good quality product for the price. the kit comes with everything you need to made your impressions and ship them back to then for processing.. takes about 2 weeks and presto.. you get a great fitting product.. been using it so much and the results are amazing.. recommended vice getting ripped off at the dentist..</li>
    <li> Custom trays are GREAT, making the impressions is a bit tricky but patience is a virtue they say. HOWEVER, the gel they supply to use with the trays is liquid-hevenly-punishment from the depths of ya&#x27;ll don&#x27;t wann&#x27;a go there! OMG it&#x27;s horrible! Yes, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t get it on your gums&amp;#34; I know, but placing gel NEAR the gums is the only way to remove even slight stain from near the gums...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once this stuff gets on your gums it WILL burn like a thousand angry campfires and cause literal damage to your human flesh, bleaching it white and mottled like you&#x27;ve just gulped battery acid from a disposable cup for a sorority dare, who obviously don&#x27;t want you around for long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is better gel out there, providing results without the unearthly punishment to your sensory organs and fleshy bits :[</li>
    <li> This really works well.  Be careful though, the gel is very strong and will burn if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that Sporting Smiles has done all they said they would.  I ordered retainers for whitening my teeth and the product was delivered in the time frame they claimed.  I had ordered some from my dentist and it cost me over $700.  I wish I would have found Sporting Smiles before I spent such and incredible amount.  I have contacted them and ordered a pair of retainers to wear at night and they were as prompt with my request as before.  Before you go to the dentist and waste money as I did, I would recommend you give them a try.  A Happy Customer and a returning one.</li>
    <li> Hey it really fit perfectly so tight I have trouble getting them off. quality product and fast delivery. The cleaning solution comes in syringe tubes with a dispensing hole that is too big to dispense the correct amount and the solution works but not nearly as good as Opalescence tooth whitening systems 35% mint. The Opalescence has a small dispensing hole making it really easy to place it in the right spot. I have found that after I put the solution in the mouth piece i use a Q tip to even it out and after both are even I use the clean end to clean any at the gum line but make sure to put it in the trash away from kids and pets. I had yellow teeth and now have clean white teeth. It is a little difficult getting the teeth white real close to the gum line but will clean up in time.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service! Finished product was delivered in half the estimated time. Perfect fit to my teeth and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I would most def recommend this company/product/service to friends &amp; family!!!!</li>
    <li> The trays are much more inexpensive than what my dentist charges.  They&#x27;re also a better fit and not as thick so are very comfortable.  I would highly recommend you give these a try.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to get to the point where I could write this review.&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped in a reasonable time-frame.&lt;br /&gt;My son needed it to whiten teeth prior to an implant.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the implant, the first casting had insufficient clay, so we had to get more.&lt;br /&gt;After the castings were complete we waited more than a week for the trays.&lt;br /&gt;The trays are great!  He doesn&#x27;t have a lot of extra whitening gel in his mouth to disturb his gums - even around the hole where his pulled front tooth was.  So he has little pain - unless he uses too much gel and it squooshes out.  And his teeth are much whiter now.&lt;br /&gt;The personal trays from the castings are really the way to go for home whitening.&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Custom trays came in the mail very quickly and fit perfectly for less than half what my dentist would charge. I opted to purchase a different brand of whitening gel so I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the gel included in this package.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, my dentist had molds made of my teeth for whitening using the Opalescent whitener.  They fit perfectly and the whitening system worked without too much burning or sensitivity to the bleach it used.  I used those molds a couple of more times, buying more Opalescence at 35%, and which worked really well.  After several uses, the original molds became a bit misshapen, so I tried using the self-molding trays, and none of them resulted in a close enough fit to properly keep the whitener in place against my teeth.  So I decided to spring for this &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; set of trays, which included the whitener, and it seemed that it was a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG mistake!  The bleach used in this kit is extremely harsh on the gums, and any amount that seeps out of the trays (which are not, unfortunately, as close fitting as the ones I purchased through my dentist) results in a long lasting burn that far exceeds any irritation I ever experienced with Opalescence, even at the 35% strength.  I used the included whitener for over ten days, skipping a day twice, due to the severity of the chemical burns in my mouth.  I wiped the excess off the bottom edges of the trays as soon as I fit them in, to avoid any excess sitting on my gums.  However, I just could not stand to keep the bleach on my teeth any longer than 15 - 20 minutes, and I was in extreme discomfort and pain that whole time.  It has now been four days since I last used the bleach, and I still have a significant chemical burn in the tissue between my lower gums and my lips which is only just now healing to the point that I can touch it without significant pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered Opalescence and will try to use the trays with that product, as it is far less harsh and I can keep it on my teeth long enough to get them significantly whiter that I could ever hope with the bleach included in this kit.  Hopefully the trays from this kit will work with the better whitener.  I give this kit 2 stars because the trays do seem to fit a bit better than the do-it-yourself-in-hot-water ones, but I cannot emphasize enough how harsh the included bleach whitener is, so please take that into account.  I would recommend the Opalescence system for anyone looking for an effective and safer whitener.m to fit a bit better than the do-it-yourself-in-hot-water ones, but I cannot emphasize enough how harsh the included bleach whitener is, so please take that into account.  I would recommend the Opalescence system for anyone looking for an effective and safer whitener.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! The trays fit perfectly - just like the dentist version except, $250 less!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS REALLY WELL, but you need to know a few critical things: 1) the first package arrives in about a week, and it includes only the tray making kit, no gel (my pack did not have instruction on how to make molds, so I had to look up the video on their website); 2) Once you make the molds, you will have to wait 2-3 (for me, a bit over 2) weeks to receive the mold back!  In my case, I wanted to whiten in short order, so that the two veneers I was having would match the whitened teeth.  The timeline for the bleaching trays/gels set me back a month, and I had to cancel my cosmetic dentist appointments.  It was a long time to wait, in my opinion, for $70.  The trays are high quality soft plastic and the gel is strong -- I had a lot of zingers!</li>
    <li> These trays are so cool. They fit perfectly even though I am sure I made less than perfect molds--it was really hard not to gag on the molding putty! I feel like I cheated on my dentist by getting these made through S.S., which is an awesome and super fulfilling sneaky feeling.</li>
    <li> Very well made! This is the second pair we ordered from this lab! Will certainly recommend this company to whoever has the same need!</li>
    <li> I have used this company before and everything worked out as promised.  It was very easy to make impressions and the trays fit perfect and bleach works well to.</li>
    <li> Have used the trays about 3 times. 20-30 min each time and they&#x27;re working. Might ease up on how much time I leave them in. As certain teeth are getting sensitive. Otherwise, good purchase for the price. Our dentist wanted $400. My husband went to another dentist that charged $99 and he said my teeth trays are much better made than his. I think his are a cheaper plastic feel. These are more a rubber mold feel.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I needed a guard to protect my teeth at night.  Found out that it would cost me $700.  I had ordered these whitening trays already when I noticed they did grinding guards as well.  For another $50-60, they sent me a professional, perfectly fitting guard as well (made from the impressions I had already sent).  No wonder I hate dentists.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I found these but was desperate. After my bleaching trays magically disappeared I contacted my dentist to get replacements. He quoted me over $400! I didn&#x27;t think I had anything to lose by trying these. I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My box arrived within a week of ordering. Everything you need to take your own impressions is there, including a link to a video! I was concerned about mixing the puddy, it said to do it withing 20 seconds. It was so easy to mix, just kneaded it like bread in less than 10 seconds. After taking my impressions, I put everything in the prepaid shipping box and sent off. 10 days later my package arrived. Trays came in the case I ordered. They fit great and my teeth are super white again. I must say that the bleaching gel they send is a huge amount and it works as well as product I got from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to order these because I do not like whitening my teeth with regular trays.  I usually could not keep them in very long because of taste of whitening gel or excessive mouth watering then gel was just diluted.  These tooth forms are so comfortable you do not even know you are wearing them!  They keep the gel close to your teeth and you can breathe normally when you have them in.  Fit is excellent and they are very comfortable.  Turnaround time was exactly 3 weeks from initial order - I shipped my impressions out the day after I received the molds.  I would definitely purchase from sporting smiles again!</li>
    <li> The company is great – product came via US mail in timely fashion.  Easy directions for making impressions … the video on YouTube was very helpful as well.  I mailed back the impressions in the same box with prepaid postage label provided.  It took about three weeks to receive the actual trays that were made from my impressions.  I have very crooked bottom teeth and was concerned about that, but it is working great.  Still in the whitening process so will update when finished - which will change to five stars.</li>
    <li> The molds fit almost perfectly and the solution does a good job. Just don&#x27;t get it on your gums. Less is more with the gel.</li>
    <li> My dentist wanted $400 for their bleaching trays to be made, so this was worth a try. The impression process with this company was easy to follow (with help from their website). I received the trays, with bleaching gels one day shy of three weeks from the time I mailed my impressions to them. They fit perfectly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not only is the product the real deal the customer service is excellent.  Everything was exactly as described and all very possible for most anyone to accomplish.  My teeth have become so much whiter I went to my dentist for a color change on false teeth that were color matched to the best white crest strips could do!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so damn happy I did this. Oh and the product is the same thing my dentist charged my mother 300 dollars for.</li>
    <li> Really great product! I sent away for this kit and might I add that I have trays from the dentist but have had work done on some teeth and they no longer fit, rather than paying the 250.00 dollars for a new set, I elected to try these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came with instructions that I read and then reread. I did as they suggested and mailed my impressions back. The new trays came, maybe not as thick as the ones from the dentist BUT close. Either way with the new trays and the gel that by the way is in huge tubes, my teeth are much whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is better than other gels that I have used and offer less irritability. Once when using the gel I placed it too close to the root area and I just used a q-tip to wipe off that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The molds came to me with a perfect match to my teeth. I contacted customer service a few times (to check on my order status and to check on how often I could safely use the gel), and their response time was VERY quick and answered my questions thoroughly. I love a company that makes a great product (dentist wanted $200 for what I assume is the same exact thing) and has outstanding customer service. Definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for a week, and have gotten probably about 2 shades lighter even with my teeth-staining habits (iced tea, cola, tobacco). Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had professionally made trays before, and these were just as good quality. I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve paid a lot more at the dentist, but these were perfect. The kit is really easy to understand and the final product arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.  Slightly less hefty than the ones I got from my dentist, but they are 1/4 the price!  I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> They fit perfectly and arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> This product surpassed my expectations replacing the set that I had previously acquired from a dentist for a significantly higher price.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about buying whitening trays from this seller because there were no reviews. But I found many great reviews of the seller&#x27;s products on eBay.     The shipping was very fast and I was very impressed with the quality of the materials they had sent me to make my molds. I then sent the package back to them (it was prepaid too!)     I waited about two weeks for my trays to be made. They sent the trays back with a case and 4 whitening syringes. I was extremely happy with the final product--it looked exactly like the picture on Amazon (exactly the same quality).    Overall, very happy with my purchase. I have no complaints-- the quality of the trays and materials was tremendous. They look exactly (if not better) than my mom&#x27;s whitening trays that she got them professionally done at a dentist.</li>
    <li> Great service... great quality, quick turnaround. Very Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Excellent fit.  I feel like a chump having paid $400 for my first pair through my dentist when these are superior.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable compared to those DIY heat-molded trays.</li>
    <li> The upper and lower trays fit perfect !</li>
    <li> fits really well and is well made, though it needs the gum line trimmed down by hand for a perfect fit. The turn around time is more like 6 weeks though which was really annoying.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I goofed up my upper tray impression by coming too close to the plastic tray edge. Called Sporting Smiles and talked to a Diane who sounded rather crabby and told me I needed to send them a picture of the tray so they could determine if it was a bad impression.  This got followed up with an unfriendly email saying they&#x27;d resend the putties. Fast forward to my receiving the bleaching gel:  have used it six times with not even an iota of lightening.  I&#x27;ll continue but I&#x27;ve also noticed the gel is sticky, stretchy when dispensed from the syringe which means it&#x27;s probably old, thus the lack of result I&#x27;ve seen.  I don&#x27;t drink cola or smoke so I&#x27;m not a hard case for lightening.  The plastic trays are not that great either - they feel like lightweight plastic to me. Very similar to the plastic Tortellini comes in from the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Got these for my kids and wife.  It fits well and whitens teeth effectively, at a fraction of the cost of getting trays made at the dentist.</li>
    <li> great stuff and it works as described! Got my mom a few :)</li>
    <li> After trying those awful thermoforming trays, I decided to invest in custom trays to whiten my teeth more effectively at home. I learned I could have them made at my dentist&#x27;s office, where it would cost a few hundred dollars. Then I browsed Amazon to see what offerings there were for custom trays. I was wary of listings that had titles reading like advertisements and being sold by companies that I could not find any information about online. After all, you&#x27;re putting this stuff if your mouth, so you want to make sure it&#x27;s safe and coming from a reputable seller. So I read-up on Sporting Smiles and they seemed the most reputable- they make their trays in-house and have a dentist supervising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few questions before purchasing, which were answered courteously and promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the initial pack, you receive the impression materials, trays to put the material in and create your moulds, instructions, a form to fill out and return postage label. The impressions are fairly easy to make, and Sporting Smiles have instructional videos online that are VERY helpful! After making my impressions, I was a little concerned how one of my impressions turned out, so I took a photo of the impression and emailed it to Sporting Smiles. They responded the same day, and informed me that my impression looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I filled out the return form, where you get to request a case color, and dropped it all off at the post office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly two weeks later, I received my trays. They fit perfectly and I can confirm they are of dental quality (they look just like a friend&#x27;s trays, that were done at dentist&#x27;s office). The trays are already cut to size, so no need to do any cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also receive two big 10ml syringes of whitening gel. I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the gel yet, as I&#x27;ve only done one treatment. However, I have confidence in it&#x27;s quality and safety, as it&#x27;s coming from a dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole experience with Sporting Smiles has been seamless. Excellent customer service, excellent quality and excellent value-- sure beats spending hundreds of dollars on the same product at my dentist&#x27;s office. I would highly recommend this company and product.</li>
    <li> Turn around time was great! I mailed my impressions and got the trays back in two weeks as promised - great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this as 5 stars except that my top tray is veeeeery loose and falls out unless I clench my teeth shut. I&#x27;m confident that my top impression was good so I&#x27;m not sure what happened. I don&#x27;t know how well it will work for me to use the top tray for whitening as it does not sit close to my top teeth at all. On the other hand, my bottom tray is a prefect fit and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this...the trays were custom made...I was surprised...I had my made at dentist for a very hi price..for anybody that wants to buy this product I surly positively recommend it...</li>
    <li> I received the bleaching tray but the upper and lower molar teeth were cut off as well as the frame of the trays to the point where the tray wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I contacted customer service and requested for a new tray with molar teeth uncut as well as the frame.  They sent me a new set and it&#x27;s PERFECT.  The material is VERY soft and for the price, it exceeds my dentist office.  Highly recommend and request the customization in advance since it takes a while to get it shipped.</li>
    <li> This item does as advertised. Far less than the dentist price and it does the same thing. Gel burned a little the firs time using it.</li>
    <li> Completely as advertised good product great value</li>
    <li> The whitening gel that they supply burns your gums within the first five minutes. I will call the company to discuss this problem. It&#x27;s not just me, either. Phil</li>
    <li> The trays don&#x27;t fit snug to my teeth, so the gel just gets washed out (I have swallowed WAY too much gel using these).  I have been using these for several months, and after spending a fortune on good bleaching gel, I realized they trays are the problem. Good concept--wish it worked better.</li>
    <li> What a Great Product, Glad I went through Amazon for this product..</li>
    <li> The system works great.  Yes it takes awhile to complete the process of making the molds and getting the molded parts back but it is worth it&lt;br /&gt;Griff</li>
    <li> This is a really cool system of getting perfectly measured trays and the whitening gel. My husband and I are really happy with it, the trays are high quality and it only takes 2 weeks for the trays to get back to you. Recommend it</li>
    <li> A significantly cheaper alternative to what the dentist would charge you for the same thing.  The process was easy and the time it took to return the custom trays wasn&#x27;t too long.  The only bad thing I would have to say is that the gel they provide is very strong - it burned my gums (I&#x27;ll admit this was probably user error) and made my teeth very sensitive.  I&#x27;ve since switched to a weaker whitening gel, but I still use the trays.</li>
    <li> I gave t his to my husband for Christmas because he is a coffee and tea drinker which has ultimately stained his teeth.  He has sent the impressions in and is waiting for the trays and the bleaching solution.  However, I am rating this and titling this due to the fact that I purchased the set several months ago and it seems to work really well.  My teeth are not heavily stained as I do not drink coffee but I do drink tea and diet coke.  Luckily, I inherited very white teeth from my dad but after periods of drinking tea and diet coke I do notice that my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as usual.  After using this product 2-3 times I can tell a significant difference. The trays fit perfectly and the impressions were easy to do. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Be sure not to spend too much time kneading the 2 part product before making your impression.  Trays arrived in 2 weeks as described and fit perfectly.  The cost was about 1/5th the price my dentist charged me for ONE tray, just the upper.  After one use of 20 minutes, my teeth are remarkably whiter.  I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This tray is far better than the one I originally got from my dentist and lost. They wanted to charge me $$ to replace it, and I ordered this DIY kit instead. So glad I did!</li>
    <li> Except quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Can&#x27;t think of anything to complain about</li>
    <li> My dentist charged me $275.00 to make molds so I could match my teeth with my 20 year old caps. My wife bought these Sporting Smile trays from Amazon and they are identical.</li>
    <li> The instructions were easy to follow. The trays fit perfectly.  I recommend to anyone thinking of having trays made from your dentist.</li>
    <li> Trays fit perfectly. Rated 4 stars because it took about four weeks to receive the finished product after mailing in my molds. Otherwise, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.The kit came, I watched the how to videos and followed the instructions and my molds came out perfect. I put them in the container, affixed the prepaid (yes, prepaid) shipping label and dropped it at the post office.  The trays arrived and they fit perfectly.  I like that these are cut to only cover the teeth and not the gums. The last ones I had went up onto the gums, which sometimes cause my gums to feel burned or sore from the gel.  I have a different gel I used with these I already owned, so I can&#x27;t say whether or not the gel is any good, but given the quality of the trays, I would assume it&#x27;s just fine plus there is a ton of it.</li>
    <li> After paying $350 for one upper tray, from the dentist, I was thrilled (yet skeptical) to find an Amazon Co. that customized trays.  I&#x27;ve had lots of impressions made so that was easy.  I got the trays about 3 weeks after I shipped the impressions back and they fit better than the one from the dentist.  Excellent product and value.</li>
    <li> I received the trays two weeks after I sent molds back. Good quality. I have to stop using it a couple of days just I I felt TOO MUCH sensitive but the product it is perfect ! and works fine. Definitively I recommend it. Thank you</li>
    <li> The trays were flimsier than I was expecting, I thought it would be a firmer, closer fit for my teeth.  They are working and that is nice, but the fit isn&#x27;t as form fitting to my bite and I&#x27;ve had some of the gel cause the inside of my mouth and even my tongue to experience discomfort after using the trays, like the feeling your mouth can get after you eat fresh pineapple sometimes.  As a result I am a bit hesitant to use it again, but will probably give it another try and just be aware if I can sense or taste any of the gel escaping the tray.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t fit right, its a hit or miss if you get them perfect since the average consumer is not a professional in precise placement of the tray, and no room for mistakes or movement.</li>
    <li> I am a cancer survivor and need trays to treat teeth because of radiation.  These were the most reasonably priced, easy to use product.  They answered my letter on the postcard enclosed with the returned forms I had made promptly and made me two sets of trays for a small additional fee!  What a blessing!  By the way the teeth whitening syringes they sent were twice the size of other brands and also worked fantastically.  Thank you..........thank you.  I have recommended you to all my clients!</li>
    <li> This company is great! I got my trays a little over a year ago and they are still in excellent condition. I whiten my teeth about once a wk and the gel that came with the order is also awesome! Just be careful, the gel is super strong and your teeth will hurt! But hey, totally worth it for those pearly whites!!😉</li>
    <li> The trays fit perfectly! These are a million times better than the self mold trays. They&#x27;re way thinner and also keep the whitening gel out of my mouth for the most part. Self molding trays are super messy and let a lot of gel leak out of the trays and into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot more play than 20 seconds when mixing the molding putty. I spent 40-60 seconds mixing the putty and then carefully put it in the tray and made sure that a thick layer was spread out evenly all over the tray. I had no problems with my molds.</li>
    <li> mkay so i had average teeth, a little yellow mostly white, overall just an okay smile.  i brush twice a day with whitening toothpaste, don&#x27;t floss or water spray or anything fancy, just the 60 second brushing when i wake and before bed.  additionally i drink coffee and soda all day, and smoke occasionally, sorry please don&#x27;t preach to me it makes me feel good :D so anyways i ordered this thinking it would take 6 months to see improvement.  i&#x27;ve seen IMMEDIATE RESULTS.  i definitely want my smile to just someone over or force someone to put on their sunglasses when they talk to me and im sure that will take some time but just wanted to share that i saw such quick results. already worth the 50 bucks, anything after that is a bonus.  oh ya, wanted to also share&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) bite down all the way on the thing they send you. they don&#x27;t tell you to bite all the way down, but i&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to do.  their directions didn&#x27;t specify this and one of my teeth don&#x27;t fit perfectly into it due to this lack of info.&lt;br /&gt;2) there is pain involved in this, medium to heavy stinging is occuring in my mouth when i bleach them because i have sensitive gums&lt;br /&gt;3) there is NO WAY TO TRACK PROGRESS.  this company is dumb and needs to put a shade meter picture on all the pointless info they send so we can track how many shades we change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that awesome product and still highly recommended.  if i dont get any whiter im gonna come back and give a stinky review though :D</li>
    <li> I am really happy with these molds.  Everything was exactly as they said, they had wonderful instructions and a video on the website.  The trays move vertically and horizontally to fit your mouth.  Rub the putties together, press for a few minutes, take out and boom.  A prepaid envelope is included and they return custom trays back to you and give 2 free syringes for whitening.  The whitening helped me a little but I realized when I brush my teeth I don&#x27;t rinse since I heard it&#x27;s better protection on your teeth if you only spit out the tooth paste.  It wasn&#x27;t until after 2 weeks I realized this was probably preventing a lot of the whitener from penetrating my teeth.  I will give it a second go in a little while and hope to follow up again.  Thanks for a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> The first set I got had a few issues. The tray material did not come up far enough in the front to fully cover both of my front teeth, just one. I contacted the company and they remade them and sent me a new set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to point out is that, at least in my set, the material is a flexible rubbery material and does not fit tightly along the gum line to keep the gel from leaking onto the gums. Maybe this is how they are supposed to be but I was expecting them to be a bit more brittle and more conforming to the gum line to protect my gums. I have learned to apply the perfect amount of gel to minimize leaking and I have also perfected the cut on each tray by trimming any excess material that would cover the gum tissue so that the gel can be wiped off the exposed tissue after the trays are put on. I now get minimal bleach burns on my gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while these are not perfect gum line type bleaching trays, they are way better then the kind you make yourself at home with boiling water (those suck) and they are sooooooo affordable compared to getting them done at a dentist office. My teeth are whiter and I don&#x27;t regret my purchase whatsoever. Just know what you&#x27;re getting and be patient. The two weeks it takes to make them does not include the shipping time either direction so don&#x27;t panic when they don&#x27;t arrive in your mailbox two weeks after you send off the molds.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the prompt service and quality of your product. I will order again the bleaching gels in the future. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> This company is amazing !! When I first ordered this kit I was a little worried about the service because it seemed to good to be true for the price. I was planning to go with this company Smile Bright after hearing so many reviews about them but I found it to be a little pricey, so I thought to look for a company that offered the same service for the fraction of the cost. I stumbled upon this set and another on amazon and went with this one because of the great reviews it had. I knew I was safer going the amazon way because they offer buyer protection. When I received my mold kit I noticed after reading the instructions they also have a website . At the Sporting Smile website I saw videos on how to do molds and what other product could be made besides whiting trays from the kit. After I made my impressions at night I took a picture of it because I had concerns about if I did it right and I then sent a email to Sporting Smiles and they responded the morning after. The responder sent me an email saying it was fine, so after reading that I used the return postage provided to send it back that day. After around two weeks I was curious when the finished trays would be done, so I sent another email, turns out it was being shipped that day and they told me when my mold package made it to them. I now have my kit  after only few days after the email and I am very satisfied with the service. The trays fit perfect and the gel is not to bad either. I have used the kit twice since yesterday and my teeth are 4 shade lighter, I can measure this with a teeth whiting chart the provided with my kit,I found that really handy. Overall I am happy with the Kit, and thought it was cool that the company keep your molds for a year and half so you can make other purchases for a discounted price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The idea of an online dental lab is innovative and reasonably priced, while not sacrificing quality.  I highly recommend Sporting Smiles and their products.  The process is fool-proof, stream-lined and very organized.  I am impressed!</li>
    <li> My teeth look like I just left the dentist every day. The molds fit amazing. It&#x27;s an easy process and the shipping is quick. My only disappointment is that I waited so long before I actually bought these. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> took a while to arrive&lt;br /&gt;The trays fit perfect,&lt;br /&gt;i have been using the gel now for about 8 applications seems to be working as promised&lt;br /&gt;There will be some discomfort if you put too much in and allow the solution to :clean&amp;#34; your gums</li>
    <li> The moulds are fine but the gel hurts like CRAZY when you use it and inflames your gums.....</li>
