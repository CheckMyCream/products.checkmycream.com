      <li>the salon is going to miss me ;]</li>
      <li>It does not work well at all compared to the first one.</li>
      <li>My feet look better than they have in a very long</li>
      <li>It worked great while it operated, but now that it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m not happy I purchased this.</li>

      <li>Works very well.</li>

      <li>and I tried to do it as fast</li>
      <li>the work fast.</li>
      <li>I ordered the pink one and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>This thing gives you a soft, smooth pedicure like you&#x27;d have professionally done  </li>
      <li>It would probably take much less time for most people.  </li>
      <li>My feet have gone from callous&#x27; allover to nice &amp; soft after just a few minutes!</li>
      <li>I felt like I had a new set of feet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was skeptical but this product really works.  Does a great job of removing dry calloused skin from my toe and heel.</li>
    <li> I used this product one time and it stopped working.  If you are anything like me and want a product that works right away I would not suggest this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works great to remove callouses and is so easy to use.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work upon arrival.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s easy return policy!</li>
    <li> Horrible! If you use any pressure it won&#x27;t work. Do not waste your money on this item!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this works. The dry skin just floated off. Some calluses are a work in progress.  But it has made a big difference on my feet.</li>
    <li> This does a really nice job. Saw one in the store for twenty dollars more! Great buy.</li>
    <li> Batteries are not included by the way...</li>
    <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;Does the work fast. Now I can do foot care at home.</li>
    <li> This thing works!  I ordered the pink one and I am pleased with the results.  My feet look better than they have in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner&#x27;s manual was not reviewed by anyone who speaks English.</li>
    <li> Completely stopped working 3 months after purchase date with minimal use.  It worked great while it operated, but now that it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m not happy I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Got in the mail Ina timely manner but when I went to use the product it worked for 30 seconds and then stopped. I was unable to get it to work again. Needless to say it will be going back</li>
    <li> this product for my wife works as advertised. She is very glad that we ordered it.</li>
    <li> I really love it. Makes a huge difference</li>
    <li> Ah! Finally got the dry skin off of my feet. definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> If you have hours or days to sit there with the lightest pressure possible this MIGHT do something..someday. but even then I doubt it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great!  The best I have found!</li>
    <li> Got as a gift for my aunt. It&#x27;s cheaper than the Amope one and work&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well, and is easy to use and clean!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product, but THRILLED with the service. I dropped my tool on the bathroom floor while in use and it stopped working. I sent an email to Nature Tech, and received a phone call from Eric immediately. He was incredibly helpful, kind, and accommodating, and passionately believes in the product. He is replacing my tool, adding foot cream, and shipping it to me via Priority Mail. He has taken great care of me - thanks, Eric!</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie to you perfect strangers I&#x27;m lazy. I used to work that pumice stone and just give up because my feet get callused pretty badly in the summer. I just whip this guy out and boom it takes about 30 seconds for what used to be 10+ minutes of hard scrubbing. The best part is you can use this wet or dry. So if you miss a small spot you don&#x27;t have to re-soak your feet to soften them. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love it. I used it right away. I felt like I had a new set of feet. Getting just some of that dead skin of my feet made them fell like they could breath again.</li>
    <li> I first purchased a Pedi-Egg brand foot file at Walmart for $15; thinking I got a bargain. Wrong!! It did not perform anywhere near as well as this one! This thing gives you a soft, smooth pedicure like you&#x27;d have professionally done  I bought another one of these, as I was going to give as a gift; and it is terrible!! This one (looks identical in same packaging) makes an awful noise, as if motor is strained, and it turns in reverse. You have to flip it over in your hand, uncomfortable; because the roller spins backwards. It does not work well at all compared to the first one. I cannot return it because time has lapsed, was keeping as gift. My daughter gave it back!!</li>
    <li> love it smooth feet the salon is going to miss me ;]</li>
    <li> Love this thing.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> This tech pedi is just what I have been searching for. I was using a ped egg and only used it about once a month. But it was time consuming and I tried to do it as fast as I could after I would shower and dry my feet off. This is fast, easy and effortless. Also does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have tried many others and this one did the trick!</li>
    <li> Works real good got my rough feet nice and smooth</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my sisters and wife. They like it.</li>
    <li> This is FANTASTIC.  I was able to remove several years of old dead skin from my feet.  My feet looked worse than the model&#x27;s &#x27;Before&#x27; picture and now my feet look almost perfect.  A few days of lotion and one more quick pedicure with this will probably put my feet in a perfect condition.  It took me about 45 mins per foot but my feet were extremely bad.  It would probably take much less time for most people.  You get your money&#x27;s worth.  This costs a lot less than paying someone to give you a pedicure and it is nice to do it in the privacy of your own home.  Even if someone were to use this only once, they&#x27;ve already saved a lot of money compared to a paid pedicure.  BUT...I plan to use this much more than one time.  This will be my new &#x27;go to&#x27; tool for taking care of my feet.</li>
    <li> When I first opened it, I thought it was great. It didn&#x27;t really feel cheap like I thought it would. It works relatively well on my feet. I mostly use it on the heels of my feet. When I try to used it on the middle part of the soles it doesn&#x27;t work too well. You have to lightly go over where you want to use the product. When you press hard it stops.</li>
    <li> For the money, it&#x27;s OK. I don&#x27;t think it works as well as it shows, but it helps. I had to replace the batteries and it didn&#x27;t work. Not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Stops working with any pressure applied.  Useless...</li>
    <li> Nice foot tool!!! Love the color!! I saw it in the store and it was cheaper on line. The grinding stones really do work and if you apply a foot balm. It&#x27;s just like a pedicure from the foot salon.</li>
    <li> I did not expect it to work this well. If your feet are very dry and cracked then make sure you take your time for best results. Such a dramatic difference with just one use. Love it!</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the Nature Tech Pedi! Great price and worked well.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchase. Used it immediately and it worked great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work good at all</li>
    <li> Great item and vendor.</li>
    <li> Love this, only thing that has gotten My feet this smooth and almost Callus free</li>
    <li> It stopped working after first use.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product way to go to the makers I will recommend this to everyone I know</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me,not powerful enough but customer Svc is great,I had a rep who contacted me to find out what the problem was and walk me thru how to properly use product but I still did not find it strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;I have small to mod Calus build up over winter and this did not help in removal.&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you use the right batteries as instructed in product.&lt;br /&gt;Product was returnedðŸ˜¥</li>
    <li> My feet have gone from callous&#x27; allover to nice &amp; soft after just a few minutes!</li>
    <li> Got a pair of these for me and hubby and it works great! Really seeing results on my feet!</li>
    <li> Yes the Naturetech works really well and does the job it is claiming. I am pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that you might not like is the noise it makes while do a very good job.</li>
    <li> Great product...I saw results after my first use!</li>
