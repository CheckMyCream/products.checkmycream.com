      <li>I love this Duo Brush On Lash Adhesive...</li>
      <li>am glad I bought 2.</li>
      <li>This product was ok</li>
      <li>It tends to clump around the threads and top of the applicator.</li>
      <li>Easy on easy off!</li>
      <li>Allows the user to apply a more precise amount of glue while still wearing the lash.</li>
      <li>it works well, holds well, the tube is full, and I recommend this to anybody, and I would prefer this glue to the tube glue for strip lashes, just because of the ease of use!</li>
      <li>If there is a way where the glue does not leak out, this product is a dream come true!</li>
      <li>It dries very quickly making the container all sticky around the opening</li>
      <li>Overall the Duo brand is excellent, but whomever invented this one baby, let me tell you, they tried it, got it right</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s FORMALDEHYDE FREE (Causes Cancer).</li>
      <li>Quick, easy, neat,</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, dries quickly and goes on</li>
      <li>Most of my reviews are positive.</li>
      <li>I had always used the regular Duo glue and really loved it, but the brush...</li>
      <li>not so adhesive as i thought but still not bad</li>
      <li>I prefer this glue to the regular stuff - the lashes stick better, longer, and it dries faster!</li>
      <li>Then too boot, My upper lid got a nice reaction</li>
      <li>, it is hard to get it to work, but once you get it to it works good!</li>
      <li>Its as good as any other lash glue.</li>
      <li>, It dries clear, Lasting power is amazing!</li>
      <li>So I bought this, only to be less then impressed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;DO NOT BUY the clear version, stick with the tried, tested and true!</li>
      <li>I think they intentionally goofed up this new glue because when it first came out it was so fantastic</li>
      <li>ohhhh having the brush really changed my life!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and Ã­tem as described!</li>
      <li>But I definitely prefer this brush-on version more than the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping !</li>
      <li>Better than the blue duo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately when this item got to me, it was solid and the top was glued on.</li>
      <li>Application is SO much easier!</li>
      <li>people have mentioned that there is a slight light blue tint when you first apply it- true, but that quickly (in seconds) turns clear when the product dries.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular brand for years and will not use anything else; I can only speak for myself but this is the best eyelash glue I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The inner and outer edges were a bit loose but that is still pretty good for my whole head being dunked into water</li>
      <li>On Lash Adhesive is so much easier to use than the glue from the tube.</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>They were definitely not falling off and they still felt comfortable on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>really thought the reviews SOLD me on this product.</li>
      <li>and you couldn&#x27;t tell unless you looked very closely.</li>
      <li>DUO Brush On Striplash Adhesive Glue works very well.  </li>
      <li>I really like this glue.</li>
      <li>so you can see where you applied too much</li>
      <li>It gets tacky really fast and stays all day.</li>
      <li>Much easier than the adhesives in a tube.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So easy to apply on, makes applying false lashes easy and fast!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not gooey when you apply, it does not dry up immediately but can be applied right away &amp; still sticks to eyelid</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really tell where the clear glue is that&#x27;s why it gets in your eye.</li>
      <li>I want to beleive this product (or manufacturer) is worth the praise, yet my personal experience states otherwise....</li>
      <li>Maybe once in a while this would be OK, but certainly not for daily use.</li>
      <li>I used this to wear false eyelashes at a party and was pushed into a pool, and they stayed on the rest of the day without any touching up!</li>
      <li>I especially love that it goes on clear because if you slip up at all, you&#x27;ll never see the evidence left behind like you do with black lash glue.  </li>
      <li>This review is for the clear version of the glue.</li>
      <li>I use this to apply my clients false lashes and I must say that it works amazingly well for the price.</li>
      <li>Then the bristles of the brush started to bend in an upward direction and stay that way, so at least it&#x27;s cheap enough to buy a fresh bottle anyway.</li>
      <li>The thin brush makes applying the adhesive to your falsies very easy and controlled.  </li>
      <li>I just began wearing eyelashes, and it takes a few times to get it right!  </li>
      <li>The thin applicator brush makes it extremely easy to apply to the weft of the lashes or the waterline of the eyelid without adding to much and having it run.</li>
      <li>adhesive is easy to remove by simply &amp; gently pulling the false lashes from the outer corner to the inner corner of your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The glue doesn&#x27;t dry flexibly, gets really stiff and falls off easily because it doesn&#x27;t adhere to the shape of your eye.</li>
      <li>It usually takes me 3 tries before i can get it to apply to my lash line correctly and gives the glue look after so many attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This dries on clear and has lasted me several hours when applied.</li>
      <li>It goes on white and dries clear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different glues and this one by far is the easiest to use.  </li>
      <li>So much easier to use than the other ones by Duo.</li>
      <li>Takes to long to dry, I prefer revlon in the tube with brush dry fast and clear.</li>
      <li>The brush-on application is why I purchased this, and indeed makes it easy to apply a thin line.</li>
      <li>Its good because it has a brush that is fine and delicate... it tends to get overly sticky though which disappointed me.</li>
      <li>Make sure to wipe that off as soon as people because the glue becomes tacky, otherwise you&#x27;ll be missing a few strands of hair!</li>
      <li>Its decent for my first time wearing false lashes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> DUO Brush On Striplash Adhesive Glue works very well.  The thin brush makes applying the adhesive to your falsies very easy and controlled.  Much easier than the adhesives in a tube.  The adhesive needs a few seconds to set on the falsies before the application to your eyelash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Once your false eyelashes are in place they stay put!!  Flutter all you want!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive is easy to remove by simply &amp; gently pulling the false lashes from the outer corner to the inner corner of your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;3 This adhesive!!</li>
    <li> I ended up having to get a refund because when I received the product it was in one solid chunk. Think it froze.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have allergies to latex and I do prefer the one in the tube....This one is alright, but does not hold as well as the one in the tube..</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Have been having problems with the regular glue all year for some reason and basically gave up the eyelashes until I found this. Quick, easy, neat, and my eyelashes stayed put all night!</li>
    <li> This adhesive works great like the latex glue with out the latex. I would recommend this adhesive to anyone with or with out a latex allergy. Thank you</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions, but this adhesive did not work for me and it stings my eyes each time I applied it to my lashes.</li>
    <li> Duo Brush-On Lash Adhesive is so much easier to use than the glue from the tube. It goes on white and dries clear. Lashes stay on your eye lids all day and night.</li>
    <li> My professional makeup artist told me about this product because it was the best eyelash glue she had used. I have had more expensive products than this but yet I still keep coming back to this. I especially love that it goes on clear because if you slip up at all, you&#x27;ll never see the evidence left behind like you do with black lash glue.  The only downside I noticed was that as time goes on, the whole bottle and wand gets really messy and the product squeezes out as you tighten the Brush in the cap onto the tube. Then the bristles of the brush started to bend in an upward direction and stay that way, so at least it&#x27;s cheap enough to buy a fresh bottle anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash glue! It is easy to apply, dries quickly and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned that there is a slight light blue tint when you first apply it- true, but that quickly (in seconds) turns clear when the product dries.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular brand for years and will not use anything else; I can only speak for myself but this is the best eyelash glue I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I got the duo brush on because i thought it would be easier to use than the tube, it actually is very hard to get it to work. It dries very quickly making the container all sticky around the opening and you cannot wait the recommended 30 seconds before applying. Actually the timing is hard to get right too, too early or late and it won&#x27;t stick. It usually takes me 3 tries before i can get it to apply to my lash line correctly and gives the glue look after so many attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, because it has the vitamins in it, and the different formula it does not feel too heavy or itch my eyelids at all! and once it is actually applied correctly (on all sides) your lashes stay put! In fact they stayed on for 2 and a half days while I was on vacation and at a theme park, going 60mph plus on rollercoasters until the sides finally popped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is hard to get it to work, but once you get it to it works good!</li>
    <li> I use this to apply my clients false lashes and I must say that it works amazingly well for the price. The thin applicator brush makes it extremely easy to apply to the weft of the lashes or the waterline of the eyelid without adding to much and having it run. I would definitely recommend this product and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I prefer this glue to the regular stuff - the lashes stick better, longer, and it dries faster! Latex free, and definitely less irritating for me as a contact wearer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different glues and this one by far is the easiest to use.  The brush applicator makes application a breeze</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and Ã­tem as described!</li>
    <li> The brush applicator makes it way easier to apply to eyelashes to ensure that glue gets all over the lash strip. However be very careful to close the lid tightly or else this will dry up.</li>
    <li> This review is for the clear version of the glue. I&#x27;ve used a few lash glues and the white/black ones have always been fine, but this clear version is terrible! It has fumes that sting your eyes while the glue is drying, making your eyes water and smudge your makeup. The glue doesn&#x27;t dry flexibly, gets really stiff and falls off easily because it doesn&#x27;t adhere to the shape of your eye. When you remove the lashes, it&#x27;s really hard to peel off the glue, so you can&#x27;t reuse your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY the clear version, stick with the tried, tested and true!</li>
    <li> I really like this glue. It gets tacky really fast and stays all day.</li>
    <li> Love this glue. So much easier to use than the other ones by Duo. I feel like I waste less product bc of the brush.</li>
    <li> Love this glue!  Easy on easy off!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and watching tutorials, I purchased this product.  Its decent for my first time wearing false lashes. I did have to learn to let it almost dry before placing it on my lid.</li>
    <li> Its good because it has a brush that is fine and delicate... it tends to get overly sticky though which disappointed me. I think they intentionally goofed up this new glue because when it first came out it was so fantastic, a pair of false eyelashes could last you a month with this stuff..... because its the glue that ruins them... but, as we know girls, the same companies make the lashes and the glue. Anyway I tried to outrun them and  I rushed to buy a half dozen of these before they realized they made a glue that was so good lash sales would drop,  but the formula was already changed.... profit before integrity: the american way... sad, stupid, but true.  Anyway... Its as good as any other lash glue. I still like it.</li>
    <li> Omg! I&#x27;m in heaven when I discovered this \\&quot;Brush On\\&quot; glue from DUO. I like it because #1 it&#x27;s FORMALDEHYDE FREE (Causes Cancer). The other Duo Glue (Blue &amp; White) I bought from sephora contained the formaldehyde which I did not know at the time.  But this Glue is Great for these reasons: No Smell, It&#x27;s not gooey when you apply, it does not dry up immediately but can be applied right away &amp; still sticks to eyelid, It&#x27;s white so you can see where you applied too much, It dries clear, Lasting power is amazing! I fell asleep with the fake lashes on &amp; it was still on overnight, &amp; lastly - you never have to re-apply because it stays on all day without false lash coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Ardell brush on in clear &amp; so disappointed because it  Stings, Smells bad like toxic,dries up fast &amp; looses it&#x27;s stickiness, lashes comes off after a few hours, need to re-apply. When it gets in your eye - it hurts bad. You can&#x27;t really tell where the clear glue is that&#x27;s why it gets in your eye. Totally opposite of the Duo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duo Brush On - Love Love this Product!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye lashes glue...holds really good!!</li>
    <li> I love this fact that this has a brush as a tip, makes it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Less messy and soo much easier to put on lashes! Better than the blue duo. I can get the ends without any problems.</li>
    <li> I had always used the regular Duo glue and really loved it, but the brush... ohhhh having the brush really changed my life! Application is SO much easier! I just brush it along the lash band and wait for the glue to turn a little less opaque then stick the little guys on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately when this item got to me, it was solid and the top was glued on. It has been below freezing here lately- so perhaps something happened in shipping.</li>
    <li> Most of my reviews are positive. There are a few that state my dislike. This would be one of them! I hate this product because it did not live up to my expectationsâ¦at all!  It was watery; not at all like Duo adhesive in a tube. In addition, it had a strange blueish iridescent color and had absolutely no hold! If I put a piece of chewed up gum on them-that would have held the lashes better than this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best glue for eyelashes, and it perfect for me, since I put the glue directly on my eyelid, as opposed to the eyelashes.  No more need for the eyeliner brush and glue.  It&#x27;s all in one!</li>
    <li> not so adhesive as i thought but still not bad</li>
    <li> It tends to clump around the threads and top of the applicator. As such it can get stuck. And you lose some of the product &#x27;cuz it dries there.</li>
    <li> I love that this has an applicator and the formula does not irritate my lashes at all. Definitely my favorite lash glue</li>
    <li> The brush-on application is why I purchased this, and indeed makes it easy to apply a thin line. The glue stays put all day, however, I had to severely deduct stars because of how hard it is to remove. It doesn&#x27;t fully dry, so at the end of the night, there is still tacky leftover adhesive on your eyelid that needs to be scraped off rather harshly. Maybe once in a while this would be OK, but certainly not for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have not tried othe one so I can not compare with any other products. Easy to use ! Fast shipping ! Thank you!</li>
    <li> You literally brush the glue onto the eyelash and wait 30 seconds. Just take your time applying the glue because there are occasions where you may miss and get some on the hairs of the eyelash. Make sure to wipe that off as soon as people because the glue becomes tacky, otherwise you&#x27;ll be missing a few strands of hair! But I definitely prefer this brush-on version more than the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great for when those stubborn corners just refuse to stick. Allows the user to apply a more precise amount of glue while still wearing the lash.</li>
    <li> Takes to long to dry, I prefer revlon in the tube with brush dry fast and clear. This product was ok</li>
    <li> really thought the reviews SOLD me on this product. So I bought this, only to be less then impressed. Waited for the &amp;#34;tasky&amp;#34; ness to arrive , It did within the 30 secs alotment. Problem was...it didnt keep my eyelashes staying. Then too boot, My upper lid got a nice reaction ( I  must be alergic to this glue!!). If anyone can recommend a Hypo allergenic kind, please share. I want to beleive this product (or manufacturer) is worth the praise, yet my personal experience states otherwise....</li>
    <li> I love this Duo Brush On Lash Adhesive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to apply on, makes applying false lashes easy and fast!</li>
    <li> I really love this Duo glue. It works really well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand of brush-on false eyelash adhesive and it was a nightmare: burning, no staying power, etc. However, DUO&#x27;s products have always been top-notch and this brush-on adhesive does not deviate away from their reknowned quality at all. I used this to wear false eyelashes at a party and was pushed into a pool, and they stayed on the rest of the day without any touching up! The inner and outer edges were a bit loose but that is still pretty good for my whole head being dunked into water and you couldn&#x27;t tell unless you looked very closely. They were definitely not falling off and they still felt comfortable on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking a star off for the packaging, the glue is leaking out of the cap and making the tube sticky. If there is a way where the glue does not leak out, this product is a dream come true!</li>
    <li> The glue sucks, doesn&#x27;t stick well like my other DUO. It&#x27;s thin and dries clear but it just doesn&#x27;t do the job. I also hate the applicator.</li>
    <li> I just began wearing eyelashes, and it takes a few times to get it right!  With this thin line brush on glue, all you do is place a very small amount on the brush, put it on the lash, line it up and go!  I will not ever be using any other type of lash adhesive.  Overall the Duo brand is excellent, but whomever invented this one baby, let me tell you, they tried it, got it right and I&#x27;m thanking them for this product!  You GO DUO ,)!</li>
    <li> THE BEST. I love this glue.</li>
    <li> this is now my favorite falsies glue! it is soo easy to use, I love it! it works well, holds well, the tube is full, and I recommend this to anybody, and I would prefer this glue to the tube glue for strip lashes, just because of the ease of use!</li>
    <li> Very good indeed, buy some for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;Long wearing and good for your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought 2.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  I have been a fan but this is the best ever.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The glue is near impossible to remove from the lash band after use. I had no issues to remove the red and blue DUO adhesive, but the green one I am having major issues.</li>
    <li> This dries on clear and has lasted me several hours when applied.</li>
