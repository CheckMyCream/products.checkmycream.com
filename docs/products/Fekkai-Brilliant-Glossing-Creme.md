      <li>I have used this for years and love how it feels.  </li>
      <li>Seems pricey, but you don&#x27;t use but a pea size amount (I use a bit more) per application, so</li>

      <li>This one is worth the money!</li>
      <li>Lovely, gentle Fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work best in conjunction with other leave-in products (like the Fekkai pot de creme), so I mainly use it for finishing touches.  </li>
      <li>this 2 oz size, frankly because at present this was the best value, being offered ounce per dollar cheaper than the larger tubes.  </li>
      <li>I liked the results so much, I have been back many times to make retail purchases of this product on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Super shiny, soft, and healthy looking.</li>

      <li>The scent is light and fresh, but I don&#x27;t get much shine.  </li>
      <li>#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; *</li>
      <li>This is a nice creme to use when hair is dry but nothing special.</li>
      <li>My ends are kind of dry hair from getting highlights over the years.  </li>
      <li>I have VERY curly, unruly, and frizzie hair -- this product worked like a charm on a very hot and humid Savannah day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a holy grail for us frizzy-hair-havers, especially if you live in more humid climates!</li>
      <li>Used by itself, it&#x27;s only okay.  </li>
      <li>I will be back for more.</li>
      <li>Makes my coarse hair really soft and has a nice, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Works great to add some control and a LOT of shine to my hair which is thick and wavy.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Works okay for my very curly hair, but not as well as the sample I received from one of the &#x27;big box&#x27; cosmetics stores.  </li>
      <li>I love this for frizzy, dry hair.  </li>
      <li>I only need a pea size amount and it covers all of my hair just fine.</li>
      <li>I started using the cream regularly and have seen a huge change in my hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does make hair shine and...</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very glossy.</li>
      <li>Really nice product, I have very short kept hair but just enough hold and some added shine.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and just a dot goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>This glossing creme makes my hair very soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>Love this product, adds a little shine and body to your hair.</li>
      <li>Really makes my hair baby soft.  </li>
      <li>So, the price is well worth it since you will only need this product alone.</li>
      <li>Smells great, a tiny drop goes a long way (don&#x27;t use too much or it will make your hair heavy).</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t find it at our usual department stores and am glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>cant truly describe it.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to style as usual though with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way on my oh-so-very-straight hair, and the smell is nice.  </li>
      <li>The is only the second time I have purchased this, as the first time I bought a large tube, which I couldn&#x27;t use fast enough for it to stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A few years ago I received a tube of Fekkai Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me as a free promotion via Amazon&#x27;s Vine product evaluation program.  </li>
      <li>I only use maybe a pea size drop and rub it between my palms and gently rub on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It added shine and control to my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are countless hair products out there promising \\&quot;Silky</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look greasy, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>If you use too much it does go on looking greasy but if you wait about an hour or blow dry, it will give you the smoothness and silkiness of your dreams.</li>
      <li>small tube is a better choice as it takes so long to use it up.</li>
      <li>Have to be careful not to use too much though.  </li>
      <li>If you use too much, it tends to make hair a little greasy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff really does make hair shine and... with short (which I have) makes styling a breeze. Smells good also to me anyway.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and just a dot goes a long way.  Really makes my hair baby soft.  Love it.</li>
    <li> REALLY love this product.  Works great to add some control and a LOT of shine to my hair which is thick and wavy.  Have to be careful not to use too much though.  I only use maybe a pea size drop and rub it between my palms and gently rub on my hair.  The shine it gives is amazing!</li>
    <li> Works okay for my very curly hair, but not as well as the sample I received from one of the &#x27;big box&#x27; cosmetics stores.  I still prefer Hair One.</li>
    <li> This glossing creme makes my hair very soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> The ONLY smoother/glossing I&#x27;ll use! Doesn&#x27;t look greasy, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> It does add shine, but it didn&#x27;t last for long, it was temporary. Really nice scent!</li>
    <li> Love this product, adds a little shine and body to your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair shine like nothing else! I wish it did a better job taming the frizzeis but it does help. Only a small amount is needed so this tube lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> Light, not greasy, and smells great. Takes my puffy head of hair and calms it down to normal.</li>
    <li> This is the best after-wash-and-conditioner product I&#x27;ve found. My hair is shiny and manageable without being sticky or stiffly controlled.</li>
    <li> Hmmm...does it impart shine to the hair? Yes, it does.&lt;br /&gt;However I felt that it just sat on my hair, kind of coated it. Did not seem to penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt odd when I applied it to my wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very  nice, but I expected to feel an instant softness to my hair when I used this. Instead my hair felt weird and somewhat stiff/dry...cant truly describe it.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to style as usual though with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Wen glossing serum, although it&#x27;s terribly overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;This one seems pricey too.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations. It added shine and control to my naturally curly hair. I like the fact that you only have to use a pea size amount for it to work.  Helps to defeat frizz in humid conditions.</li>
    <li> My ends are kind of dry hair from getting highlights over the years.  I apply this to the ends of my hair and it really does a great job of smoothing and giving some shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! Gives your hair a nice silky look without it looking greasy</li>
    <li> The product is excellent except the scent. I prefer  stuff of no scent.</li>
    <li> Because of my hair&#x27;s coarse texture, I&#x27;m not one of those who can use only a pea- or dime-sized amount, so the 4 oz. would&#x27;ve been a better buy for me.  Used by itself, it&#x27;s only okay.  The scent is light and fresh, but I don&#x27;t get much shine.  It seems to work best in conjunction with other leave-in products (like the Fekkai pot de creme), so I mainly use it for finishing touches.  This is for those whose hair doesn&#x27;t require something a little heavier.</li>
    <li> wow! love this stuff, it makes my hair so shiny and silky!</li>
    <li> Fekkai has a great line of hair products.  I just started using it.  I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> not much effect shows up</li>
    <li> I love this glossing cream!!! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I hope it will not be discontinued!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find it at our usual department stores and am glad to find it on Amazon. Will keep the subscription for a while. This is a good brand and great product for permed hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! After using it I have barbie hair. Super shiny, soft, and healthy looking. I have fine hair but a lot of it and was nervous seeing as some of the reviews pointed out that using too much would give you greasy hair. I only need a pea size amount and it covers all of my hair just fine. Granted it is semi-expensive, but unlike other products you only need the creme. Not a leave-in conditioner, heat protector, etc. So, the price is well worth it since you will only need this product alone. Definitely buying again!</li>
    <li> A few years ago I received a tube of Fekkai Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me as a free promotion via Amazon&#x27;s Vine product evaluation program.  I liked the results so much, I have been back many times to make retail purchases of this product on Amazon.  I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are countless hair products out there promising \\&quot;Silky Shine\\&quot; . . . and leave you with hair like dry steel wool.  Fekkai delivers as promised.  Seems pricey, but you don&#x27;t use but a pea size amount (I use a bit more) per application, so a tube goes a long way.  Great fragrance too.  Suitable for women or men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased (and am reviewing) this 2 oz size, frankly because at present this was the best value, being offered ounce per dollar cheaper than the larger tubes.  And it is small enough for airport carry-on luggage!</li>
    <li> I L*O*V*E this amazing Fekkai Glossing Creme! A little goes a long way! Lovely, gentle Fragrance.  Smooth, glossy shine to finish. No greasy residue to weigh-down your hair.  I have VERY curly, unruly, and frizzie hair -- this product worked like a charm on a very hot and humid Savannah day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; *</li>
    <li> This produce is non sticky, non greasy, and lightweight and smells good. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> works well but i didn&#x27;t realize the very small amount of product.  For over 7 bucks i&#x27;d think there would have been more.  Smells good and helps with frizz.</li>
    <li> Love the smell...defrizzes hair and makes it sleeker.</li>
    <li> Wow, this formula is great!  A little goes a long way on my oh-so-very-straight hair, and the smell is nice.  Talk about shine!  People WILL notice, but they won&#x27;t suspect a glossing product.  This one is worth the money!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way when it comes to shine. (Don&#x27;t over-do, it doesn&#x27;t look as well).  Sometimes I mix it with another leave-in conditioner - both in small doses - to get both softness and shine.</li>
    <li> Wonderful feel and really amps up the shine, smooths out any hint of frizzies and keeps hair sleek. I got a small tube of this as a sample and have been purchasing from Amazon ever since because local availability is spotty. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotional item in my influenster box and I love it! I started using the cream regularly and have seen a huge change in my hair. I beat the s*** out of my hair. I bleach it every 2 months, I wash it every other day then go on to blowing it out and straighten it. This cream has helped me have nice shinny hair and it has also helped with my flyaways. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love how my hair looks after using this.  I blow dry and then apply a small amount mid-shaft to the ends.  Makes my hair very glossy.</li>
    <li> the shampoo and gloss made my hair softer.  I liked the products</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Bought a big tube years ago that lasted forever. Smells great, a tiny drop goes a long way (don&#x27;t use too much or it will make your hair heavy). Makes my coarse hair really soft and has a nice, fresh smell. This time I bought the smallest tube possible since you use so little.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and love how it feels.  Use just a tiny bit....for me that is no more than small pea size.  The is only the second time I have purchased this, as the first time I bought a large tube, which I couldn&#x27;t use fast enough for it to stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small tube is a better choice as it takes so long to use it up.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing a recommendation from a makeup guru on uTube.  It does a good job...makes hair shiny and smooth.  However, a little goes a long way.  If you use too much, it tends to make hair a little greasy.  Has a nice smell.  I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a nice creme to use when hair is dry but nothing special.</li>
    <li> I love this for frizzy, dry hair.  Doesn&#x27;t look greasy or flatten my hair out.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Nothing but this will work to tame my frizzy, frazzled, coarse, dry hair! If you use too much it does go on looking greasy but if you wait about an hour or blow dry, it will give you the smoothness and silkiness of your dreams. I have waist length hair and I use a bit less than a quarter sized amount. People are always complimenting me on my hair now! Oh and did I mention it smells like honeysuckle? This is a holy grail for us frizzy-hair-havers, especially if you live in more humid climates!</li>
    <li> Really nice product, I have very short kept hair but just enough hold and some added shine.</li>
</ol>
