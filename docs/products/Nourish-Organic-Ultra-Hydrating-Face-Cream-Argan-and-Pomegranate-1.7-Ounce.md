      <li>A light moisturizer that dries to a matte finish.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the intensive citrus note has nothing to do with the smell of rosewater;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the lotion itself is neither moisturizing nor nourishing, it feels like a cheap hand</li>
      <li>It makes my skin hydrated and smooth.  </li>

      <li>The real product is probably amazing.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Organic Aloe Leaf Juice, Shea Butter, Autolyzed Yeast, Organic Argan Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Organic Soy Lecithin, Organic Rose Flower Distillate, Xanthan Gum, Organic Rice Bran Extract, Organic Sweet Orange Essential Oil, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Acai Fruit oil, Vitamin E and Vitamin</li>
      <li>Natural is not always better in some cases.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make you break out and gives a nice base for a foundation when needed.</li>
      <li>About me: Combination skin (dryer in winter/more oily in summer), sensitive skin, moisturize daily and fair complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am pregnant, so I am very cautious about what I put into/on my body.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Made my face red, must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I first heard about this product through a sample I received in the mail.</li>
      <li>Nourish organics is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I first tried this as an Ipsy bag sample.  </li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>I have used SO many facial products and now that my skin has changed at the age of 46 I am breaking out.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a lightweight moisturizer that was safe and would help my dry face without being too greasy.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin or looking for a good anti-aging moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>During this cold winter, nourishing, moisturizing face lotion or cream is very important to people like me who takes good care of their skin.</li>
      <li>Yes its very lightweight.</li>
      <li>this is REALLY</li>
      <li>But I contacted Nourish Orgnaics after seeing their website sold out of the moisturizer and serums and asked if what is sold on Amazon is the real product.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>since I don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>Use the pump very close to your hands or you will have a Something About Mary moment and lose your just-pumped product..</li>
      <li>Thanks to that</li>
      <li>The bottle feels a bit small to me (1.7oz), so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but the trial size I got from Ipsy was great, so I had to buy a full size!</li>
      <li>Feels a bit tight on the skin, for lack of a better description.</li>
      <li>We live in a very dry climate and the lotion still manages to be moisturizing, while still light.  </li>
      <li>I have very very very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I believe the price for the amount is a little excessive however its a great product and quality nonetheless.</li>
      <li>The bottle was a little smaller than I thought, but thats okay</li>
      <li>On a trip to whole foods to get some essential oils, I was given a sample of this face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I also really like the cleanser and serum from the same product line.  </li>
      <li>One pump doesn&#x27;t look like much, but is enough to cover my whole face, so I expect the bottle to last a while.  </li>
      <li>I have developed rush after two days using this cream and the company would not let me return it.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes completely, without leaving my face feeling greasy or looking shiny.  </li>
      <li>This stuff also seeps into my skin instantly, which I really like as well.</li>
      <li>I have oily, adult, hereditary, acne-prone skin and even though this says its for normal to dry, its really lightweight.</li>
      <li>My previous daily face moisturizer was no longer available, company went out of business</li>
      <li>I like to try new product, especially face product.</li>
      <li>My skin is dry but sensitive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The real product is probably amazing.  But I contacted Nourish Orgnaics after seeing their website sold out of the moisturizer and serums and asked if what is sold on Amazon is the real product.  They said it is...BUT that they recalled all of their moisturizers and serums back to 2014 due to complaints of them not being up to standard.  So what you&#x27;re buying is a recalled product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, like an organic sweet tart for your face. I have very dry, red skin and it is lovely. Feels a bit tight on the skin, for lack of a better description. Moisturizes well. Caution: Use the pump very close to your hands or you will have a Something About Mary moment and lose your just-pumped product..pump is very strong!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make you break out and gives a nice base for a foundation when needed. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have developed rush after two days using this cream and the company would not let me return it. Beware once you buy it, you cannot return it if you used it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful face lotion, light and not oily at all. Best if used with the cucumber face wash, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer. I wear it over a serum during the day and under my shea butter at night.  Not moisturizing enough for me on it&#x27;s own. In my teens &amp; twenties it would have been, but now in my forties I need something heavier.</li>
    <li> Yes its very lightweight. But it makes no difference on your skin. No smoothness no clarity no nothing</li>
    <li> This is now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; facial moisturizer.  It has made a big difference in the softness of my skin.  Much better than any of the expensive, synthetic, chemical lotions on the market.  Natural is always best!</li>
    <li> A light moisturizer that dries to a matte finish. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and don&#x27;t plan on using another daytime moisturizer anytime soon.</li>
    <li> A very light moisturizer. Sometimes I still feel a little dry after using this. It doesn&#x27;t break me out though. The bottle is small and it takes a lot of lotion to cover your face.</li>
    <li> About me: Combination skin (dryer in winter/more oily in summer), sensitive skin, moisturize daily and fair complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About it: a little goes a LONG WAY! I can make a dime size max cover all of my face and neck. The smell- ehhh. I wasnt keen on the smell, but Im not a fan of citrusy smells and i felt like all I could smell was orange and clay for some reason. It wasnt enough to turn me off. It left me a bit heavy feeling but once it soaks in it wasnt bad. I did notice that it didnt play well with some of my foundations so a little trial and error may be in order. If nothing else, use powder to set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How i used it: I used it for my night time moisturizer in the winter. its a bit too much for my summer routine or right before i put on base.</li>
    <li> Michelle Phan has recommended this lotion, so I just bought for a try.&lt;br /&gt;And this is REALLY GOOD!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a good smelling like a flower I guess, and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a combine skin condition(dry+oil), but this lotion is very light and suitable for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It actually moisture my face but haven&#x27;t make my face oily.&lt;br /&gt;So I really like it! XP</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it after I have washed my face and before I put on my makeup each morning.  I will use from here on out!!!</li>
    <li> I am pregnant, so I am very cautious about what I put into/on my body. On a trip to whole foods to get some essential oils, I was given a sample of this face moisturizer. I was looking for a lightweight moisturizer that was safe and would help my dry face without being too greasy. This product is amazing. The face lotion is a great size, easy to carry in my purse, I use it twice a day. It works so well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or shiny. I am absolutely in love with the smell. To me it smells like a mix of citrus, more like pink grapefruit than rose. I am in LOVE with this product!! Thank you Nourish Organics 😍</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! After searching for months and spending a lot of money, I finally found the perfect lotion for my face. My previous daily face moisturizer was no longer available, company went out of business so I was forced to hunt for a new one. Nourish organics is exactly what I needed. Lightweight,smells wonderful and it&#x27;s organic so I&#x27;m not rubbing unneeded chemicals into my skin. Love love love this product. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>

This is a great find, and I will definitely be purchasing this again.  I love argan oil by itself, but in this combination, I get the benefits of two great ingredients.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin or looking for a good anti-aging moisturizer.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> This was a surprise. It evens out my skin because there is a bit of tint to it. It feels wonderful and looks good on my face.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh and non-sticky feeling when I use this! I love the smell too!!</li>
    <li> I first tried this as an Ipsy bag sample.  Thanks to that, I decided to buy the full size version. We live in a very dry climate and the lotion still manages to be moisturizing, while still light.  My skin is dry but sensitive.  It never causes irritation or breakouts. The lotion goes on easily and absorbs quickly without residue.  I find it very lightly scented which is neither appealing nor off-putting.</li>

I have oily, adult, hereditary, acne-prone skin and even though this says its for normal to dry, its really lightweight.

I can definitely see this bottle lasting me 6-8 months.</li>
    <li> Very light which works well in humid weather - never shiny but I need a serum underneath to fully hydrate.</li>
    <li> Love nourish and this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint, absorbs quickly non greasy. Smells great doesn&#x27;t seem to break out my sensitive skin!</li>

    <li> I have used SO many facial products and now that my skin has changed at the age of 46 I am breaking out. This product does not make me break out and my skin feels real smooth and nourished. :o)</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this lotion again. It has a weird, sort of sour smell and is very thin.</li>
