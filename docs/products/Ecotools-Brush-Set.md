<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super practical, very soft and easy to handle</li>
    <li> Convenient because it has 4 brushes in 2 sticks so it takes up less room. I love Eco tools, its always worked great for me and it is eco friendly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now a big fan of Eco Tools after my last 2 purchased. Never disappointed! So soft and comfort grib. This duo brush set is a space saver and perfect combination. It&#x27;s all you need for eye make-up. If you are looking for an eye make-up brushes, get this one!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup brush fanatic, and these would make my top cut. I highly recommend them to anyone&#x27;s makeup bag. Perfect for detail work, lid coverage, and blending.  Good job EcoTools!</li>
    <li> These brushes do the job and take up less space.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes and very functional.</li>
    <li> Love it, didnt open from package yet</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, I use them everyday!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about EcoTools brushes. These two brushes (double ended) have become a part of my every day routine</li>
    <li> This is the third set of these brushes I&#x27;ve bought because I&#x27;m so obsessed with them.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast delivery and good price.</li>
    <li> I love these! You&#x27;re not wasting your time grabbing 20 brushes while doing your makeup. With these brushes you only need two. So far they have held up nicely, no shedding.</li>
    <li> This brushes are awesome for my needs. I don&#x27;t see the need for anything more expensive unless you are a professional. The purpose of each brush is written on the wood. They bristles are soft but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall out. The little baggy is a bonus</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really big on makeup, but I like these. There is a description on the back that tells you what to use each brush for. The brushes are soft and haven&#x27;t fallen apart yet. Do people store their brushes in the packaging? I&#x27;m trying to - I cut the folded top off and try to use the bottom part. It&#x27;s not working well, but I won&#x27;t take points off since I don&#x27;t know if that was the intention of the bag.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really convenient and the bristles are really soft.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE these babies. OMG, no shedding. They&#x27;re soft and work beautifully. I love them, and I use them every time I do my makeup, which is almost every day. Love this brand, I even bought a bronzing and fan brush and was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these eye shadow brushes- what a great deal!  The wooden handles are smooth and the bristles are soft.  They do a nice job of applying eye shadow.  I also like that there are two brush heads on each handle- they take up less room in my makeup bag.  An excellent add- on purchase!</li>
    <li> The bristles are super soft except for one, the angled liner brush, so I don&#x27;t use that one that much. The others, though, are very easy to work with and they blend really well.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using makeup brushes. They are soft, sturdy and don&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> I mainly initially purchased these brushes for the one that is flat and angled, Because it&#x27;s the one I like best for liquid liners and also for putting eyeshadow into my creases. I however tried the other ones with it and they are all so great. I love ecotools brushes they are great products at very affordable prices. I use these over high end brushes for every day looks. They are wonderful.</li>
    <li> these are fabulous and great for travel.  You can accomplish an entire eye look with just these two brushes if need be.  Ecotools is a great affordable brush brand.</li>
    <li> these are GREAT brushes... i have many EcoTools brushes and these are definitely my favorite. They are pretty much all you need for many looks. Great quality. Soft, but not too soft.</li>
    <li> Best inexpensive brushes out there!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and brush on smoothly</li>
    <li> Very nice and soft set of brushes.  Use them mainly for eye shadow blending and application.  Worth it for the price</li>
    <li> I was impressed when these when they arrived.  They seem well made and the brushes were really soft.  I tried it with a Maybelline eye shadow and it ended up all over my face instead of just on my eyes.  I gave them another try with Physicians Formula eye shadow and for that one they worked perfectly.  I guess it just depends on the consistency or quality of the shadows you use them with.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Eco Tools products. They are well made and work as well as some of the most expensive make brushes I have owned. Although I am not the biggest fan of double sided brushes I wanted these for convenience and travel. I would just say to be careful not to leave these standing on the brush. These have to be stored flat. Eco friendly and great products! How can that ever be bad? And they are also less money than most of the other brushes I have owned.</li>
    <li> The design of these brushes doesn&#x27;t just make it easier to apply eye shadow, but it also allows for a more precise blending. The bristles feel smooth and soft, as opposed to being too stiff or too pokey like some brushes can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, these particular brushes hold the shadow rather well, until your makeup is applied exactly how you want it, without dropping a lot of shadow dust under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Well made and loving it</li>
    <li> I used these this morning for the first time and am pleased with them. They feel moderately well made and weren&#x27;t shedding bristles as I used them.  I like how they are marked \\&quot;blend, smudge, define, and shade\\&quot; so I know which brush is best for what.  I&#x27;ve never had a two ended makeup brush before, but it&#x27;s easy to use even though it&#x27;s two ended.  I wanted to protect the brushes in my makeup bag by storing them in the case they came in, but it was cumbersome to get them in and out of the bag because of the flap.  so, I cut the flap off and voila!  the perfect storage solution for these brushes.  Overall, I think they are a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked EcoTools, This one&#x27;s more  convenient to carry because has a brush on both ends.</li>
    <li> This is a nice variety pack of makeup brushes. There are two brushes with four brush heads total. So eye liner, shadow and creases needs are met. The wash and dry well with basic brush cleanser are hold up well for the price. You may still want an eyebrow brush and lash separator  as these aren&#x27;t included.</li>
    <li> If you’ve invested in expensive eye makeup brushes, and they’ve worked well for you, this little set may not impress you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have a need for a second or back-up set and don’t expect inexpensive brushes to perform as well or last as long as the more expensive ones, these two brushes are a good option. (There are other factors to consider, including your eye shadow application routine and the actual products you use, which are often a major factor in how well any applicator/brush works.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Good value: They won’t take the place of more expensive makeup brushes, but they do a more than serviceable job of applying, defining and blending eye shadow at a bargain cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable second set for travel; for daily take-along; to leave in an office desk, second home or elsewhere where you’d store them for periodic use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Come packaged in a case that’s good for storage and for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Handle length: Neither too short or too long and easily maneuvered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Feel: Soft on the hand and the eye; not scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Portable: Size and packaging make them easy to tote around in a makeup case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Easily cleaned with soap/water, shampoo, alcohol or special cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Not a replacement for the more expensive brushes with individual, specific application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;The angled brush, which is for “line and define” was the least-effective brush shape for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknown: How long will they last? How well will they wear over time? No bristles fell out during the period I first used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve had some eye makeup brushes for over a decade. (Yes, I clean them weekly.) However, given their cost, if these two only lasted a few months, it would be money well spent.</li>
    <li> These were a gift but I already had purchased the set for myself also. The hairs are very soft and they do not shed. I&#x27;ve washed them a few times too, just in baby shampoo and luke warm water and they&#x27;ve maintained their form. These are the brushes I find I reach for most often.</li>
    <li> I ordered these makeup brushes as a last ditch effort to find an affordable set of eye brushes to replace the ones I had lost.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much of them, but was pleasantly surprised at how well they worked!  They pick up the perfect amount of product and have not had any problems with shedding even though I have used them every day for the past few months.  The one complaint I have is that the angled brush tends to hold on to product and is a little difficult to clean, but other than that - two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great - they allow for different types of eye shadow application, and the bristles don&#x27;t come out like they do with some other makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Ecotools brushes and these are by far my faves. I love that they are double ended and I can get my whole eye done with just these two. They come in a very convenient case. They clean well and never shed. My makeup is always blended well and these brushes make application easy. They far outperform their more expensive counterparts.</li>
    <li> bristles were soft. Picked up product, which is a plus and they were small enough that I could use it on my small lid space</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes and great for travel as they replace four brushes in my make up bag. Will purchase again for friends to try.</li>
    <li> These are great to carry for after gym or touch-up. I have a similar one from Prescriptives and these feel very similar. This is a great buy. AND, if they don&#x27;t last long enough they are inexpensive enough to replace easily... Besides brushes get contaminated and dirty and it&#x27;s good to replace them. GOOD BUY.</li>
    <li> These are great...not Awesome, but great. I love dual brushes, saves me time, because I use 4-5 colors for my eyelids, but I dont wanna spend all day in front of the mirror, switching brushes. Saving time and quality of the brushes is the reason I gave them 5 stars. My fav is still a dual Crown brush I got from Ipsy, but, I dont have 18 dollars to spend on ONE brush....maybe one day when I get rich,lol.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic brushes-- soft, with the right contours.  They&#x27;re made of bamboo and recycled materials, so they&#x27;re earth friendly as well as extremely soft.  Each brush has two ends, so you get four different types of heads.  There are instructions on the package so you know what purpose each brush is meant for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these brushes, but the one drawback is the case!  You need a place to store your brushes to keep them clean and nice, but it&#x27;s so hard to get them back in this case without ruining the bristles.  It&#x27;s cute, but too tight of a fit for double ended brushes.  So the brushes are highly recommended, but I hope they improve the case soon.</li>
    <li> Gives me that beautiful smokey eye if I wanted to. Pretty good with mixing and blending eye shadows.</li>
    <li> the best brushes I have bought! Glad that they are eco friendly.</li>
    <li> I Love EcoTools - great brushes for eyeshadow application, basic application, countour, eyeliner blending, everything you need, with the top quality of EcoTools, nothing more expensive required, and in my opinion, though double-ended brushes are not my favorite, these &amp;#34;two&amp;#34; are the shapes you need to apply eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I did not buy it from Amazon, but I got that set from Walmart and I love this brushes. They have a soft hair which is not damage your eyes and at the same time that are pretty strong! This is very very awesome brushes for that price!</li>
    <li> I brought these to cut down on items to take on vacation. They worked great</li>
    <li> use these daily.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> I have another set of these brushes, so I knew what to expect. They are very well made, and the wooden handles don&#x27;t slip as much as plastic. The bristles are nice and soft.  I find them easy to clean and quite durable. Great tools at a great price and eco-friendly too!</li>
    <li> This little brush set is great for creating beautiful eyeshadow applications.  Two brushes are double-sided giving four different brush shapes.  These brushes can do just about anything I would want to do with my eyeshadow, and they offer good control in a compact size.  They come in a little plastic envelope that is useful for traveling.  These meet my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> love them there very easy to use and feel nice</li>
    <li> The bristles on this are a little too stiff on the blending brush. However they are still very handy to travel with and they are definitely workable.</li>
    <li> I have a makeup box, and a makeup bag for when I need to take makeup essentials with me I love that I get 4 brushes in 2, and that the brushes are small enough to fit in my bag, but are long enough for great control and use! The brushes seem to be holding up really well, and they flow so nicely. Almost better than the $$$ makeup brushes I was given, I would definitely buy these again and recommend them to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> My litmus test on makeup brushes is the softness of the bristles. Not much else matters to me, because if the bristles are still and hard, or rough and don&#x27;t feel good on your face, what&#x27;s the point? I have been looking for smaller makeup brushes for a long time, but each time I feel the bristles, they are rough, or stiff or hard. These are really soft and feel so nice in applying makeup. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a great set the brushes are soft but at the same time strong enough to apply product with little fall out. All brushes work well and it comes handy when I want to travel.</li>
    <li> In love with these double-ended brushes. I only hate double-ended brushes because storage can be a pain and ruin their shape, but I love ecotools and their quality. These haven&#x27;t shed on me yet, even after and/or during washing. My eye makeup can usually be done with these two alone.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Great to do any eye makeup look.</li>
    <li> Great price and great brushes. Very soft and they are the best makeup brushes I have owned</li>
    <li> This is a duo set that has 2 brush heads on each handle. The product says, &amp;#34;the brushes are soft, cruelty-free bristles, has a recycled aluminum ferrule &amp; sleek bamboo handles.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The brush set look well made, stylish w/bronze finish &amp; the bristles do feel very soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34; can be reused with it&#x27;s flap, but the bag is so narrow, it&#x27;s difficult to put in/pull out the brushes without feeling you&#x27;ll damage the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are labeled on the handles:&lt;br /&gt;Shade &amp; Define Brush: Shading (wide/thin/fluffy) - to apply shadow all over the lid, Defining (thin/angled) brush - to add depth to the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Blend &amp; Smudge Brush: Blend (round/fluffy)  - shadow to eliminate harsh lines,  Smudge (short/tapered) brush - to create soft definition/smokey look along the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these and compared to the brush set I got at a drugstore, these held on to the eyeshadow longer and blended it much better. Not perfect, but much better. For around a six dollar price, these are definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> I compared them to other EcoTools brushes I have, and the handle material is obviously plastic. The handles are not really bamboo, they are plastic made to look like bamboo.  The brushes come in handy though.</li>
    <li> I am a pretty basic user of make-up, so that is my frame of reference in evaluating these brushes - they get the job done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles and brushes have a nice, quality feel to them which matches their appearance.  These do not &amp;#34;present&amp;#34; as cheap or flimsy, and I particularly like how soft the bristles are.  The various brushes seem to be just the right size - large/long enough to perform the desired task, without becoming unwieldy or picking up too much shadow.  Because of their softness, it did seem to take a bit of extra effort to ensure enough shadow was picked up, but not to an extent that made them seem more difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a practical note, the getting 4 brushes on 2 handles definitely saves space - and I also found the handles to be the perfect size to hold comfortably and to not run the risk of soiling my hand with shadow on one end while using the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small quibble - the end of each brush is labeled with their suggested use (shade, define, blend, smudge) but the color used on the print is so light that it is somewhat difficult to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice, and could be used as a mini travel case - or to put in one&#x27;s purse and take along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely seek these out again.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes love the double side, super soft and amazing..</li>
    <li> They are so soft , i really like them</li>
    <li> Great for on the go or travel because you get two in one convenience. Love the price as well as quality</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Soft bristles and feels great on the eyes. I find it kinda sloppy with picking the eyeshadows .. a lot of falloust/: but the blending ones are great. Overall nice set, will order more brushes from them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a set of EcoTools brushes for ages, they get such great reviews. But they run in the budget friendly price-range which has always made me a little hesitant because I&#x27;ve had plenty of inexpensive brushes that were exactly what I paid for. Hallelujah, these really are worth every penny and SHOULD cost more. They are that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, they are ridiculously soft. I find that a lot of eye makeup brushes are scratchy or pull too much while not delivering enough shadow but these are super soft! They did an excellent job with both inexpensive drugstore shadows (ie. Almay, Covergirl) and my pricier favorites (ie. tarte). I normally don&#x27;t like double-ended brushes but found that these ones complimented one another perfectly. The handles are smooth with a good grip that&#x27;s comfortable while offering exceptional control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve experienced these I will be finally breaking down and replacing most of my cruddy brushes with these, they&#x27;re exceptional quality for such an affordable price.</li>
    <li> A great set of brushes with 4 different tips for a variety of uses and eco friendly, definitely can&#x27;t beat these. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for having a whole range of different make-up brushes. Even when I do I end up using a select few over and over. This set however has everything I need for eyelids in just two brushes. One brush is for shading, with a tapered brush at the other end for definition and the other brush is for blending, with a smaller brush on the other end for smudging. Nine times out of ten I go for the plain, simple shading brush but I&#x27;ve found the others come in handy sometimes too. The brushes are well-made, I&#x27;ve used them daily for quite a few weeks now and I have had no stray pieces come out of them nor have I noticed any brush heads wiggling annoyingly when I use them. Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I normally buy my make up brushes from either Sephora or Ulta and always end up shelling out a substantial amount of money each time. The angled eye brush I buy at Sephora (it&#x27;s the house brand one) is double sided and costs around fifteen to twenty dollars. The ones I get at Ulta are in a similar price range, some much more if I go with a name brand. Now, I have stayed away from cheaper make-up brushes (especially ones for eye make-up) since I have found their bristles to be rough, wear out quickly, and don&#x27;t hold up to cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised by this brush set. They are super soft (Very important for delicate eye areas!) and the angled brush gives a very fine, precise line (hard to find in a cheaper brush). I have been using them for a few weeks now and have also cleaned them and they have held up and dried very well. At this price point (around ten bucks for the set)  this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to the EcoTools line and will be reviewing another one of their products next week so we&#x27;ll see if this brand surprises me again.</li>
    <li> The most useful must have brushes. I love them</li>
    <li> Love these!! They&#x27;re so soft! I&#x27;ve always loved EcoTools!</li>
    <li> I have never used EcoTools before and I am very happy with these brushes.  The bristles are very soft and feel good when applying makeup.  The different cuts and angles on the brushes make it easy to apply eye makeup.  I like that the brushes are double-ended so I only have to use 2 brushes instead of 4.  However, sometimes the brush end that I am not using will rub against my hand and deposit makeup on it, so I have to be sure to notice this so I don&#x27;t get makeup on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case the brushes came in is pretty, but I found it very difficult to get the brushes out of it.  The opening is rather tight and it&#x27;s hard to reach into the case and pull the brushes out.  So I just tossed the case and keep the brushes in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, these brushes are well worth it.  I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great duo brush set for traveling, beginner makeup kits, or anyone on a tight budget. For the price point, the brushes are durable, soft, and can be used for any makeup look. My only gripe is that it&#x27;s a little cumbersome putting the brushes back into their pouch because the opening is kind of slim and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll damage the bristles. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> Do not buy it. I used it for a year and it fall off. There wasnt a lot of glue to hold the brush. I will never buy a drug store brush that duo ended. Maybe a high-end brushes is better.</li>
    <li> Perfect shapes to get the job done. I love that they are double sided so there isn&#x27;t the clutter of 4 brushes.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good brushes and very reasonably priced. I use them to create all my eye looks and everything blends well. I particularly like the blending and smudge sides. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the Ecotools line of makeup brushes because they last and they&#x27;re reasonably priced.  This little set has 4 different brush types on two double ended brushes.  There&#x27;s a shade, a smudge, a define and a blend and they&#x27;re even labeled.  The bristles are nice and soft and securely attached to the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally avoid double ended brushes because I store my brushes in jars and I don&#x27;t want them sitting on their bristles.  So I lay these flat in a drawer.  Other than that minor inconvenience this is a wonderful set at great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set of brushes thinking it would be great to have all of the brushes I needed for eyeshadow in a small package. That is great, but the brushes are of a high quality as well. They made it incredibly easy to complete my eye makeup in little time with little in the way of mistakes, unlike other brushes I have used before that seem to cause eye shadow to go on loose and flake every where.</li>
    <li> I love makeup brushes.  I have tried the ecotools brand before, including the travel eyebrush set ([[ASIN:B0030HMQTS EcoTools Piece Essential Eye Brush]] While ecotools brushes are nice and soft, I find that for people who are into makeup, the brushes just don&#x27;t have the right shape to get the job done and really don&#x27;t grab onto color.  I was glad to see that this set, unlike the travel eye brush set, includes a flat brush for packing on shadow.  However, the flat brush end is not stiff enough.  It is less stiff than my favorite brushes, the MAC 239 and the Sigma E55 (I prefer the E55, which is fluffier).  It just doesn&#x27;t grab color that well.  I tested this with my most pigmented palettes - by Lorac Pro palette and my Urban Decay Naked palette and felt that the color payoff wasn&#x27;t as good as I can get with other brushes, including the Urban Decay Good Karma brush that comes with the first Naked palette.  I found myself packing on some extra color with my E55.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the fluffy brush, it also wasn&#x27;t great to me.  I do like the fluffy brush in the travel mini eye brush set and use it for blending out the edges of my eyeshadow, but the fluffy brush included in this set is not as full and fluffy.  So, I just don&#x27;t have a use for it.  I really like my MAC 217 for applying color to the crease and then I like to blend it out with my Sephora #10 brush or a Smashbox brush that came in a holiday brush set this year.  The fluffy brush in this set just didn&#x27;t grab color that well, as the 217 does, and didn&#x27;t really blend as well as the Sephora, Smashbox, or the mini ecotools brush that came in the mini brush set I mentioned above.  It also wasn&#x27;t great at shadow placement, like my MAC 217.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the other two brushes.  The smaller flat brush is very good for smudging shadow under the lower lashes.  The angled brush is good for the same purpose.  It also can be used to fill in eyebrows and for gel liner. Unfortunately, those brushes are not on the same brush (the brushes are dual sided).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this set was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot; to me.  If you are starting out in makeup, while I think you can get away with inexpensive powder and foundation brushes (try Real Techniques.  The ecotools blush brush is not bad either. I use it for blending out overly harsh applications of blush), good eyeshadow brushes at a very low price point are hard to come by.  The key brushes in this set - the flat shader and the fluffy crease - are not really useful.  They are a similar quality to a cheap freebie brush that sometimes gets included with palettes.  Do yourself a favor and invest in good eyeshadow brushes - the best are by MAC and Sigma.same brush (the brushes are dual sided).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this set was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot; to me.

    <li> I love these brushes. They do a great job blending the colors on my eyes when I am putting it on. I love the dual tips. It keeps me from having so many brushes in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I usually use this line of brushes. They&#x27;re good for an every day use. Don&#x27;t want to ruin my expensive brushes. However, one side of the brush was broken when I got it. It&#x27;s not worth returning I just delt with it but that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Some of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> these are amazing brushes! super soft and very durable.  will be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and worked really well with my cream eye shadows and lipstick. I like that you get 4 brushes on two sticks but it does mean I need to keep them in the plastic casing so that the bottom ones do not get mishappen in my brush container so not sure if that really is the best idea for these brushes.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. I don&#x27;t have much use for the smudge or the eyeliner brushes, though. I wish they had other general use brushes on those ends.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality,  I love each and one of this brushes, the smudge brush I like it as a shading brush better to pack on color, love the blending blush love them all!!! It&#x27;s just hard to store but after I got them is the only ones I reach for!</li>
    <li> I find no hard and fast rules apply when purchasing makeup brushes.  Sometimes it&#x27;s worth spending a lot of money on a particular brush, but expensive ones can be as horrible as cheap ones, while some cheap brushes are fantastic.  It matters not to me if the bristles are synthetic or hair.  I do not have a preference.  Of handles I ask for enough length to use the brush for its intended purpose, and that the bristles be securely attached.  Bristles should be functional, and not fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This two-ended pair of brushes includes a lid brush, a crease brush, a liner/brow brush, and smudge brush (for smoking the eye).  The handles are excellent, and so are the bristles of the liner/brow and smudge brush.  All brushes have soft, suppple bristles.  Unfortunately, the bristles for the lid and crease brushes are too soft and supple.  I use a Sonia Kashuk matte palette and find my other eye makeup brushes work well with it.  When applying eye shadow with the lid and crease brushes, I find most of the product lands in one spot, and the brushes don&#x27;t move it well.  In other words, it&#x27;s hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend looking elsewhere, perhaps even some other EcoTools products, for lid and crease brushes.  If your budget allows, these are worth buying for the liner/brow and smudge brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I are loving these brushes. The softness especially stands out but then also work well. The angling brush is great for finer lines and the thicker brushes for eye shadow. We are very happy with these.</li>
    <li> So many times I&#x27;ve gotten brushes that were less than desirable. You know the ones... prickly and stiff and certainly not anything one would want to put near the eye. I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for these, but was pleasantly surprised to find the EcoTools Eye Brushes to be VERY NICE brushes! I like the design and they fit well in the hand. The brushes are SOFT and load well, allowing for a nice even application of powder. They don&#x27;t really shed and wash up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first exposure to the EcoTools line of brushes. I&#x27;m so pleased with their quality that I&#x27;m going to be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They&#x27;re soft and hold a lot of powder. They&#x27;re comfortable, solid and sturdy. The Ecotools Eye Enhancing Duo Brush Set has made it&#x27;s way into my daily routine and won&#x27;t be leaving anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes as opposed to some cheaper ones I got at the drug store.  They&#x27;re smooth and soft and the makeup flows on nicely and blends well with these soft bristles.  The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly like is the case they came in isn&#x27;t really a case, but a sales display.  I would have liked for it to double as a case, but it didn&#x27;t fit in my makeup kit.  I have them loose now and I would prefer some covering over them.  That&#x27;s just a small marketing-type thing that shouldn&#x27;t deter you from purchasing them for your use. I look forward to using these more and more.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes for applying powder eye shadow. The set is only two brushes but gives good options since  it has four separate brush heads, one on each end of each brush. Between all four brush heads, I find every type of brush I would ever need for eye shadow. I can&#x27;t say how well it would work on other types of makeup (cream shadows, for instance) because I really only use powder eye shadow, but these seem to be of excellent quality so I expect they would work well for multiple purposes. I also like that the handles are long and easy to use and that the brushes are partially made of recycled materials. Overall, I think that for the price this is a very nice set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I love trying out new brushes. My everyday makeup brushes changes almost daily. But the ones that stay on the top are usually my Mac, Sephora and some of my Ecotools brushes. They are just as soft as the more expensive brushes, and in comparison to Mac, I believe them to be even softer. Just as dense, a few of them, not all, and certainly just as well made. My ecotools brushes do not shed. Ever. I wish the same could be said for some of my more expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good set. I like each one. You get four different brushes that perform four different tasks. My only complaint is that I hate double ended brushes. You can&#x27;t put them in the makeup cup holders I have. Other then that I love this set.</li>
    <li> Good brushes, not outstanding. I prefer Real Techniques all the way (much better quality-value)!</li>
    <li> Very useful! love that I have less brushes to deal with. Soft bristles.</li>
    <li> These brushes were exactly what I was looking for. I already had an ecotools blush brush and loved how soft it was, so the brand was my first thought when I decided to get eye shadow brushes. The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t leave any little hairs like some of the cheaper ones do. They&#x27;re sturdy and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ll fall apart anytime soon! I like this set since it includes 4 different brushes, including an angled brush which is awesome for doing smudgy eyeliner. Having 4 different brushes helps give you options since some shadows work better with a stiffer/softer brush. Overall, a great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because what I had been using were wearing out.  I had purchased a similar set of this make of brushes as a gift for my daughter a couple of years ago.  She really liked them, so thought I would give them a try, as they are a great price for a quality brush.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I don&#x27;t regulary were a lot of make up, but these make application easy for everyday use.  I can&#x27;t wait to give them a try on that special night out, so I can better us all of the brush tips!</li>
    <li> Great tools for your money</li>
    <li> Love them.  Always will buy them in the future.  Delivered on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> These are great very handy well made... Can use it for a complete look...</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes is great as usual with EcoTools. I was excited about the concept of duo brushes for the sake of downsizing my travel makeup go bag... but in practical use, be advised that there is a cleaning problem. It is important to clean eye brushes frequently not just when it comes to maintaining true to color shades and precision blending, but also for sanitation sake- clogged pores, rashes, eye infections can be avoided with responsible habits. This is where the problem lies: the best way to maintain the bristles of your brush is to dry bristle side down to keep moisture out of the base.  If you are able to only use one brush head each time, then you&#x27;re fine- use then clean as usual with no drying issues. But if you are the type who uses multiple brush types to finish your look (not planning to use a smudge brush for blending are you?) its impossible to properly clean up at the same time.. you&#x27;ll have to wash each separately, drying the first head fully before moving on to the second one, which could be a hassle.</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent, the bristles are soft, they pick up  a lot of colour and they get the job done. I tested for shedding, there was none, and they hold up well to washing. There are reviews on here saying the brushes are not as good as professional makeup brushes.. Well OBVIOUSLY, you will not get a professional application from $4 brushes, so if you are a makeup artist or you take your daily application of makeup very seriously, then maybe you would benefit from professional brushes, which come with a professional price tag. These brushes however, are ideal for me, as I wear makeup once in a while, on special occasions and I prefer  to not carry around a million brushes. These get the job done quickly and efficiently; I am very happy with them. I love that they are eco friendly as well.</li>
    <li> i like the brush part themselves.... one of them already came off the handle... with some superglue its not a big deal... just annoying... but i suppose the price isnt going to guerentee a super quality product... like i said tho! love the actual feel of the brushs!</li>
