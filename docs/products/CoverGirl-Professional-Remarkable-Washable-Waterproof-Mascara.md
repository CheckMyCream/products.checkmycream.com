      <li>I love getting these delivered to me.  </li>
      <li>I can see why so many like it, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.    </li>

      <li>The product is ok.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this mascara.</li>
      <li>Its okay.</li>
      <li>Tends to smear more than others.</li>
      <li>That being said, it does not sweat off as many do</li>
      <li>So glad I found this.</li>
      <li>I tend to blink a lot while applying, so I need a quick-drying mascara to make sure it doesn&#x27;t smudge my lower eyelid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years &amp; still haven&#x27;t found anything I like better.</li>

      <li>It does not smudge in the rain and humidity (here in Florida), and yet washes off easily with cleanser.</li>
      <li>It really did not make my lashes look better!</li>
      <li>Sometimes I just hop straight into the shower without using makeup remover, and it disappears easily under the warm water without that raccoon</li>
      <li>on smooth, does not clump</li>
      <li>The color is just right, but if I get fur in my eye (I work at a vet&#x27;s) and rub my eye at all, it smears all over much more than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>and you have a fresh mascara when it should be changed out!  </li>
      <li>Great coverage, lasts long and through tears, sweat and rubbing.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect mascara for me.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy but it is also more of an every-day-wear mascara - not a really dramatic look for a fancy date.</li>
      <li>B000T5KATM Maybelline Full</li>
      <li>BETTER ALTERNATIVES FOR SUPER STRAIGHT LASHES</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite</li>
      <li>It really is waterproof!!</li>
      <li>It goes on clump-free, stays put all day, and then washes right off with a bit of soap at night.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 star because the color came out kind of grey.  </li>
      <li>I have nice long lashes.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it waterproof, if it gets wet it can smudge, but it stays in place for the most part and washes off easily.</li>
      <li>This is ok mascara, neither bad nor wonderful.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought calling this mascara &amp;#34;washable waterproof&amp;#34; was just some sort of marketing gimmick.</li>
      <li>Even 24 hours later, my eyes were swollen and bright red.  </li>
      <li>So overall it&#x27;s natural-looking and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This one comes off easily with your regular face wash at night.  </li>
      <li>The brown black was a nice color for a change,and stays very well during the day.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>I have problems with racoon eyes cause my lashes are straight.  </li>
      <li>One feature is that it is washable and gentle on my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not really waterproof, bleeds when swimming or sweating or showering</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy  Nice brush    </li>
      <li>Formula Aqua Wear Waterproof Mascara, Black Brown, 0.25 Ounce]], my absolute favorite which I have to order online for.  </li>
      <li>The one I received is light blue, while the casing in the picture is clearly purple.  </li>
      <li>The brush is nice and thick and it covers and separates each lash without clumping.</li>
      <li>You do t have to remember when you bought it, just throw the old out when the new one comes  </li>
      <li>Pretty much everything else promises to make them longer, fuller, thicker, and other variants of frankenlash.</li>
      <li>So far, this product does just as is described and it&#x27;s not clumpy.</li>
      <li>It also completely covers my gray.</li>
      <li>My hair is natural, and I use products that contain glycerin and water to moisturize my hair.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s natural looking or buildable for drama    </li>
      <li>and it makes my lashes feel soft and natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find the regular black/brown CG smudge proof/waterproof mascara everywhere within 60 mile radius where I live and can&#x27;t find it.  </li>
      <li>This review is for naturally long straight Asian lashes and eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>It covered each one of my eyelashes and gave it a dark dramatic look which I loved.</li>

<li> &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara, Brownish Black]]</li>
<li> Plus is stays on all day long.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge like almost every other brand.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is surprisingly hard to find a product that simply darkens my lashes.</li>
<li> Only negative is the brush.</li>
<li> I ordered the &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; CoverGirl mascara inBlack Brown (as shown), and received a waterproof mascara in Black.  </li>
<li> The curl falls out within a half hour.  </li>
<li> After applying this product, in less than one minute, my eyes were streaming with tears.  </li>
<li> It gives you length, a little bit of volume and defines your lashes.</li>
<li> Since I have thin eyelashes, I think I&#x27;ll go with Black next time.</li>
<li> (we all can&#x27;t wear stark black, you know!)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other waterproof ones like lamcome and maybeline and some are just too hard to get off.  </li>
<li> It is hard finding hair-color that will stay on my hair.</li>
<li> covers well, thick without clumping.</li>
<li> downside is that black-brown is a bit too subtle for the look I want.</li>
<li> After I tried it though, I realized they were being quite serious.</li>
<li> This is the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon and unfortunately just before Christmas when I was counting on them.</li>
<li> but I was wrong.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately I ordered two of this item.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years &amp; still haven&#x27;t found anything I like better. The black/brown color is perfect for most people ...I love it!</li>
    <li> Received promptly.  So far, this product does just as is described and it&#x27;s not clumpy.</li>
    <li> Good mascara and brush is easy to apply. Lasts longer and easy to remove. I Would definitely recommend to others..</li>
    <li> covers well, thick without clumping. Great coverage, lasts long and through tears, sweat and rubbing. Item is as description says, does what it is supposed to. Good price, shipping was on time. Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not really waterproof, bleeds when swimming or sweating or showering&lt;br /&gt;-black-brown color is more brown than I would like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-goes on smooth, does not clump&lt;br /&gt;-looks great on</li>
    <li> The product is ok. But, I personally would not buy it again. It really did not make my lashes look better!</li>
    <li> This was a radical change for me as I&#x27;ve been using the same mascara for 30+ yrs but I liked the reviews on this. I appreciate the fact that you don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes with it but it is easily washable with soap &amp; water. It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy but it is also more of an every-day-wear mascara - not a really dramatic look for a fancy date.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage it provides.  One feature is that it is washable and gentle on my lashes.  This will  be the only product I will use in the future.</li>
    <li> I love getting these delivered to me.  You do t have to remember when you bought it, just throw the old out when the new one comes  and you have a fresh mascara when it should be changed out!  No going to the store for one item,</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It lengthens, goes on evenly and I will buy again. I do recommend, try it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this mascara. It covered each one of my eyelashes and gave it a dark dramatic look which I loved. Definitely buying this again!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge like almost every other brand.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  I thought since it was waterproof that it was also humidity proof but I was wrong.  It did not hold up in humid weather and just looked clumped on lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried to find the regular black/brown CG smudge proof/waterproof mascara everywhere within 60 mile radius where I live and can&#x27;t find it.  I hope they haven&#x27;t stopped making it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is one of the best that I have used. The black/brown color is perfect. It gives you length, a little bit of volume and defines your lashes. It really is waterproof!! Doesn&#x27;t flake, but washes off easily in the shower. I will definitely repurchase this!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Not so much...was looking for something I could wear while swimming. This is not the product...sadly. That being said, it does not sweat off as many do</li>
    <li> Tends to smear more than others. The color is just right, but if I get fur in my eye (I work at a vet&#x27;s) and rub my eye at all, it smears all over much more than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This mascara IS great for those of us who have oily skin and wear contacts and don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; lashes. It doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t flake. So far, I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect mascara for me.</li>
    <li> It is waterproof as prescribed.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 star because the color came out kind of grey.  I will try to find the back color to buy cause I like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> I felt like my lashes didn&#x27;t look much different with the mascara on than when I don&#x27;t wear it at all.</li>
    <li> Since Avon discontinued their Wash-Off Waterproof Mascara, I&#x27;ve been looking for a similar product. This mascara fills the bill. It does not smudge in the rain and humidity (here in Florida), and yet washes off easily with cleanser. It comes in the brown/black color that looks best on me (we all can&#x27;t wear stark black, you know!) and it makes my lashes feel soft and natural. The brush is nice and thick and it covers and separates each lash without clumping. This is my new favorite so I&#x27;ve got this puppy on subscribe and save. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and cost effective.</li>
    <li> This review is for naturally long straight Asian lashes and eyelash curler.  I can see why so many like it, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.    CONS:  The curl falls out within a half hour.  The Brown/Black is more of a \\&quot;black\\&quot; color.    PROS:  I only paid $2.00  It doesn&#x27;t flake or clump  It is easy to wash off with Rimmel makeup remover or olive oil  It is buildable for length and volume  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy  Nice brush    BETTER ALTERNATIVES FOR SUPER STRAIGHT LASHES THAT NEED TO HOLD A CURL:  [[ASIN:B000T5KATM Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara, Brownish Black]], it&#x27;s natural looking or buildable for drama    [[ASIN:B001AYFVAE Physicians Formula Aqua Wear Waterproof Mascara, Black Brown, 0.25 Ounce]], my absolute favorite which I have to order online for.  Only negative is the brush.</li>
    <li> This is incredibly easy to apply, with no clumping or smudging. I tend to blink a lot while applying, so I need a quick-drying mascara to make sure it doesn&#x27;t smudge my lower eyelid. This does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also very easy to remove. Sometimes I just hop straight into the shower without using makeup remover, and it disappears easily under the warm water without that raccoon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that black-brown is a bit too subtle for the look I want. Since I have thin eyelashes, I think I&#x27;ll go with Black next time.</li>
    <li> Although this product is labeled mascara, I use it to cover the gray around my hairline. It stays in place and does not come off. It also completely covers my gray. I like the fact that it washes out with shampoo. My hair is natural, and I use products that contain glycerin and water to moisturize my hair. It is hard finding hair-color that will stay on my hair. This product works for me.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time at the price listed. I would recommend this to a friend. Good job.</li>
    <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; CoverGirl mascara inBlack Brown (as shown), and received a waterproof mascara in Black.  I don&#x27;t know what the seller was thinking as the casing colors are not even similar!  The one I received is light blue, while the casing in the picture is clearly purple.  This was to be a gift and so I do not  have time to return and exchange this product.  This is the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon and unfortunately just before Christmas when I was counting on them.</li>
    <li> love this kind, doesn&#x27;t bleed, great color and brand. It was a great price too, I really enjoy it! ok</li>
    <li> At first I thought calling this mascara &amp;#34;washable waterproof&amp;#34; was just some sort of marketing gimmick. After I tried it though, I realized they were being quite serious. This stuff is amazing! It goes on clump-free, stays put all day, and then washes right off with a bit of soap at night. I&#x27;m so happy with this mascara!</li>
    <li> Its okay. I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it waterproof, if it gets wet it can smudge, but it stays in place for the most part and washes off easily. I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.</li>
    <li> I have problems with racoon eyes cause my lashes are straight.  This mascara is the only one that works well with me.  I&#x27;ve tried other waterproof ones like lamcome and maybeline and some are just too hard to get off.  This one comes off easily with your regular face wash at night.  Plus is stays on all day long.</li>
    <li> I have nice long lashes. I am blonde, and so are the ends of my lashes. I do not like obvious makeup, but I do want my lashes to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is surprisingly hard to find a product that simply darkens my lashes. Pretty much everything else promises to make them longer, fuller, thicker, and other variants of frankenlash. This... just makes them darker. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to gob up or fuse the lashes together, and doesn&#x27;t run if I jump in a pool, sweat in a workout, or get caught in the rain. So overall it&#x27;s natural-looking and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is ok mascara, neither bad nor wonderful.  You have to use eye makeup remover or baby oil or something to get it off, which is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I will never buy this brand of mascara again.  After applying this product, in less than one minute, my eyes were streaming with tears.  My eyes were stinging and burning for hours.  Even 24 hours later, my eyes were swollen and bright red.  Unfortunately I ordered two of this item.  I will never put it on my face again.</li>
    <li> I bought this washable mascara because the waterproof mascaras release some harming smell and vapors that made my eyes red.The brown black was a nice color for a change,and stays very well during the day.It washes off with water,and I would recommend using an eye makeup remover after washing it off.</li>
