### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But all in all a good buy!</li>
      <li>Came on time and as described so I&#x27;m happy</li>
      <li>For how inexpensive these are, they&#x27;re a great set.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this set!</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>Most of them were wielded together</li>
      <li>but i was very happy with the different colors they do differ from the picture</li>
      <li>So in love with them :)</li>
      <li>My wife wanted a belly button ring for Christmas, I had almost paid $4.99 for just one but thought better of it and looked online.</li>
      <li>My mom was jealous of how cute and cheap they were</li>
      <li>The seller actually made sure I was happy with what I had bought.</li>
      <li>but i liked the ones i got better thanks</li>
      <li>These look great while they last.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get any of the colors I originally bought the set for.</li>
      <li>The bar stays clean and I don&#x27;t notice any fading of the material</li>
      <li>They were late about a week, but I was very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>but I would of still perferred my variety of colors but overall the jeweryl has good quality</li>
      <li>Very fun and exciting to change and wear</li>
      <li>A plus shipped quickly</li>
      <li>While it feels pretty secure, I was overall dissatisified with what I received.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me I wear my clear gems a lot</li>
      <li>but I super glue them back in.</li>
      <li>Extremely cheap in quality, some stones were loose or had fallen out.</li>
      <li>It is also not like the ones in the pictures, the top metal screw does not have a gem it is just plain metal</li>
      <li>In the pack I recieved 3 clear gems and the rest of the colors.</li>
      <li>Then add that I can&#x27;t unscrew the top to at least 4 of them.</li>
      <li>The gem feels like it is barely in metal ball</li>

<ol>
    <li> No assortment of colors as shown.  There were 2-3 of one color and none of another</li>
    <li> The stones were a little loose but that didn&#x27;t bother me. I got all different colors. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. I got 3 black and 3 dark blue. I wanted at least one green one and got none. Then add that I can&#x27;t unscrew the top to at least 4 of them.</li>
    <li> Most of them were wielded together</li>
    <li> Not satisfied. Extremely cheap in quality, some stones were loose or had fallen out. Just not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> These look great while they last. The bar stays clean and I don&#x27;t notice any fading of the material and I wear these for sometimes weeks on end. The only problem is that sometimes the jewels pop out but I super glue them back in. For how inexpensive these are, they&#x27;re a great set. I received all the colors shown. My mom was jealous of how cute and cheap they were so I bought her a set as well.</li>
    <li> They were late about a week, but I was very happy with my purchase. The seller actually made sure I was happy with what I had bought.</li>
    <li> A plus shipped quickly</li>
    <li> I got 3 colors and like 4 of each of the colors I got. Will never buy again!!!! Waste of your money!!</li>
    <li> Came on time and as described so I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I love then they took awhile to get here but i was very happy with the different colors they do differ from the picture but i liked the ones i got better thanks</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I thought they would be and also came with a couple duplicate colors. But all in all a good buy!</li>
    <li> bought these as a little add on gift for my girlfriend and they just arrived, they only gave me 3 different colors and a couple of them are missing the gem.. like its just an empty cup.. waste of money</li>
    <li> So in love with them :)</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. Very fun and exciting to change and wear</li>
    <li> The stones were dull and the metal Was dull not very impressed.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a belly button ring for Christmas, I had almost paid $4.99 for just one but thought better of it and looked online. I&#x27;m so glad I found this set!</li>
    <li> Got duplicate colors and the ring is poorly made. The gem feels like it is barely in metal ball and it so loose I can rotate it. It is also not like the ones in the pictures, the top metal screw does not have a gem it is just plain metal so it is NOT double jeweled. While it feels pretty secure, I was overall dissatisified with what I received.</li>
    <li> Good quality, but bad mix of colors three black and three ugly green.not what the picture shows. Kinda disappointed... Oh Well</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come as describe. Very disappointed. Had to return.</li>
    <li> I like all my bellyrings I got all colors except for the dark green, the hot pink, and the champagne looking color. In the pack I recieved 3 clear gems and the rest of the colors. Lucky for me I wear my clear gems a lot but I would of still perferred my variety of colors but overall the jeweryl has good quality and I wouldn&#x27;t mind ordering again!</li>
    <li> Really difficult to get the balls off.</li>
    <li> Ended up with triplets and a set of doubles. And colors that aren&#x27;t even shown. Didn&#x27;t get any of the colors I originally bought the set for. Pretty disappointed overall.</li>
