<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this oil a few days ago and have used it two nights in a row now. I&#x27;m familiar with the benefits of oils as a facial moisturizer, and have tried several varieties including argan, maracuja and another variety of rose hip. I&#x27;m very pleased with this one so far. It has an earthy scent, but not overwhelming or too strong. It&#x27;s also a rich orange color, but don&#x27;t let that scare you away. It takes a little while to completely soak into your skin, but I&#x27;ve never felt so youthful. Granted, I&#x27;m only 29, but I&#x27;ve had significant acne issues my whole life so far and nothing has made a difference like facial oils. I really like rose hip for me personally because my skin is not mature yet and I don&#x27;t need to worry so much about wrinkles yet, other than preventing them which is what this helps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And seriously, if you have any issues with acne, I highly recommend you try facial oils of some sort. Do some research and figure out what would be a good fit for your skin type. The first one I tried was Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja Oil, and it really changed my life. I continued to do research and branch out to argan oil and now rose hip, but at first I was scared of putting oil on my face because it seems like the opposite of what you&#x27;d want to do if you have issues with acne. But trust me, it is EXACTLY what you want to be doing. Your skin will thank you indefinitely for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company, Teddie Organics, is very good about communicating with its buyers. I received an email from the owner making sure my purchase experience was satisfactory and that I was happy with the product. I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> Really Good, the best I used!</li>
    <li> This stuff is gold! No I really mean it&#x27;s like I found gold!! It is wonderful!! It makes my skin so smooth! I can&#x27;t wait to try all the different ways to use it!&lt;br /&gt;I use it under my moisturizer instead of a serum.&lt;br /&gt;The color is orangey but it doesn&#x27;t change the color of your skin.  Also the smell that everyone says it has...is true....BUT....it goes away as soon as a put it on my face!!!&lt;br /&gt;The Sellers were so helpful by sending instructions on all the different uses which helps tremendously!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I am borderline obsessed with this company and their products!&lt;br /&gt;The first item I ordered from them was the rose water, on February 13th of this year. I loved it so much, that I have ordered two more of the larger size bottles since then, I ordered and tried the rose hip oil (in the smaller size) and just ordered another in the large size. I use these two products religiously and can&#x27;t sing their praise enough.&lt;br /&gt;I also think the people behind Teddie are extremely pleasant. They offer great customer service, fantastic products and speedy delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Excellent quality oil that works as described. Packaging is beautiful and company itself is lovely! My skin feels soft, radiant, and nourished. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought the 1 oz bottle to try about two months ago after reading about the skin benefits, particularly for eczema, which I have on parts of my face and on my arms. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. My skin (particularly on my face) is incredibly sensitive and this has helped soothe every dry, rough, scaly spot on my body. The eczema on my left arm is nearly clear and the right arm is significantly improved. I also recently had a bad reaction to a skin care product and putting a little bit of this oil - mixed with a soothing moisturizer - on my face every night helped sooth the redness, irritation and bumps in a very short amount of time. I&#x27;m now ordering the larger 4 oz bottle. I can&#x27;t imagine my beauty routine without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I did a lot of research before choosing this brand of oil. It has the right color, clarity and consistency; almost no discernible smell (which I read complaints about with other oils); it is organic and cold pressed; and the bottle is amber to help prevent against degradation/breakdown.  It beats pretty much every other oil I looked at in stores and online and the price is so, so reasonable. I will buy this again and again.Thanks for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural daily moisturizer for my combination skin, and was attracted to this product for lots of reasons - the positive reviews, organic ingredients, and, admittedly, cute packaging. On top of that, the price was pretty affordable. The bottle shipped fast, was much bigger than expected, and was preceded by a personal email from the company assuring me they&#x27;d be checking in on how I felt about the quality of the packaging and product. And I must say - I absolutely love it. It goes on like a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil - it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. On top of that, it smells AMAZING. Most rose products tend to smell artificial and musky, but this, being from the fruit of the plant, is light and fresh! It makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated, and doesn&#x27;t cause my powdered foundation to cake like cream moisturizers do. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> If you are thinking of buying one of those expensive &amp;#34;rose hip oil&amp;#34; creams, order this instead.  The commercial creams may contain a half teaspoon of the oil and can cost $40-50.  Buy this instead and you&#x27;ll get 4 ounces of the real deal, without the additives, fragrances and fillers that are in most of the commercial creams.  The seller includes a helpful guide on using the oil, and the oil is USDA certified organic.  It&#x27;s very gentle but very effective.  I was surprised how easily it absorbs into the skin, and it is almost odorless.  It takes only a tiny bit to soothe and soften, so the 4 ounce bottle will last a long time.  .</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied! Its always nice to find a great product backed up by great customer service. All my questions were answered and product was shipped fast. Rosehip oil can be used in so many ways. In my opinion all women should use this in their daily skin routine, along with Argan and Jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> Have used it on my cracked feet. Nothing else has worked so far... but this oil is working out great. in one week... using twice a day...my feet has improved more than 90%. great find for someone like me. I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face at night. The skin has improved considerably.</li>
    <li> Love rosehip seed oil. I apply it at night and it leaves my skin supple and glowing with the affed bonus of evening out my skin tone. I have been using it for close to a year however I am new to this brand and I am not disappointed. Great quality and richness to this product.</li>
    <li> I tried another product that was not organic and I could tell the difference within one week of using this product.  The other product was very greasy and this is not.  This one absorbs into your skin pretty fast. I can even use this close to my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The other one would leave my eyes very cloudy.  So far my skin looks very radiant.  I will be reordering from Teddie.</li>
    <li> Great price and a very nice oil and a large sized bottle!!</li>
    <li> You will love this rosehip oil. It has a nice mild scent. And it works like a charm. I normally have chapped nostril and the skin around my nose when I have a cold. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the cold I recently had.  I just rubbed rosehip oil on my nose area generously. I also notice that my facial skin is softer and moist (not greasy) since I use rosehip oil. So far I am happy with my purchase and definitely would buy from Teddie again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Have only been using it for a few days, and I am already noticing a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I love this product! And the company! I received my organic rosehip oil in record time - and it was packed very, very well. No breakage - no spillage. I even received a nice email from Teddie Organics thanking me for my order and to be sure to let them know if I was not perfectly satisfied with the packaging or product.  I am very satisfied with both. The product is great on my skin and I plan to order from  Teddie Organics for other products as well.  Thank you for a quality product and quality packaging!</li>
    <li> Quality : Superb level. I throughly researched on rosehip oil, company by company before I order and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this company. I had to reorder it to share with my mom and beloved people. I started to see the positive difference on my skin ever since I used this oil. This doesn&#x27;t have any smell issue like some other company. I highly recommend this product to anyone!  Customer Service: Excellent. I had some package issue but, they were really attentive and helpful. They are basically stay on top of their game on their product, customer service and care. They emailed me to check on if there was anything wrong on their part(though it was not their fault) and showed their care and dedication to their customer service in a very pleasant manner.  Through their excellent product and customer service, they totally gained my loyalty, love, and support! I&#x27;m going to keep buying product from their company. I&#x27;m so looking forward to seeing the company grow more!</li>
    <li> I will never be without this oil again. Remarkable change in the softness and appearance of my skin in a short time; I can&#x27;t wait to see what a couple of months will bring. I use it by itself at night and mix with any of my other products during the day. It smells like a garden. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far only used it on my face but would love to get a full body massage with this.</li>
    <li> These guys really really care about the quality of thier product. I even got a follow up email from them after my purchase to check in and see if I was satisfied and if I had any additional questions. I&#x27;m new to this oil so do not know yet how effective it is but buying organic from a small company who cares is at the top of my list. Am also planning on trying their rose water as well...</li>
    <li> Order, arrival &amp; packaging all 5🌟. I purchased this for Rosacea. First two or three days had stinging. It must have been the raw areas. That settled, no new break-outs. Quit using topical antibiotic lotion first day. Later reduced antibiotic capsules to one a day. Still no new eruptions. It&#x27;s only been six days of use so am reluctant to drop all meds. Redness reduced too.  So far...So good.</li>
    <li> Ordering from Teddie Organics was a pleasant experience, prompt service and great customer service.  I am also pleased with the rosehip oil that I purchased.  It seems to be of good quality and has done wonderful things for my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> I absoutly love this oil!!! I use it as a facial moisturizer twice a day!! I add 5 to 6 drops to organic body lotion and I feel so spoiled!! It does wonders for dry hands as well!!! I am hooked!!!</li>
    <li> I had been using The Life Flo Rosehips Oil and was almost out so I decided to try this one.  I included a pic so you could see the difference in color of the 2.  The Teddie oil is the bright orange one on the left and the Life Flo is the pale yellow one on the right.  I feel the Teddie one to be the superior product in every way...higher carotenoids (judging from the color), higher quality, lower price/oz, and organic.  It reminds me of the Pai Skincare Rosehip oil which is very high quality, but about $30/oz and difficult to get since it comes from overseas.  I actually prefer the Teddie oil since it is 100% rosehip oil whereas the Pai and the Life Flo sneak in other oils like Vitamin E which I know increases the self life, but it always makes me break out.  Will definitely repurchase. Customer service is also wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great product! Oil is a rich, vibrant color, as rosehip oil should be. I use it for face, body, and nails. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle. I feel like I look so much younger since I started using it. Wrinkles and sun damage (I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned) has been reduced and I don&#x27;t mind using this generously since it&#x27;s an organic, natural product. I&#x27;ve been using Extra Virgin Olive Oil to clean my face at night for years, but this oil is nothing like that...it also seems magical, it works that well. I use it both am (under lotion &amp; makeup) and evening (under lotion)...despite it being oil, it&#x27;s not oily at all. My skin seems to drink it up within 5-10 minutes of application. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful item I&#x27;ve found to be doing exactly what it says it will. I use this as my moisturizer at night after serum and toner. It doesn&#x27;t brake me out and my skin is getting more even by the day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller. Package arrived exactly as described, on time and on great condition. It was priced lower than many other similar products and I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This product is very greasy, smells like chip cooking oil and the color is way to too dark for being a true rose hip oil as it claims.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil, because I thought it was going to be great to remove dark spots,  n surgery scars, I have been using this oil for about 2 weeks n have not seen any difference.  I apply twice a day and massage it but i have not noticed any difference</li>
    <li> This feels really great on my skin.  My skin has a tendency to be a bit dry, so this has really made a difference.  My only complaint is the slight fishy scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil I&#x27;ve ever used. I put it on my face before bed each night and have never had such clear, soft skin. I generally battle dry gas heat resulting in very dry skin this time of year, but the oil has healed the scaley-ness I usually have around my nose and cheeks. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Received sooner than expected and that&#x27;s always a good thing. Will buy from this company again. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Results after using this product is amazing.  I apply this after the Teddie Rosewater Toner &amp; facial refresher.  Using these products has become a  daily MUST DO ritual.  They are just that wonderful.  Thanks Teddie Organics for making superior products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeated customer. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Love the customer service as well as the product of course!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in great shape and on time. Seller was very nice and followed up to make sure everything was fulfilled by Amazon. The oil itself is great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy. I use it after every shower and follow it with a body butter and I&#x27;m never sticky! It seems to have made an improvement in my skin texture, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so. If you have never used Rose Hips oil on your skin, be forewarned, it does not smell too lovely. but it does the job and the smell wears off almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This winter has been especially cold and my skin needed some extra care.  I had read about the benefits of rosehip oil and decided to give it a try.  It has been wonderful.  I use it both day and night and after one week my skin is no longer chapped or dry.</li>
    <li> Just started using this for dry skin, and to help with my c-section scar. So far, so good. My face feels moisturized, but not greasy.  I&#x27;m hoping with regular use, my scar will also fade quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading a lot about RH oil online. I&#x27;m 56 and have sensitive dry skin. I use Cerave cleanser and moisturizer, but wanted some sort of anti-aging serum. I can&#x27;t use retinol or anything similar. RH oil is working wonderfully. It soaks into your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I also use it to remove my waterproof mascara. Works better than coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of brands on Amazon, all with good ratings. I picked Teddie because I liked their logo. Seems silly, I know. I&#x27;ve looked at some more of their products, and it seems like a good company. I would order from them again. Also, when I ordered, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention- for 23.00 I was expecting a 1 ounce bottle. It was 4 ounces! At that price, I can use it on my body, as well, especially since a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews and to try an inexpensive replacement for a department store face oil. I am satisfied with my purchase. It is an economical price for the size, I like the dropper stopper to control the amount that you use, it has a nice consistency, it is easily absorbed and works either alone or under makeup. There are reviews on here from those who do not like the aroma. It&#x27;s organic so there are no fancy fillers or fragrances and the thing I can compare it to is maybe the aroma from the teabags after you&#x27;ve made sun tea and after application I can walk from my bathroom to my bed and its already dissapeared ! The customer service from the company is great too, after receiving the product I got a follow up email to see if I was satisfied with my purchase which I thought was a really nice touch. All in all I&#x27;m very happy and would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Super dry skin from working outside most days.  This product made a huge difference after just a few days.</li>
    <li> I am certainly pleased with the quality of this rosehip oil. I use it under my morning moisturizer. Splendid. It also arrived on time wrapped securely with bubble wrap. I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use it and will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I have been using rosehip oil for a while and decided to try Teddie Organics because of the reasonable price. I am pleased with the oil and feel it is working as well as the more expensive brands.  I would recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> I have been using the oil for about 4 weeks now, I use it at night after cleaning my face. It does not take to long  absorb into the skin . My skin is softer and more plumb. I am in my 60&#x27;s and I am happy with the results .&lt;br /&gt; I also mix a couple of drops into a yogurt mask . 2 Tblsp whole milk  yogurt , 1 Tblsp. lemon juice and a few drops of Rosehip oil . mix well . Spread the mask over clean skin and rest for 30 min. rinse with lukewarm  water. Sometimes I make the mask twice a week it is very refreshing !</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great! I love this stuff for my skin!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I got the small one first to try and loved it. It smoothed out my eczema hand.</li>
    <li> just used a few days; love it! skin feels so soft...</li>
    <li> This is a great product from a great company! I am very satisfied. The Rosehip oil is the best that you can get, and lives up to every description about it.This oil is excellent for keeping the skin young, removing age spots, scars, and giving the face a soft wonderful feeling.  I intend to also use it on my hair and cuticles since I know that it is so good.  Teddie Organics is by far at the top of my list for being the best company, and most Customer oriented. They are very concerned about making sure that all of their customers are satisfied and happy with the products. I will be purchasing all of my organic oils from them from now on!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. My skin loves it. Great product!</li>
    <li> great product....company has integrity. color smell and consistancy tells me it is what they claim</li>
    <li> Awesome Product The Real Stuff. No question that it is Pure Unrefined and Cold Pressed Rosehip Seed Oil. It should not smell like Roses and should be dark amber/orange in color.  The smell is kinda fishy but as soon as you apply it fades quickly. I have read to keep it in the fridge to keep it from spoiling and longer shelf life and also to cut down the smell, it works!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using if for about a week now and I can already notice improvement to my skin.</li>
    <li> It think it is helping but it could be I am drinking more water. Smells like over brewed tea a bit but only for a second. I think it gives me a slight darker tint to my skin too but it is a nice tint. I will keep using because it makes my skin feel soft after use. You will seem and greasy but you don&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> so  far so good. Will know more in a few weeks. Put it on and it left my face feeling baby&#x27;s skin soft. I have dry skin so it absorbed rapidly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I am 60, male and have lived in Florida.  My face has seen a lot of sun damage.  The Rosehip Oil is fantastic!  A few drops at night and my skin is softer, wrinkles diminishing, brown spots fading, and has a healthy glow.  The family run business puts a personal touch on contacting you to see if you like the product or have any questions, very rare in these retail days.  I recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this rosehip oil. This was my first purchase of a rosehip oil so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. At first I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, but I use a lot of essential oils and so I got used to the smell very quickly and find it quite pleasant now. My young daughter, who is very particular about smells, said I smelled good one night after I had just applied it to my face, so that is saying a lot. I feel like the benefits of the oil have been extraordinary. I have some fine lines that I have seen definite improvement in. I have very dry skin so I use it morning and night on my face and neck and I continue to be amazed at how soft and smooth my face is after I apply it and throughout the day. The dry patches that I usually suffer with are gone. I also put a couple of drops on each hand at night before bed, and it helps the dryness there too. I do not suffer from acne, but this does not break out my skin. I see no need to try out any other brands and will be back for more Teddie Organic Rosehip Oil.</li>
    <li> the rosehip oil makes my skin so soft! my poor dry hands are feeling so much better in only a few days using it. I add a drop of Young Living Frankincense Essential oil to mine also to up the game. love it so much. it came as expected and on time.</li>
    <li> A really Beautiful oil! Great product!</li>
    <li> Truly enjoying my Rosehip Oil and very happy with my purchase! Feel free to read my full review on how I used the oil to benefit my family&#x27;s skin! http://www.realhousewivesofmotherhood.com/diy-lotion-for-dry-skin/</li>
    <li> So far, I am loving this!  My skin was really dry and starting to look like crepe paper. In a week, it looks significantly better.  My 25 year old daughter recommended I try it and she was absolutely right. Now, MY mother is ordering some.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see that this was packaged so tightly when I got it! The application is nice and smooth and the fragrance of the rosehip is very mild. Unfortunately, my highly sensitive skin does not seem to take to the product too well, as I had a minor breakout all over my face after a couple days of trying the product. I&#x27;m still leaving a positive review because the product came very quickly and well-packaged, and I gave this to my sister who unsurprisingly loves it since she&#x27;s a huge fan of natural products, and she will make good use of it! I will definitely shop with this brand in the future for more natural products!</li>
    <li> This is a really excellent product - from the very first time I applied it, it visibly soothed my skin and feels so luxurious. It absorbs really well and is also excellent value for money - the bottle is really larger than I expected and  requires only a small amount of product for great coverage- maybe just two or three drops from the stopper -  for my face and neck. The bottle cap was really securely taped when it was delivered and was a little difficult to remove, but I appreciate that the makers did this to ensure there was no leakage during transit. This product will definitely become a staple in my beauty regime - why wouldn&#x27;t it - its pure, simple, excellent value, feels wonderful when applied to my skin  and I have received quality  follow up service from the makers which proves to me they too believe in their product and care about their customers satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil... Great packaging!</li>
    <li> Very good quality! I use it to remove my eye makeup or all over my face if it&#x27;s drier than normal at night. Super smart, thoughtful packaging too. When it arrived they had wrapped the neck in white tape similar to electrical tape that prevented any leakage.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase from here again!</li>
    <li> The smell takes some getting used to, but my skin feels so soft after 2 applications, I will get used to it. I&#x27;m hoping it helps my mild psoriasis-fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. I use it at night to reduce fine lines. I had results the next day. It works beautifully  under foundation  as well, as it gives a glow. I am looking forward to it reducing my scars and hyperpigmentation. The smells not bad at all, for those that complain of the smell. I will continue to use!!!!. Thank you Teddie Organics .</li>
    <li> Love this product....amazing for your skin!  Teddie Organics has been wonderful, really concerned about my order and satisfaction.  I would go to them for all their products.  Really nice to have such great customer service!  I give the product and Teddie Organics 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is a very customer oriented company.  The company sends e-mails to follow up on the purchase of their product, answers any questions immediately, and is concerned that the customer is totally satisfied with their product.  The Rosehip Oil is a lovely, thick golden oil with no odor.  I combine it with my moisturizer and only need to use a couple of drops for each use, so the product will last a very long time.  If you are looking for Rosehip Oil, this product seems to be outstanding.</li>
    <li> definitely the real deal--same deep orange color and lovely earthy smell that you see in comparable products from major brands like kosmea, but at a fraction of the price. amazing customer service and fast shipping times, too! highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using this oil on my face very much. I live in an extremely dry area so it helps to keep my face hydrated and feeling silky smooth. Excellent customer service, as well!</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, well-packaged, and good value.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I slather it on every night before bed and the improvements in my skin are noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love the Rosehip oil, I have not used it for very long yet but so far I am very pleased with the results I see in my skin. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Product is great! I use it as a moisturizer for my face primarily. Teddie Organics service and communication were first rate all the way through the purchase. I will definitely think of them again when I need similar products.</li>
    <li> I use this Rosehip oil on my skin, hair and nails. I added a little lemon essential oil to mine and it smells delicious. The packaging is very nice and arrived quickly. It&#x27;s obvious Teddie Organics has put a lot of thought and care into their products. Will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and customer service. Questions answered timely. Will purchase again. Thank you!</li>
