      <li>I&#x27;d estimate that runtime figure is pretty accurate and if you shave every day, you can easily go a week on a single charge.  </li>
      <li>I used it with lotion and my own homemade soap lather and the shave was okay, about typical for an electric, requiring more passes, time,  and attention to tight spots and under the chin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Remington finally got something that is comparable to Braun and Phillips!!  The pivoting head works nicely when shaving under the chin.  The new smart edge looks weird at first but works really well when cutting long hair, however not really a clean shave with it though.  The foil proved smooth close shave, but would it be better with a double foil?  Still this doesn&#x27;t make me to take away any star!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s anything wrong with this shaver. I have not used electric shavers in more than a decade so I thought I&#x27;d try it again. The result is just about as I remember it. You get a good shave but with more effort and time than the razor version. I can see tossing this in a travel bag if I don&#x27;t want to bother with bringing the razor or for a quick touch up when I don&#x27;t want to wait for the beard hair to soften out with water. But for daily shaving I think that I&#x27;ll stick with the razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition there were two areas where I found that the shaver struggled a bit: the neck skin just where the jaw meets the neck and the hair that is just adjacent to the nose. For the latter the tight spot make it harder to get the large cutting head just in the right position. For the former it works OK when the hair is short and sticks up but when it&#x27;s longer and &amp;#34;laying down&amp;#34; then it&#x27;s hard to cut and needs lots of passes over it.</li>
    <li> I returned this razor for a refund.  This razor appears to be well built, and it gives a pretty good electric shave.  The problem is obviously a design flaw, an engineering boo boo.  I received the razor, checked it out, put it in its cradle and plugged it in to charge.  The next morning I go through my routine and step up to the mirror.  After applying my Lectric shave I turn my razor on and proceed.  Hmm, this is a pretty good shave for an electric razor.  BUT WAIT, I have a mustache and there is about a quarter of an inch between my upper lip and the mustache.  Well guess what?  This razor will NOT shave this spot because it has a flat top blade on each edge and a rounded foil in the middle.  The flat edge blades would not shave the hair under my mustache.  I had to get my old electric razor to finish my shave.  So long as you have a flat, or round, surface the thing does pretty good, but if you have a mustache like mine, you might want to consider another razor.  You cannot get into tight areas with this razor, sorry.  Construction, grip and charger, 4 stars.  Shave, 3 stars.  Overall usefulness, 1 star.</li>
    <li> The Remington XF8550 shaver is definitely the best shaver I have ever used. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was the excellent built quality. It feels solid in your hand and the hard rubberized coating provides good grip. The lithium-ion battery is advertised to deliver 50 minutes of run time. I have no doubt in that claim as I have used it daily for 6 weeks on its first charge! You must use the included foldable charging cradle to charge. I would have preferred a direct plug in, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as I only have to charge it every 2 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last three shavers were the Philips Norelco rotary type. I have also used a Braun model. This Remington gives a cleaner cut than all my previous electric shavers. With a circular path, It almost cuts like razor but still gentle to the skin. I have tried both dry and wet shaving. Wet is smoother and cuts slightly closer. Dry works fine when I am in a rush.</li>
    <li> The Remington XF8550 is a great razor with some great features, provides a close shave but it is not for those with very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The XF8550 is a nice razor with a really good design. I like the angle of the shaving head and it made for some really comfortable shaving and closeness. The clippers also did a great job for trimming and helping me keep my (preferred) perpetual 5 O&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is off the charts, at least in my testing. When used daily, I went almost a month without recharging it. This is a big, big plus to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive skin and I often have to use a pre-shave to use an electric razor. The XF8550 would continually cause razor burn, even with a pre-shave, below my jaw and down to my neck. I do get a very close and clean shave with this razor but I couldn&#x27;t stop the razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you have no issues with sensitive skin, then I can highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been torn between Braun and Panasonic electric razors for nearly 20 years now, usually replacing one every three years or so. My [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7]] was getting near it&#x27;s third year, so I was open to a replacement. Panasonic is in love with making the largest, weirdest heads ever, so I was pretty open to Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smartedge has a lot going for it. The Li-Ion battery really does charge fast. Fast enough that you could open the box, charge, and shave in under 15 minutes. And the blade is pretty comfortable, though even after several days, it seemed to tug on the edge of my beard. Not a dealbreaker, but not very impressive at the price. Similarly, the cut was reasonably close for an electric, but not as close as my Series 7, and not nearly as close as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flimsy charging base was a bit of an annoyance, compared to the cleaning dock you get with most Braun or Panasonic razors, but I could see how it&#x27;s a bit nicer when travelling than leaving my Braun on the sink. It&#x27;s not the worst trade-off ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a decent razor for the money. But... it kind of begs the question: Why wouldn&#x27;t you get a [[ASIN:B001P5HCKK Braun Series 5 590cc]]? The price (at the time of this writing) is identical, but the difference in build quality is substantial. You get the same five-minute quick charge, the same water resistance, a way nicer base unit, and the ability to use Clean &amp; Renew cartridges if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;ve had bad luck with Braun or some other aversion to the brand, I can&#x27;t fathom why you&#x27;d choose this razor between the two. On the other hand, if you have found Braun razors to be uncomfortable (and honestly, they have not changed substantially over the past 10 years or so), I&#x27;d totally recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> While this razor is certainly well-constructed and seems like it will last, the price and the expense of replacing the head are a big turn off. It shaves fairly close but isn&#x27;t the best electric razor ever in that respect. The best thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate, though the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof is nice as well. Additionally, it keeps a charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re used to electric shavers, this one should work for you, but if you prefer the close shave of a razor, this isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two different smaller models of Braun and Norelco in past years, always with dry shaving, and they&#x27;ve never lived up to expectations through regular use.  This Remington has a better ergonomic feel in handling and a much better battery. I used it with lotion and my own homemade soap lather and the shave was okay, about typical for an electric, requiring more passes, time,  and attention to tight spots and under the chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the small charging stand and it&#x27;s an easy set-up for traveling.  The cleaning is easy and you can use it in the shower if you want.  This is the best electric that I have used.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with electric shavers for about 25 years.  In the interest of full disclosure I use Braun, but I like trying shavers from other manufacturers like Remington, Panasonic, and Philips Norelco.  I have used the Remington XF8550 for one week and here are my observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;-I like the blue color, and ergonomically it feels great...very comfortable in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;-2 Year Warranty&lt;br /&gt;-The charging stand has a small form factor that uses less space than many of the others out there.&lt;br /&gt;-A charge lasts a long time and the power dip doesn&#x27;t occur until the very end..typical of Lithium technology.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to take apart and clean or rinse off.  Comes with a nice whisker brush.&lt;br /&gt;-Has a travel lock feature in case you travel without the charge stand.  Prevents the shaver from getting bumped, turning on, and then draining itself.&lt;br /&gt;-A drawstring travel bag is included, and it can hold the shaver, the charging stand, and the whisker brush easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Gives a good solid shave as a brand new shaver.  Not as close as my Braun 7-790cc, but that shaver was also almost twice as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;-The pop-up trimmer is convenient to use, doesn&#x27;t nick your skin, and does an accurate job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes/Needs Improvement:&lt;br /&gt;-This is a 3 foil shaver, but the outer two are for longer hairs, while the middle foil protects the cutter block that does the real close shaving.  Because there is only one cutter block it takes a little longer to shave, -AND- it makes it hard to get that middle foil close to sideburns, under your nose, etc.  You end up leaving a little unshaven area in each of those spots.  My Braun, on the other hand, has the two cutter blocks on the outside, and a single long hair cutter in between, so I can get really close to sideburns and my nose, and it shaves a little faster.&lt;br /&gt;-I wish the shaver gave a little closer shave, but then I am also spoiled by my current shaver.&lt;br /&gt;-If you travel and want to be able to charge the shaver while on the road, you must bring the charging stand.  There is no ability to just bring the shaver and the cord like some other shavers.  This is only a minor inconvenience since they can all fit in the travel bag, and the charging stand is so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a very nice electric shaver for the money.  I think it competes well with any other shaver in the $100 price range.le to charge the shaver while on the road, you must bring the charging stand.

    <li> Very nicely made, sharp in appearance. I&#x27;ve tried this type of electric razor in the past, with less than stellar results. This is quite different. Using it with a gel really makes for a close comfortable shave. Just my preference of course, but I have to say I still prefer my rotary blade electric razor; for some reason, itjust works better on my beard. My partner, on the other hand, will usually use a  regular razor, but he really prefers this razor. He says it is ideal to use with gel for him, and gives him a better shave than my rotary blade razor. I guess it just depends on what kind of beard you have. He loves it, and I like it fine. He prefers this over my rotary razor, while I still prefer the rotary. I do appreciate the long lasting battery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of electric shavers.  I don&#x27;t shave every day, but when I do, I normally use a [[ASIN:B003983HZK Gillette Fusion Proglide]] razor, [[ASIN:B0084GVSWG Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Badger Hair Shaving Brush]].  I get a close, comfortable shave and I can easily trim around my sideburns.  In the past, I tried a [[ASIN:B00CD1QU80 Philips Norelco]] electric shaver, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with it.  It was a dry-shave only model.  The shave was not as close or as clean as a blade shave, it was impossible to use it to shave around my sideburns well - there is just no way to get a precise edge and worse than that, it wrecked my neck every time I used it.  I was recently offered a sample of the Wet/Dry Remington XF8550 to test and I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To charge the XF8550, you must place it into it&#x27;s charging cradle - there is no way to plug the electric cord directly into the XF8550, so you are relying on the batteries at all times.  Luckily, the XF8550 is equipped with the more reliable lithium-ion batteries like a modern cell phone and not the older nickel-metal-hydride batteries which start losing their ability to charge significantly in short order.  The battery is rated to deliver a 50 minute runtime after a two hour charge.  I&#x27;d estimate that runtime figure is pretty accurate and if you shave every day, you can easily go a week on a single charge.  Still, the batteries are not user replacable and the lithium-ion battery will fail at some point.  So with no option to run the XF8550 in a corded mode, you are buying something that has a limited life-span... maybe a few years... maybe three or four before the battery becomes a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The XF8550 is very comfortable to hold with the handle covered in a blue, hard-rubberized coating.  The power button is integrated directly into the blue rubberized coating and is placed perfectly for your thumb to operate.  There is a pop-up sideburn trimmer on the backside which is also easily deployed by your thumb.  The shaving head does pivot by maybe 10 degrees, but I wonder if it really does much of anything to keep the blades in touch with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a wet/dry razor, I&#x27;ve been using it wet.  Actually, I&#x27;ve been using it with the same [[ASIN:B0084GVSWG Proraso Shaving Cream]] I use when I use my [[ASIN:B003983HZK Gillette Fusion Proglide]] razor.  The shave from the Remington XF8550 has been decent.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close a blade, but it does a good job.  It doesn&#x27;t wreck my neck like the [[ASIN:B00CD1QU80 Philips Norelco]] I tried in the past.  My only complaint is that like other electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, there is no way to shave close to long sideburns or a beard well.  I know this has an integrated trimmer, but it is just that, a trimmer - it is not meant to shave around well defined sideburns or beard.  Like other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s always too vague as to where the shaving edge is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is a breeze as you can just pop off the foil assembly and rinse the Remington XF8550 off under the faucet.  Then just shake off the excess water and let it air dry.  I store mine on it&#x27;s stand-up, foldable charging cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the Remington XF8550 better than other electrics I&#x27;ve used in the past, but don&#x27;t expect as close a shave as what you would typically get from a blade.  And if you have long sideburns or a beard, you&#x27;ll not be able to shave around them too well.

    <li> Bought this thinking it was an improvement over Remington 750...BIG mistake; using it for neck where it does a superior job at catching longer whiskers, but switching to 750 (with more than 2X foil surface area) for closer shave on face. Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, found easy way to clean the heads on both: place in small bowl (heads facing down) with hot water covering 75%, then &amp;#34;apply&amp;#34; Dawn Foaming Dish Soap&amp;#34;. Let sit for 30+ minutes &amp; rinse (yeah, I know: Whoopie).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a big improvement over the previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> I must note that I requested this product to use on myself. I know it is labeled as a men&#x27;s shaver, but I was curious. I must say that I was rather pleased with how the shaver cut smoothly and easily. I have used it on dry skin and have had excellent results and am very pleased. Highly recommend for both men and womem!</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco 3500 electric shaver and this shaver cuts as close as that one. After using it for the past couple of week, I think I like the single head design versus the 3 headed design that more Norelco&#x27;s have. I think the shave is closer and it is much easier to clean. The charging time on this shaver is super fast. I literally plugged it in for 5 min and it was ready to go for a shave. The full charge time is about 2 hours according to the instructions. The shaver has the standard auxiliary cutter that flips up on the back side of the unit for doing your side burns. The reason why I took off 1 star is that the charging base is pretty flimsy and falls over easily. The actual shaving unit does not have a charging plug on it so you can only charge through the charging base (basically don&#x27;t lose the charging base).</li>
    <li> Clearly I&#x27;m not a man so this product was tried by my lover. I&#x27;m sharing his experiences using the product as well as my experiences with his face after such use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lover has thick facial hair that grows back quickly but he also has very sensitive skin. Previous electric shavers simply have not gotten close enough to do the job or they&#x27;ve irradiated this skin. Because of that he&#x27;s been using disposable razors which do get closer but which leave him with knicks and rashes. While he doesn&#x27;t like his look with facial hair (nor do I) he normally only shaved every three days to allow his skin to recover. We even visited a high end razor shop where he was given instructions but their manual razors were more expensive than he really wanted to pay plus the accompanying lotions and washes tended to create minor allergic reactions. He was willing to try out this razor when I was offered it via the Vine program. He tried it for 22 days for a total of 12 shaves so more often than he was using his disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled by this shaver -- he has not been this smooth nor his skin this unirritated in years. While I always enjoy kissing and snuggling with him, I&#x27;ve enjoyed it a bit more after he uses this shaver. Not only is his skin smoother but it looks healthier, too. I always cringed when I saw him post shave but neither of us are fans of facial hair so he suffered to please us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this electric shaver, his suffering is over!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:7106ed92f34be0a9de0dbf70d61c3094]]I have been using a Braun Series 1 - 190s Men&#x27;s Shaver, which was an upgrade from a Norelco Rotary Razor.  I still think the Braun is pretty good, but not perfect.  I don&#x27;t have a thick growth but still my stubble grew out quickly.  Also the dry shave seems to be abrasive on the skin after a while, so I was thinking about going to a straight razor.  Personally I love the straight razor, best shave you can get.  The problem is just that it&#x27;s not very convenient, especially when you are in a super hurry like I often am during the week.  When I saw Remington&#x27;s Foil Shaver I thought it was worth a try.    Remington XF8550 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver, Blue is the first foil shaver that I&#x27;ve tried.  The appeal of the foil shaver for me is that I can actually use shaving cream or dry.  Depending on what I need.  So I tried both dry &amp; wet shaves as a test and was quite surprised by the results.    First - Wet using shaving cream.  Very smooth and closer than either of my previous shavers.  Not quite a blade, but amazingly similar feel.  My skin feels very nice and not so dry.     Second - Dry.  It&#x27;s not quite as clean as the wet but only by the slightest margin.  It&#x27;s still better than the Braun and far better than a rotary.  I&#x27;ve been using dry shaves on the mornings when I&#x27;m rushing out the door.  Very close and not so terrible on the skin, I think there must be a residue of cream that makes the shaver less abrasive than completely dry.    Remington XF8550 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver is very easy to clean since it&#x27;s water proof.  I just shake it under the sink and I&#x27;m done.  Works in the shower as well with no issues.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d like the foil shaver, but I&#x27;m sold.  It&#x27;s definitely a step up from either electric razors that I used before.  If you&#x27;re a fan of the straight razor then you still probably won&#x27;t be convinced to switch.  But you cannot use a straight razor in the car and it&#x27;s safer to use electric inthe shower.  I highly recommend the Remington XF8550 SmartEdge.</li>
    <li> The best thing about the Remington XF8550 is that it can be used either as a wet or dry shaver. I have a tough beard and most electric shavers just don&#x27;t work on my beard. The Remington does a decent job dry shaving and a great job when it&#x27;s used in the shower with a shave gel or foam. Not to mention, it&#x27;s much easier to clean than a conventional dry shaver that can&#x27;t be ran under flowing water. I fully charged the razor before I left for a week long trip to Disney, used it everyday and never had to charge it. I actually got a couple of days at home with it on the original charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;-The battery life is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;-Works exceptionally well in the shower with a foam.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to handle, not too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;-Back side mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-Easiest to clean shaver I&#x27;ve personally used.&lt;br /&gt;-Includes a nice charging cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral&lt;br /&gt;-I little bulky to fit in a small travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;-Dry shaving is a bit more complicated if you have facial hair that grows in multiple directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-This model doesn&#x27;t have a travel setting that allows you to lock it in the off position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Remington XF8550. If you have a long beard you&#x27;ll need to trim it fairly low before using this shaver. However, if you shave everyday or every couple of days you will find it easy to use and highly functional.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington razor several years ago and started using a Norelco rotary  shaver and although I worked ok,it just did not shave a close as I like.So when I saw the new Remington ones,I decided to try one.Much closer shave the the rotary Norelco.Even the trimmer cuts better and is easier to use.</li>
    <li> My husband has never been a big fan of electric shavers. He says that he simply doesn&#x27;t get a close shave like he does with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington Smartedge isn&#x27;t going to be the saver that changes his mind. He liked the look and feel of the shaver, saying it was good to hold, although a bit heavy. The pivoting head did an adequate job on his beard, but because he had to use a degree of pressure to make the thing shave his beard close, he got some razor burn for his trouble. (he also has sensitive skin, despite decades of shaving.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the pop-up trimmer worked well on his sideburns, and he said the battery life was good. He couldn&#x27;t detect any appreciable let up in power after several shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this isn&#x27;t bad for what it does. If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that works well, and your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, this might work for you. But the average guy who uses shaving cream and a razor probably won&#x27;t give up that habit for the shave he&#x27;ll get with this product.</li>
