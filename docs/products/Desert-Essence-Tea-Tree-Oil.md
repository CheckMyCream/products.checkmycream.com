      <li>but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>This seemed like it was about 9 days or more.</li>
      <li>I swear it works better than the mange dip I got from the vet and the over the counter mange stuff I bought at the feed store.</li>
      <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s undiluted.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for hundreds of reasons and have given so many bottles to friends for their needs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used this to help get rid of scabies.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical. I have very sensitive, yet combination and acne prone skin. As a woman in my 30s, this isn&#x27;t exactly cute. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. While this oil doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;prevent&amp;#34; my breakouts, it sure dries them up in record time. And even though it attacks blemishes with a vengeance, my face does not feel tight and pulled as it does with other astringent like/medicated products. This is a must have for me. Once I figure out what is causing my break outs, I will be on my way to skin recovery.</li>
    <li> Great tea tree oil! I use it for all sorts of things but mostly acne and acne scars. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily. Pretty strong scent, but can be diluted with other oils if necessary. Overall great product and I will reorder.</li>
    <li> works well just need to remember to apply it daily</li>
    <li> I overdid with salicylic acid, and my chin was super dry. I grab small bottle of this oil at Trader Joe&#x60;s, used 3 times today, and my skin came back to normal! Blemishes are less visible by far, and my skin is not dry. It&#x60;s amazing how fast that works! I was afraid of the smell, but it&#x60;s not bad (herbs and menthol). It&#x60;s also great with cuts and wounds. I was never interested in essential oils, but I googled the stuff and I&#x60;m gonna try the other ones too (like lavender for sleep and relaxation).Do not hesitate!&lt;br /&gt;Added later: please dilute this, because I use it in full strength few times a day and I burnt my skin, it was really red and patchy for few days. It all went away, but this is strong oil, and I highly recommend to dilute with water.</li>
    <li> Received in great condition!</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil. It has several uses and we use it all the time. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice oil and smells good too</li>
    <li> I mix it in my shampoo and conditioner it has done wonders with my seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.</li>
    <li> I am never without tea tree oil and not loyal to any brand. Just make sure it&#x27;s undiluted.  Always buy 100% Essential Tea Tree Oil.  I buy it in 16 ounce bottles. It last a long time.     As long as it&#x27;s 100 percent tea tree oil I&#x27;m good. It works from everything to getting rid of fleas and mange on dogs to lice and ring worm on children. It even dries out a pimple fairly quickly. And if I were ever to have nail fungus I would treat it with tea trea oil before resorting to other medications.     For lice I place a few drops into a dime sized blotch of shampoo and wash kids hair as usual. Then I do the same with their leave in conditioner and then blow dry child&#x27;s hair completely. Both the heat and the oil kill the lice. To be on the safe side I treat everyone in the house.     Then I soak brushes and combs daily in a water/tea tree oil mix. 40 drops to every 8 ounces of water. You can reuse the water mix if you do this in a bucket.     I also make up the same solution of 60 drops to 8 ounces of water and place it in a spritz bottle so I can spray all our furniture, bedding, clothes, stuffies and whatever else you think might have a louse on it.     I even put 40 drops into my laundry soap and fabric softener. Not the whole bottle, but 40 drops for every wash and rinse cycle. Hope this makes sense.     Sadly, when my children where in elementary school lice was abundant and we had to deal with it on four occasions. The first two times I used the regular products. They are both expensive and not nearly as effective as the tea tree oil, nor as safe. The third time I did two regular shampoos with the chemical ridden shampoos and followed up with tea tree oil regimen that I listed above. That worked great. The fourth time I treated only with tea tree oil regimen and it was super easy to get rid of.       For mange with dogs it&#x27;s similar as the lice treatment. I place several drops into both their dime sized blob of shampoo and conditioner. I leave in the conditioner. Andthen spray them down with the sprintzer full of 60 drops of oil to every 8 ounces of water. In between baths I sprintz them down two times a day and rub the solution into their skin. I also spritz their bedding between washes and carpeting and anything they may lie on. I swear it works better than the mange dip I got from the vet and the over the counter mange stuff I bought at the feed store. Plus, it&#x27;s safer to use than what the vet gives you and smells so much better than what is at the feed store. And most importantly completely gets rid of it.     I also use it in my mop water and my kitchen and bathroom cleaning solutions. I place several drops into my hand soap dispensers. And I even use it to disinfect cuts and other sores. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many different Tea Tree Oil brands but this one is the best. It has a very pleasant aroma unlike many others that I&#x27;ve used. Some that I bought even had vitamin E oil mixed in which smells BAD.     I use it for acne and after years of going from product to product (Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean $ Clear, Cetaphil, Pro-Active YOU NAME IT) with no success, this is the only thing that has worked. Just have be consistent with use. A little lasts a long time for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> I tried buying this brand of TTO and am very happy with my purchase.  It is really strong, so be sure to read the label and don&#x27;t use full strength on your skin.  This 2oz. bottle should last a while.</li>
    <li> Used it for insect bites and it really helped take the itch away.  The smell is strong at first but you get use to it.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of this. Like this size bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old and sometimes have breakouts. I had one that was really bad, so I bought this tea tree oil in hopes of eliminating it or atleast helping it a bit. This product is AWFUL! Never again will I look at amazon reviews; I will instead google what dermatologists think about certain products. This product made me break out so much worse and I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Have been using off and on for several months, have not found any reason to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is 100% pure tea tree oil however, with no fragrances or additives there are a few unavoidable problems for some applications.  The smell is definitely a bit strong, i&#x27;ve never had anyone else notice the smell, but you will definitely smell it when applying it.  This stuff will wreck your skin, i use it for athlete&#x27;s foot and other low visibility skin problems, so its perfect for my uses.  If you&#x27;re planning to use it on your face i would highly recommend diluting it to about 50% water, 50% tea tree oil at least.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil on acne/blemishes and for other times I need an anti bacterial like on cuts. It is a high quality oil and I prefer Desert Essence over other brands I tried.</li>
    <li> This tree tree oil is great for getting rid of the rash I get from plant and dust allergies. It also makes a nice air fresher  when mixed with water in a pump or spray bottle. It freshens closets, cupboards, bathrooms etc., and I&#x27;ve also used a few drops in the laundry. It also lasts a long time. I bought two 2oz bottles over a year ago, and I still have one and a quarter bottles left.</li>
    <li> Love this, Use it all the time, not available at any local stores in my area. Great for topical use</li>
    <li> I add this to my shea butter cream as a disinfectant after swimming in the public swimming pool. It does have a strong smell but with time you get used to it. My kids used to get a lot of ring worms from using the YMCA bathroom after swimming practice but since they started adding it to their creams they no longer get it. I used to get it from the whole foods store but I found it cheaper here on amazon. Love the whole Dessert Essence product line especially the facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I chose the next to highest possible rating because of the diversity of use of this product.  I would recommend it to any and all of my family and friends that need toenails softened or cleaner scalp.</li>
    <li> I have had bad yellow toenail fungus for over a year. I have no idea where it came from. It started in my big toe and spread to the others on the same foot. I don&#x27;t have health insurance, so I&#x27;ve tried over-the-counter and home treatments: Fungi-Nail did not work at all and neither did foot soaks with Listerine, vinegar, alcohol, and other things. I&#x27;d read about tea tree oil as a treatment and bought it about a month ago. As I&#x27;d done before, I trimmed the nails back and filed down the nail beds and applied the oil on the nail beds and under the cuticles with a Q-tip twice a day. About a week ago, I saw a beautiful sight: pink, healthy nails beginning to grow in. I never thought I&#x27;d have them again. So, for me, it took about a month to begin to see some results. I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s working and that I didn&#x27;t waste my money. I know it&#x27;s a long process; it takes diligence and patience. I definitely recommend this to anyone with stubborn toenail fungus. I will be using this oil to prevent recurrence.</li>
    <li> From the land of Men at Work and Olivia Newton John</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small(ish) bottle but a little goes a looooong way. It has already cleared up a bit of skin irritation for me.</li>
    <li> I have used thus product for everything from cleaning the bathroom to treating an ear infection. I am totally in love with this stuff.</li>
    <li> not worth it to return it.  I&#x27;ve bought this brand before and it was great.  But this had the rancid smelling oil with it, and the tea tree oil is usually much stronger of a smell.  I wasn&#x27;t too happy.  I&#x27;ll try a different seller.</li>
    <li> The oil has been effective. I like the see-through container, but the open mouth makes it difficult to dispense the oil in small quantities. Granted this oil is not as expensive as others, so most people aren&#x27;t dispensing it in such a meager manner, but I prefer to use individual drops to target specific areas. When you try to pour it slowly, oil dribbles backward down the neck and body of the container, wasting oil. While I am happy with the oil itself and the price, I have been annoyed by the open mouth. If you apply the oil in a different manner(q-tip, etc.), this may not bother you at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for killing zits.  Dab a little on with a q-tip and leave it overnight.  I also add a little of this to my makeup remover for a fresh and clean feeling.  Its a magic product!  Used to buy this from the Vitamin Shoppe but ordering from Amazon is so much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Used twice a day will cure toe nail fungus. Takes about 2-3 months but so much better than prescription drugs. Use a cotton swab and get down under the nail as far as possible. DO NOT DOUBLE DIP!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before with the label shown. my recent purchase of this product had no seal. Hmmmmmm!</li>
    <li> This is really strong,  but  I think that&#x27;s what makes it work. Be prepared for the burn. I combined it with the zinc sulfur soap and the sulfur ointment, with the vitamin E oil as a moisturizer</li>
    <li> The product was misleading since the similarity of the proscr&#x27;s bottle led me to believe I was reordering the 100% Organic Tree Oil. Instead I received Australian Tree Oil. THERE IS A MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN ODOR AND POTENCY IN MY OPINION. STRONGLY DISPLEASED AND PERCEIVE THIS PRODUCT AS A BAIT AND SWITCH</li>
    <li> It works overnight, but make sure to moisturize after using it because it will dry your skin.</li>
    <li> My husband HAD polyps in his nose.  also had a cath and drug eluding stent and cannot have surgery-  THIS STUFF WHEN USED IN A MEDIPOT REDUCED HIS POLYPS AND THE DOCTOR COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This works better for me on new pimples that are just forming, especially big ones. I just dab some on there and its pretty much gone a day later</li>
    <li> I add a little to my conditioner for lice prevention (I&#x27;m a teacher) and so far I&#x27;ve been good to go! It also makes my hair feel very soft and not greasy. Just wish it smelled a little better, but no problem when added to a scented conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using tea tree oil. I was in desperate need of a product to maintain my acne. I&#x27;ve used countless products and spent loads of money on special gadgets to improve my skin. I began researching after a bad breakout and came across many positive reviews for tea tree oil. Figuring I had nothing to lose I gave it a try and fell in love after first use. It&#x27;s an incredible toner. Interestingly, it&#x27;s an oil that strips oil away and leaves pores tight and clean. The smell can be a little strong at first, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. It is wise to dilute the oil with a moist cotton pad before applying to the face. Also be careful not to let it seep into your eyes. Frequently I experience some stinging in my eyes for a few minutes after applying. I apply before bed and when I wake up the blemish is well on its way to healing if I have popped it, which I admit to doing. Not good. Not to sound gross, but it also helps blemishes come to a head quickly, bringing that white icky stuff to the surface, but i find it to heal faster that way. Tea tree oil can be drying, so even though I have oily skin, if I apply it in the morning I follow it with jojoba oil mixed with a light oil-free moisturizer. This helps avoid flakiness under makeup. I hope it works for everyone suffering from problem skin!</li>
    <li> Bought this to help one of our teenagers with their acne breakouts.  For now, he&#x27;s using so many different natural products it&#x27;s hard to tell if this one is indeed helping??</li>
    <li> If you like Tea Tree oil, this is probably the best out there. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Tea Tree oil is great for healing skin conditions which are mildly infected. You can add a few drops to shampoo for dandruff or other scalp conditions, too. It cleans well, is antiseptic, and is a great healing aid. The scent is herbal and sort of like eucalyptus, but it dissipates. I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> This oil works on my scalp better than I thought it would. My scalp stays dry no matter what I do, but after I started suing this oil, I no longer have dandruff. Great product.</li>
    <li> I first stumbled into the world of essential oils back in 1990 when I needed a part-time job and there was an opening for \\&quot;Weekends Only\\&quot; at a tiny Aromatherapy store in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Back in those days, very few people had even heard of the word and thought FRAGRANCE oils to be synonymous with ESSENTIAL OILS.  It was an invaluable experience working in that store and it changed my life in regards to taking charge of my PERSONAL wellness through the use of Essential Oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO DRUG IS A PANACEA OR MAGIC BULLET FOR EVERYONE!!!! I state this clearly because of the few negative reviews that all the various company&#x27;s that sell Tea Tree Oil have received. For instance, I&#x27;m allergic to Peroxide. The pills Asprin and Tylenol have zero effect on me. So, if you have NEVER used Tea Tree Oil, BUY THE SMALLEST BOTTLE YOU CAN FIND AND TRY IT OUT ON YOURSELF! If you&#x27;re as lucky as I am, it will be your Go-To Treatment for 99% of \\&quot;What Ails You.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many a company&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil and have finally settled on THIS brand. Why? The reasons I list work for ME; they may not work for YOU:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s in a CLEAR bottle! I know, I know: having E.O.&#x27;s in blue/amber bottles protects them from the light, but so does storing them in a dark place. I like being able to SEE how much is used so I know when to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It does NOT have a calibrated \\&quot;Rain Drop\\&quot; apeture in the top, meaning that you can POUR the oil out or use these micro measuring spoons when creating hair or bath products. [[ASIN:B0009X1P9S Norpro 3080 Mini Measuring Spoons, 5 Piece Set]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) PRICE!!!!! Compared to other company&#x27;s with fancier labels and prettier bottles, this product is several dollars LESS expensive than the other brands, without losing a bit of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Availability!!!! Since this product does NOT ship through Amazon Prime, there&#x27;s no cost savings to me. Both my local Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#x27;s sell this brand, so I am no more than a 10 minute drive in any direction when I am running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, those are the reasons why I buy THIS brand. Now, HOW do I use it and HOW has it helped me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) For my body, Tea Tree Oil is Magical!!! Every single thing that you can find online with HOW this oil works, it responds that well in MY body! YOUR results may vary. Since discovering the sheer effectiveness on my system, I keep no less than SIX bottles in our lives: in my purse; in our first aid kits; and in every medicine cabinet. My family has been taught by me that Tea Tree Oil is thee FIRST response to ANYTHING that breaks the skin and it&#x27;s kept our medical bills down to ZERO. Yes, ZERO!!!, in regards to the common things you go to the doctor for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I have had chronic and debilitating ear infections my entire life. As a child, I&#x27;ve spent weeks in hospital with infections that threatened my life. Countless surgeries on my ears have done NOTHING to stop the infections, which can come on in an hour. Now, as soon as I feel the Tell-Tale tingling in my ear, I grab my bottle of Tea Tree Oil and swipe it down the entire side of my face. I repeat this process every single hour until the tingling stops. Results? NO MORE EAR INFECTIONS AND NO MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS OR DOCTOR VISITS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) When my family and I have a scratchy throat or have been subjected to anyone with a severe cold or the flu, we place a couple of drops on a cotton pad and then deeply inhale the vapors and hold it in our lungs for the count of five, then exhale and repeat the process. Since doing this, NO ONE in my family has had a cold or the flu in 8 years!!!! NO ONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) We have a Summer Cottage near a lake which means ticks, chiggers and mosquitoe bites. One drop of this oil on ANY of the following solves the itch, the pain and the resulting infections. We&#x27;ve seen ticks actually back out of the skin when a drop of this oil is placed on their backs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Tooth infections! I had four Wisdom Teeth extracted. After it was okay to rinse my mouth, I placed a drop of Tea Tree Oil in warm water and would rinse out my mouth when directed. When I went in for my check up, my dentist was SHOCKED at the healing of my gums and was suspicious as to WHY they had healed so well and so fast! Seriously, Dr.? Shouldn&#x27;t you have just been HAPPY for me? LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) And for me, directly, the use of Tea Tree Oil in my daily job is a God Send! I&#x27;m a Landscape Architect with a staff of 17 men. Every single day, we get injured; it comes with the job. Whether it&#x27;s a deep penetration of a thorn, a complete scraping of skin from a tree you&#x27;re climbing, a deep knick when you&#x27;re sharpening a pruner, or a massive sliver that got jammed into a palm, we have daily injuries. Since we can&#x27;t stop work when this happens, we normally would just rinse the area off with a hose and continue working. More than half of the time, these injuries would get worse, with either the employee or myself loosing productivity or hours, because we couldn&#x27;t use that hand or arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve taught every one of my guys to come to me for treatment and they hold out their injury to receive some drops of Tea Tree Oil. At first, they were skeptical; now, some are SO convinced, they&#x27;ve had me buy bottles for their own homes. And for home use, this oil is amazing! I&#x27;ve had deep knife cuts from a knife slipping out of my hands while washing; I&#x27;ve had deep scratches from our dogs and cats when we&#x27;ve tried to corral them for the vet; and 100% of these injuries NEVER get infected nor turn pink or swollen if treated immediately with this oil. Healing time is 3-5 times faster than when left untreated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used this oil for acne, cold sores, tooth aches, ear infections, athlete&#x27;s foot, insect bites and all manner of skin breaks. For whatever reasons, our DNA works with this oil. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it such glowing reviews. YOUR results may NOT be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d recommend that you buy the smallest bottle possible, to keep it fresh and pure. In my home and purse, I buy the .05 ounce size and when it&#x27;s half full, I buy a replacement bottle and store it in the frig. Remember, NOTHING that you put to the opening is sterile (cotton balls, swabs or your fingers!), so with each touch of the oil, you are contaminating it. So, buying a large 2 ounce bottle just allows the oil to become less and less effective. The one exception for me, is that for work I buy the 2 ounce bottle, simply because we go through one of those bottles at least once a month and it&#x27;s more cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you want to learn about more health benefits of essential oils, THIS book is the BEST there is!

    <li> I have used this since I was a kid. It is a first aid kit just by itself. This is the only brand of tea tree oil products I have ever used. I sold other brands in the health food store but never got as much positive feedback as I did with this. And why try something else if this one is perfect. I have used this for hundreds of reasons and have given so many bottles to friends for their needs. One bottle should last years since you usually only use a drop, but if you give them away like I do you will be back for more. It doesn&#x27;t go rancid either!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the book, \\&quot;Tea Tree Oil Bible,\\&quot; with this bottle of TT oil.  I learned quit a bit about healing with natural ingredients, vs. chemicals, and now I must admit, I am a TT oil junky.  There are so many uses for this wonderful natural product and it works so well....naturally....I&#x27;ve been spreading the word to all my friends and acquaintances....this is the way to go!!!</li>
    <li> No miracle cure, but effective enough to invest in. I add it to green clay masks and use it on occasional shoulder acne. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> First time trying this type of oil.  It did offer some itchy relief but it is very oily and has a strong odor that stays for a while.  Used it a few times but the benefits did not outweigh the strong smell so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I first started using tea tree oil about 5 years ago, and my mother told me that Desert Essences has been around since she was young and was the most reliable brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therein I found the solution to many skin issues I had been experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne: tea tree oil is great for people who suffer from acne, it is a natural antibacterial so your pores absorb the bacteria killing goodness and it won&#x27;t dry out your skin. I apply a generous amount multiple times a day to blemishes and they&#x27;re usually gone in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Athlete&#x27;s Foot: tea tree oil is also an anti fungal and can be applied to athletes foot and any irritation in the toe nails (I know from experience)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff: if you&#x27;re experiencing dandruff you can add a little tea tree oil to your shampoo and it treats the cause (fungal I believe?) of the dandruff on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink eye: I don&#x27;t recommend this for the faint of heart and DO NOT GET IT DIRECTLY IN YOUR EYES but if you ever have pink eye you can use a q-tip to apply a very small amount of tea tree oil to clean the crust from AROUND your eyes throughout the day but be very careful to not get it IN your eyes. It fumes made my eyes water a little but I found it to be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etc: whenever I experience any sort of irritation or abnormalities in my skin I immediately reach for my tea tree oil. The smell is strong at first but you get used to it pretty quickly and when you see how much it helps your skin you&#x27;ll learn to ignore it.</li>
    <li> I pretty much use tea tree oil to disinfect everything. The Desert Essence brand definitely makes a quality tea tree oil. I haven&#x27;t found one that I like better.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well for acne BUT BE WARNED: you NEED to dilute the Tea Tree Oil (TTO) with something before putting it on your skin!  I learned that the hard way when I tried to spot treat a bunch of pimples every night for a few days, and by the 2nd-3rd day they had all turned into EXTREMTLY red marks on my skin.  The pure TTO on my skin was a terrible idea and I definitely burned myself with it, and those marks took a good 7 days before they went away.  That was completely my fault so I don&#x27;t take any stars away from the product for that. It also says directly on the bottle not to apply directly to skin, but I read where many people used it as a spot treatment so I went ahead and tried it.  I still spot treat larger pimples every now and then, but when I do I dip the very tip of a cotton swab into the bottle and BARELY touch the pimple with it to spot treat it.  I can&#x27;t stress enough how SMALL of an amount you need to use if you&#x27;re going to spot treat with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that incident, I started to dilute the TTO with witch hazel (the alcohol-free toner, NOT the astringent which has a certain % alcohol).  It&#x27;s recommended to do a 5% solution with 5% TTO and 95% of your diluting liquid, which in my case is the witch hazel.  I don&#x27;t measure it out or anything, I just pour ONE drop onto a cotton ball and then 3-4 good squeezes out of the witch hazel bottle and wipe that all over my face and neck every night.  Sometimes I follow with a moisturizer an hour or so later, but not always.  The witch hazel with aloe does a good job of preventing dry skin the next day.  You will feel a tingle sensation on your skin and you should see noticeable results in literally 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most potent tea tree oil&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used. I use this tea tree oil to kill acne, I take a cotton swab, dip it into the bottle and apply it directly to acne and the acne will disappear within 2-3 days. I also put this tea tree oil in a homemade mouthwash that I make, I mix 1 cap full in a 32oz bottle of water and salt, it winds up being a lot more potent than commercial grade mouthwashes. This tea tree oil is extremely potent, most folks may need to dilute it before applying it to their skin so be careful before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Very high quality, strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: Australia</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to tea tree oil when I first got an insane number of bug bites over last summer. Now whenever it&#x27;s humid outside, I have to have a bottle of 100% tea tree oil with me to repel bugs! It really works great to take away the itch away from bites, and it works as a great bug repellent. The strong medicinal smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and I actually like it but that can&#x27;t be said for others.   I love the versatile function of tea tree oil but like other reviewers have mentioned, be sure that you buy only 100% tea tree oil no matter what brand you buy. It&#x27;s expensive but it lasts a long time if you use it occasionally. I find that this is a great natural alternative to other chemicals that are out there and again, the versatility may actually end up saving you more money depending on your needs!  As an alternative to buying online, you may be able to find 100% tea tree oil in your local drug/pharmacy store like CVS.</li>
    <li> Great for applying on pimples, etc.  I mix it with my homemade body butters and i love it. The smell is strong but it will go away after 30 mins or so. Fast shipping with amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of tea tree oil but this is my favorite. It&#x27;s not too strong &amp; not too weak just right. It feels great on the skin like it has plenty of moisturizer oil in it &amp; the smell is not overwhelming. It&#x27;s the only brand I will ever use.&lt;br /&gt; Shipment seemed really long. Other stuff I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon usually arrives in 3-5 days. This seemed like it was about 9 days or more.</li>
    <li> great product, works great</li>
    <li> I saw reviews commenting on the stink of the product, and I didn&#x27;t believe them because I&#x27;ve bought tea tree oil shampoo before. This smells nothing like tea tree oil shampoo just to warn you. It had a strong medicinal smell like a harsh chemical but works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for a few hours and have used it for so much. I&#x27;ve used it for my dandruff flakes, and they&#x27;re disappearing. I put some in the bath, and when I came out of the tub my skin was glowing and my skin tone even.&lt;br /&gt; I even used it to wash my face, and it did just as good a job of clearing the dead skin away as clinique step 2 of the 3 step treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a little bit of the oil in the sink with water and soaked towels in the oil-water solution and my completely soiled towels came out almost spot free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with some water in a spray bottle and cleaned my entire bathroom almost as easily as I do with a Mr. Clean magic eraser. Works well an fast for set in tub icky ness (the brown ring around the tub that had been there for a few days.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten nail fungus on my big toe from badly banging it.  The first time I had the standard 4-month oral anti-fungal medication treatment doctors prescribe.  It worked for me but it&#x27;s nasty, only works 85% of the time, and has bad side-effects  Tea tree oil gets the most positive reviews as an alternative treatment and I absolutely did not want to do the anti-fungal treatment again, so I tried it.. You are supposed to put it twice a day (use cue-tips) for just as long as the drug treatment (4 months or until the nail has completely grown out normally), so don&#x27;t blame it if you stop too soon.  I noticed that nail fungal growth had stopped almost right away. DON&#x27;T ask for the anti-fungal medicine without trying this first,  Western medicine is awesome, but this is one of the places where it is off-track.</li>
    <li> i was never a tee trea oil fan because evry1&#x27;s always talking about how strong this particular oil is. But as i was doing sum research i read of how GOOD it worked on acne, but let me say dis, this oil is freaking awwwsome for acne. PERFECT for those menstraul breakouts, luv, luv, love!!!</li>
    <li> desert essence makes so many great tea tree products. i love the pure oil. i use it for my face, as a feminine hygiene product, and as a blemish spot treatment. i NEED this product always it is a crucial cosmetic for me. it is best diluted with water because it is a very strong oil. i find it lasts a long time. just put a cotton ball on top, a quick turn upside down and run a little water on the ball. i&#x27;m sure there is an easier way but it works for me. (and honestly i like the burn so i dont always dilute it.) i really bought it at first because it was recommended as an acne treatment, and it was the perfect treatment for acne but there are so many other uses.</li>
    <li> The Best.  Cant live with out. Use to heal wounds.  Defend against Mosquito&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I use this tea tree oil for breakouts works like a charm. Each and every time the quality is CONSISTENT which I greatly value in any products I use.</li>
    <li> Very high quality.  I use it on my family and my farm animals and get exactly the results I am looking for.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t started using tea tree oil, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing! Just google the uses, they&#x27;re seemingly endless. I use it for oral care, insect repellant, and a decongestant just to name a few of the things, but it is said to cure yeast infections, dandruff, ear infections and much much more. The smell is pretty pungent, but it wears off of the shin pretty quickly and if I use it in the bath, a drop or 2 of peppermint oil offsets it completely. No matter what kind of relief you are looking for, you have got to try this stuff! A homeopathic cure all!</li>
    <li> Last forever.  Great price and quality oil.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil has got the most horrible smell never. At home or at work everyone knew I was using it. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use with water on a cotton ball to wash my face. Great for small acne marks and drying them out. Lasts forever too.</li>
    <li> Great product with many great uses!! Love it.  I use it for my dandruff, pimps, and cuts.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use for toenail fungus and i started to notice about a week and a half or two that it was working</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week I guess since I started using this product in replacement of my body shop tea tree oil. I am having a bad acne on my face because of my hormonal imbalance. This oil so far is a big help on drying my acne. I am hoping this product can help on fading my old blemishes. I don&#x27;t dilute it with water since I badly need a max strength.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described on the bottle. I got what I wanted. The only thing that could be better is the price. I found it to be slightly expensive.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree is one of my favorite oils and Desert Essence is my favorite brand.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Loved this product, it worked really well.</li>
    <li> Just recently received this product but really like it so far. It does have a strong scent when you open the bottle (like others point out on here); however, if you use a carrier oil - like Jojoba oil with it, the smell is really reduced. Applied this with a Qtip after applying jojoba oil to a few new &amp;#34;breakout&amp;#34; areas on my face and they immediately started reducing in size overnight and have dried up. This is a little stinging to the face if you just put it on directly but with the carrier oil, it doesn&#x27;t burn so much. Excited about the other reviews for using this product for so many other purposes...will have to try those too.</li>
    <li> very concentrate, need to be use with delution&lt;br /&gt;Any way, it worths. nice product. strong smell. may find out more uses.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this. I&#x27;m not into the whole oils thing but it can&#x27;t hurt. Right? Right!! This stuff is great. It cleared up my teenage childs acne, It makes my face feel so soft and smooth after I use it. My complexion is really looking good. We use it on burns, cuts, scrapes. You can look up all kinds of ways to use it!</li>
    <li> Use it topically for acne, sunburn, as an anti-bacterial agent on wounds, to heal scars more quickly, or if you happen to like the smell.  I keep multiples stocked in my house.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil has long been praised for its fine health properties.Being a longtime user,,Desert Essence is the key factor in this review.This brand makes the best tea tree oil ,with great results.While the price might be  a bit steep,the results are worth the price</li>
    <li> The label is different and is the new desert essence labels. Genuine product here. I think its good quality compared to other &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brands. I use it for cosmetics and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Great product--I have used Tea Tree oil for many years and this is the best price I have found.  Quick delivery, nicely packaged, too.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the purchase.- this is a good brand and I like it.  I will definitely purchase here again.</li>
    <li> Love this strong oil. I think it will kill most germs.  Sometimes I use it for my gums.</li>
    <li> Strong stuff. Keep away from children and pets. Works when you need it. I will buy again. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been told that this product loses strength if exposed to light. So I bought dark colored bottles to transfer it to and it is great.</li>
    <li> I you use tea tree oil, you know that this stuff is the best quality on the planet. The eco harvest stuff they offer is junk compared to the original. This bottle is three times the cost in the local stores as it is here on Amazon. We use it for skin blemishes, cuts, inside the nose and ears and it also works great with a drop on your toothpaste! Thanks for the deal Amazon!</li>
    <li> First, the medicinal smell is very strong as others mentioned.  However, my husband liked the smell a lot more than I did.  I used it on my scalp and it was very refreshing but hard on my hair.  I also tried it on some itchy areas but it did not help those.  Not so sure I will continue, I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
    <li> Only thing that helps my cystic acne. I bought it twice now and will probably keep using the same product.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, and great product!</li>
    <li> Very effective for so many uses. I&#x27;ve used it to eliminate toenail fungus, and unclog/dissolve a sebaceous cyst.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good quality tea tree oil. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural but effective way to reduce acne</li>
    <li> this is really strong oil but still. very gentle on the skin.  I got it based on amazon posted reviews.  It looks like the product will last  for a long time. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband was looking for and at a much better price than he had been paying!  We are very pleased!!</li>
