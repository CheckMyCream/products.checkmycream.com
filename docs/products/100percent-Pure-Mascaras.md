<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. Love 100% Pure products. This mascara is great and smells like wild blueberries. No complaints. No flaking or smearing.</li>
    <li> Well just like the other reviews I love it so far only used it once though very pretty color I have hazel brown eyes and wear Purple Raspberry and Pink quite ofter so when I seen this product I just had to try it I does go on thin but it does build up lengthens great the trick is to apply a primer first  then mascara use a heated eyelash curler curl your lashes then reapply mascara ...My lashes are all different lengths so hopefully this will help with that too and use s lash primer which I did to thicken they look noticeable but not over the tops very feminine.P.S. smells great too</li>
    <li> I love it - it&#x27;s the only mascara I use - and I love the color.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Smells so good I could eat it...but its a great mascara..smooth..no clumps and very deep color. Best part..its all natural!</li>
    <li> At first I thought this mascara was too thin to be noticeable. However, I learned to take just a little more time applying it, and then it looks very pretty. I love the color, with just a hint of purple. I also enjoy the smell, which seems natural and a bit like fruit. Mostly I appreciate that I&#x27;m not using all those chemicals on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I already have this mascara in Black Tea and that continues to be the best color to make my light brown eyes pop.  This color isn&#x27;t really a black purple it&#x27;s burgundy.  It doen&#x27;t make my eyes pop like the Black Tea but it does give them a nice daytime look.  Every lash gets it&#x27;s own coat and it does really bring them out but it&#x27;s not obvious about it. I do have to say that 100% pure is the first mascara I have used that defines my lashes like this no matter how many coats I put and never turns them rock hard.</li>
    <li> If they are out of black then try tis color. My fav mascara.</li>
    <li> This is by FAR the best mascara I have ever used.  Why?  No &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t smear or flake.  The weather in my area is VERY hot - no issues with running either.  One more reason - I am a redhead and black mascara makes me look FAKE since my lashes are pretty invisible naturally.  This mascara darkens them in a very natural looking way - and a little plus is it smells GREAT!!  I&#x27;ve used purple mascara before and this one is much more natural looking and enhances my green eyes too!  Now that I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it, I can only hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.  WELL worth every penny spent!</li>
    <li> Smells good - all natural and the package is nice as well. I will continue to buy this product - .</li>
    <li> A natural no chemicals smells great Mascara. This product works great and lasts all day. This is the best mascara I have used in years. I quit using regular mascara because it all made my eyes burn, turn red and my eye lashes were falling out. never agin will I use a different mascara.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Looks great. Feels great knowing that it&#x27;s all natural. Performs just as well as any other mascara I&#x27;ve used. I love it!</li>
    <li> This mascara lengthens my lashes and looks great on, smells amazing, and is my new favorite mascara.  Will definitely purchase again and again.  I will never go with &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s with questionable ingredients ever again.</li>
    <li> Smells so delicious too!</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do much to my lashes at all.  I was really disappointed.  This got decent reviews, but iI am not seeing an of it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and doesn&#x27;t flake. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn make-up for a long time.  Since I&#x27;ve decided to join the dating pool, I wanted to re-learn the art of applying and selecting make-up that enhances my inner and outer beauty.    Particular about what I put into and onto my body - I searched high and low, read countless reviews and decided to go with this mascara. Pricey, but simple - without all the chemical binders that conventional make-up uses, I tried this twice and had no side affects at all.    So, I&#x27;m staying with it because it highlights my lashes, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or smear, even if I cry.  I can understand the ingredients and of course, feel better using a natural mascara.    And, I applaud the company for producing a healthier make-up that supports my desire to wear non-toxic products.</li>
    <li> Definitely lengthens, lasts all day, and smells great with no toxic chemicals to boot. Love it!</li>
    <li> This mascara is by far the best!!! It&#x27;s all natural, high quality with excellent color and lasts all day. I found the &#x27;black tea&#x27; last even longer and use a combination of the black berry&#x27; and &#x27;black tea&#x27; for a fuller effect and to highlight my brown eyes.&lt;br /&gt;They have lasted me a year and I put some visine in it to make it go longer a trick I learned not recommended by 100% Pure. You should really replace cosmetics every few months six or seven at the most. Will definitely be ordering again here shortly and eager to try some of their foundations.&lt;br /&gt;Thier make up is free of any chemicals preservatives and even the ones that claim to be safe like titanium dioxide.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My eyelashes are actually growing longer not being hampered by chemicals</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It goes on well and adds length to my lashes. It smells awesome and washes off with ease. I feel good about putting something so natural on my face.</li>
    <li> This is one awesome mascara I love and it smells like berries!! I baught the purple one for my green eyes. Love it so much.</li>
    <li> I never wear make up. Never. Not until now. Why? Because it&#x27;s stuffed full a ton of crap that is just murder on the skin and the body. Plus, it irritates the you know what out of me! I end up rubbing it off within hours. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I scrapped mascara off my lashes with my finger nails just so I could rub my eyes without looking like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AWESOME. They really got it right! It&#x27;s not too heavy and never looks clumpy. I apply a coat, let it dry, and do one more for a dramatic look. I LOVE the purple - I have green eyes so this is a good look for me. I already have long lashes that curl up so I don&#x27;t know much about lengthening or curling. But my lashes are light coloured at the tips so mascara is a must for any look! When I wear make-up I use a lot of natural tones and don&#x27;t wear it super heavy. I just love this mascara for that. Since there are no clumps and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy it adds just that hint of accent without being over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the ingredients (or lack thereof!) The color is great. The feel is fantastic. It isn&#x27;t irritating at all and once dry it never smudges or rubs off for me all day. But I can take it off with a gentle baby wipe. Looking forward to trying more products from this company! I&#x27;m also a Pacifica girl as of late and am happy I can actually wear make-up!</li>
    <li> Love everything about this mascara. Only product I will use.</li>
    <li> I have been using more natural products and wanted to find a good mascara. This one works well and smells great! It doesn&#x27;t flake or run. It&#x27;s easy to remove. I have the purple and it is great for everyday use. May not be dramatic enough for special events, but great for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got the bunny logo, so no animal testing.  Lasts all day for me.  Good mascara.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased black, brown and berry. Black is best for me, but the others are just fine and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how good this mascara smells (like fruit) in addition to being a high quality product.  It is not clumpy and I would repurchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  It does not clump, leaves your lashes so feminine looking - not all botched up with gooey harsh black looking eyes that are so fake.  This mascara is natural, and is so easy to come off with the pure cleanser.  love, love, love it</li>
    <li> This is the best product. No eye irritation, finally!! Covers well Doesn&#x27;t smudge The smell is heaven! It is wonderful Love it</li>
    <li> This mascara lengthens and doesn&#x27;t clump up on the eye lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes.  The brush needs a different shape as is somewhat hard to apply on lower lashes.  It stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge either.</li>
    <li> This is a very clean product without any silicones or difficult to remove waxes. If you are switching from a conventional mascara, you will need to let go of the need for thick, flirty lashes. This is more of a lash tint and needs to be applied in multiple layers to achieve any kind of thickness. It doesn&#x27;t crumb or flake and is relatively non-clumping. It removes easily.</li>
    <li> After using for a while my lashes started to get slightly fuller. It smells amazing every time I put it on! Will but again. When I cry, my tears are purple...but it never smudges or smears</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t use any other mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I love the purple</li>
    <li> this did not work well for me.  it was too light for my wimpy lashes.  I&#x27;m guessing it would work well for someone with fuller lashes</li>
    <li> I got this in the purple color. I would say its like a dark brown once its on. Its a simple day time mascara. It does not give a lot of extra length or volume. I wont be using it on smoky eye nights. Oh- and it smells awesome- good enough to eat!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Smells amazing! And the fact that it is made out of all natural ingredients is the best part.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a little dark so I wouldn&#x27;t call it purple more brown but the quality is the best.  You can layer it as much as you want, stays on forever yet comes off with just water.  The best mascara I have ever purchased, will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> wears off the end of the day as most</li>
    <li> Covers nicely after a few applications. Smells yummy. Don&#x27;t really care for how it leaves red lines on my skin after I apply. When wiping off excess with a Qtip its not too bad. I like the blueberry and black much better however and I give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing it, I&#x27;m totally hooked on their mascara. The first formula I bought was their black tea and it had a consistency closer to commercial mascaras, but I switched to the blackberry which is a little more runny. I believe the acidity from the berry keeps it from getting clumpy, and in turn the application is much lighter and easier to control. I give my lashes a quick and light coat and it gives my eyes just the right definition and amount of pop. My boyfriend also likes the scent a lot, so he often kisses the apples of my cheeks to smell it. Win win. Lastly, I like that it&#x27;s natural, but I would LOVE it if all of it were organic. Hopefully one day!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara. I love that it is 100% natural and safe! It smells amazing, has great color and will last all day!&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another brand again. I will be trying my 100% Pure products in the future!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and looks beautiful. Really brings out my green eyes and makes your eyelashes look long and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This mascara wipes off easily and is very kind to sensitive eyes. My lashes actually do appear longer. There is still the clumping issue which is why I did not give the a five star rating.</li>
    <li> This mascara smells amazing! I have dark eyelashes, so the color doesn&#x27;t show much but it does give my lashes some nice length without clumping. It also applies well and I have had no problems with it wearing off throughout the day or irritation. The only complaint I have is that when I received this mascara it was a little dry compared to my last tube of the 100% pure black tea mascara.</li>
    <li> Always on the lookout for good natural mascara so. This is one I always go back to.</li>
    <li> First, I should mention I&#x27;ve never worn much makeup, and hence, have little skill in applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened this mascara, wow, it smelled wonderfully berry. Lovely. But, after applying, the berry smell soon dissipated and another, somewhat unpleasant smell remained. I&#x27;m not sure what the smell is, and some people probably like it, but I don&#x27;t care for it although I got used to it soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, but have trouble getting enough of it on my lashes (?). It seems to dry a little too quickly (?)... not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad? Guess I can just apply a 2nd coat when it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Maybelline girl.  And when wearing mascara have always been complemented on the length of my lashes.  However, knowing the toxicity of these main stream mascaras is not worth it to me.  So, I bought two different natural mascaras.  I have been using the 100% Fruit Pigmented Ultra Lengthening for over one month.  There is no clumping and no flaking.  When I received it I was a bit shocked at the purple hue.  However, it works beautifully!  I have hazel/green eyes and brown hair.  I can not tell that there is even a purple hue to the mascara once it is applied onto my lashes.  This effect may be different for someone with lighter colored hair or lashes.  My own eye lashes are dark, the tips are light.  It is only evident that they are long when I have mascara on.  This mascara builds nicely as well.  I will not miss using Maybelline at all.  Although Maybelline is a cheaper brand, it was what worked well for me.  I have tried many other brands.  I will be sticking with the 100% Fruit Pigmented Ultra Lengthening Mascara.  It is my new favorite without the toxic cancer causing chemicals!  Oh, and it smells amazing too- Bonus.</li>
    <li> This product smells very good and I like that is all natural but it is cakey and it clumped my eyelashes! The worst feeling for me is feeling like I am wearing mascara. I don&#x27;t think i will be buying this again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She says it stays on well, does not smudge, and looks even on her eyelashes. No clumping.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara; only pitfall is the price- but I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascaras and they were always clumpy. I wanted to find a natural mascara in dark purple to highlight my green eyes without being too much. This mascara is perfect AND it smells amazing! It really makes my green eyes pop without having the mascara look obviously a different color. It&#x27;s not very noticeable that I am even wearing mascara!! This is possibly the most natural mascara I have tried (and I have tried many). I think I will stock up on the black purple mascara and perhaps get the black and brown as well. Seriously! Try this mascara...it&#x27;s awesome! :)</li>
    <li> My very favorite Mascara EVER!  I love this mascara!  It has a great feel and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes with all of those icky chemicals that other brands have.  The brush could be a little fluffier, but I am very happy with this product.  PLEASE MAKE A BLUE/BLACK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am comparing this mascara to Lancome mascara (which I loved until they literally started taking my sight).</li>
    <li> too dry to apply smoothly</li>
    <li> I have tried all three of these all-natural mascaras, and all of them are easy to use and do a great job enhancing my lashes.  Like all of the products from this company,  they contain no harsh or synthetic chemicals.</li>
    <li> I am soooooo happy with this mascara!!! It lengthens my lashes beautifully with no clumping whatsoever, smells amazing and is all natural!! Washes right off! What more could you ask for??? Just one thing:  It&#x27;s not Waterproof so do not wear it if there&#x27;s any chance you&#x27;ll be crying or in a rain storm.  Was on my bike one night and got stuck in a torrential rain storm with high winds, all the mascara ran into my eyes and really burned!!!  Aside from the waterproof thing, it&#x27;s an awesome mascara and smells fruity too! I&#x27;ve purchased 3 times so far!!!</li>
    <li> I have both the Dark Chocolate and Blackberry mascara from 100% Pure.  I prefer the Blackberry as it seems to go on more smooth and consistent for me, however both are fantastic.  I don&#x27;t experience any clumping with the Blackberry, and just a little with the Dark Chocolate, but still less than with conventional mascaras.  It makes my eyes look more defined but without the overdone clumpy mascara look so many women suffer from!  I typically end up with raccoon eyes when I wear mascara, but I can wear this brand all day long and not have any rings around my eyes.  I&#x27;m trying to \\&quot;green\\&quot; my cosmetic collection and am glad I found 100% Pure!  The mascara also cleans off easily with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> My wife is allergic to something in the formula. She thinks it is the beeswax. We had to send it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara.  I got blackberry because it was the cheapest at the time.  I can&#x27;t really tell that it&#x27;s not black.  But I have VERY black lashes anyway- so maybe that&#x27;s why.  I experience no flaking at all and the mascara goes on pretty smoothly.  It&#x27;s not going to work wonders for you if you are trying to get the fake lashes look- but if you are looking for a very nice natural mascara this one works beautifully.  I also don&#x27;t get the irritated, dried out feeling in my eyes that I used to get with traditional mascara.  I&#x27;m sold on this brand and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and am allergic to a lot of dyes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a naturally dyed mascara but was skeptical that it would look as good as my trusty MAC mascara. I&#x27;ve used MAC for over 10yrs and I honestly think this one is better! First off, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or make my eyes itch. It looks great, it really defines and lengthens my lashes. It doesn&#x27;t smudge either! I&#x27;m so happy and will not use anything else!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara for &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34;.  It smells delicious and is completely natural.  It was a bit too thin at first but got to the right consistency after a couple uses.  It makes my lashes super dark and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- most definitely NOT waterproof.  Even squirting too many eyedrops into my eye has made this start running all over the place including into my eye where it stings a surprising amount.  I put up with this because on a regular basis I want to be using a product with only natural ingredients.  But this is not my mascara choice for a night out or a long sweaty day...</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my lashes at all. Waste of money. Sad, because I love natural products, but this one does not even come close to acceptable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a week or so, but I LOVE it so far. Not cakey or clumpy, smells lovely and really lengthens my lashes. You can control how dramatic you want your lashes to be with the number of coats, and the color is perfect, particularly for light eyes and complexions. And of course, I&#x27;m stoked that it&#x27;s more natural than its chemical counterparts. Great find!</li>
    <li> The products by 100% Pure are top quality.  This mascara is a great natural alternative to add to your make up bag.  It works well \, lasts, and comes in a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Not uncommon, but I was so disappointed when I had a reaction a few hours later, with redness &amp; itching &amp; puffiness under the eyes. There was one mascara that I had that reaction to years ago: Maybelline Great Lash. I compared the ingredients to both &amp; the only common denominator is Cera Alba (Beeswax). It&#x27;s used in lots of cosmetics &amp; I wear them with no problems, except for mascara. So I had to return this, &amp; will look for another natural product without beeswax. Somehow the synthetic waxes &amp; all the other non-natural ingredients do not bother me. Go figure. Still, I am planning to switch to organic products. Now I know the culprit. But the color is great &amp; I hope to find another like it.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this mascara!!!! Definitely the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t  clumps :)</li>
    <li> I chose 2 stars because Amazon says 2 stars means &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34;; which I don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t hate the mascara, but the brush is minimal, the color is so-so, and it doesn&#x27;t thicken or lengthen my lashes any more than your average $5 tube.</li>
    <li> This scrumptious-smelling mascara is dark purple--not bright or loud, just a softer look than a pure black mascara. The wand works well, and the mascara is easy to remove. It has the staying power of any average non-waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work, but it just does not in any capacity.  It barely makes your lashes noticeable, and if you live in a hot or humid place, or it drizzles or rains -- watch out, because this stuff will be all over your face.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what happened with this past order, but the &amp;#34;blackberry&amp;#34; color was light purple and produced absolutely no color on my lashes. When I&#x27;ve ordered this mascara in the past, the color was black with a very slight hint of purple. Such a bummer because the previous one I used made my green eyes pop.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Will buy again. Feeling good about switching to organic!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara...Love this brand.</li>
    <li> I was previously using Tarte mascara, which was my favorite, but the EWG score is in the moderate range. It annoys me to purchase a product that&#x27;s supposed to be natural and not get a truly low hazard product (their products vary, so look them up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara works well for coloring my lashes, but doesn&#x27;t do much otherwise. I find that I&#x27;m applying more of this than I would have with Tarte to get close to the same effect. However, my lashes are pretty thick and curl nicely, so I don&#x27;t need anything too crazy. This stuff smells like berries (amazing!) and does a decent job holding my curl as well. I think I&#x27;ll continue with this product but will change over to the black for my next tube (tried the plum color since I had green eyes, just goes on like a brown).</li>
    <li> The product was already used (or had been opened and at least applied to other eye lashes).  When I opened it and pumped the stick, an eyelash came out with wand.  The product was not sealed so it was returned immediately.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see all natural products, as I have contact dermatitis to many chemicals.  I ordered mascara, lip gloss, eye shadow and eye liner.  Loved this mascara and color.  Unfortunately, within an hour my eyes were watering, bright red, itching, burning and throbbing.  This lasted almost 24 hours.  I did some research and found that tocopheral-a is natural vitamin E with acetic acid added to it aka carboxylic acid, which I am allergic to.  There are many articles on the dermatis, blisters and problems with tocopheral-a.  This product has vitamin E, but I don&#x27;t know if it is tocopheral-a, a form of vitamin E that is not natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the manufacturer, Purity Cosmetics, asking for the MSDS/label, materials safety data sheet.  It&#x27;s been over three days and I have received no response to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I heard from 100% Pure and the lot numbers indicated old make-up.  They have since replaced everything I bought from resellers.  I am now wearing the new make-up without any problems.  I first tested it on my wrist.  They use tocopheral alpha and not tocopheral acetate, so I am not allergic.</li>
    <li> I  usually buy the black tea version and love it but this was cheaper so I decided to try it out.  It isn&#x27;t very black which is a big deal for me and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give the same volume; this may just be an illusion due to the color change.  It smells AMAZING but I will be switching back to the black tea version.</li>
    <li> A nightmare to apply! I was so looking forward to loving it, but it is so dry! I made several attempts to wear this and the only result was flakes all over my face and clumpy, flaky lashes. I absolutely love the color, the scent, and that it is all natural. Unfortunately it is unwearable.</li>
    <li> I have medium length eyelashes, they absolutely love to stick out straight. I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a mascara that will give me great length, separation and won&#x27;t clump! Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to convert my beauty routine to natural products, your skin absorbs anything you put on it! I was searching around on Amazon for \\&quot;natural makeup\\&quot; when 100% Pure caught my eye. I&#x27;d never heard of it, the only natural makeup I&#x27;ve ever used is Physicians Formula, and even that brand makes me question if it&#x27;s truly organic. I went right to the mascara and read some reviews. I didn&#x27;t realize you could click down for other colors lol, so I ordered this mascara in Blackberry. But I was excited to try the \\&quot;shimmering dark plum.\\&quot; After a week of waiting, I finally had a pretty; silver, slick tube in my hands! The product is pigmented with blackberries so it smells pretty fruity and fresh--my boyfriend even noticed that I smelled fruity haha. The brush is great, it always has the perfect amount of product on it. The formula itself is wet and applies smoothly without caking lashes together. I get amazing length and separation with this! The only problem I&#x27;m running into is it doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl, unless I curl a second time after applying (and doing that, this mascara doesn&#x27;t cause me to have any sticky lashes, so less damage to them!) My brown eyes look very pretty with the plum color, it looks very natural, I actually like it better than black. The price isn&#x27;t bad for what I get: amazing length, no clumps, great ingredients! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras and some have worked pretty good, but when I look at the ingredients I&#x27;d rather give up a curl and that \\&quot;fake lash effect\\&quot; than to put chemicals around my eyes. This mascara makes me feel good about using it, and I&#x27;m also noticing I&#x27;m not losing as many lashes as I did with other drug/department store mascaras. Yay for 100% Pure! I want to try the Dark Chocolate next!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this.  The odor of it was a bit strong at first, but then the itchy irritated feeling started - the same itchy feeling I had when they were painting my house with latex paint.  I can&#x27;t have that!  I was so looking forward to this being a great mascara as I love the idea of using naturally derived products.  The only thing I can think of is that I&#x27;m allergic to the seaweed in it.  I just tried another all natural type of product and suffered itching, and it also had seaweed.  It&#x27;s weird because I am fine with seaweed extract that is in La Mer, but then it&#x27;s fermented.  In any case, it&#x27;s going back if I can return it.  Too bad for me.  I still want to try some of the other products and will see how that goes.  My go-to mascara is Lancome for many years.  I won&#x27;t try to fix what isn&#x27;t broken again.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup I have ever used. I have very sensitive skin, not a problem with 100% pure. Coverage is great, makeup is light. Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> best natural mascara i&#x27;ve ever tried! not to mention it smells wonderful!!</li>
