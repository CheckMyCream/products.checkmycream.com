    <li> Este perfume le parecio formidable. Llego muy bien y a tiempo</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume! Always get so many compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it. For some reason hard to find in department stores now. Thankfully Amazon carries it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast this item came.  It was in the condition noted.  I&#x27;d purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend not buying from Tuccini.  They sent me the wrong two items,and returning it was a nightmare.  Something went wrong in my return, and the company gave me wrong information. As a result, I had to pay for return shipping and again for shipping on the items when they sent me the correct ones.  Moreover, the manager yelled at me when I called about the status of my return.  He said I was lying in that I received the wrong product.  Thus, don&#x27;t buy from Tuccini!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the items my daughter requested for her birthday. Her favorite scent - modern, fresh, and light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the item very quickly and right on time for the birthday!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!  Light and pleasant without being overpowering.  Every time my granddaughter gives me a hug she says, &amp;#34;you smell good!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the several positive reviews. Really, I dislike this perfume. It was a waste of money for me and couldn&#x27;t bear to use it more than twice. I&#x27;d never buy it again.</li>
    <li> LIVE IT WILL KEEP ORDERING AS  LONG AS IT IS AVAILABLE!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BGWGNM Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women 1.7 oz Eau de Parfum Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Amazon is terrific; however I ordered parfum spray from a company who advertised here on Amazon...what I recieved was a shimmer spray, not actual parfum as described in their ad.  I called the company and explained they sent me the wrong item and thought it would be an easy exchange.  I was told \\&quot;oh, we&#x27;ll research the issue &amp; will get back w/in 24-48hrs.\\&quot; Over 48hrs passed and I followed up w/another call since I hadn&#x27;t heard anything.  The woman chuckled and said \\&quot;we told you it would at least 48hrs\\&quot;...not exactly true.  But regardless, I explained the issue again and she indicated they probably never had the parfum spray to begin with!  I then asked about a refund.  This employee indicated I would have to ship back the item (at their expense, thank goodness!) and they would issue a refund back to Amazon, then I would have to wait for Amazon to refund me.  I&#x27;m still waiting, over 1 month later I&#x27;ve seen no refund.  Oddly enough my husband purchased purfume for me at Christmas time and the same thing happened to him, no parfum, just shimmer spray! Since he didn&#x27;t remember the company on Amazon for the purchase I had to keep the shimmer spray.  Buyer beware of Tuccin which is the company I used.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> This item is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;too lovely and wonderful item...&lt;br /&gt;my husband loves it too..&lt;br /&gt;not too strong just gentle</li>
    <li> I always wanted too buy this perfume I am so happy that I bought this perfume it smell  so nice.</li>
    <li> This is a lasting fragrance,and is pretty strong and very lovely,but not for a summer time scent !I like the light fruity scents in the warm weather.but will defiantly save this one for the cooler months!</li>
    <li> I will need to order more soon !</li>
    <li> I just love the way this perfume smells!  It&#x27;s great for day or night time!</li>
    <li> OK!  OMG this is my absolute favorite and only perfume I use!!  I couldn&#x27;t pass on the deal I got because my 14 year old Daughter is a smell good freak so I was able to get her a smaller bottle of her own.  Her bottle is already gone so I have to hide mine  ;o)&lt;br /&gt;If SJP had this as a room spray or linen spray I would be so HAPPY I don&#x27;t know if my husband could deal with me :-)</li>
    <li> Always love it, this size bottle is so easy to hold and to travel</li>
    <li> What a refreshing sent that lasts a very long time.  I am always getting compliments about how wonderful I smell when I wear Lovely.  I only wish that I could find the body lotion that goes with it.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this! I love SJP Lovely scent.</li>
    <li> Love this sent - so light and summery.</li>
    <li> I use a few different perfumes, but this is my favorite.  If you are wondering whether or not you should try, do it.  It is a light but sensuous perfume that stays with you all day.  I receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Love This company!  Can&#x27;t beat their prices and high-quality products!!</li>
    <li> I liked her perfume Covet and with such a Lovely name I purchased this item hoping for the best. It is a very strong flowery (orchids?) old lady like perfume. If that is what you are looking for get this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is the best colonge I have ever used. and my boyfriend said he really really loved it,</li>
    <li> I have used this colonge  for years I get many compliments on how nice it smells. It is fresh and soft.</li>
    <li> We got this for my sister as a christmas gift.  She had always worn Happy and I was so tired of smelling that stuff, personally I think it stinks but I am not one for citrus flavors or smells.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it smelled so good on her I tried it one day.  I loved the way it smelled on me as well.  It is a floral scent but it is not overpowering once it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and wear it occasionally.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine with the order,gave it to a friend,because it wasn&#x27;t meant for me,she loved it .Thank you for the prompt delivery and packing was good also.</li>
    <li> I bought it to my mother two year ago and He liked a lot, She bought it a couple times after that she commented it is good and that I chose correctly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, I cannot believe its so cheap on amazon, considering it cost about $50 in department stores. I am very happy with this product, and have no complaints. We&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
    <li> This is so sophisticated and very skin scent, though long lasting. Smells a little cool due to the lavender and musk combination, so it&#x27;s better for spring than winter. But I say this is a year-round office or everyday scent. It&#x27;s a very versatile and inoffensive smell, but also very distinct. I will always have this in my collection. Oh, it smells nearly identical to Narciso Rodriguez fo her. Love the bottle too.</li>
    <li> Sellers were very courteous and I was very pleased with my order</li>
    <li> VERY strong, heavy scent, smells like old lady perfume...tied to get used to it, used multiple times, still dislike ;)</li>
