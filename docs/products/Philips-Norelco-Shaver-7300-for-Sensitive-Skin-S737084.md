      <li>and I am delighted.  </li>
      <li>good thing!&lt;br /&gt;silent</li>
      <li>It Did a good job.  </li>
      <li>which is nice.  </li>
      <li>Good shave but carrying case too small,can&#x27;t fit cord or trimmer in it.</li>
      <li>This Norelco 7300 was ok to begin with.</li>
      <li>The cheaper Norelcos are better than this one.</li>
      <li>great product and price with fast delivery</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any better than the $39.</li>
      <li>Would be much better if trimmer was part of the shaver not a separate attachment.</li>
      <li>I really love this shaver - my skin feels good/smoother.  </li>
      <li>shaves fine but the charger function on the cleaning unit does not work.</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>It does not glide over skin smoothly (even with pre-shave lotion)</li>
      <li>I have a light beard</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my straight razor/brush/shave soap for a simpler, more compact and closer shave.</li>
      <li>and powerful, my dad likes it.</li>
      <li>Is quieter than my previous shaver, not that it was very noisy, and does a great shaving job.  </li>
      <li>Do not like holding the cutters under hot water.</li>
      <li>It shaves cleaner, more comfortably, and quieter than the more expensive model.  </li>

      <li>, I guess my expectations were way to high.  </li>
      <li>Any previous Norelco I have purchased and used has worked amazingly well and for a long time.</li>
      <li>I wish it had a stand like my previous shaver as in some weather this does not dry 100% after cleaning and a stand would expose the heads better for drying.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been away for nearly a month without it</li>
      <li>This model has a sideburn trimmer that interchanges with the shaving head, I think other models have a beard trimmer instead if that is useful to you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a life long Norelco Shaver user and really like this one.  </li>
      <li>The old built-in flip-up trimmer is a solid design.</li>
      <li>I previously owned a 9000 series Norelco - don&#x27;t waste the money - this 7370 is a much better product.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure if it is worth the extra money over the basic model of a Philips shaver.</li>

    <li> Tried it for two days. No thanks!  Razor and cleaning accessories too cumbersome for airline travel.  I&#x27;ll stick with my straight razor/brush/shave soap for a simpler, more compact and closer shave.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a 9000 series Norelco - don&#x27;t waste the money - this 7370 is a much better product.  It shaves cleaner, more comfortably, and quieter than the more expensive model.  I really love this shaver - my skin feels good/smoother.  I thought I would not buy another Norelco after the experience with the 9300, but took a chance and I am delighted.  It has all the attributes of the more expensive model - easy cleaning, easy charging, and carrying case included.  But I keep coming back to - it is just a better shaver!!</li>
    <li> Contact me in a month when I&#x27;ve had time to evaluate it.  I&#x27;ve been away for nearly a month without it so what can I say so far;  not much.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver at my husband&#x27;s request for Father&#x27;s Day. He expected much better. Needs to be a simpler model. He needs the electric for some parts of his face due to blood thinners.He had an  Older model but the blade on this model is better but the additional stuff is not necessary to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for years and probably never again.  This is my second fancy 3 head and the head wore out in 2 months on this one.  Norelco used to be the leading brand but in recent years they have gone to the bottom in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Not shaving as closely as previous Norelcos I have owned.</li>
    <li> The best of all Norelco&#x27;s triple headers&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations</li>
    <li> He has a thick beard and this did the trick</li>
    <li> Works well for a electric razor</li>
    <li> The best shaving machine I ever have, I will keep using it</li>
    <li> It Did a good job.  I had a 3000 series Philips electric shaver before this one, It is an upgrade and I do like it, but reading all the notes and reviews about it, I guess my expectations were way to high.  I am not sure if it is worth the extra money over the basic model of a Philips shaver.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic. Poor design for cleaning the head. Do not like holding the cutters under hot water. Does not feel substantial in your hand. My mistake was buying it on line.</li>
    <li> Good shave but carrying case too small,can&#x27;t fit cord or trimmer in it.Would be much better if trimmer was part of the shaver not a separate attachment.</li>
    <li> good thing!&lt;br /&gt;silent and powerful, my dad likes it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, Great price. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> What a great Father&#x27;s Day Gift.  Works Great</li>
    <li> I am not convinced it can give me a single  shave a day.  I will keep it another week before I decide  to keep it or returned .</li>
    <li> great product and price with fast delivery</li>
    <li> A good razor, but it does take awhile to get used to switching from a blade</li>
    <li> This Norelco 7300 was ok to begin with. One year in and it&#x27;s just the worst. I regret buying it.  The reasons I really don&#x27;t like it: 1. It does not glide over skin smoothly (even with pre-shave lotion) 2. The frequency (compared to the previous 4 I have owned) with which it must be cleaned is extremely high. 3. The head is too big - it&#x27;s difficult to navigate and get a tight shave on upper lip 4. No built-in trimmer. The old built-in flip-up trimmer is a solid design. #AintBrokeDontFix 5. Any previous Norelco I have purchased and used has worked amazingly well and for a long time.</li>
    <li> A gift for my father on Fathers Day.  I asked him a week later if he was using it and he said &amp;#34;yes, and I was wondering why you hadn&#x27;t gotten me one before.&amp;#34;. He loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with my Philips Norelco Shaver 7300...it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any better than the $39. Shavers that I&#x27;ve purchased from Philips Norelco in the past...I would really like a refund.</li>
    <li> shaves fine but the charger function on the cleaning unit does not work. Not worth the hassle sending it back but I am quite disappointed - have to charge separately which is a pain as the razor has to be cleaned after every use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a life long Norelco Shaver user and really like this one.  Is quieter than my previous shaver, not that it was very noisy, and does a great shaving job.  I have a light beard and I&#x27;m finding that the cleaner cartridge is last longer than expected which is nice.  I wish it had a stand like my previous shaver as in some weather this does not dry 100% after cleaning and a stand would expose the heads better for drying.  This model has a sideburn trimmer that interchanges with the shaving head, I think other models have a beard trimmer instead if that is useful to you.</li>
    <li> My 21 trial days are over and I have to say that I like the results.  This is a really good shaver.</li>
    <li> The cheaper Norelcos are better than this one. This does not cut as well and too big.</li>
