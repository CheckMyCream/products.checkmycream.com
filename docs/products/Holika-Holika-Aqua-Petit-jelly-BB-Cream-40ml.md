      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>However, when I put it on after my moisturizer with a light powder my skin looked great.</li>
      <li>When using it over moisturizer, I have to wait a good 10 minutes for it to dry/absorb or else the bb doesn&#x27;t blend at all and just sits on top of my skin on globs.</li>
      <li>and here are my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
      <li>my skin kind of glow.</li>
      <li>Wish it came in warm medium tone.&lt;br /&gt;Box</li>
      <li>This BB is a nice change for the summer considering the humidity.</li>
      <li>It sets to a nice powdery finish.  </li>
      <li>Even if this BB cream says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;jelly-like&amp;#34;, when applied it feels kind of dryer on skin.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It dries to a kind of matte finish.</li>
      <li>I just use a bronzer afterwards to warm it up a bit.</li>
      <li>This was a really lovely and impressive BB cream for my first try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for dry skin, and has great coverage and wear.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Blends very easily onto my skin despite the color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>OMG I really love love it!</li>
      <li>And, it has a nice smell. :3</li>
      <li>It feels quite light on the skin while not taking away from coverage and the jelly like texture feels really good on the skin.</li>
      <li>daughter who is fair skinned, with cool undertones has tried this product as well &amp; it also blends in well with her skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was going to buy the lighter shade because I have very light skin, but this one came with Prime</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went with the #2 because even that is very light</li>
      <li>I am in love with this bb</li>
      <li>For now, I&#x27;m going to have to stick to Missha (works really well with my skintone and coverage is great), but hopefully Holika Holika comes up with more shades.</li>
      <li>I would love to wear this fragrance as a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As i said, BB cream isn&#x27;t a thing for me, I&#x27;ve tried so many BB cream</li>

      <li>The package it came with is really cute as well</li>
      <li>but I still apply a translucent rice powder on top for staying power.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>will update after I start using it more.</li>

      <li>I love the way it comes on and feels like there&#x27;s nothing there.</li>
      <li>/&gt;maybe better for summer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m an N120 in MUF foundation. A filipino who&#x27;s not exactly tan but not exactly pale, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE: do not apply this BB cream if your skin is dry. Apply a moisturizer so your skin is moist enough to absorb the BB Cream. Even if this BB cream says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;jelly-like&amp;#34;, when applied it feels kind of dryer on skin.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream is ALMOST perfect. I feel like it&#x27;s a bit lighter (maybe a bit gray..?) than the N120, but it still feels passable. I also saw that it slightly oxidizes after a bit of time, so it looks natural. It has really nice coverage and with a little extra dab on a specific area, it conceals parts too.&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re a shade higher (darker) than N120, it might be a bit too light. You could still use it of course, if you use a powdered foundation over which&#x27;ll help bring more of your natural color in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasant, kind of floral/mint but I don&#x27;t mind. The package it came with is really cute as well and it also came accompanied with a hard sponge. I don&#x27;t use it. Only my fingers in a patting/blending motion. But I could see it being useful if you want to press down the BB cream into your skin.. but seriously, it&#x27;s really hard and doesn&#x27;t fit into areas like the side of your nose..</li>
    <li> Best BB cream I have found.</li>
    <li> Came faster than i expected love it !!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  It looks super natural and feels REALLY light!!  You don&#x27;t feel the product like you would with foundation.  I received it in good condition.  Nothing bad to say!</li>
    <li> i got two ones. not good BB Cream. I used it for one time, and it&#x27;s not smoothy as much as I thought. Now i just put them away. Regret to buy two!!!</li>
    <li> This feels so light on my skin! I feel like it would suit normal/oily skin more. I have dry/normal skin and I have to apply a moisturizer underneath for it not to flake around my nose. But it has really good oil control. The bb cream sets very fast, so you have to work fast. It has light to medium coverage but is buildable.</li>
    <li> Love the BB Cream!! Makes my face flawless!! Feels really light weight. The package was well bubble pack and I love that they sent out samples!! I will continue to order from them!! 5 STARS!! 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily, honestly it&#x27;s like a pool of oil. I was using other bb creams and noticing that they basically disappeared. I used primer and things improved, but this particular bb cream seems to stay in place. I used it with concealer, and it looks great. It also has pretty good oil control. So far I really like it.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than my expect, easy to use. It could keep for a long time, and works well in oil control.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very relaxing to apply on the skin and provides medium coverage. Dark marks still show through, but you can add on to it. It does, however, leave a &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; look. It kind of just sits on top of your skin and makes it obvious you&#x27;re wearing makeup, kind of like foundation. It also makes your dry spots very apparent, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people with dry skin. What you see IS what you get! I don&#x27;t recommend using the sponge that comes along with it. The spatula is also very helpful to give you the right amount of product</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is a little hard to blend with the sponge that comes with it.  It can get a bit streaky but works great with a brush.  It sets to a nice powdery finish.  Great for summer.</li>
    <li> This was a really lovely and impressive BB cream for my first try. Very smooth application with the jelly consistency and really evened out my skin tone without looking caked on. The only drawback is the fragrance- it&#x27;s SO STRONG. I end up sneezing at least once or twice after application. It&#x27;s only been a couple of days, but if my body doesn&#x27;t acclimate to the scent soon, I&#x27;ll have to let it go.  Also, this is a great shade for me in winter when you&#x27;re pale, but probably won&#x27;t work for summertime if you&#x27;re mixed like me (Filipino/American) and tend to have more golden/olive skintone in the summer.</li>
    <li> love this BB cream!!!! i use it almost everyday!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Seriously my holy grail of holy grail items. I purchased one and after finishing it tried another type from this brand and immediately went back to purchase this again. I caution that it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as some bb creams and is very difficult to layer for more coverage. It makes my skin look amazing and topped with a finishing powder I am shine free for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and neutral skin color. Should match most people. Not long lasting and light coverage.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have ever used! I have tried other BB creams from American brands, but unfortunately they always had some kind of an orange tint which never looked quite right, even when blended. I&#x27;m not very fair-skinned, but I do have light-colored skin, and this BB cream provided perfect coverage for my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under normal circumstances I usually get an oily t-zone throughout the day combined with slightly reddish skin, especially around my breakouts. When I first applied the product, I was skeptical that such a light, breathable cream could truly cover up my blemishes, and figured that they would still show through prominently, as they did in the past with other foundations. I was more than surprised by the results. This Aqua Petit Jelly is not heavy at all -- even to the point of not feeling it on your skin once blended. You don&#x27;t even need to use very much of it. Once applied, it gives a very nice, matte effect, with even and complete coverage; it even covered the worst of my acne. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this BB Cream, it&#x27;s truly amazing! I paired this product with the Tony Moly Cats Wink Clear Pact, and my make-up stayed on all day without revealing oil, blemishes, or discoloration. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have acne; nothing in the past has worked as well as this has for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I would suggest is that you make sure to moisturize your skin before putting on the Cats Wink Clear Pact and the BB Cream; because it is winter, the skin on my nose was a little dry, and I could see some of the roughness of the skin when I put on the makeup. This was all cleared up with a bit of moisturizer, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points for cute packaging. :)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this bb cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this on Sep. 2012 and I have been using this bb cream about almost two months and here are my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Please enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cute bottle&lt;br /&gt;- color #2 and only come with one size which is 40ml&lt;br /&gt;- Little goes long way&lt;br /&gt;- Water based&lt;br /&gt;- Can use as make up base&lt;br /&gt;- No gray or white cast&lt;br /&gt;- Yellow undertone&lt;br /&gt;- Matte finish&lt;br /&gt;- Great for NC 15~25 ( If you are NC 30 up you can use this bb cream as make up base)&lt;br /&gt;- Wont dry up the skin&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 20!&lt;br /&gt;- Light to medium coverage&lt;br /&gt;- 4~6 hours without oily-shine on face&lt;br /&gt;- won&#x27;t clog the pores&lt;br /&gt;- I feel my skin can breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And OMG I really love love it!</li>
    <li> i love really how lightweight this bb cream is. doesn&#x27;t leave any shine and the smell is good. it can be layered as well.</li>
    <li> I must say that BB cream isn&#x27;t a thing for me, the glass container was smaller than I thought. But there is definitely a lot of product in there, the consistency was a bit thicker than I though. As i said, BB cream isn&#x27;t a thing for me, I&#x27;ve tried so many BB cream but this is the one that I would definitely use for an everyday no-makeup makeup look to school. Even so, I found that mixing it with a bit of CC cream makes the consistency easier to work and thinner. The sponge applicator that came with it, I didn&#x27;t like it right away when I open the packaging and as resulted. It sucks all of the product and yet hard to blend the product in. Over all, I just need to find a way that I could wear this GREAT BB cream in a way that my skin can adapt :)</li>
    <li> Well packaged &amp; protected. I opened it &amp; to my surprise its a bit watery. But during application the consistency changes. It dries fast so you must apply fast otherwise it can get cakey. I like it! It has good overall coverage. Even though I like it I will not be re-purchasing because I prefer another brand because they carry my exact color.</li>
    <li> pretty good&lt;br /&gt;but it was probably a shade too light for me. even though this is the darker shade of this product.&lt;br /&gt;made me look dead :( don&#x27;t recommend for tan skin people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels refreshing&lt;br /&gt;maybe better for summer.</li>
    <li> Best BB Cream I&#x27;ve ever tried! The finish is slightly matte and the texture is almost like jelly-mousse if that makes any sense. My skintone is light-mediums and #2 is just perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I love this because it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and I have a very oily looking skin. I definitely going to buy some more in the future!</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels and looks, but I would prefer better coverage. Great for younger, acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Like most bbs, it&#x27;s a little too light for me and I wish there were more shades. It&#x27;s medium coverage, but it will accentuate every little nook, cranny, dryness, etc. The texture is jelly-like and you have to apply + blend reeeaaaallly fast or else you&#x27;ll have streaks or splotches. I live in a desert, so maybe that makes a difference, idk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, I have tried to mix it with different foundations and moisturizers, but it always turns out clumpy and never mixes well :/  When using it over moisturizer, I have to wait a good 10 minutes for it to dry/absorb or else the bb doesn&#x27;t blend at all and just sits on top of my skin on globs. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasant and feels nice (cool and a little tingly) and light... But I&#x27;m low maintenance and this takes too much effort.</li>
    <li> Glad I went with the darker color (NC20ish, &amp; darker in summer). This BB is a nice change for the summer considering the humidity. It layers quite well for those problem areas. Stays until I wash it off. Perhaps because of its water base, it spreads further and less product is needed. Seller packaged this well - important and much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Too light! I am not dark or light. Wish it came in warm medium tone.&lt;br /&gt;Box came damage, but the product itself was okay. Returning the item back!</li>
    <li> This product basically does two things, conceal large pores and even out skin tone. However, your face need to be well prepare for it to work property. By saying well prepared, I mean your skin needs to be well exfoliated and largely acne free because it will not cover any acne redness or scars...No added coverage when you try to put on the second layer, it will only look cakey after the second layer. If you do not exfoliate skin well and try to put this product on...have you ever take a close look at the surface of an oil paint? If so, you&#x27;ll know what I mean...&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to people who do not have acne problem, and generally good skin. Also, unless you are Snow White type of white, do not choose color #1.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin where foundation or even tinted moisturizer cause cakeyness and dry patches. I recently changed up my skincare so my skin is less dry and switching to using bb creams but I still get the occasional dry patch. This product however did not dry me out, it is light and Telly and went on smooth. I apply three 2 inches swatch on my forehead cheeks and two 2 inches swatch on my chin, then I use a small stippling brush to evenly distribute it on my entire face then use a wet sponge to pat it on. The end result is flawless skin. It will stay flawless for a good 4 hours then it gets sparse around the nose and settles in the crease but people don&#x27;t look at you that up close you just need a touch up.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a 5 star rating but this doesn&#x27;t work for my unfortunately tanner skin and this is the darkest shade of this bb cream as well. :( but other than that this bb cream is amazing! It feels quite light on the skin while not taking away from coverage and the jelly like texture feels really good on the skin. Also a little goes a long way. Overall an amazing bb cream I just wish they had more of a color selection</li>
    <li> this product is very pale and has a powdery finish. I received a lot of negative comments stating that I look like I&#x27;m wearing too much makeup even though I use a small amount of product. would not recommend, even though the jelly-like texture is pretty neat.</li>
    <li> Favorite BB cream. Doesn&#x27;t oxidize on the skin, blends in without feeling like a foreign layer. It isn&#x27;t the most long-lasting but if you use a setting powder you should be fine. Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Was nervous as this was the first korean makeup product I have purchased but this product lives up to its reputation! Will definitely buy again :D</li>
    <li> This BB cream comes in an appealing box. You get the BB cream and a sponge applicator. The sponge is pretty decent. The BB cream is the best! It dries fast but it really makes my face look smooth and even! Although I must say that my skin is pretty clear to begin with. Overall, it feels nice and light on the skin. Almost like it is not there! Only issue is the spatula because I just know that it will be a struggle to get the remaining product once it is almost out! P.S. I am light medium skin tone and #2 is a perfect fit!</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily skin, and I was getting tired of regular foundation getting all goopy after wearing it for a few hours, so I started looking for an alternative. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and I am really happy with it! It didn&#x27;t break me out at all like a lot of makeup tends to, it doesn&#x27;t get gross from any oils, and I find that the coverage lasts all day, especially when I apply a setting powder over it. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on, but still provides enough coverage to hide some small imperfections. The consistency is different than anything I&#x27;ve used but I quite like it, and of course the packaging is adorable! I don&#x27;t know my skin shade number or letter or anything, I&#x27;m pale but not super pale and the #2 shade worked well for me (so if you&#x27;re particularly tan, this product probably wouldn&#x27;t work for you).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using few Korean BB Creams and this one does its work. But it feels a little dry so I need to put some moisturizing before applying. If you have combo or oily skin you are not going to have any problem</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong color and had to reorder the right color. I will say this BB offers nice coverage, a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell! Cute packaging. Tons of product! Nice heavy glass container. I don&#x27;t know how this would do travel wise but I&#x27;m sure I will reorder when I run out. Three start rating for receive the pink based color instead of the Yellow based one I need!</li>
    <li> Love this BB cream but it&#x27;s way too light for my med olive/neutral skin. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use it. But I&#x27;m going to buy some dark foundation and mix it, hoping to save it. I do like the consistency and coverage. I&#x27;m giving formula a 5 star. But color selection is a 1, so 3 is the final rating. (Although the packaging is awesome. So a 3.4.)</li>
    <li> -This is not a fake-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Makes my skin kind of glow. Very enhancing and does not look like I have makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;-I love the smell of this BB cream&lt;br /&gt;-Looks very natural on my skin! Regular foundation tends to look powdery on my skin but this does not.&lt;br /&gt;-Feels a bit refreshing on my skin and not stuffy&lt;br /&gt;-Blends very easily onto my skin despite the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy the lighter shade because I have very light skin, but this one came with Prime so I ordered this one instead. I was worried it might be too dark but it still blends to my skintone. This is why I love BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really important but the actual bottle looks different. The cap has polka dots. Cute ^^ I think this will last a while. At least a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am Asian and have relatively oil skin.</li>
    <li> I am so surprised how much I really like this cream.  It goes on smooth and a slight lighter than I usually use but I add a tinted bb cream and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s has a minimal coverage which is good for me because all i need to do is just tone my skin and it does it very well. A little goes a long way and its very light on your face. But one problem i have with is when i put it on my nose, it looks very cakey or rather dry why i put it on. Idk why bc i exfoliated my nose before hand and moisturized it too. (If anyone knows why please msg me! :D)&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its pretty great elsewhere on my face!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t dewy enough.</li>
    <li> Skin type: Normal/ Dry Cheeks and Eye Area &amp; T-Zone is Oily. I have gotten so many compliments on how natural this BB Cream looks on me. I have a skin tone similar in range to NC20- NC25 [ MAC Cosmetics] The product itself is a light to medium coverage that is build-able but will never reach full coverage. It reduces the redness in my skin and evens out my coloring but if you have any major imperfections they will show through it. I have tried several high-end foundations ranging from 25-50 dollars and this does a great job and I would actually prefer it to its high end counterparts. I have never had a foundation that goes on as smooth as this. The sponge that comes with it is lack luster it eats up all of the product. I use a flat top kabuki style brush to apply this and it works great. I have had this on for 10+ hours without needing to re-apply. [ I do use a setting spray, the $3 dollar one from elf works just fine.]</li>
    <li> Great coverage and staying power! Packaging isn&#x27;t my favorite but wouldn&#x27;t deter me from purchasing. Also, not stated but somewhat waterproof!</li>
    <li> Came way earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing bb cream, it is lighter than expected and the texture is interesting.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation, usually a light powder or in winter months powder foundation. I&#x27;ve heard so much about BB creams &amp; thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am of  Asian descent &amp; have Olive skin- I was a bit worried that it might be too light. However, when I put it on after my moisturizer with a light powder my skin looked great. It blends well with either a sponge or your fingertips ( which I prefer)It didn&#x27;t feel heavy like I was wearing make-up . Also, I absolutely love how good it smells!!! I would love to wear this fragrance as a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for over a week now &amp; although I have clear skin &amp; small pores, I sometimes struggle with whiteheads on my nose &amp; chin. Ever since I started using this product I swear that my skin has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter who is fair skinned, with cool undertones has tried this product as well &amp; it also blends in well with her skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I love the baby doll appearance I feel it gives me &amp; I&#x27;m hooked now!!</li>
    <li> I love this opposed to thick heavy make up. It smells great and hydrates your skin. The coverage is buildable and very even. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> First off, the packaging is adorable. The bottle is frosted glass and shaped like a flower, and the box containing the bottle and the sponge is sturdy. Second, the scent is great-smells floral but light. Third, the bottle comes with a spatula attached to the cap, so you don&#x27;t have to use your fingers to scoop up the product.&lt;br /&gt;However, that&#x27;s where the pros stop. The color is way too light for my skin, and when I applied it, I looked like I was sick or something. My face looked pasty after the application-and my skin has a healthy, light tan but far from olive toned. It was disappointing; I had hoped the #2 would be dark enough. Another thing is that while the consistency of the bb cream was jelly like, after applying it my skin looked too dry. I will try again after putting more moisturizer on first, but my Missha bb cream worked fine without putting a moisturizer on beforehand. As for the color, I will mix it up with a darker base since I have the whole bottle anyways-no point in wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to see if I could replace my Missha bb cream no. 27 (honey beige) with this one, just to change things up. For now, I&#x27;m going to have to stick to Missha (works really well with my skintone and coverage is great), but hopefully Holika Holika comes up with more shades.</li>
    <li> it is light complexion wise, but I only use it sparingly a thin layer if that, i spot fix more than anything. The makeup feeling is light weight.</li>
    <li> I bought this in shade #2 and I am about an NC20 in MAC foundations. It has light/medium coverage and feels very breathable. The finish is satin so it&#x27;s not as dewey/shiny as some other BB Creams I&#x27;ve tried. It lasts a good five hours without wearing off. It has a light fragrance, so avoid if you&#x27;re sensitive. The sponge it comes with is really nothing special, it absorbs a lot of the product and can&#x27;t be used wet, a Beauty Blender works better.</li>
    <li> very pleasant scent, sad it only comes in 2 colors. I got the darkest, to light to wear in summer but very good product</li>
    <li> OMG Holy Holika Holika! This stuff is one of the best BB&#x27;s I have ever tried. That product is true to its name with a bouncy jelly texture that provides buildable coverage. When it dries the finish is matte but I still apply a translucent rice powder on top for staying power. I bought shade number 2 and it works really good with my ivory/beige skin. I think it works best when you wait a couple minutes before applying more than one layer and finish with powder.</li>
    <li> this product is so amazing! there is nothing bad about it! only thing is that itt takes a while to arrive, other than that perfect bb cream</li>
    <li> Cute bottle but feels like I am rubbing gritty hand sanitizer on my face. After it goes on it looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Korean BB creams and this is hands down the best one: good coverage (medium), super lightweight, smooth matte finish, oil-free, not cakey.</li>
    <li> I love the how it came with a whole product  as in the sponge for it and the box i thought it would be just the bottle and t has great coverage !</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite BB Cream! The texture is very jelly like indeed! It jiggles in the bottle like Jello. lol I had gone back and forth and agonized about whether to get the #1 or the #2 shade. I was worried about #2 being more for yellowish tones as some youtubers stated because I have pinkish undertones. I&#x27;m so glad I went with the #2 because even that is very light so the other shade would have been way too light. The shade does blend in really well it&#x27;s just a tad light. I just use a bronzer afterwards to warm it up a bit. It goes on really smooth and blends out easily. I use my Beauty Blender to sweep it on then pat it onto my skin. It dries to a kind of matte finish. It&#x27;s not really dewy. I love that this is made with mint water (whatever that is.) I do the whole Korean skincare routine and really moisturize before hand so I haven&#x27;t really noticed the dryness others have. I have dry to somewhat combination skin and this works well for me. It&#x27;s not perfect but it does work great and I love it!</li>
    <li> I would give this product zero star if I could. I bought it for my girlfriend and what I receive did not look like this. The packaging was totally different, basically the picture was very misleading. The inside wasn&#x27;t even full and looked like it has been used. My girlfriend was scared to use it and ended up dumping it. Good thing amazon has amazing customer service and I was able to receive a refund. Will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It has a watery texture, is very lightweight, and looks very natural after you put it on. Definitely one of my new favorite BB creams.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008F5DCFC Holika Holika Aqua Petit jelly BB Cream 40ml #2]]&lt;br /&gt;I just opened my package, and the cap was loose (practically halfway open). Just by looking at the bottle, it is quite obvious that the product has dried out already. I was looking forward to using this and am really disappointed. I have been wanting this for a while but won&#x27;t be able to use it, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who do I need to contact? Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have many Korean bb creams and this is one of my favs.! Good for hotter days too.. Kind of light on your skin and has a refreshing feel. This one and the sweet cotton bb cream are awesome for summertime oily faces!</li>
    <li> It was delivered quicker than I expected! This is by far my favorite BB cream. It&#x27;s perfect for dry skin, and has great coverage and wear. I will definitely be buying this again! I love it!</li>
    <li> Delivered super fast, and it lasts forever, in love</li>
    <li> I ordered this, and was a little skeptical about it, but I recieved it and did a few splotch tests, and tried. I loved after trying it. It doesnt leave lines like othe bb creams I tried. And, it has a nice smell. :3</li>
    <li> So far, this is my favorite Bb cream. I have dry, sensitive skin &amp; this product goes on easy &amp; blends really well with my stippling brush. Adorable packaging, light coverage &amp; gives a powder finish. It makes my face feel like magic working through my pores &amp; smells absolutely amazing to me! Shipping and delivery was super fast and the product wasn&#x27;t open or broken. This shade is perfect for my skin tone, plus feels and smells great! My new obsession is asian/korean cosmetics, but I live in texas, so will definately be buying more products with this seller.</li>
    <li> This BB cream was awesome. I love the way it comes on and feels like there&#x27;s nothing there. It matched my skin tone 100%. The only thing was that it has really low coverage but with another coat it covers just fine for me. Even with two coats applied it still feels light and like nothing is there. Also, after applying it I got a matte finish, which Is perfect for my skin type because my skin is oily. I can wear it for the whole day without the oils from my skin breaking through. Last, the jar it came in is just the cutest thing! I would recommend this product to those who match my skin type, tone, and the amount of coverage you want.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!!!! I will continue to purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> It is a decent light scented bb cream. also quite a good coverage, I say medium.&lt;br /&gt;However, even the darkest shade #2 is still a little too light for me. It is good for you if you are in NC 20-25.&lt;br /&gt;It has a matte finish in my opinion and I have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s light, not so smooth but maybe use for daily. I wish it could go with more shades</li>
    <li> Burned my skin, gave me a reaction. Really awful blending, pills up unless your skin is 100 percent dry. Very cakey....</li>
    <li> My favorite bb cream so far. It looks very natural as if I have nothing on, but my skin looks nicer. I use this product by putting a dime sized amount on the back of my (clean) hand, dab it on with my (clean) fingers, and then smooth it out (with clean hands). Then I set with powder. This process makes it more sanitary then just directly putting it on your face and it should look more natural. I noticed this product has a nice light smell and would recommend it to people that need little to medium coverage that are NC 20-25. It does seem to oxidize a little bit to match your skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start with the bad: doesn&#x27;t stay put without help. That&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this in shade #2 and it is a better match for my NC25 warm, light-medium skin than any other BB cream I have tried. I am a W2 in L&#x27;oreal true match too if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;This BB has sheer-medium coverage that is a little buildable, up to a strong medium. If anyone remembers the discontinued maybelline Pure makeup liquid foundation that came in a light mint green squeeze tube, I would say that mousse-y texture is visually the closest way to describe this Bb cream&#x27;s texture. However, this BB cream spreads much more easily and and feels almost like a thin, moisturizing aloe gel (no aloe smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried &amp;eacute;tude house precious mineral Bb cream (thick, paste-y white and hard to blend evenly), the original red Missha BB cream (grey cast on my yellow skin), Lioele triple the solution (similar to the &amp;eacute;tude house one, only slightly better color match but still kind of white-grey cast). The finish of the petit jelly BB is satiny and so realistically glowy, like the Missha but less dewy (read: shiny). However, unfortunately I cannot wear it that way as it does slide off my acne within a couple hours unless I set it with some powder. In indoor lighting the foundation has no grey cast, which is already better than most BB creams. In natural lighting/sunlight, there is a noticeable grey-cool cast to my complexion compared to my neck. Keep in mind this was far worse and more starkly noticeable in all my previous BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;I love the very mild subtle fragrance, it does not break out my acne prone sensitive skin, and looks pretty natural even if you apply several layers.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t even tell I have foundation on and it makes my skin look flawless</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I am of southeast Asian descent and this product in #2 worka great on my face. I have dry skin but with adequate skin moisturizing routine I have no problem with this bb cream. I use beauty blender to apply the product.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it but test swatch was really pink, based on other reviews i expected no2 color to be more of a yellow tone, inside its ok, but outside in natural light it&#x27;s really pink. will update after I start using it more. coverage is alright. probably wont be really moisturizing, after it&#x27;s dry the bb cream is really powdery/dry to the point where you want to use lotion. super matte finish. probably really good for people with oily skin.  update: on the face it&#x27;s a lot less pink.. (i hope or else I was looking really strange when I went out ha..) it is really drying, i had to remove the first application i applied because i set it with powder out of habit and my face felt like a mask.  when I removed and reapplied the bb cream it was a lot better. the coverage is a lot more than i expected from a bb cream, i&#x27;m used to skin 79 which seems to be thinner after applied and more natural looking. later through the day the aqua jelly bb sunk in enough to look and feel lighter and more natural. I&#x27;ll keep using it daily until other bb&#x27;s i ordered get here from korea and update in a week or two (if i remember)</li>
    <li> Too thick and packaged weird . It seems like a decent product in termsof ingredients but it makes a mask like look that is kabuki like</li>
    <li> Love the coverage on this BB cream. I don&#x27;t like the sponge that comes with it, the application is splotchy. Using a brush or your fingers will give you the best application. It also smells like cucumber!</li>
</ol>
