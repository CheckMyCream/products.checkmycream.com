<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought 3 of these about two years ago for my husband and kids, and have been loving it ever since.  Even after thorough brushing, when we use this flosser, lots of food particles falls out!  It&#x27;s amazing and funny!  The brush does not clean under your gums and a lot of food remains there!  I have read a lot about how gum cleanliness can affect one&#x27;s health.  I wish I had known this much earlier in my life when we were only using the toothbrush and thought it was enough.  I bought this one for my mom.  Waterpik is the only one of its kind we&#x27;ve all used and we love it, it does a great job.  We take it with us when we travel.  In other words, we cannot and will not sleep at night without using it!  Absolutely worth 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great on all levels!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year. I love it. It helps to really clean my teath</li>
    <li> Great device to aid people w braces. Cleans wonderfully between brackets ti get teeth as clean as possible</li>
    <li> This was for my husband and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It does floss things out, even after brushing with sonicating tooth brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. No regrets for the purchase but might juss stick to floss in future. I works as advertised, a little messy and I generally do not use it for my teeth. But, that is me.</li>
    <li> Waterpik was exactly what I ordered.  Excellent product &amp; easy to use.  I&#x27;d certainly recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a Waterpik. I&#x27;ve had several before this, but this has been the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> We are very happy with our purchase.  It does what you said it would do and it arrived quickly.  Great seller; great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this flosser every night for a long time now.  I will buy another one when it wears out.</li>
    <li> Using this was like having a fire hose in my bathroom.  I just never got the knack of it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic piece of equipment. Gums pinked up faster than I expected. Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Saving my teeth and gums, it is amazing what tiny bits it finds that hand flossing does not reach.  Smooth operation, nice storage of extra flossers in the top of the water holder, compact, adjustable pressure, nothing missing I can think of.  And it produced a greatly improved outcome last dental visit!</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik. I&#x27;ve owned this product before, and it broke pretty early on. So far I&#x27;ve had no issues with the new one.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I don&#x27;t use this as much as I would like.  It gets a little messy.  But maybe, I&#x27;m just not using it correctly.  When I do use it, I mix water and mouthwash and my gums and teeth do feel really fresh.  I will continue to use it and hopefully better.</li>
    <li> Great delivery and product.  Ruth E. Blunier</li>
    <li> Better than flossing.  The water pressure is high enough to get between the teeth.  In fact I never put it above 3 on the dial (dial goes up to 10).  I like it because it massages the gums as well as cleaning between the teeth.  As I have aged my gums have started to recede so gum massage is important.  There are several attachments that snap into place that should handle any application that I need.  I mainly use the brush with toothpaste and the water turned off, then turn it on to rinse.  Then I use one of the other attachments to squirt pressurized water between my teeth.  Watch out for the high pressure water as it will squirt across the bathroom if you do not turn it off before taking it out of your mouth !&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the product is that the miniature hose is a bit too stiff and a little shorter than I would like it to be.  But this is pretty minor .</li>
    <li> Good Price and Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> OK, but does NOT beat flossing with flossing string.</li>
    <li> love the product,i choose this product because i have braces and it deffinetly helps keep them clean.much easier than trying to get floss inbetween braces</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used a waterpik before, but this is awesome! It takes a little getting used to, though. I wound up spraying myself in the face and spraying my mirror multiple times. You press the button to turn off the flow, not turn it on. That seemed a little counter-intuitive to me, but I&#x27;m used to it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really cleans your teeth! I use an electric toothbrush and thought I was getting most of the plaque and food particles out, but after using the waterpik, I&#x27;d spit out loads of nastyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful where you&#x27;re aiming it in your mouth, though. I hit the side of my cheek, which resulted in an ulcer. It does have the power to do damage to your mouth tissues, so I keep it set around 4 out of 10 and try to only hit my teeth at the gumline at a 90 degree angle.</li>
    <li> Flossing is something I regard as an annoyance but necessary. This product changes everything because it&#x27;s easier to use than floss and more effective. The cost is well worth a lifetime of healthy dental hygiene. It really makes you feel like your mouth has never been this clean before. Can&#x27;t recommend enough. Also, oral B&#x27;s electric toothbrushes as well. The basic model is fine, no need to pay an extra 100 bucks for \\&quot;different speeds\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Ok, I had head these were just great, and that I needed one. so I started to look into them, so many, so many reviews on them. after alot of looking I went with this one, it had great reviews and no problems, small in size and the price was perfect. Now I know how great it is, and Ill be getting them for gifts for family!</li>
    <li> We had a unit for over 12 years, worked perfectly until the hose broke from age.  Searched on line, found this model, it is the exact replacement.  The unit is a little quieter and a little lighter, but works perfectly.  All of our extra tips we have accumulated over the years, fit (nice when a manufacture do not change accessories).  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It works great and has solved my teeth problems, wish I had bought it  much sooner. Highly recommend to anyone ,</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpik to replace my old one that gave me 20+ years of service.  The old one had a switch on the pik that turned the water on.  The new one has a button that cuts off the water while you hold it.  Not that handy and if you have kids prepare for deluge.  It does its job as well as the old one but has a smaller reservoir.  I personally find the backwards push button irritating.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. Saves so much time with not having to floss with my braces, also isn&#x27;t as hard on my gums.  I will definitely continue to use it even after I get my braces off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and am satisfied with its performance. It hurts to floss, and this is painless. Wish I had gotten it a couple of molars ago.</li>
    <li> Water flossing is the way to go for reaching those areas you can&#x27;t by using conventional methods. And this product was solid and worked great for a year to two before one day the hose just disconnected itself from the handle while I was about to use it. I take good care of my things, so at first I thought the hose had simply gotten lose or something and I would need to re-attached it. But on closer inspection, what I discovered was that the plastic and material used for the hose had turned very hard and brittle near the handled and tore open without warning, rendering it pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pity because this product worked fine but it doesn&#x27;t last. Be aware.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product and work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and needed!</li>
    <li> I have large hands and after years of frustration trying to floss I finally bought a Waterpik.  It&#x27;s SO easy to use and does a great job.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd waterpik i have had.  the other model had problems with the water line. It kept baking.  I thought I would try this model.</li>
    <li> This one works much better.  Water tank is just the right size and the pressure available is higher without going crazy.</li>
    <li> 1. Noise: It&#x27;s a bit louder than I would like, but the noise isn&#x27;t terrible. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s 55 to 65 dB.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pause button: Having to hold the button down is slightly inconvenient. A better design would allow the button to remain depressed on its own.&lt;br /&gt;3. Size: I thought the device would be bulky, but it is surprisingly compact.&lt;br /&gt;4. Power: For me, the third power setting is enough to achieve a thorough cleaning, and anything above 4 feels a bit painful. I&#x27;m not sure how some people are using settings higher than 7.&lt;br /&gt;5. Water Capacity: The reservoir is supposed to give you 90 seconds, but if you want to spend 3 seconds cleaning each space from two directions (from the front and from the back), you&#x27;re going to need more time. I end up using about twice the reservoir capacity, so I have to stop and refill once.&lt;br /&gt;6. Durability: I&#x27;ve been using this for just a few months, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far. It comes with a three-year warranty, so I&#x27;m not concerned.&lt;br /&gt;7. Cord Length: I have no problem using the device, but increasing the cord length by about 25% would make things a bit easier.&lt;br /&gt;8. Effectiveness: In general, the WP-100W does a thorough job cleaning. I find that it leaves a miniscule amount of plaque behind, so I don&#x27;t think it can be a complete replacement for flossing -- but it comes very close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how much food particles are eliminated by use of the Flooser; and since i am t a fan of traditional flossing, this flooser almost eliminates it except in rare instances.  Your mouth feels clean when you are done.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is a little noisy but works like a charm.Leaves your teeth and mouth feeling fresh.One of the best things i&#x27;ve purchased for myself.</li>
    <li> Effective complement to tooth brushing.</li>
    <li> Wish the tank was larger, and the lid on and off (needed to add water) was better fit.&lt;br /&gt;And the on off buttons better thought out.&lt;br /&gt;Length of tubing should be longer,&lt;br /&gt;more powerful pumping action would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking for the more professional water pick tool system.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows one, please get it online..</li>
    <li> I hate flossing, and I always have. I think people who floss regularly have an extraordinary amount of willpower. I also have very tightly spaced teeth, with braces behind my teeth--so I couldn&#x27;t floss using string even if I wanted to. (The dental hygienist initially insisted it was possible, and then quickly gave up... you can just simply not put floss between my teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I heard about the Waterpik, I had my doubts--but thought it would be worth a shot so my fiance and I could finally floss. This thing is INCREDIBLE. It&#x27;s gross, but I can see the removed chunks of plaque/food in my sink after I use it. We use it at about half power, which is perfect--and intense. I can feel the water go through my teeth and clean all the spaces in between. The pause button is a LIFESAVER. I haven&#x27;t used the other tips yet, but it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re there. Yes, you&#x27;ll probably have to fill the water reservoir every time, but it takes five seconds--and a 60-90 second spin on the Waterpik leaves your mouth feeling AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working at first, stretch out the coil hose a little bit--then the water will come running! The coil needs to loosen up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not recommend this more. It sincerely is a great product.</li>
    <li> I started using the waterpik and I am totally thrilled with the results.  It removes far more food particles than ordinary flossing and brushing.  I also enjoy the water pressure on my gums.  I have not yet tried the other tips, but I will.  I have another dental checkup in March 2015 and I&#x27;m hoping my dentist notices the effort.</li>
    <li> there are certain issues you much contend with but I do not use tap water, but distilled. or highly filtered water.&lt;br /&gt;but the results of the unit are great, gets under bridge and between the teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;messages the gums as well.</li>
    <li> This one was purchased as a gift for our daughter who just had braces put on. Makes caring for her teeth easier</li>
    <li> effective and easy to use. I was able to put it together and use within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see the particles it dislodges, in the sink after I rinse. Added some mouth wash for the fresh tingling feeling and I feel great each time I use it.</li>
    <li> My last waterpik failed after several years because of a leak in the hose. I was not going to buy another, but their new model allows the hose to be replaced. I struggled with a portable version from another company for a year so I was very happy they came out with a new model that addresses their quality problems. I hope I am not surprised down the road.</li>
    <li> Good product. Worth the money.had several others that I did not like.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. It always works well.</li>
    <li> Have owned two, thus brand.  Last one lasted over 40 years.  Always does superior job.  Bad gums?  THIS COULD HELP SAVED YOUR teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  I&#x27;ve had my Waterpik for about a month or so now.  At first, you need to use the lower settings, as is recommended by the manufacturer  It is surprisingly powerful!  Much better than flossing.</li>
    <li> This product works well. I had just gotten some implants put in and a lot of dental work done. Along with my brushing and regular flossing this product is helping to keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I have had no other pick but am very satisfied with this one that my dentist insisted that I purchase.</li>
    <li> If you have braces... This is what you need for clean teeth!😃</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very reasonably priced. Our dentist asked us to get this instrument for better oral health.</li>
    <li> since I bought this a few years ago at my dnetists reconmmendation my teeth cleaning bisits have been reduced in half.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how you possibly use this washing your whole bathroom. I assume it would be great if I&#x27;d bought a cordless model and used it while IN the shower. I seriously must be doing something wrong because even on the lowest setting I managed to splutter the mirror, the sink, the vanity top, the floor, and half my face.  Yes I made sure the heads were properly placed (no leaks).  I swear it was a caddyshack moment.  I also hate how loud it is; feel like I have a small diesel generator in my bathroom..  back to the hateful little floss for me.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product. This product cleans what a normal toothbrush misses.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this thing. And my hygienist states that my gums look great and I made her job easy on her in terms of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person who never loved flossing and was inconsistent with it, I can say that I use the waterpik way more regularly - probably 4 or 5 times a week.</li>
    <li> I have used it for just a few days, but it is very effective in cleaning teeth. It is very easy to use, and I like being able to control the amount of warm water in it, and the variety of tools is nice. I like the storage container on the top. I have not had it long enough to see if problems develop over time, but so far it has worked better than previous water flossers I have tried. I have been using the brush attachment and a setting of three, and the amount of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that comes out from between my teeth is remarkable. I thought it was a bit pricy, but I suspect it is going to be worth it.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. I have had no issues whatsoever with it. I like that I can add mouthwash to the water container (diluted) and get down under my gums into the small pockets that I have with the antiseptic mouthwash. The water reservoir holds  just enough water to do your entire mouth you don&#x27;t want to overdo it with that high pressure on your gums because it can damage your gums if mot careful.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff, and my gum get improved. very useful and easy to use. You will like it and it worth to have it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I couldn&#x27;t floss with braces.  Threading takes so long and there are still areas I can&#x27;t seem to reach.  I was a little skeptical because I made the mistake of reading a message board filled with dental students arguing about its efficacy.  Don&#x27;t do that, just buy it!  I love it and feel that my overall dental health has improved as a result.  I am also an ex-smoker and this has really helped get my gums back into shape.  It comes with a bunch of great attachments, and you can use mouthwash with it too!  It is sort of loud, sounds like an air compressor.  Not a problem but good to know!</li>
    <li> As has always been the case, your product is as good as you have ever advertised!  My dentist would readily attest&lt;br /&gt;to that!</li>
    <li> Good product at fair price. Just a little bulky to store. This is our second and they do help with issues.</li>
    <li> we paid US$45 per unit plus approx. USD30 per unit as international courier charges,&lt;br /&gt;and still cheaper than what we have paid if to get from local merchants.&lt;br /&gt;the problem is the adapter, that scale down transformer (220V-110V) cost approx. USD65 from local electric shop.&lt;br /&gt;hope amazon also sells transformer to oversea buyers like us.</li>
    <li> I use this pretty much every day and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old one that died after many years of use.  I also like the smaller tank because you don&#x27;t really need so much water to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Paying it forward...purchased this as a gift along with the mobile unit.  It is a great buy.  You&#x27;ll be able to see after using it and visiting your dentist!</li>
    <li> Waterpik works very well - am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase in December for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> The pros for this device are easy to see - If you&#x27;re a lazy flosser like me, you&#x27;ll find this way more convenient than regular floss and use it way more often. Result : Better dental hygene. This is huge. It&#x27;s also pretty convenient to use, and changing the intensity and the tip to suit your needs is easy. In theory, an excellent flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con mostly comes down to one design issue that annoys me - the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button is *not* convenient. It has two primary problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it would have been so much better to make the default button position one where water isn&#x27;t spurting out, and the non-default one being the one where no water comes out - that way, it&#x27;s pressed when you want it, and if you let go, it wouldn&#x27;t default to spraying water around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and really the thing that makes this so frustrating, the button gets stuck easily and is difficult to pull out once it gets stuck in the pressed state. With the way it works now, I have to make sure the button is pressed, and kept pressed, as I switch on the waterpik, and then aim it in my mouth, and then release the button and hope it releases. If it doesn&#x27;t release, I struggle with it to get it unstuck, and if I take it out to the wash basin, at some point, when it gets unstuck, it&#x27;s going to spray water around the place and the speed at which it does means there&#x27;s going to be splashing. If it releases, great, and I have a good flossing session in the way it&#x27;s intended to work. Once I&#x27;m done, I have to pause to spit, or to turn it off, and thankfully, at this time, it doesn&#x27;t matter so much if it gets stuck because I&#x27;m going to just turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be, in theory, something I love, but in practice, because of the sticky pause button, has been a source of frustration, and a cause for a mess of water that needs to be wiped off around my sink and sometimes on the mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought 2. One for this kids and one for us grown ups.  Works really well. Had one like this when I was a kid...and with teenagers who won&#x27;t floss with braces... It works really well.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who just recently got braces. She loves it! It makes it a lot easier to manage braces than using regular floss. She has gotten a good report from her orthodontist for brushing and flossing. It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I was &amp;#34;ordered&amp;#34; by my dental hygienist to get this for problem gum areas. Add Listerine to the water and nothing else makes your mouth feel cleaner!</li>
    <li> Have had this product for just over a month and use it daily and actually have now bought three more as gifts (fathers day and two birthdays)....  I love it.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and never had a waterpik before, and now I am thinking of all the years of extra oral care I&#x27;ve missed out on.  Never too late!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version has a large water resevoir and many tips for the head of the nossel.  You attach the tip to dispense the water in your mouth that you like the best.  I haven&#x27;t played around too much with them - i like just the regular size.  There are different strengths of water dispenser so you can have a mild pulse of water in your mouth, and then work up to full strength (if you like) where it&#x27;s like a car wash in your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this! Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the new compact design.  I have been using Waterpic for 20 year and this model is the best.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my waterpic and use it every day,.  Very attractive and easy to use.  My dentist and I thank you.</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars, I would.  The flimsy bracket thats holds the hand piece broke off right after the warrantee period. I tried to fix with a little velcro, but that did not hold well.  When I sent it in,they returned it to me with a nice letter telling me to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> It makes flossing a lot easier. It cleans the gums thoroughly in a way that normal brushing or flossing couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my elderly mother (86 years old) on the recommendation of her dentist because she had trouble with her gums.  She uses the Waterpik twice, sometimes three times a day.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and the results are phenomenal!!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but need to order new brush heads.  You don&#x27;t seem to have them available.</li>
    <li> amaziing.. best flossing ever ,, made my life easy!</li>
    <li> Was using a portable flosser and realized that the power was too low for good cleaning. This one does the job to my and my dental hygenist&#x27;s great pleasure.</li>
    <li> This model is so much easier to use than my old one. The pause button makes all the difference It makes it easier to control</li>
    <li> Much better than my old one and my wife likes the look of it.  Works well and is not too loud.</li>
    <li> will get things out of your teeth left behind from brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> It does jobs that tooth brush can&#x27;t do. I feel i should have got one long time ago. it is well made, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I feel put the tool box on top of the water container is a little inconvenience for me.  I&#x27;d prefer it has a simple lid.</li>
    <li> One of my best investment ever. Since I didn&#x27;t have dental insurance for many years after I got out of military. This baby has been maintaining my teeth. Saving me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended me to try a water flosser.  Because of extensive crown-work, I have lots of spaces for food to get caught in after eating.  After a meal I have so much food caught between my teeth that in-betweens and dental floss just cannot get it al out--even after repeated attempts.  This water flosser is one more tool at my disposal.  I start with it and then use tape floss as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank holds some 90 seconds worth of water--enough for a good wash.  Folks who suggested I try using the water flosser while I am showering have not read the warnings!  Further, I cannot imagine how they could mange it!  Ninety seconds over a sink is all I usually need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to use dental floss to finish up.  Sometimes after 30 minutes or so I use this waterpik again to get the last of what I feel caught between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found level 3 (out of 10 levels) to be strong enough.  One has to be careful as the instructions warn:  the region under the tongue is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, even if you believe your teeth are clean, using this water flosser will show you that the toothbrush does not remove everything. I prefer using it befor I brush to get out the loose food. Also it is great to keep your gums healthy.</li>
    <li> This works excellent.My dental checkups are a lot better now that i am using this regularly.</li>
    <li> I have been using water pics for a long time. I like that this one is smaller, it has power. However, it is noisy. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just started using the waterpik flosser and my mouth feels so clean.  I thought that flossing was good but it can&#x27;t beat this.  It&#x27;s faster, and even gets etween bridge work to get out those crumbs that are left.  I started with the cordless one and love it (especially because you can travel with it) but decided to get one that is stronger and has more options.  My dentist will be so happy when he sees me!</li>
    <li> My teeth have been thanking me since I started using this. I love this product. very easy to use and keep clean</li>
    <li> Excellent water flosser for the first year I owned it, then the water stream started losing power.  After two years (recently) the water hose broke in the middle.  I suspect that the hose first became creased in an unnoticed way and cut down on the power of the water stream, and finally broke from repeated use.  If it lasted longer I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Think your teeth are clean? Use this thing for 2 minutes. It toughens up your gums to fight decay, et al. If you know about this product and don&#x27;t use it, you are a fool. Knowledge is power only when you use it.</li>
    <li> My DDS assistant recommended and so I purchased this Pik. Works wonderfully its amazing the stuff that this little gem can get out between your teeth. Gross I know but it&#x27;s better than a root canal.</li>
    <li> Like: well made&lt;br /&gt;  Good design&lt;br /&gt;  Gets EVERYthing out of teeth&lt;br /&gt;  Adjustable pressure settings&lt;br /&gt;  Can have multi users (we picked needed attachments&lt;br /&gt;  Can add mouthwash to water for taste&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to clean/store&lt;br /&gt;  Removes plaque on teeth AND under gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dis:  attachments not color coded so tougher to share when most pieces samecolor</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a previous model which both my husband and I used.  That model had two standard end pieces, so each person had his own tip.  This model provides only one plus a bunch on specialized flossers that I expect no one uses.  And the water well is much too small.  I do not have a particularly large mouth, but I find that I barely get enough water to complete the job.  When I first got it I though I had bought something for a child.  But I have continued using it, and have adapted.  The old one was much better.  It was only after I had bought this one that I found out that Waterpik has replacement parts for the older models.</li>
    <li> The size of the waterpik is good, not too bulky.  I do have to fill the reserve twice while using it.  Would have liked a larger water reserve, but not a deal breaker.  Power of the water is good.</li>
    <li> This model somehow seems more compact than earlier versions.  And it&#x27;s much nicer than the handheld version.  Big range of pressures.  The wand is easy to hold.  The reservoir holds just the right amount.  It does have to be set up next to the sink.  I have a pedestal sink, but put a small table under it next to the side wall and it works fine.  My hygienist said she notices a big difference in patients who use these.  I believe it.</li>
    <li> Once you&#x27;ve tried this product, you will never be satisfied with just brushing. Simple. Fast. Thorough. Double these comments if you have kids with braces!</li>
    <li> In addition to string flossing, my dentist said the irrigation flossing oxygenated the water and the bacteria in your toothy crevices don&#x27;t like it. Had this for a couple weeks and it seems to work well, only complaint is it fills your mouth up with water really fast even at the low setting. Not something you can get around.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended i purchase one of these and thought - shoot more money and more time spent on something i don&#x27;t enjoy - but i was wrong - it takes very little time - maybe 1 minute or 2 at most - but it&#x27;s fast and fun and encouraging to see junk from between your teeth falling into the sink and feels refreshing to boot.  cheers to waterpick.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this Waterpik - our other one broke and this one is a definite upgrade.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am 34 with braces and this thing has saved my life.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, the hose becomes brittle and breaks in 12-18 months.  Repair kits costs about $10 and requires mid-level handyman skill to replace.</li>
    <li> love it, can&#x27;t believe the food particles it gets out even just after you finish brushing. would recondmend it to everybody</li>
    <li> The practice of good oral hygeine care is a must. You can pay now or pay later. Either way you will pay. I chose this item because i wanted to do more than just brushing and manually flossing. Waterpik is a well known name and that&#x27;s where The Waterpik Ultra Flosser comes in. It&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done. If you want to keep your own teeth then this is a no brainer as a purchase. You will be glad you did at some point and time. This is definately a recommendation to any one who&#x27;s listening.</li>
    <li> How did I manage to feel like my teeth were clean before using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser? After using it consistently for three months my dentist was impressed with the improvement in my dental health. Honestly, my teeth no longer feel clean if I don&#x27;t use the Water Flosser everyday. I liked mine so much I purchased one for each bathroom in my house. I&#x27;ve had mine now for nearly a year and never had an issue with the reliability of it, even using it everyday. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to my relatives and friends.</li>
    <li> My back teeth are too close together to floss without a good deal of pain and fear that I will yank my teeth out. This works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and no issues. What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how great the tooth brush attachment would be, I don&#x27;t think my teeth have ever felt smoother.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to get one, I did and love it. The bigger one is better as it has more pressure settings and is much more powerful than the cordless.</li>
    <li> Exact same &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; as the 900 series, but without the rechargeable toothbrush...</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. Pressure settings have a good range. The range of attachments makes its suitable for almost all your dental care needs. Keep in mind though, its not a replacement for flossing. It is great for getting the husks of popcorn kernels out of your gumline though!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It does a fantastic job, better than my attempts at flossing.  I wish the cord between the handle and the machine were a bit more flexible, but that may occur after continued usage.  The water supply is sufficient and the power adjustments are enough to dislodge any material in the gums and teeth.  I like the assorted attachments for multiple types of flossing.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is serious about their health needs.  It makes flossing quick and simple as well as thorough.</li>
    <li> My dental health is much better after routinely using this multi pick product.  This photo doesn&#x27;t show the 5 or 6 different picks that it comes with and it&#x27;s much smaller than previous Waterpics.  My dentist isn&#x27;t talking about gum surgery any more.  I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to get this item through TSA I love it and what it does so much.</li>
    <li> This was the best thing I got this year! Amazing product.  I usually use everyday, once a day. I just went to my dentist to do a cleaning and he told me that I didn&#x27;t need one. Thanks  to Waterpick. Worth it every penny!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Within 30 days of using this product, the reservoir would leak from the rubber reservoir valve.  The owner&#x27;s manual says: Contact&lt;br /&gt;Water Pik, Inc. customer service for a replacement valve.  I did.  They do not sell them.  Instead, they want to sell a complete reservoir for $10.  Alot mor profit there than selling a bag of valves for $1.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is so much easier and works far better than regular dental floss.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how affordable it was.  I would expect to pay more for such a great product.</li>
    <li> My lab uses this to blast electrode gel from our EEG cap, and it works great on our 64 electrodes in our neuroscan cap. With this we can clean the cap in under 10 minutes with minimal work by RAs - definitely an improvement from 50 minutes cleaning by hand! The stream is powerful and effective for blasting thick EEG gel off of each sensor. It does make a buzzing noise which is likely common to all waterpiks, which it doesn&#x27;t really bother us but would be a problem if you wanted to secretly hide the fact that you were using a waterpik somewhere. I would highly recommend it for EEG cap cleaning but I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness on teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a compulsive shopper and I don&#x27;t like to floss my teeth with regular floss because of my retainer so I bought this but honestly, I dont&#x27; like it that mch I&#x27;d get a refund if I could.</li>
    <li> Fast, a pleasure to use, feels great, and powerful. Take with on all overnights. Good idea to use after every meal if convenient. Per Dentists, does not replace flossing but sure takes a load off the floss. A handy unit in the shop also for flushing out jets, small orifices, tubing, lines, and ports. A 12\\&quot; longer hose of more flexible material, and clips to secure the tank and cover from falling off when unit picked up would complete a perfect \\&quot;tool\\&quot;. My dental hygienist recommended this purchase. As valuable as my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have been used for a period of time. The quality of this product above my expectation. Love it !</li>
    <li> We purchased  this Waterpik because our 12 year-old daughter got braces, easy for her to use, and so far working great. We hope she continues to use it.Also want to add, shipping was faster,  then we expected. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought another one of this after just 2 days of getting my first one after seeing how it was able to remove remaining plaques even after brushing and flossing.  This works very well for my bridged teeth and my daughter&#x27;s braces.  This really is a mini pressure washer for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that pressure on this device can be set from 1 to 10(highest), so start at 1 and gradually go higher from there as setting it too high might cause injuries to your gums and tongue.  After weeks of using, we find that 3 on its dial is right for us.</li>
    <li> I had some gum pain, most likely as a result of gingivitis. After 3 days of using this, the pain disappeared and my teeth feel much &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t say this totally replaces flossing, as the Waterpik didn&#x27;t get all of my particles out. However, it&#x27;s an excellent complement to brushing/flossing as it gets deep into your gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to add hydrogen peroxide or salt to make this an even more effective treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and I like using it and testing out all of the different attachments are fun (yeah, I&#x27;m easily entertained!).  Sometimes, the water pressure is weak and I have to switch it off and then back on again before it hits the right stream.  I had to learn not to use it as high (about 6) that I was using it at because my teeth and gums started being sensitive to it.  But, when I adjusted it down (about 4), I could continue to use it almost daily without any issues.  I want to add essential oils to it so bad, but it specifically recommends that these not be added because it may cause problems with the product.  Otherwise, I really like this thing.</li>
    <li> This device is easy to use.  It is somewhat hard to get the water bucket off the unit and to get water out of the system for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device comes with plenty of specialty heads.  But, the one that is normally used seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure can be changed from very light to very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it does a good job of getting most things out, but I believe floss would still help more with pieces of food that are really stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it more regularly than I would do flossing, as it is easy to use and seems less painful than floss.</li>
    <li> I do not understand the high reviews for this item.  This is a horribly designed product.  1st the hose much too short and pulls the reservoir over spilling over the unit.  The reservoir cap is fussy as the hinge separates and equally and oddly does not accommodate all the accessory tips.  The left sided controls are not user friendly for most right handed individuals.  This is such an annoying product, I wish my spouse hadn&#x27;t thrown away the box.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and her family.  They all tell me frequently that it is the best and I should purchase one for myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference ever since I started using a waterpik. I have large gaps in between my teeth and always build tarter faster than anyone else in my family. I usually have to get my teeth cleaning done every 3-6 months but now after 3 months of using this waterpik and flossing at once, its been 3 months and I have no tarter build up at all. This has a bigger tank than the cordless one so you don&#x27;t have to refill it in the middle of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to use the first half of the water tank to push out anything between your teeth, using regular floss, then the 2nd half of the tank to get what you missed, then brush, and rinse. I only do this once at night before I go to bed and my teeth are tarter free. Of course you could do it multiple times a day, but who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it is very noisy!</li>
    <li> Ever since day one of using this product my gums have felt so much healthier and haven&#x27;t bled as much during flossing or bleeding. I actually look forward to using this machine b/c the massage on the gums feels good.</li>
    <li> Was far better that I expected.  Had one before, that was still in it&#x27;s box, that I gave away.  Think I could have saved $1000s on Dentist&#x27;s with this</li>
    <li> Excellent waterpik, a must have if you want to have beautiful teeth!!! You will say that this was the best purchase you ever made for yourself!</li>
    <li> Works great for my mouth - helps where regular flossing misses - I add a tad of mouthwash to the water and my mouth is fresh as can be!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know of another product that compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended from my dentist. I plan to use it at least 2 times a day.  It is adjustable pressure which is also great so you can adjust for sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large reservoir is perfect for adding 2 cap fulls of your favorite mouthwash into the luke warm water.</li>
    <li> The perfect way to keep your teeth and gum and best shape, and the best way to save in deep cleaning...</li>
    <li> This product was above my expectations. It  was simple and easy to set up and use. Price was great compare to buying in a store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling bad morning breath and receding gums for a better part of 3 years now. At first I purchased a Sonicare toothbrush and thought that was the holy grail of oral hygiene. I felt that my mouth has never felt cleaner after brushing my teeth, and that if there is any product someone should buy for their oral hygiene it should be a sonic toothbrush. If that&#x27;s true for a sonic toothbrush, it&#x27;s doubly, no quadruply (is that even a word) true for a waterpik. I purchased this product 3 days ago and I&#x27;m in such awe at the cleaning power of this tool that I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waited this long to buy it. If there is any hesitation in your mind about wether or not you should buy a water floss product, remove it. After a bunch of research I realized this would be the best next option for me to help combat my oral problems (including caring for my crown I just received a few months ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for the first day, I realized it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m going to need in my teeth cleaning regimen everyday. The clean feeling you get after using this is only comparable to the clean feeling you get at the dentist. I&#x27;m being serious. I said earlier I believed the sonicare gave me the best clean feeling after brushing my teeth; this gives the second best clean feeling EVER only passed by cleaning by a dentist. I actually enjoy using a waterpik every night because it&#x27;s so easy and the results you get are amazing. A good example of how well this pik works:My front bottom teeth slightly overlap and because of that creates a pocket where plaque develops and my toothbrush or floss can&#x27;t get it all. After the FIRST use of this waterpik, it blasted 4 months of plaque buildup in one go. I also had gum swelling near my crown, and every time I flossed I would bleed and after 2 days of using this I did not bleed anymore and my swelling went down tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The couple of problems I encountered with this product is it can get messy when you&#x27;re first using it and that it is slightly loud,but if you have a bathroom that is separate from any rooms, this shouldn&#x27;t wake anyone else up when using it at night (I tested this and when I closed my bathroom door while standing outside I barely heard an audible hum). I was also reading reviews about mold and this made me extremely paranoid. After collecting as much research as I can about this and even emailing Waterpik, I developed these precautions: Do not leave your head in the handle. After use, remove it and shake it to remove as much water as you can. Do not keep the top on the water basin when not in use. By keeping the top on while the lid is damp will make it a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. I just keep my tools organized in the top and keep it in my medicine cabinet. Grab the actual waterpik mechanism and handle and hold it upside down over the sink and let it drain for a few seconds. After, pat the inside dry and place the water bin upside down over the waterpik mechanism and place the handle upside down instead of right side up. If this sounds confusing, just look at the picture I posted :). Also, do NOT USE BLEACH like some of these users recommended, Waterpik stated it is not safe to use with their product, and using a mixture of hydrogen peroxide or vinegar and water is a better alternative to clean your system. Also, I like to add a bit of mouthwash, and I read it is recommended to run water after to remove all the gunk the mouthwash can leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might sound like a lot of work for oral hygiene, even doing it once a day (I&#x27;ve been doing it twice a day), but I still give this product 5 stars because it really is worth the hassle. Most of the work is preventative for mold, and some steps can probably be skipped (Removing the heads, emptying the water basin, and keeping the lid off are probably the most important). Don&#x27;t forget! Buying this product gives you 3 year warranty so if anything happens you can contact Waterpik and they&#x27;ll send youa replacement for whatever went wrong. I was a bit of a skeptic at first with some of these negative reviews, but even with all this skepticism I believe getting a oral irrigator such as this Waterpik is essential for keeping healthy gums and teeth. After only 3 days of use I wake up with fresh breath, a pink tongue, and my mouth still feeling clean. I have never felt this in my 23 years of life!nt wrong.

    <li> It is a perfect way to celan you teeths&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day after meals 3 times to day&lt;br /&gt;I like it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the first to admit it--I&#x27;ve got a mouth full of crappy teeth and gums! All those years of candy-crunching have caught up to me as an adult and I&#x27;ve got holes, fillings, root canals and a partridge in a pear tree going on in there. Traditional flossing has been an exercise in futility as I can never quite get between my teeth with all the work I&#x27;ve had done. That&#x27;s why I was overjoyed when I found the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. WOW, where has this thing been all my life?! Although the first couple of times I used this gizmo were painful, I&#x27;ve been a regular Waterpik-er everyday and it&#x27;s gotten so much better. It&#x27;s gross, but I love seeing food fall into the sink that the Waterpik was about to blast out of there. This is by far the best gadget I&#x27;ve ever bought for my tooth health and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has trouble with traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> It really is great. I worked my way up from #5 setting all the way up to #10. It really did help me to no longer have sensitive gums. Not to mention my gums use to slightly bleed when I brushed and especially flossed and since using this, not anymore. My dentist noticed a huge improvement too.  Only complaint is it&#x27;s LOUD ! Other than that, it&#x27;s a must have product.</li>
    <li> My 20 year old Waterpik, which was very basic, finally died. This replacement is a BIG improvement over my old one! More attachments, gentler and quieter pulsing action. Also, there is no tank inside to grow black mold. I had to add bleach to it every few weeks to get the mold out. Also, it was priced right. Let&#x27;s hope this one lasts 20 years as well.</li>
    <li> Trying to take care of my 50-year-old teeth so that I don&#x27;t end up gumming my food in my twilight years.  This thing is incredible.  Easy to use, comes with a lot of little tips for various jobs.  You will be amazed...I was...at the stuff that will come out of your mouth, even after brushing and flossing.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Easy to stash, clean &amp; use. Great deal for the price &amp; good variety of tools, too. Highly reccomend. Saves me $$$ on dental bills, too !</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Strongly recommend it. Wish it came with two standard tips. A little noisy, but a good product.</li>
    <li> I have used this waterpick 5 times now and this last time, I was so angry with it, I threw it into the trash. Try as I might, I could not prevent the water tank from toppling over and dumping 8-16oz of water all over the counter, soaking everything. The problem? The cord that attaches the wand to the machine will stretch to 3&#x27; if you pull on it enough, but realistically, you can only stretch it 12\\&quot; before the tension in the cord lifts the machine into the air. The machine weighs less than a pound, so any tension on the line will knock it over. The water tank sits in a molded base that fits the tank and is only held in place by gravity. See that white lid in the picture? It is even worse than the tank connection, floating on top of the tank, with a 2 mm lip to keep it from sliding side to side. Bump it slightly and it falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What am I trying to say? None of the parts snap or lock together, except for the pick ends. With water, it is top heavy, given the narrow base. Move the machine more than 20 degrees and tank falls out, the lid falls off, water comes out, anger ensues.  The whole thing is as stable as a Jinga puzzle after 20 mins of playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time this happened, it was easy to figure out why and I thought I could hold it in place with one hand on the machine during use. Nope. Stretch the line more than 12\\&quot; from the machine and the bottom will fly out from under the water tank, the lid and tank will separate in your hand, and you will be angry all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to use this machine is to place it on the edge of the sink, put one hand on top of it, and keep your head 12\\&quot; from the base to prevent the line from stretching. I keep having visions of the scene from Office Space, where they smash the copier to bits in a field. That&#x27;s how much I like this machine.</li>
    <li> Works perfecctly. Had one before for many years that finally wore down.  Highly recomend to anyone who values their teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Waterpik for years and enjoy the way my teeth feel so clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.  The pik that I am using seems to use more water than did my old one, the opening is probably not as small as the previous model but it still does a good job.</li>
    <li> Removes food stuck in my teeth. Makes my mouth feel clean. It doesn&#x27;t prevent calculus build up though but then again, manual flossing didn&#x27;t either.</li>
    <li> The Warterpik Ultra is ultra.  I love the pressure, the place to store the extra piks, &amp; the toothbrush that came with it.  I the item came on time &amp; in great condition.</li>
    <li> The product works great. Simple and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the push button on the flosser that pauses the flow of the water jet gets sticky after a month of use and gets jammed into the handle. Need to turn off the flosser to release the jammed button</li>
    <li> I am going to keep it. It is better than the smaller water pik I have. It has a little more pressure than the smaller one but not as good as the older model that I had. Wishing they still made them as good as they used to. The pressure could be better  but I don&#x27;t think they make them that way anymore. This is my third attempt to replace my older model and I am going to stick with it. Tired of trying to find one</li>
    <li> My wife bought this item at the urging of her dentist.  She loves it.  She uses it regularly every day.</li>
    <li> This works very well. I love all the options for intensity. You can do it very gently for kids or very intense if needed. The water capacity is perfect, it will be all you need to floss. like the way the cord coils up inside of it. It is easy to tip over when plugged in but we have very limited counter space so thats part of it. Its great, works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and really feels good, just like what the dentist do when they wash your teeth. Quite helpful.</li>
    <li> Works great. Only drawback is the water resorvoir is empty before I finish.  Maybe I just have not figured out how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> And so did the second one they shipped me.  The third one, which arrived today, worked.  I have only used it once, but the motor had two or three stumbled while using on my teeth.  So I am concerned in it&#x27;s long term reliability.</li>
    <li> I like all the different attachments and the adjustable water pressures. No assembly necessary and it&#x27;s very user-friendly. I have braces so its been very helpful right after meals and it saves me loads of time over traditional flossing. I do that as well, but the water flosser helps cut down my oral hygiene time. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Waterpiks for years. The hose leaked after about five years, so we purchased a new one. I will never be without one. After a meal I use my Waterpik, which blasts all of the food particles out of my mouth. I then gargle with Hydrogen Peroxide and then brush my teeth with the Hydrogen Peroxide still in my mouth. Then I will give another quick rinse with the Waterpik and then a splash of Scope for that refreshing minty taste. My gums have never been better. They never bleed from flossing etc. Buy a Waterpik and brush your teeth as usual. Then use the Waterpik and you will see it flush food particles out of your mouth that you thought you had gotten rid of with your regular routine. It&#x27;s great for bridges and other dental work, as it will blast water between your bridge and gums where it is very difficult to get at with dental floss. Your teeth are like your friends. If you ignore them...they will go away. Use a Waterpik and keep your natural teeth longer and your gums healthier.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time deciding which water pik to buy for my daughter to help keep her mouth and braces clean.  This was a great choice!</li>
    <li> I like it and I use it everyday it is a great buy and much improved over the other water pic by the same company. I highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my hygienist because I have deep gum pockets.  I started out on the lowest setting and could feel the pressure where the pockets are.  I have increased the setting to almost the highest and now, three weeks later, I no longer have that sensation, which I believe means they are already getting better.</li>
    <li> This is the second waterpic we&#x27;ve purchased.  We&#x27;ve had one at our house for over a year now and just got this one for our cottage.  We got a lemon, but exchanged it and this one is great.  Despite meticulous dental hygiene, my husband has had real problems with gum disease until we started using these.  Now they&#x27;re healthy!</li>
    <li> You can read other reviews and hear about the size, shape and what items come with the waterpik.  I am going to share with you what the pik does for your teeth and gums.  I went for my quarterly cleaning after using the waterpik a couple of months.  My dental hygienist could not believe the shape of my mouth.  100% less swelling and tartar. My hygienist also reset my dental cleaning schedule from quarterly to every 4 months.  I went for my last cleaning yesterday, same results.  In one word, the waterpik is impressive.  One thing to beware of; using the waterpik is habit forming.</li>
    <li> dental hygenist recommened trying this because I have a hard time flossing.  this is a great alternative or addition to flossing</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because flossing is tedious and tough to reach back teeth. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I am am very happy with the purchase. The flosser came with 4 different water picks, and it shoots water at high pressure to remove foods and plaque from your teeth. It is easy to reach all places in your mouth. I would describe it as a high-pressure hose but for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I made a big watery mess the first time I used it because I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. I&#x27;ve since developed a technique where I face downward and somewhat close to the sink bowl and keep my mouth mostly closed --- you&#x27;ll figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a replacement for going to the denist, but you&#x27;ll get great check ups and only need touch up cleaning. What&#x27;s really neat is you can mix 20% peroxide and/or your favorite mouth-wash in the water tanks to get a nice smelling breath and kill germs. I started the general use pick on #8 and I bled a little for about 3 days. I now use it on #9 pressure and never any blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works very well and has 4 different picks to use&lt;br /&gt;Only take 2 minutes to floss entire mouth on #8 pressure --- use the full tank of water for the first few times&lt;br /&gt;You can reduce pressure to the point where you feel comfortable and in crease from there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can be messy in terms of water spray until you get your technique down&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy so if you don&#x27;t want to wake people up do it at night before bed</li>
    <li> Overall update 3/14/2014 from first review of July, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item in January of 2013, despite a number of negative reviews. I used a Waterpik many years ago then got away from it in favor of floss and Sonicare. My regime for over 20 years was to use regular brush, floss, then Sonicare every morning and brush every night. This staved off any recurrence of periodontal disease that I first had when in Japan in 1988-89. Visits to the dentist, first every three months, then stretched to six months and then sometimes as much as a year without any evidence of periodontal pockets or significant tarter buildup between visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in early 2013, my dentist recommended that I use a Waterpik. I decided to take my chances. I found none of the difficulties such as others complained about using the device itself. After six months of use, I wrote my first review giving the Waterpik a five-star rating. The hose had remained coupled to the pumping station, the handle remained in one piece and the pressure regulation worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do not have recourse to use all the differing ends they provide. I use the standard end and Mary uses the tiny-jet high velocity end for periodontal pockets. So far, so good. (This true as I update as it was when first reviewed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afte purchase, I decided to test the efficacy of the Waterpik by eliminating the use of floss. After close to a year, I went again to my dentist and he found significant tarter, much more than in past examinations. As stated, my previous regime of brush, floss, sonicare resulted in negligible tarter with as much as three years between visits. (We worked on a boat in the Caribbean and could not always get dental care.) Now I know that the Waterpik helps...I can see this after eating things such as nuts then flossing then using the pik, but it is not a replacement for floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention my method of flossing because it probably is significant to this review. I hold the floss, wrapped around one little finger and around the other hand. Stretching the floss between the two hands, I go up and down between the teeth on the teeth edges four-to-six times. I do this for each edge side of each tooth, up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current regime is brush, waterpik, floss, Sonicare. this seems to do the job. As a result of my experience, I have reduced the overall rating of the Waterpik to three-star. While it should receive a five-star rating if only the quality of the device is considered, the overall determination should be the quality of the results and this, to me, is three-star based on its efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is that the Waterpik is insufficient by itself to eliminate buildup of tarter. Rather its combined use with floss is surely the best combination with brushing. But, if you have to choose between the two, choose floss...its consistent use will stand you in good stead compared with the pik by itself.s review.

    <li> There&#x27;s no two ways about it.....but maybe not as vigorous as without the Waterpik.  I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for years and when my old one sprung a leak, I had to replace it ASAP....My teeth don&#x27;t feel really clean unless I use the waterpik!</li>
    <li> My son got braces so we thought this would help him floss.  My kids used this for 2 months before it broke.  The button on the flosser gets stuck in the off position so you have to pry it open each time.  Now it is stuck permanently and cannot be used.  Of course, the return timeframe has expired so I am stuck having to find an alternative.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter because her orthodontist recommended it. She was having a tough time doing her flossing with her braces. Waterpik has made her life so much easier because the time it takes to clean and the areas it can cover is commendable.</li>
    <li> I have used this water pick for at least 5 years and love it! The first time I used it I was amazed at the amount of particles removed from my teeth. I have to have my teeth cleaned every 6 months due to the amount of tarter my body produces. My hygienists are very good but the cleaning is difficult for me. After using the water pick, my cleanings were much easier and the amount of tarter was reduced.</li>
    <li> This waterpik works great, I notice that it removes all leftover food between teeth very well and leaves you with a great clean feeling.  if the unit stay reliable for a long time its well worth it. It will get the gum pockets to shrink, and make you and your hygienist happy.</li>
    <li> We used the older Oral-B version of oral irrigator for many years -- the one that combined with an electric toothbrush. That is no longer available, as we found when we finally needed to replace it.    This one is good and much prettier, but it requires a separate toothbrush appliance. It&#x27;s pulses don&#x27;t seem as strong. Also you have to be careful to press the tank down to prevent leaking.    With those picky negatives, it still does its main job quite well. After checking the market, this one seems to best current available. I use it daily and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product has helped change around my life. When I was a child growing up my parents couldn&#x27;t afford much medical care for me let alone my teeth. My mouth was always sensitive to brushing and flossing. I&#x27;d bleed alot after I flossed too. (This was back in the 1960&#x27;s. I grew up with 6 brothers and sisters too.) As I got older I was able to finally get a job that had medical insurance including dental.    My dentist diagnosed me with gingivitis and reccomended I go to a periodontist. I went to periodontist and was then told about this product that it could \\&quot;restore blood flow into your gums and help slow down your gingivitis\\&quot;. I was then given the Waterpik from my periodontist&#x27;s office.    It has been about 3 months since I bought my Waterpik and at first I was skeptical because I have never used such a product in my mouth. It&#x27;s quite intimidating to have this pressure hose in your mouth. I was clumsy with it and gradually learned to use it. Become better with it in time.    At the time of this writing I have notiched the following:    - Your teeth and gums have this new clean sensation. It is different than flossing. It is something you have to experience for yourself.    - The color of my gums have actually gone from a dark pink to a now lighter, healthier pink. Which means blood flow has increased and helped heal me.    - The bleeding in my mouth still happens though in a little amount compared to the large amount I originally had.    - My teeth have gotten a bit whiter too because this does remove the junk stuck on your teeth.     The bad points of a Waterpik:    - You need to ALWAYS dry it off after you use it. If you don&#x27;t then you can start to smell in the blue reservoir an odor that bacteria is growing in it. I just fill up the reservoir with hot water with a little anti bacterial soap. Then I let it soak for 5 min, turn on the unit and let it just flush out anything in it. Use regular water for one last flushing as to get the soap out. Now it is clean again.    - I have a small sink with a receptacle near by that I plug in. My Waterpik is actually on an angle which actually interrupts the water flow which means I have to actually hold it flat with one hand then the other use the actual handle. You need a flat surface for optimum efficiency.    My final thoughts are this is an excellent product. My bad points are really little things but I wanted to write an honest review. If you just simply always dried it off then it would never have anything growing in it though for me I admit I could be in a hurry and not dry it off. The other bad point is that water needs to flow through the device so it would only make sense to have it on a flat surface. The Waterpik has NOT broken down at all on me or anything, it still works fine. This is why I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> We got this waterpik for my son who just got braces, and it&#x27;s a life saver. Trying to floss under the braces was torture. My husband is also now hooked and is thinking about getting one for his office.     I do have a complaint about this particular model, and that&#x27;s the ridiculously short cord from the unit to the piece you put in your mouth. I noticed other reviewers remarked on this, but thought, how bad can it be? The answer is, pretty bad. We have an older pedestal sink with no counter surrounding it. My husband had to build a little shelf for the waterpik to sit on to be able to use it. He ingeniously used screws to stabilize the unit so you don&#x27;t pull it off the shelf when you&#x27;re using it. But you shouldn&#x27;t have to be a carpenter to use a waterpik</li>
    <li> The product is as described and does clean your teeth on areas that your brush can not. It feels better than when you floss. I highly recommended to everybody that care about their oral hygiene. It is worth the $$.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. It really does a great job in cleaning your teeth and gums. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.I recently had a dental bridge put in and the Water-Pik does a great job in cleaning the entire area. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in purchasing a product like this.</li>
    <li> I use it after brushing and flossing my teeth.  My mouth feels very clean and comfortable.  I am going to buy another one for my mom.</li>
    <li> Increasingly over the years my breath has begun to smell foul.  I tried brushing 6 times a day and nothing ever worked. Dry mouth and bad breath were killing my self esteem. Before I started shoveling money into internet \\&quot;bad breath killer\\&quot; products I went to a nutritionist doctor who told me to pick up a water pick and my breath would be normal in 7 days.  I added a tongue scrapping every night and drinking 8 glasses of water a day a lo and behold the bad breath problem is gone. I should have bought this waterpik years ago.    Bacteria as a result of lodged food particles were the culprit. The water pik dislodged the particles, the tongue scrapper removed bacterial buildup, water keeps the cleansing system powered. Good-bye bad breath. 2 months and the machine works like the day we bought it.      It makes me feel better and makes my teeth clean.  Only problem is that not all of the attachments fit in the cool compartment above the waterpik.  I guess it would increase the size too much. This thing is small enough to take on vacation. Glad I finally stopped procrastinating and bought the darn thing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, really gets the job done.    1. brush with sonic toothbrush.    2. brush with waterpic toothbrush.  Look with amazement at all the stuff that comes out of your mouth that the sonic toothbrush missed.    3. switch heads to the water jet and no more flossing.    Cons: could use a larger reservoir. ( I refill between brush and jet)  could use a little more power. don&#x27;t get me wrong, what is there is plenty for most, would just like a tiny bit more.    Why did my dentist not tell me about this years ago.. I think he had kids to send to college.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is the best product I have ever bought.  I was told that I had periodontal disease around a tooth and had a pocket that measured at least a \\&quot;9.\\&quot;  A referral to a periodontist was made.  I was told that for about $1,000 I could have the problem taken care of, but that the procedure would also leave me sensitive to hot and cold.  I bought a Waterpik because I didn&#x27;t want to spent the money I didn&#x27;t have, take the antibiotics required for the surgery, and then be sensitive to hot and cold for (maybe) ever.  I wanted to see if I could \\&quot;get away\\&quot; with postponing the inevitable until I could save up the cash.  I used the product religiously twice a day.  In a few days I noticed a difference in my mouth, and in a month a significant difference, so significant I decided to give the Waterpik an even longer trial before having surgery.  After using the product for 10 months without missing a day, at my last cleaning I was told that the measurements around the same tooth that was a \\&quot;9\\&quot; now measure a \\&quot;3.\\&quot;  The Waterpik worked miracles for me.  I&#x27;ve never spent a better $60.  I am not sure the Waterpik would do the same for anyone else, but honestly combined with daily brushing &amp; flossing, I have the healthiest mouth I have ever had in my life.  I recommend this product highly to absolutely everyone. A lot of products promise a lot of things, but this one that made very modest promises, delivered beyond my wildest expectations.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  Brushing isn&#x27;t enough.  Brush first, then use your Waterpik and you&#x27;ll be amazed at all a thorough brushing missed! My dentist father called it \\&quot;garbage\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Thought it would work like the thing they use at the dentist, but for an at home water flosser, it works great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, easy to fill, easy to maneuver, powerful pulse - so powerful that I do not have to turn it up any more than about half way. Not only does it wash away food particles, I can direct the water pulse into my gum pockets, thereby washing out harmful bacteria that lurk and infect. I use it at least once per day depending on what I eat. The residue from some foods is so irritating that I remove it sooner than others.  They say flossing is better but I am not convinced that it is.  Flossing hurts, the floss hangs on my fillings and crowns then shreds.  I dread flossing so I do not do it as recommended.  I would say that daily [plus] use of this device translates into much healthier hygiene than dreaded sporadic flossing. This water pik is what I need and I am glad I bought it.  Five stars if it lasts 3 years.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace a worn out Waterpik.  We have used ours for several years and it finally gave out.  This replacement is quieter and does a marvelous job.  Would recommend this unit to everyone that is concerned about oral health.  The dentist even remarks on what it has done for our overall dental care.</li>
    <li> I have used a waterpik in the past, but the portable one that I had did not hold enough water.  This one is great.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Waterpic - easy to use and it really cleans between the teeth and along the gums.  I purposely brush my teeth first and then use the Waterpic.  I am amazed what the Waterpic can do - it gets the small pieces of food still between the teeth.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I had a Waterpik years ago and got rid of it for the fancy battery toothbrushes, and floss but this make you teeth and gums feel so much cleaner. So now I use a combination of all three. Love! It Love It!</li>
    <li> This product takes some getting used to. New users are apt to spray the sink, mirror etc. It also takes up a fair amount of counter space. But, it does seem to loosen food in between the teeth, and the tongue cleaner is kind of neat. Whether or not it improves dental health, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I bought a WP-100 a couple of years ago and have used it happily ever since. However, just before the 2-year warranty expired, the plastic hose started leaking. I asked them if this was covered under the warranty. Being a cynic, I thought they&#x27;d say  &#x27;Of course the plastic hose is NOT covered,&#x27; but to my pleasant surprise it WAS covered and they shipped me a replacement part with no questions asked other than the serial number of my unit. My advice to WP-100 users is to make sure the plastic hose is smoothly coiled when not in use.</li>
    <li> Good product, and I got the best price from Amazon by at least $10.00. Product would be great if it was not so messy.</li>
    <li> received the waterpik and it works great at a very reasonable price. The price was 50.44 with free shipping.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested that I get a product such as this.  After reviewing everything on the market I chose the Waterpik Ultra.  It&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Great on the gums and really cleans between the teeth. Feels like you just got your teeth cleaned everytime you use it. Don&#x27;t crank it all the way up or you will end up with some bloody gums.  Tounge cleaner is worthless.</li>
    <li> The product was a good buy as it was a lot more expensive at stores around here...  Works well keeping my teeth cleannner..</li>
    <li> does  not  work sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik products for years and this one is the best.  The water preasure is excellent and it does the job.  I found it to be a good value given the price at Amazon.  I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I got this product because my son&#x27;s orthodontist \\&quot;required\\&quot; it. I had braces when I was young, but my orthodontist didn&#x27;t require this. I resisted at first, but relented after lots of complaining. The device works very well and gets out all the bits of stuff stuck on the orthodontic appliance. It&#x27;s quite easy to use with only 2 switches. The attachments seem spot on for getting all the nooks and crannies in the mouth. My only wish is that the device was more aesthetically pleasing. It occupies a lot of space on my bathroom sink and caused me to relocate the soap dispenser and the toothbrush charger. I also think that there should be a warning on the device about proper cleaning and handling. I am concerned that the wet spot in the device are great for growing bacteria if it&#x27;s not properly cleaned and dried after use. I shudder to think of it&#x27;s high pressure water jet shooting germs under my son&#x27;s gums.</li>
    <li> Our family of two has used this waterpik every night for about 2 1/2 years. Using water irrigation to supplement brushing and flossing has arrested my receding gums and given me a much healthier mouth. So I never again want to do without.    But - shouldn&#x27;t an appliance last more than two years? The water pressure became significantly reduced two years after purchase, and the appliance stopped cold after another six months or so. This seems like planned obsolescence to me, especially when you hear about waterpiks that have lasted 20 years.     This is not the kind of quality that keeps me loyal. I&#x27;m searching for another brand. I may buy another waterpik, just to keep us going. But I am on the lookout. Any suggestions are warmly welcomed.</li>
    <li> I just got this new Ultra Waterpik, so I can&#x27;t yet say anything about its durability, but my initial impressions are VERY favorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notably, this new unit is MUCH quieter than my last Waterpik.  The old one clattered like a jackhammer; this one purrs like a cat.  This alone may merit an upgrade, if you&#x27;ve ever refrained from attending to your morning oral irrigation for fear of waking a significant other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have noted that the reservoir on this model is significantly smaller than the reservoir on \\&quot;family\\&quot; Waterpiks, but it still holds 20 fl. oz. of water, which is the amount I used with my family model any way.  This is plenty to give your gums a good workout, believe me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturers have included a knurled grip on the jet tip, making it easier to turn the tip to the angle you need even if your fingers are wet, an improvement on the design of my last unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose on this new unit also seems to retract more neatly and easily than the hose on my old machine, and I appreciate the more compact footprint here -- the machine takes up less space on your sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, about my only compaint so far concerns the storage lid on top; it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a space to stow the tongue tip, but I have never used that one any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have gum problems, you need a Waterpik, and this is clearly an excellent model.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. All these flaws have been individually documented by others so I will just summarize them here:  1. Needs new head replacements more than once a year which often don&#x27;t work either.  2. More attachments come with unit than fit into its container top holder.  No simple explanation as to what each does best.  3. Most attachments fail to click in place even with new handle after a few months. No way to buy them individually.  4. Sprays water everywhere at any setting. You need to change clothes after using it and clean bathroom sink and mirror too.  5. Extremely noisy.  6. Hose too short, so you have to bend head down to use it. That defeats its purpose as your head needs to be in normal position for spray to be effective.  7. Container top often falls into the unit itself during use.  8. Earlier models produced better results with fewer problems. New does not mean improved here.  9. Dentists and hygienists keep recommending it by name despite all the above problems which they&#x27;ve heard many times from their patients and for which they have no solutions. Give no alternatives either.  10. Product ratings are misleading as most are written after the first few uses and customers assume if we use it more it will continue to work. Bad assumption.  11. Alternatives available through amazon all rate even lower.  12. Works great for some, but not for many and not for long.[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet performs well. The only drawback is the size of the water tank.  It is much smaller than past models. This is our third waterpik. The first lasted 12 years, the second 7 years. Used to be able to get parts from the manufacturer &amp; fix them. Not any more. I resent the fact that I have to replace the entire unit because the hose cracked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had this Waterpik for over a month and here are some of the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Significantly improves periodontal health by massaging gums and removing food debris below the gum line, thereby reducing the risk of gum infection.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Oral irrigation and water jet effectively removes more food particles between tight teeth and for those who still have their wisdom teeth than any method of flossing.  Flossing can remove much, but requires far more effort and time and may still leave particles remaining.  The water pressure can be built up over a short period of continuous several days of use to a setting of 8 or above.  Once at this level and continuing to use the Waterpik, the process of getting teeth clean is faster than any method of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Regular use will help in preventing the build up tartar and calculus of the teeth.  Some people through their saliva build up tartar on the front 10-12 teeth and the Waterpik does prevent this build up more effectively than any tartar control toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;4.  In each tankful, adding a cap full of regular Listerine, which has about 27% alcohol, keeps the unit clean by preventing possible build up of bacterial growth.  It also works as a mild disinfectant for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;5.  As the cost of health care in the US is increasing, dental health plan prices are either increasing or becoming secondary due to cost.  Using the Waterpik, you can reduce your visit to the dentist to once every two years, provided you don&#x27;t have other problems, and you won&#x27;t need much cleaning.  Many dental hygienists are abusive on a person&#x27;s teeth, not deliberately, but they simply can&#x27;t feel the pain and need to get the tartar build up off.  A typical dentist visit is between $50-$75 dollars that includes cleaning and is recommended at least once every 6-12 months.  By using the Waterpik regularly you can skip a couple of visits and save $100-$150 which more than covers twice the cost of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;6.  The standard tip followed by the orthodontic tip are the most useful. The toothbrush and tongue cleaner tips are not useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Construction is of cheap plastic and the unit will last no more that 2 years with regular use provided you don&#x27;t drop it or have hard water which may clog the pump.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Somewhat noisy and if you&#x27;re wife is talking to you while you&#x27;re using the unit, you can&#x27;t hear her.  Some may call this a \\&quot;feature.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Don&#x27;t ever touch the bottom portion of the unit or the black gasket on the unit. You will get bacterial growth on it.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Storing water in the unit is bad idea and once finished using, make sure the outer part is relatively dry.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Water is everywhere and it takes some learning to keep from spraying everywhere.  Don&#x27;t ever get the spray in your eye as its painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a good unit which is designed well and is effective for its purpose.  The price deserves to be closer to $40 rather than $50 based on the flimsy plastic materials.the orthodontic tip are the most useful. The toothbrush and tongue cleaner tips are not useful.

    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new Waterpik!  The price was right, and it was delivered exactly on schedule.    I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.  And I would recommend that they purchase  it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> excellent product...good design...nozzle resting plastic clip broke...fixed easily...still works day after day after 3 yrs</li>
    <li> I must have left some solution of hydrogen peroxide and water in the bowl and the rubber wheel in the bottom melted giving off its black color.  Can&#x27;t use it anymore.  It&#x27;s also pretty noisy.</li>
    <li> A good product, it cleans between the tooth, no more decayed food and no more foul odor from mouth. Best to add some warm water to the tank before you start if you have sensitive tooth. Let out the cold water in the line for a few second and you will get the warm water.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing.  I don&#x27;t like the way the floss cuts the blood flow to my fingertips as it is wrapped around them.  I don&#x27;t like sticking my fingers in my mouth.  I don&#x27;t like coming into contact with the bits of food and debris removed from between my teeth.  With the Waterpik, those issues are things of the past.  Dental visits used to be accompanied by speeches from my hygienist about how I needed to floss better.  Now my hygienist thinks that I floss daily.  The recession of my gums has actually reversed in the two years that I have been using the Waterpik.  I actually look forward to my daily routine with the Waterpik, as I love the way my mouth feels afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issues I have had are with the handles.  In about 3 years, I have gone through 3 handles.  The first handle failed within the first year, and Waterpik sent out a replacement at no charge under warranty.  The second failed several months later.  Both of these failed at the button that temporarily stops water flow.  I believe that the gaskets around that valve just don&#x27;t hold up under frequent use.  I no longer use that button to stop the water, and use the on/off switch instead.  The last handle to fail developed a small crack at the plastic connector on the bottom of the unit, which quickly broke clean off.  I ordered a replacement from Waterpik, and had it in just a few days.  I really don&#x27;t think that spending $8.99 on a handle once a year or so is a big deal.  The brush heads on my Sonicare cost much more than that, and have to be replaced more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cannot put a price tag on good oral health, and the Waterpik has been a great investment with noticeable dividends.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a water pik before. I did a little research before selecting this one and I am so impressed with it. It works really well and is small enough to not be in the way on the counter. The price was great as well. I wish we would have bought one long ago... I think it is a must buy if you have kids! But beware...it can get pretty messy. There is a learning curve for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought this back in February right after I got my braces put on because trying to floss with braces is a pain. It works great at getting the food particles from between your teeth and around the brackets and wires. I use it every night or if I&#x27;m home, after lunch too. I can&#x27;t wait for my next cleaning to see what the dentist has to say. I wasn&#x27;t much of a flosser in the past.</li>
    <li> The unit works well and adjusts to individual comfort. The hose and handle appear flimsey but work well. Some care is needed when first used or you will wet down everything around you.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best one on the market.  We have used this unit for many years.  My wife has one, and I do also.</li>
    <li> No leakeage from the tank (as seen on other reviews).  WOW my mouth feels so clean!  I love this!  I would suggest it to many.  I love that it stores the tools in the top too.</li>
    <li> The reservoir is too small and the horizontal on/off switch is not as convenient as the vertical switch on earlier waterpiks. This product comes with a whole array of tips that waterpik would like to sell replacements for but only one standard tip (contrary to the Amazon product descriptions which indicated 2 or 3 standard jet tips).  What this means is that if a family purchases this item the first thing they have to do is order extra standard picks for each family member at $5 each.</li>
    <li> Love this waterpik.  Only lasts about a year or two, but still like it. This is our third one.</li>
    <li> I was told by the dental technician about this product after she had me in the chair for an eternity cleaning the tartar deposits .I bought this on her recommendation and I am thrilled with the product.The price was right and free shipping was an added bonus. The price at the store I usually shop at was about $10 higher and they had sold out their stock of water picks.All in all I am pleased with the product and so are my teeth.  Marv C SE Florida</li>
    <li> the water pik works great!  My husband and my teeth feel cleaner.  It is very easy to use.  We have had other types of water piks but we llike this one the best.   We would like to get a water for traveling.  One that is run totaly on batteries.  i have searched and I can only find rechargeable ones.  When traveling that is almost impossible.</li>
    <li> Product is great, Amazon selling at an excellent price. nice and compact with all the water pics you could need I recommend. Slow in filling order. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested using a waterpic product for my back teeth that I just couldn&#x27;t get clean by flossing, I purchased this waterpik and it works superb, easy to use, my teeth feel so much cleaner. when I went back for my cleaning the dentist said that the back teeth were 100 per cent cleaner and no plaque build up.  Buy this product and you&#x27;ll notice the difference right away.  I love it.</li>
    <li> For years I have had problems with gingivitis, stemming from a lack of flossing. My teeth are very tightly grouped together and it&#x27;s hard and uncomfortable to floss. I always thought a water pik would be messy and a pain to use, but after a recent visit to the periodontist where the water pik was specifically recommended, I decided to give it a try. WELL, I am here to tell you that it is easy to use, and almost (dare I say it) FUN! I use it every night before bed without fail. I only wish I had bought one ten years ago BEFORE I began to get some bone loss. Using it has slowed down the progression (from years of smoking and not flossing), but I could have avoided some painful and costly periodontal surgery, and added another 20 years to the life of my teeth. So, don&#x27;t wait another day. If you don&#x27;t love it you can always return it, but I bet you won&#x27;t. I bought a 2nd one to take with me on (car) vacations, and as a spare since i know these things take a lot of wear and tear and burn out eventually. At this price, it was worth getting another. Check your local discount drug store and I bet they&#x27;re charging $10 to $20 MORE than Amazon, and the shipping is free!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik ultra water flosser at the recommendation of another user.  I just began with peridontal work and decided to upgrade my oral care by adding waterflossing too.  Although only having used for one month, I am very happy with this product.  I read reviews before I bought it -- and didn&#x27;t care much about noise (there is some noise) and other criticisms.  The Waterpik works and does what it is supposed to do -- I feel that my oral care is greatly enhanced by this product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son that has braces. Boy, the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is fantastic at getting all the crud that sticks to his braces and in-between his teeth. I tried it and love it, too! I have to go to the dentist every 3 months and my dentist made a comment that my gums were in the best condition they have been in in a long time! And that was just after a month&#x27;s use. Great value! You&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> Years ago, I owned a water pick, and found it OK, but when it died, I did not replace it.  So I have a basis of comparison to guide the review.    The good news:  This is improved over the ancient one that I owned.  The water tank is larger, the force of the spray is better on higher settings and the cap-storage compartment is a good idea (the probes use to be inserted in small holes and were exposed and prone to damage).  The probes easily snap into the handle and can he directed by a rotation dial at the lock-in base.    Now the bad news:  The semi-circular \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; shape does not match the right angle designs of most sinks, so it is not totally snug or stable. This is made worse by a tight on-off switch which can easily cause the machine to rock and teeter when you are trying to use it. This is mindless form over function.  Almost all the probes are useless for most users and are \\&quot;clutter\\&quot; what overflows the container if you keep them all.  There is no quick and easy way to dry the machine after use.    A little attention to these issues would improve the rating, but it is a good buy in any case.</li>
    <li> I had a Water Pick as a kid and bought one for my kids-it has awesome power, works amazing! It does take up a bit of counter space, but it&#x27;s like having your teeth professionally cleaned each time you use it! Leaves your gums &amp; teeth fresh &amp; clean!</li>
    <li> Excellent option for those who want to improve their gum´s cleaning or may have gum´s diseases; or like in my case, that have orthodontic devices.  As per my dentist´s comments, regular use of Waterpik flosser assures a much more healthy teeth and gums.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is my very first Waterpik.  It definitely makes your gums and teeth feel very clean but I came across one problem...Needs more power!  Since it was my first time, I did what they had recommended and started on the lowest setting.  I didn&#x27;t feel a whole lot so I switched it on the highest setting.  I did feel quite a difference with the water pressure but I still felt it was somewhat lacking.  I was expecting to have to work my way up to the highest setting but I was there my first time using it.  I&#x27;m a religious brush/flosser so I wonder if that has anything to do with it.   I did find it really helped with getting the back of those pesky wisdom teeth.  All in all, good product, just wished for a bit more power.</li>
    <li> Waterpit is an outstanding cleaning unit. The Pik does a great job cleaning between the teeth and cleansing the gums.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik came before the promised date in good quality. I am still learning to use it with different heads and angles.  Due to my weak gum I can only turn the power half way. I can feel the cleanliness after each use.  I believe this product is good for dental bridge, an excellent alternative for manual flossing if your aim is perfect.  I still make a mess after each use sometimes but it&#x27;s good trade off.</li>
    <li> The waterpik purchased was outstanding. There was never a moment of hesitation, where my wife  thought she would have to return it. She took it out of the box tried it, and it was just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> Good but do not use. Other dental devices more convenient.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.  I dislike using regular floss and find that I don&#x27;t floss like I should.  I tried a little hand held flosser with the disposable flossing heads but still had problems.    I decided to try this and I am so glad that I bought it.  It came with so many different heads.  I&#x27;m using the regular one, my daughter is using the orthodontic one and my husband is using the one for bridge work.  It&#x27;s perfect!    It&#x27;s not a whisper quiet operation, you can definitely hear it when someone is using it in the bathroom but it&#x27;s not terribly loud.  By the second time I used it, I had gotten the hang of it.  My daughter was extremely pleased with the results she got, since it&#x27;s usually difficult to get her braces clean.    There&#x27;s enough water in the tank to do your entire mouth and I&#x27;ve found that when it empties, I&#x27;m finished anyway.    Great product, wish it came with more than just one regular tip but I&#x27;m really happy with it and you can buy replacement tips at the Waterpik website.    As for how it flosses?  Excellent!  It does a great job, noticed a huge difference right away.</li>
    <li> As many others said, this is a worthwhile investment. I hope I don&#x27;t have to visit a dentist again in my life.  An amazing product.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik since about 1985 and this is with out a doubt the best one yet.  It  is much quieter than previous models and more compact.  I did not need  all of the extra attachments.  I like the fact that it is warranted for 3 years--my last one lasted 2 years and 1 month which exceeded the warranty period by 1 month.</li>
    <li> Purchased the item because my dentist suggested it during my semi-annual cleaning.  Since&lt;br /&gt; my teeth (crowns, bridges, etc), cost me more than my car, I took his suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in a timely manner and the first impression I got of it \\&quot;right out of the box\\&quot; was that it looked cheaply made.  It was flimsy and no doubt was not meant for rugged use. (and by rugged use, I mean being pulled on, turned on, twisted, by a few teenagers).  Tried it out, and worked as advertised, but as a few reviewers stated \\&quot;lacked serious power\\&quot;.  In all fairness to the manufacturer, I&#x27;m sure the power was \\&quot;turned down\\&quot; because of potential lawsuits.  Unfortunately, we live in a litigation society where suing is a way of life for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it after my usual brushing was beneficial as far as getting rid of hidden food particles, but don&#x27;t expect miracles, or use it to take the place of professional cleaning.  It is meant as a \\&quot;supplemental\\&quot; tool.  If you are an individual that takes care of his teeth, this is a great \\&quot;final touch\\&quot;.  Really gets to those places around the gum line where it is really noticeable if you \\&quot;missed\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I could see how it would be extremely beneficial for teenagers with braces or retainers, as those \\&quot;hard to get places\\&quot; hold plenty of particles of food.  I think it would be a \\&quot;must\\&quot; for them.  But use it with care, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;gorilla\\&quot; tested.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this Waterpik, I read some reviews.  A few discussed how the unit leaked water.  I figured those isolated problems and ordered it. The first time I tried it, water poured from the bottom and the water pressure was minimal.  On examination, I saw the hose wasn&#x27;t properly connected to the base.  It was either broken or incorrectly assembled.  I called the company. I was told that they would send me a new part that I could install.  I considered that, but I didn&#x27;t want to wait the five to seven business days they said it would take.  I wanted and needed one now.  I returned it to Amazon and purchased a different type from Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> This is a product everyone should have.  I did have one many years ago but decided I need to get back with it.  Not disappointed at all.  Many improvements since my old model.  I use it every evening.  I do add a couple of ounces of mouthwash to the water.</li>
    <li> I find this product ok.  The design is neat and easier to store than the older versions but I found the power to be just a little short of the mark.  Give it a larger reservoir and some more power and I would consider this water pik perfect, or nearly perfect. I have used this product for a while and my opinion has improved.  It is a good product.</li>
    <li> It;s much better and faster than flossing. Takes less than a minute. I don&#x27;t like the tip for the tongue. It doesn&#x27;t clean anything.</li>
    <li> This is the Waterpik to buy if your bathroom (near a sink) accommodates a plug-in one with a reasonable but not tiny footprint. The reservoir is plenty big (we never fill it or we would be there for a long, long time!) and the pump is quite powerful (we have the pressure adjustment set below halfway). The coiled tube reseats itself very nicely after use, and so far we have had no problems with it at all. It features a nice assortment of tips, though our hygienist has directed us to use pocket tips. I have recently acquired a five-tooth bridge and occasionally use the bridge tip instead. Both do a great job of cleaning food particles out of our teeth, even after careful flossing. And the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; action of the jet feels good on my gums!</li>
    <li> All in all, it should be a great product. Unfortunately I wanted to use it in Europe. Adaptors and converters did not work, and the device burned out, even though I checked on the internet about using it overseas.</li>
    <li> A little hard to get used to - squirts all over until you get the hang of it, then it&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> I struggled with an Oxyjet that lasted many years until the brittle hose finally split and was no longer functional.  After studying the available literature, studies, feedback, and recommendations of experts, I decided to purchase the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  I must report with all delight that I have seldom been so pleased with a dental appliance or any other Amazon purchase!  This is simply a magnificent machine!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik was terrific UNTIL it stopped working and seemed to clog up after a short period of time. MY husband tried strightening the cords going into device but nothing worked.</li>
    <li> Great product for all family members..even my 4 and 8 yr old kids loves this...it really cleans teeth much better than just brushing and mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpiks for a very long time because I don&#x27;t like to floss. This new design and all of the attachments, which I do not use, seem to be an improvement until I discovered that it has the same problem that caused my last one to fail (after several years). The line to the Pik is crimped at the juncture of the Pik itself and will break with use over time. Since this one is about 40% more expensive than my last one, I think that the designers could have done better.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Waterpik Ultra over 6 years ago to replace an unreliable HydroFloss that kept needing too many repairs. That first Waterpik was used 3 times a day and lasted 6 years before the tip-release mechanism broke inside the handle. I bought a new Waterpik to replace it.   Although the new unit looks identical there have been some changes. The old unit feels 3 times heavier than the new one and it&#x27;s pump was slower running and quiet. This new lightweight model has a new pump design that runs twice as fast and sounds like a jack hammer! It&#x27;s very loud. I find it very annoying, but since I have to use it for health reasons I just hope it lasts as long as the old one.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like the WaterPik because it actually helps the mouth be in better condition by removing pieces still left between the teeth EVEN AFTER FLOSSING and brushing and also removing plaque and helping your teeth feel smoother. When I&#x27;m done running the WaterPik all along all my teeth, then I hold the pik in front of my front teeth for a few seconds each, and when I&#x27;m done, my teeth actually feel smooth again, like I just had a dental polishing! This proves to me how the longer you hold the WaterPik to a certain spot, the more it removes. I agree with all the others who said the water tank is too small; I have to use 2 whole water tanks to complete my job (I keep a large cup beside the Pik when I&#x27;m using it so I can reach over to the cup and refill the tank with one hand while I pause the handheld part). In addition, I can see how they say the cord breaks prematurely, because it doesn&#x27;t stretch very far at all, and it keeps the strong tension on the curls in the cord when you try to stretch it to you. In addition, the machine vibrates and shakes the cord while you&#x27;re using it. I have noticed that with a little time (over less than a month), when I turn the unit on each day (even after my husband already used it an hour before me), I will have to hold the pik over the sink for the first few seconds to let it get the proper strong stream going first. Sometimes hardly anything comes out at first. This concerns me, that it could already be trying to break down. It didn&#x27;t do that at first. I am wary of premature breakdown of this item due to many others&#x27; occurrences, so we&#x27;ll just have to see what happens with ours. I had a WaterPik when I had braces as a 12-year-old, so I can tell you that they are making these with way less quality than they used to. I can see we&#x27;ll have to baby this. And we live in a medium- to hard-water area, so I&#x27;ll have to do monthly vinegar-and-water flushes to keep the hard water minerals from clogging anything and prematurely ruining it, also. If we do have a really bad occurrence with our unit (premature breaking), I will come back and add an addendum to this review. **************ADDENDUM 7/2/11: It turned out that we had a part failure only about 3 months after getting the Waterpik. The handheld piece started leaking after every use, at the point where the curly line enters it. Cust. svc. told me that is normally only a problem when there is constant stress or pulling on the line, but we keep the waterpik as close to the sink edge as possible and lean close to the sink when using it, and we angle the waterpik to make the line stretch out only minimally and with the least amount of pressure to it, so I don&#x27;t see how it could have possibly been our fault. I&#x27;m afraid it is just now a cheaply-made piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> It works very well its very useful &amp; it does it job very well which is very nice to find in some thing like this.</li>
    <li> My husband just had all his teeth removed. They put in permanent dentures. Basically they sit right on top of your gums so there is this really thin space between. Brushing will not get in there. But this does! It was recommended by our dentist. It looks exactly like the picture but a little more attractive. By that I mean...it looks more sleek and slimline when you set it up. My husband used it for the first time yesterday and was very impressed. He said that it was a stronger pulse than he expected and that it removed what he didnt even know was there. We can even share it as it doesnt touch the teeth! There were a bunch of fancy attachments that we havent really used yet, but its nice to know they are there. It doesnt take up much room on our sink so thats really nice. I like that it works and its inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Purchased 8 months ago. Used frequently. I add salt packets as recommended by some. I take care of it and rinse well after each use. Skip a night and my teeth and mouth definitely feel the difference. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement unit as pump on the unit bought couple of years ago stopped working. I use it every day along with brushing, flossing and tongue cleaning which I have been doing at least twice a day.    Great product to have for healthy mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for 4 weeks and it&#x27;s been running great! I like the pulsating action of the variable water pressure. I&#x27;ve read reviews that say it spills or dribbles water where the removable pik attaches to the handle. I don&#x27;t have this problem. I don&#x27;t however recommends Waterpik&#x27;s cordless models. The battery on the cordless models runs out shortly after the 1 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I have owned Waterpiks for almost 30 years and just received the Ultra.  The tips do not click into the handle and obviously the tips pop out when you turn it on.  Also if you don&#x27;t push the top water container firmly in place, it leaks all over the place.  I will call Amazon and Waterpik in the morning to resolve this problem.  It looks like it is a really bad design and I think I will try another Manufacturer.  I am an engineer for well over 40 years so you cannot say I do not know how to put things together.</li>
    <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break.  Mine broke within 2 days.  I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing everyday for years, but I was still getting plaque build up. My Dentist recommended a Waterpik and it&#x27;s really helped. Plus, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> For most of my life, I have been a dedicated user of Waterpik&#x27;s. Unfortunately, they seem to wear out faster with each model I purchase, and am hoping this won&#x27;t be the case with this latest one.  I did notice that the pressure is slightly lower than with my previous models, but it still does the job.  The reservoir is also smaller than I would like. Everything else is pretty standard and simple to use. I don&#x27;t purchase the deluxe model since it has too many additional features/implements that I don&#x27;t need. Reliability and simplicity work the best for me.</li>
    <li> We bought this unit to replace a 20-year old Waterpik.  This model has significant improvements over our previous unit in terms of features and ease of use.  We had it for over 2 months now and it performs flawlessly.  We did not found water leaks as reported in other reviewers.        Also the pricing at Amazon is much better than the retail stores including Costco.</li>
    <li> Directions concise and easy to understand.  Easy setup.  Great device friends have had very good luck with and terrific oral exams following daily use.    I hate to floss and this does a much better job to boot.</li>
    <li> this is great...used to floss for a minute or 2...now only a minute of this, teeth feels clean without the bleeding</li>
    <li> My wife and I decided to try waterpik as alternative to flossing. Seems to work well, and so far we have been using it daily.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the new water pik.   The price that we found through AMAZON  was the best price. And we shopped around. The arrival date, packaging and presentation of the item were top notch.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to floss your teeth. It is easy to use and its durable.  Cleans teeth and leaves my mouth feeling clean (by adding a small amount of listerine in the reservoir). Only take 2 minutes a day for a healthy clean mouth. Used it everyday for 2 months and still working great.         Came in a huge box, with several attachments, each having a specific purpose. Strongly recommend this product for people who rarely visit the dentist. Only bad thing is that the reservoir is a little small if you really want to thoroughly clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my dentist that I start using a waterpik so I purchased this one. Great price, great product and I use it everyday. This is the only waterpik I have ever owned so I am kind of partial to it, but I would definatly recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! had to have my wisdom teeth removed and was SOOOOOO hungry the day following surgery. I ended up eating Mexican food and the water pik came in handy to remove food particles from me mouth and \\&quot;hole\\&quot; where my wisdom teeth were. It kept an infection from occurring. I have only used it for 2 days but teeth and mouth are significantly cleaner and it worked well on my post op surgery mouth! LOVE THIS you should consider buying it, especially if you have or will be getting braces. SUPER CHEAP in price compared to products similar to it but it beats them in quality and ability in my opinion.</li>
    <li> good,  lots of options on pipette and speed (strength), can&#x27;t think of anything more.    bad side,   the cap is not well designed. often have hard time to put it back to position (it should be instantaneously and straight forward). also you can put all the pipettes in the top cap but fits loosely and easy to move off position.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is very effective to clean between teeth and below gumline (removes plaque and debris). In general it is much more effective than using string floss (however using string floss is still better than not flossing at all for sure). How much more effective this waterpik vs string floss also depends on your flossing technique, but even you are an expert flosser, I believe you will still see there are more stuff/food that will be removed by the waterpik. This will also improve your gum health as it is not only clean below the gumline but also by the massaging and stimulating the gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Waterpik Ultra comes with 6 different tips which each of them has its own purpose. The basic/classic tip alone definitely worth the whole package, and the additional 5 specialty tips surely adds more value. e.g. the Orthodontic tip will be very useful if you wear braces (3 times more effective than regular string floss). Don&#x27;t forget to use lukewarm water as using too cold or too hot water could be inconvenient if you have sensitive teeth and gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish more dentists push this type of flossing more (water flossing) because it works, and good oral hygiene will help your heart and your health in general. Please consult with your dentist about using waterpik/water floss (especially if you feel pain on your gum or your gum receding after using this). And once you start water flossing, don&#x27;t stop string flossing altogether if you are already string flossing right now (maybe reducing the frequency is fine). Again please consult with your dentist to see what&#x27;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Powerful water jet/pressure (very effective to clean food/debris between the teeth)&lt;br /&gt;2. Include 6 different tips for different purpose&lt;br /&gt;3. Water jet power can be controlled (1-10) so you can find your optimal water pressure&lt;br /&gt;4. Pause button on the handle&lt;br /&gt;5. Big enough water tank&lt;br /&gt;6. 3 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The water can leak from the bottom of the handle (solution: don&#x27;t refill the water tank until the next time you are about to use it)&lt;br /&gt;2. The wire/hose is a bit short (if you are taller than 6 feet+ you might need to bend down a bit or place the waterpik on higher platform)&lt;br /&gt;3. People says the jet power reduces with time (or gave up altogether). Having said that, I personally think it is still worth to buy this product even if it will only last one year (if less than a year, I will find alternatives), as having good teeth and health is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidarta Tanuthe water tank until the next time you are about to use it)  2. The wire/hose is a bit short (if you are taller than 6 feet+ you might need to bend down a bit or place the waterpik on higher platform)  3.

    <li> We got this for our 11 year old daughter. She just got braces and an expander, which can really catch a lot of food. She&#x27;s not blessed with the sturdiest of teeth, so I opted for the Waterpik to keep her teeth free of food particles. The price was great, and with all the different attachments, everyone can pick a tip and take advantage of it. She had no problem getting the hang of it and I&#x27;m hopeful it will keep her teeth healthy for the 2 years she&#x27;ll have braces. This flosser includes an orthodontic tip for brackets, but she uses the regular tip for cleaning the expander (which honestly looks like a medieval torture device on the roof of her mouth). If you&#x27;re putting out the thousands of dollars necessary for braces, $45 to keep their mouth healthy is a small price to pay.</li>
    <li> Works well. and does the job. The pressure adjustment  i OK the on of switch is little awkwardly placed  The case fo rthe different attachments is  poorly designed</li>
    <li> At the age of 69 I got braces. Over the years my lower front teeth had shifted, and as a result, for the second time in my life I wound up as a \\&quot;metal mouth.\\&quot; Orthodontics technology has changed alot since my childhood, but one thing that hasn&#x27;t is the annoyance of having a horizontal wire running in an arc around your mouth. It prevents ordinary flossing.  Sure, there are work-arounds, but most are time-consuming and annoying.  The solution was the Water Pik, which is fast, effective and a great advance in itself over the model I used years ago. Plenty of water power, sturdy construction and all in all, a good tool to minimize the annoyances caused by the braces.</li>
    <li> Nice adjustments, good overall size (small) compared to the older unit it replaced.  Plenty of pressure ... I use it on about 8, not sure I&#x27;d want to go all the way to 10.    The only thing that buggers me about it is that it does not have enough \\&quot;spaces\\&quot; in the handy cap compartment to hold all of the tips it comes with - it&#x27;s one short - that&#x27;s kinda silly.    Much quieter than my old waterpik.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the previous version of the waterpik. At first I noticed that I was running out of water before I finished. I found that having the setting a little lower uses less water and actually provides enough water pressure to do a good job. I like that this updated model makes less noise and that all the tips store in the lid. I do wish that the lid fit better on the water reservoir.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny spent on it. I tried a lot of methods to get rid of Gum bleeding (may be Gingivitis). Nothing worked as good as this. Cleaning once every night keeps me away from dentist. You have to try this if you are planning to see a dentist for any kind of dental problems if you suspect it is due to poor cleaning. I can say this is better than two times brushing in a day.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before, but I ruined it by putting mint mouthwash in with the water.  I always put a little listerine in the water and was out of it so I put some mint wash in that was my wifes --- don&#x27;t do that -- it gums it up.    This is a great waterpic, but it comes with too many tips that I won&#x27;t use and only one regular tip that I use. I had to buy spares.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month, and it works just as described.  Much easier and less time consuming than flossing.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the Waterpik. I got it because I just got braces and it&#x27;s much harder to floss my teeth now.  The Waterpik Ultra has a special attachment for braces which is very easy to use. My orthodontist has complimented me on the dental hygiene.  He said I was doing an excellent job of keeping my teeth clean. Ordering through Amazon was simple. I had the Waterpik into a week of ordering it online.</li>
    <li> As of this date my wife Catherine is using the waterpik three times a day and I have asked her if she likes it.  Her response was that she would like to get more water pressure.  Other than that she is pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik on and off since I was a child.  They have always been great for getting the bits out from between teeth (and under hard to reach places such as a bridge).  Our old one sprung a leak (they do tend to wear out after awhile) and we got this new model.  The design is nicer and sleeker.  The extra attachments are hidden away in the lid and the handle has a swivel feature to direct the spray which makes it easier than the old model.  A Waterpik is also perfect for those who aren&#x27;t so fond of flossing.  I do floss these days but there were years when I used the Waterpik alone to keep my gum health.</li>
    <li> After years of struggling with regular dental floss we decided to try out what our dentist has been recommending all along - the Water Flosser.  It really works.  My wife and I find ourselves using it more consistently than we did with dental floss and the results have been better.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my family overseas and they love it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] After a month of use I have become accustomed to the operation of this appliance. I use #9 setting and find it works well but does not eliminate all flossing. Occasionally some food may remain between teeth. It does improve the gums in color and feel. I recommend this waterpik.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with this but am keeping it because I do like cleaning my teeth with a water pik.. The problem is that the water adjustment even tho it goes to 10 it is just not strong like the other one that I bought yrs ago that looks just like this .. I think one other review said the same thing ..They did something in that the adjustment is just not very strong on these anymore...</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and still running great. More convenient than regular floss.</li>
    <li> I just recently started getting into the good oral hygiene habit.. Have been to the dental office at least 8 times this month fixing my teeth up because I let them slip away for 2 years and I hadn&#x27;t flossed my entire life until recently. I can say this is the best $50 I&#x27;ve ever spent... Ever since I bought this product my breath is amazing along with brushing 4 times a day. I floss as well as use this machine and my gums are as healthy as they have ever been in my entire life!! Definitely worth it! On top of regular proper brushing and using this machine your breath will improve drastically!</li>
    <li> This product works effectively on my bridge.  I took the suggestion from another review,   and add a bit of mouthwash to the water.  I like the clean feeling!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Waterpik for about 6 months now and I finally had my first cleaning since I&#x27;ve made this purchase. My dentist said, \\&quot;you&#x27;ve been keeping up with your flossing\\&quot;....that was music to my ears!! I never stopped flossing, it&#x27;s just that I seem to have a lot of tartar/plaque buildup than the average person (so my dentist tells me). I was brushing my teeth 2-3 times a day along with flossing 2-3 times a day and still had buildup. I decided to look on Amazon and see what they had available and decided to give the Waterpik a try...and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Him complimenting me was confirmation that the Waterpik works! I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have hand the portable unit and I wasn&#x27;t happy with charging it all the time. This unit is a good size and  very powerful( you can clean in between bathroom tiles)</li>
    <li> this product is compact, well designed, lightweight, efficient and appears to be durable.  this will be the third water-flosser/waterpik which  I have purchased in the last 4 years.  I decided to spend a little more money at amazon.com to try a higher-end model in hopes of getting a   longer lifespan out of this unit.  Time will tell.  Richard E. Lindner</li>
    <li> Always like a water pik. This is a much better design that my previous pik. Works for me. I have recommended this for kids with braces.</li>
    <li> Replaced five year old WaterPik - hose broke.  New unit only has one regular nozzle - old unit had two.</li>
    <li> Bought this gadget for my wife. She loves it! Has already reduced build-up and may even lessen the amount and frequency of \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; at the dentist. If the wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser mostly because my son and I have braces and flossing has become a nightmare! I read the reviews and thought it was the most sensible alternative (but I admit I purchased it in disbelief).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received it promptly and I have to say it worked. I used it the first time and actually flossed afterwards to see if there was anything left that the Waterpik didn&#x27;t get...and my teeth were \\&quot;picked clean\\&quot;. There wasn&#x27;t a hint of plaque anywhere. I was pleased with its performance and that it met and exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that its very much a \\&quot;plug and play\\&quot; type machine. There is a little card to tell you how to start it for the first time and after that (which is super simple), it stays simple. No fussing. I do really like the coiled cord the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; is on...it slides in easily every single time, no messy wires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there are a few things that I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Be prepared for a mess! And a big one at that until you learn how to move your lips around the thing. I kept trying to close my mouth (natural reaction to water spraying everywhere) and also tried looking at what I was doing (normally, you look in the mirror when you brush, right?)...what a mistake. This sends water flying every which way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to keep your head down close to the sink with your mouth half open with water running out of it (that makes a difference and it says to do this in the directions, but your natural instinct usually is the opposite of this). I have to confess that this is a little uncomfortable for me...but the upside is that you have \\&quot;flossed\\&quot; every crevice of your mouth (especially your braces) in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you think your kids are going to pick this up without making an even bigger mess - be warned. My 12 year old son had even managed to inadvertently spray the bathroom window (across the room) and had water all over the counter, etc...everything was wet. Its taken time for him to get better with it, but its a slow process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The directions say you can&#x27;t use it for more than 5 minutes every 2 hours or it may burn out the motor. Keep in mind that it takes me two minutes to run through a cycle with the machine on its highest setting. But if you have purchased this for your family to use, you can&#x27;t use it back to back between kids without risking damaging the waterpik altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t whiten your teeth or remove stains. I have a sonicare toothbrush that removes the grit and stains from my teeth. The waterpik removes plaque and food particles. It doesn&#x27;t really remove the gritty feeling from the back of your teeth that isn&#x27;t close to the gum line...remember though, we only use the braces attachment and so maybe the other attachments work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I did try the tongue cleaner...it really seemed like a waste and then you have to change attachments. I know its not a lot of work to change attachments, its just a matter of convenience and ability. Its inconvenient to change the head and it really doesn&#x27;t seem very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for younger children. I have kids from age 3 up to twelve and I would think that my 10 year old would be okay with this, but not my 8 year old (a little uncoordinated anyway). I don&#x27;t think it would hurt them, it would just be a mess and you cannot look in their mouth and do it for them like you might if you were trying to brush their teeth for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the waterpik did what I wanted it to do - clean around our braces. I would still buy it in a heartbeat all over again because of how quick and efficient it is...but I&#x27;ll only be using it while we have orthodontics. Hope this helps someone else who has the same troubles flossing as we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE****** March 15, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to let you know that after all this time, we are still using our waterpik. It has served us well. No problems, easy to use...saves your sanity when it comes to flossing:)</li>
    <li> During my dental visit it was shown that although I was flossing occasionally, it wasn&#x27;t enough to prevent bleeding when the dental assistant flossed my teeth. She recommended that perhaps I try a water pik; and that the results are usually better than flossing, because it strengthens the gums which then prevents the bleeding. Well this has worked. I have been using this product for about 2 to 3 weeks and it&#x27;s so easy to use. I like it so much better than flossing!</li>
    <li> I asked my dentist her opinion of the Waterpik Flosser. She said they were really being pushed in dental schools recently, because they work every bit as well, if not better, than conventional flossing. In my experience, the Waterpik Flosser works well, but it&#x27;s messy. It never fails that I end up with water running down my arm, so my advice would be to use it prior to getting dressed for work. I alternate between this and regular floss. While regular floss isn&#x27;t as messy, you never have to worry about running out of floss with this thing. No excuses for skipping flossing now!</li>
    <li> Had one of these mucho years ago and never really used it.Thought there may have been vast improvements but not really.My dentist recommend this in addition to flossing but I got to tell you that flossing which is essential does the same as this. This will go on the shelf and won&#x27;t get much use.</li>
    <li> Prior to receiving this Waterpik, my flossing habit was very sporadic.  Since receiving the Waterpik, I floss every night.  After flossing the first few times with the Waterpik, I would follow up with dental floss just to see if I was getting everything with the Waterpik.  Now I simply use the Waterpik and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my dentist used a version of this during my last cleaning. I figured for the price it would be a good deal. It seems cool, modern, and easy to set up. But honestly It&#x27;s not high-pressured as I thought it would be. I don&#x27;t really feel like it cleans well. But after I used it I have a really clean feel in my mouth. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but it seems to do a better job than how it feels. I can&#x27;t really complain. Hopefully it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I had a previous Waterpik model, but got leery of using it because of how loud it was.  My dentist told me I should use it more anyways, but the hose broke.  I experimented with [[ASIN:B0028OV2S0 RediBreeze Oral Irrigator]], but that did not work with my bathroom faucet at all (water went everywhere). So I decided to try out the Ultra Water Flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely quieter.  It&#x27;s still loud, but I won&#x27;t fear waking people up now.  The previous model also had problems with water leaking if any was left in the basin, and that has also been fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six different pics come with this model -- from a tongue cleaner to a Pik Pocket to Plaque Seeker tip.  The variety is somewhat useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other reason I didn&#x27;t like the previous version: five years ago, it used to hurt.  I wasn&#x27;t flossing enough, especially in one spot.  All cleaned out now.  Flossing and the Waterpik don&#x27;t hurt healthy gums, so if they do, let your dentist know about the trouble spots.  I had an unpleasant 2 minutes in the dentist chair, but the mild soreness I used to have has been gone ever since (\\&quot;if you keep up the flossing\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irrigators work better than flossing, and there is a spot I&#x27;ve been warned about, so I&#x27;ve switched over.  And I&#x27;m quite glad that Waterpik has improved their product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  It holds enough water to thoroughly get the lingering pieces of food which hang around between teeth at gum line, underneath bridges and around dental implants.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I use it every time after I brush which is about three times a day.  Brushing is good, but doesn&#x27;t always get tiny pieces lodged in hard-to-reach areas.  This pik is much better than my previous water pik which just crashed from all the use.  This one holds plenty of water so no need to refill.  The old one didn&#x27;t hold enough water to complete the job.  This one is a lot nicer looking than the old one.  Has several attachments for particular types of cleaning and a cute holder for them which serves as a lid when pik is not in use.</li>
    <li> I have been using Waterpiks since 1979.  My first one lasted about 20 years.  Since then I have gone through at least 6 more.  The pumps just don&#x27;t last on the newer ones.  This is the first one that I have used with this shape/style.  It produces a weaker stream and is not as effective at dislodging debris between the teeth as the older style.  That is why I gave it only 4 stars.  The only thing I like better about this style is that the hose and wand are easier to \\&quot;hang up\\&quot; than they were on the older design.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik water flosser is adequate and performs as expected.  The only difference noted,(compared to my old Oxycare), is that the pressure has to be turned all the way up to the highest number 10 to get the same pressure I got on my Oxycare at number 7.</li>
    <li> Love it, still working great.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist to help me take care of my teeth during a lengthy and very expensive bite reconstruction project.  Since the beginning of this project a year ago nine implants and many crowns have been placed into my jaw bones and onto my original teeth.  There are times when partial plates have to be put in temporarily to allow for bone grafting to heal.  Using this piece of equipment has been the only way to clean my teeth and gums well.</li>
    <li> After I got water flosser, I like to use it, and I like to clear my tooth. It&#x27;s worth to buy!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik does what I wanted it to do.  I have the power/pressure dial set at about  half way, so it has as much power as I need  and more.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2QMJ8PBV7IFTK]]UPDATE: 1/24/2014 - Waterpik has a new model, the Aquarius Model WP660C, [[ASIN:B00HFQQ0VU Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser, White Satin Base with Crystal Clear Reservoir]]. It&#x27;s been updated with a few new features. It has a gum massage feature and  to help you pace your flossing it pulses at 30 and 60 seconds. It runs for 90 seconds on a full tank at the highest pressure setting. The WP-100W has a clunky storage space on the top for storing the tips and the WP-660C does away with that while allowing the storage of two tips between the reservoir and body of the waterpik. It is much lighter in weight (not sure if that&#x27;s good or not) and is attractive in a waterpik kind of way. You may want to consider checking out my review of the WP-660C before making your decision on which to get. I actually prefer this Ultra WP-100W in spite of the new features of the Aquarius WP-660C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this Waterpik Ultra WP-100W water flosser. Prior to this I owned an [[ASIN:B000F54AQA Interplak Dental Water Jet, 1 each]] and I was quite happy with how long it lasted. That one lasted 3 years with daily use and started to leak at the handle so I decided it was time to buy a new one. Unable to locate the same thing locally, I decided to purchase the Waterpik WP-100 and so far I find it superior to the Interplak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik operates on 120V, 60Hz only.&lt;br /&gt;Measures at the base 5.5\\&quot; wide, 4.75\\&quot; deep.&lt;br /&gt;Cord length is about 54\\&quot; which is quite generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a small footprint so doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space. The Interplak didn&#x27;t take up much space either, but the Interplak was very light and it was more difficult to remove the water reservoir than with the Waterpik. The Waterpik is heftier and feels more substantial and better built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also quite surprised at how quiet it is. Compared to the Interplak which made a LOT of noise, this is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the water reservoir has more than enough capacity for me and I seldom fill it all the way to the top. Usually about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way to get a thorough amount of flossing action. With the water reservoir filled completely and the pressure set to mid-range it will operate for 2 minutes 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large variety of tips are included, most of which I never use. But if you have orthodontic appliances, then there are tips that you will appreciate for getting around the orthodontics. there is only one standard tip however so if you are not the only person using the machine, you&#x27;ll have to purchase some additional \\&quot;normal\\&quot; tips for other users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the pressure setting set to 7 and it&#x27;s plenty powerful enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a really handy button to temporarily stop the flow of water and I also really like the rotating tip feature that lets you easily manipulate the tip position while its in your mouth without having to do contortions with your hand and arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a winner. Now I just hope it lasts for years. I&#x27;ll update my review if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: August 12, 2012 - My WaterPik is now almost a year old and is still working perfectly. I use it every day. No leaks, no odd noises. It&#x27;s doing its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: May 19, 2013 - Still going strong. No problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: January 24, 2014 - Still going strong. No problems.k the water reservoir has more than enough capacity for me and I seldom fill it all the way to the top.

    <li> An excellent product that really cleans well between the teeth, since it has more water pressure and faster pulsation to dislodge trapped food between the teeth and plaque along the gum line.</li>
    <li> This is the third of these devices that I have purchased.  After a period of approximately 2-3 years  I don&#x27;t keep records), the tubing breaks and the water sprays the room.  If this weren&#x27;t the \\&quot;only game in town\\&quot;, I&#x27;d be happy to find a vendor that makes a device that lasts.  I suppose this is an excellent example of American capitalism requiring repeat consumer spending for the same thing over and over.</li>
    <li> I grew up with the waterpik. I decided it was time to revisit the best way to keep my mouth fresh &amp; clean. For me, the highest setting of 10 was needed. I find only the basic flossing head worked the best for me, the tank held sufficient water &amp; overall the machine did a great job.  The instructions mentioned that there should be no space between the handle &amp; the flossing head where it inserts.....if there was I should call the 800 #. There was, so I called...I was told the instructions were wrong. That there should be a space. Ok....  There is some clean up afterwards....no biggie for me; I would like a wee bit more power behind the wash (I have very healthy gums) &amp; it could be quieter.  This model is easy to use. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A must for good dental hygiene.  Enables you to quickly clean between teeth after eating.  Cheapest price out there too.  It&#x27;s $64 at Walgreen + tax.</li>
    <li> On a quest to improve the health of my teeth and gums, I went on amazon and began my search.   Two things seemed to make sense to me. One I have and love, was a product called showerbreeze... which is basically a fantastic invention, somewhat new and super easy to use. It hooks up to your showerhead and is basically similar to this item, but you do it in the shower.. and use the water from your pipes. Easy, no mess, no refilling, and whenever I shower, I use it. It gets rave reviews.    The next thing is oral-b power flosser, which I have not tried, but people say it is easier and better than regular flossing, especially if you have no space between teeth and the floss gets stuck. Supposedly, the vibration helps the floss get between teeth easier. I am ordering one today.  Hope this helps you decide what you want to buy.   On a side note, I am not affiliated with any product, nor do I make a penny on any of this. I just wanted to spread the word on what I found.  thanks</li>
    <li> I had two of the cordless waterpiks - bought for about $30 - but they only last 1 year or less,  So I switched to this bigger model and its working great.  I dont think I will have the same problem as I did with the cordless because the problem with those is that the charger eventually wont work because of the corrosion.  Since this is plugged in all the time, this should last a lot longer.  Can&#x27;t live without my waterpik.</li>
    <li> We have had two battery powered Waterpiks and both  faied after a few years. They also did not have the water pressure that this unit has .</li>
    <li> Although yes, the concept is rather simple- just spraying water with force to rinse food particles out, it works amazingly well, especially for people with gums issues like I do. My gums bleed whenever I floss. Waterpik actually gives me an alternative solution to that issue. The manufacturer is also great for making a top quality product. I have been using this for a year and my dental health has improved a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this waterpik for two years now and I love it. Pressure is great (I leave it on 5 -- I can&#x27;t imagine turning it any higher, it&#x27;s quite strong). I am an adult with braces, this has been invaluable, I can&#x27;t imagine life in braces without it and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it once I&#x27;m out of braces as well. Flossing is great, but this is the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone that has or will be getting braces, it also works great just for someone who wants that extra clean feeling after brushing and flossing. The water tank holds enough water to rinse your whole mouth.</li>
    <li> The water pick works good. The water reservoir is large and easily filled with a glass of water. And the water pick shuts off easily too.&lt;br /&gt;However the tubing wore out in  4 years and is not replaceable.</li>
    <li> Love the interchangeable heads/tips it comes with - even one for people who wear crowns or braces or are in for a periodontal treatment. Gives you an ultra clean feeling and fresh breath - especially if a little Listerine/mouthwash is added.</li>
    <li> Water-piks do a fantastic job, not only in removing food particles from your teeth, but also in helping maintain healthy gums.  Would never be without one.</li>
    <li> I have to point out that the most popular review isn&#x27;t quite accurate for what I just received:  my WaterPik Ultra came with ONE standard tip (not 3); plus tips with a tongue scrubber, a tiny 3-pointed brush, a small brush, a regular brush, and the \\&quot;high-pressure\\&quot; tip.  This serves ONE person as shipped, although additional tips are surely available.  There&#x27;s room in the top cap storage area for 4 more standard tips, assuming you store all the fancy tips elsewhere.  I agree that the pressure is less than my old model delivered - but set on \\&quot;10\\&quot;, it&#x27;s certainly an acceptable/effective strength.  I like the way the tip snaps and locks in (releases MUCH easier than my old WaterPik - push the little button on the side of the handle and it pops right off); and can be turned with the knurled knob.  My old unit didn&#x27;t have the shut-off button on the handle - I like this new feature!  But the best part??  This new unit is SO quiet; and takes up far less room on the counter.  I feel that the reservoir is sized perfectly.  The hose going to the handle should be a little longer - if you are right-handed, you will want this sitting on the right side of the sink, for example!  My old Waterpik was well over a decade old, and I used it almost daily.  My hygienist praises my dental health with each checkup - so I know a water flosser does what it claims!  I have faith in the quality of WaterPik, and think the newer design is nice overall.</li>
    <li> This Water Pik arrived in a very short time. I am always pleased dealing with Amazon.com.  The item was exactly as described, the price was right on, and it arrived in just a few days.  Amazon never has disappointed me in this purchase or any other I have ordered.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace my broken flosser.  It works just fine...better than the other company&#x27;s product. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the first oral hygiene product I&#x27;ve purchase of this type but it does everything I thought it would and more. I&#x27;ve always been a flosser but this helps me do a even better job. I plan to leave here with all my own teeth.  Very pleased with the ease of use and ease of purchase.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my dentist early in the year and I waited until Thanksgiving to buy one. I was greatly impressed after the first time using it. It not only rinses the food debris out but also massages the gum. The Waterflosser and Sonicare take excellent care of my dental hygiene everyday. Read the manual carefully and the machine should last for a long time by proper use.</li>
    <li> My dentist recomended this product to me so I bought it. It comes with different attachments which are very useful for different applications. For the most part this product is allright, but for me it has two major drawbacks. First tehe whose, it should be atleast 12\\&quot; longer, as it is you have to have the unit right by the zink and so gets messy. The second is that I feel is really underpowered, I feel that it does not have enough pressure to really clean gum pockets, which is what I got it for.</li>
    <li> Excellent, well thought out design. Has all the needed pressure adjustments.  Right size water container and unit is not too big. Good storage for the wand.  All this from a company who stand behind its products.  On my last water pick  (not this) they replaced the wand even after the unit was out of warranty.  I can highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> I like this device. It works better than floss in my opinion. It can be a little messy if you&#x27;re not careful though.</li>
    <li> First of all, if you are planning to buy this one to replace regular flossing then don&#x27;t.  This is not a replacement of regular flossing only to be used in addition to it or if you have braces and cannot use regular floss.  Its harder to use than a regular thread floss. You have to bend a lot into the sink to avoid the water spilling everywhere in the bathroom. As a result you can&#x27;t see the mirror. It gets messy sometimes even if you are careful.  Its too loud and too much vibration. I don&#x27;t understand why it has to be that loud or vibrating.   It also occupies lot of space on the sink counter. The power button is at an inconvenient location, which sometimes hard to use.  I could live with all the above shortcomings but it doesn&#x27;t clean well as advertised. It couldn&#x27;t remove food particles lodged between my teeth in few occasions where I had to use thread floss.  I bought this after reading so many overwhelming positive reviews but it didn&#x27;t work well for me and I don&#x27;t recommend unless you have braces or other issues that prevents you from using regular floss.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have TMJ and it very hard for me to floss the conventional way.  The waterpic is a great alternative for old fashioned flossing.</li>
    <li> I have no problems whatsoever with this product.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance.  Of course, the full review will not be possible until I visit my dentist to see how the plaque issue has been dealt with.</li>
    <li> Hey, it was my diligent (very diligent) dentist who recommended this Waterpic when I complained about the hand-held version I was using.  With this model they got it right: no battery to re-charge, an array of \\&quot;picks\\&quot;, including one to clean your tongue, and my dentist&#x27;s favorite, the Pic-Pocket for getting under hard to reach gum lines. The price is right too, at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was totally surprised how well this product works. As it says, it only takes a minute to water floss my teeth after filling the little reservoir, which is also quite easy. Even after I have brushed and flossed, the water pick still removes some particles that were missed. When I am done, my mouth feels so clean, much like it does after a professional cleaning. It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of the Waterpik which lasted 5 years so I just had to get another one. Received the Waterpik and used the old transformer to convert the current for use in Australia but wanted to double check with Waterpik if this was the best/correct transformer. Although they advised this product would not be suitable for use in Australia, I have been able to use the Waterpik and am very pleased with it. Arrived in a timely manner. All round very happy. So for anybody living in Australia they advised to make contact with the Australian distributor for more information/purchases.</li>
    <li> I bought my Waterpik when I had traditional metal braces installed on my teeth nearly 2 years ago (still have them on). I&#x27;ve used it at least twice a day every day and I love how easy it is to keep my teeth and braces clean when used in conjunction with an electric toothbrush. Sadly, there was a small kink in the hose that recently wore through and sprung a leak. Something inside is also leaking now, so I need to buy a new Waterpik. I wish it had lasted a little longer, but overall, I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth and will willingly buy another.</li>
    <li> I love my new WaterPik Flosser.  It does a terrific job.  I have short stubby fingers so it makes flossing so much easier than trying to reach way back using dental floss.  Great product.  It does take a little experimenting to find the right pressure setting.</li>
    <li> This waterpick comes with many different picks and my teeth and gums feel so clean after using it.  One of the picks actually gets under the gums to flush out trapped food.  I have had other waterpicks, but this one is so much easier to use and clean.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended I purchase this product to help my gums and to prevent potential gum disease. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and I can already tell that it&#x27;s making a difference. It&#x27;s easy to use. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it takes up some precious bathroom counter real estate. A good trade off though.</li>
    <li> After shopping  around, I selected this model upon favorable reviews. So far It works great and the price beats competitors.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a month.  I got it because I just got braces for the 2nd time along with a rapid palatal expander which is basically a sheet of metal that goes against the roof of the mouth that separates the jaw in 2.  Anyways, brushing doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  I have a Sonicare but I needed something that can hit the roof of my mouth and get rid of the stuff on the braces themselves - especially the tie ins and joints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it is tedious and I can always just open my mouth in the shower and let the water spray that way.  I use it a couple of times a week to keep my gums in check and to make sure I don&#x27;t have a bunch of particles stuck around the braces and between my teeth.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Very adjustable.  Different pressures.  I use the 2 or 3 settings.  Any higher and I just wind up spraying water everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;2) Compact unit.&lt;br /&gt;3) Gets your teeth, gums, and braces VERY CLEAN.  I mean it is cleaner than using a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;4) Cost.  Wish I had known about this earlier when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;5) Destroys dental floss.  Not even a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;6) Various tips for what you want it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I hate how the water sprays everywhere.  I have my head in the sink with a small mirror above the drain and I still wind up getting water all over the bathroom mirror, floor, counter, and clothes lol.&lt;br /&gt;2) Wish the device was more cylindrical and narrow so it could fit on the counter.  I usually keep it on the toilet top when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;3) Wish you could adjust the spray&#x27;s width so it could spray wide and not just a pointed stream.&lt;br /&gt;4) Top of device only holds 5 of the 6 brush tips so I keep the one I don&#x27;t use in the box.  Makes no sense.&lt;br /&gt;5) Wish hose was longer so I could just use this in the shower so I wouldn&#x27;t get water all over the sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a MUST buy if you have dental appliances or braces.  Why spend $5000-6000 on braces and be worried about spending $40 something on a device that will make your teeth even better?Why spend $5000-6000 on braces and be worried about spending $40 something on a device that will make your teeth even better?</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I had periodontal disease, with quite a few 6mm or more pockets in my gums. She wanted me to undergo &#x27;deep cleaning&#x27; aka root planing. The thought of that made me sick, not to mention the horrendous cost involved. I bought this water pik and I used it every morning for a year, and added anti-bacterial mouth wash to the water. My teeth feel really clean after every use, and I usually notice bits of food getting washed away that my toothbrush couldn&#x27;t get. Anyway, a year later I went back for my dental check up and there was no sign of periodontal disease any more, my gum pockets were all within normal healthy readings. Seriously, I am not making this up,  I just want to tell people what a con deep cleaning is and how good water piks are. Maybe, it wouldn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it certainly did for me. It&#x27;s got to be worth trying before submitting yourself to intensive gum laceration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with leaks or anything with this model. I don&#x27;t take the reservoir off to fill it though, I use a cup, which means the seal never gets disturbed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. It was a great buy and the Waterpik works great. Better than expected. It has many accessories and the presure monitor is amazing. I have to keep it at a  Level 2 it&#x27;s so powerful.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Works as it should. I have not had any problems with it. I have been using it daily for the last four months. I use a sonic tooth brush which cleans pretty well, but the Waterpik still rinses out small particles that were left behind after brushing. Powerful enough. I don&#x27;t think I would want the spray any stronger than it is.</li>
    <li> I heard this product from some friends, after using that, have to say, it is convenient and defenitely useful. So I am very happy with this purchase. : )&lt;br /&gt;It is very simple design, not really high technic stuff, but very smart. Another thing is that I will be happier if it can lasts long, haha, now it&#x27;s 2nd month, and it still works well. Hope can be much longer.</li>
    <li> I love it, it works great and has a lot of pik choices. It takes awhile to use up the water. I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> comes in handy on occassion.  Water squirts all over the place!!</li>
    <li> Much more rewarding than picking or flossing your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;My last one was satisfactory for 3 years but this one is made to last much longer!&lt;br /&gt;There is a 3 year warranty, I&#x27;d be happier only If I could have that kind of warranty&lt;br /&gt;for myself!  Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser (Purchased on April 4, 2012)</li>
    <li> the waterpik is as described and works great, a quality item. this is the second generation in my family to use one!</li>
    <li> Bought this a month ago. Excellent price. I immediately purchased additional spare heads to have should they be needed. The cost for spares was almost the same as for the unit. I do love the unit. Where previously I always was forgetful in brushing and especially  flossing, I now use the unit after almost every meal. It is so easy to get the food bits from between teeth. If I have only one criticism, I wish the power range was  stronger. I use it at the maximum and feel I would like a bit more powerful water stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said my gums looked better than they had in years. I had only been using the unit for 2-3 months.  He said, \\&quot;You must be flossing more regularly.\\&quot; I nodded (as my mouth was open) a yes.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is an excellent dental hygiene device that&#x27;s easy to use, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik Ultra is moderately sized, and fits on my small bathroom countertop well.  It&#x27;s also fairly attractive looking, so it&#x27;s not something you have to hide away when company comes.  While made of sturdy feeling plastics and feels well assembled, when I took it out of the box the pressure control dial popped right off.  It was simple to snap back in place, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it.  On the bottom is large rubber feet so the Waterpik does not move around the countertop while in use.  Included with the Waterpik are a handful of specialty tips, but I use the standard one, as I&#x27;ve found the others either don&#x27;t seem to do much or are for conditions or dental appliances that I don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operating the Waterpic is simple.  Attach a tip, fill the reservoir with water, select a pressure setting, and turn it on.  On the handle is a button that you press and hold to stop the flow of water briefly.  Make sure you hold it firmly, because as soon as you let up the pressure, even slightly, the water starts flowing again.  Since I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for years I prefer my on a high-pressure setting, but if you&#x27;re just starting out, or have sensitive teeth, it&#x27;s nice that you can adjust it to a very gentle pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second version of this machine.  The first one I bought about 6 years earlier, and recently it developed a crack in the hose and would shoot water out.  Still, the old machine never gave me any other issues, so that&#x27;s why I decided to buy the same one again.  While the new one looks identical on the outside and has all the same functions, it is much quieter in operation, and that&#x27;s a very welcome upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all...gets below the gum line better than floss and does it gently and quietly.</li>
    <li> My son loves it! He has braces. It is fun and easy to use. It came with five different tips for different applications. It does not take too much counter space.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old waterpick from the 70&#x27;s.  This one is okay, but not nearly as powerful as the old one.  But it&#x27;s also not as large.  The old one was bulky and difficult to store, but this one is like a little kid.  I miss the old one, but it sure did last a long time!</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. I started using a waterpik on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and so far it seems great. I can feel it cleaning my teeth and gums and it&#x27;s even dislodged a food particle or 2 that I had missed while brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the waterpik itself. There have been no leaks or other problems. Only interesting note is that it comes with 6 tips but the top of the pik only has room to store 4 tips. So one tip is left on the waterpik and the last one is just sitting in the box.</li>
    <li> Had a wonderfully fun deep cleaning recently, woohoo periodontal disease for me. So i bought this waterpik and it&#x27;s so easy to use and my gums definately are getting less horrible. So at least it appears to be working and feels great to use. 5 start for you Waterpik!</li>
    <li> Flossing made easy.  Definitely does the job!  More than worth the money.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a month now and it works great.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  I add a little mouthwash to mine.  Rinse it from time to time though.  Run some clean water through it so it doesn&#x27;t get a sticky build up internally.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of dental water jet applicances, but have not purchased a Waterpik unit for many years. This unit is great! The jet is powerful, the shut off button makes using this appliance very easy to use and the performance is super. I would like a bit more length on the hose, but the overall design is a great improvement over other Waterpik and non-Waterpik units.</li>
    <li> My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of years ago and her oncologist recommend a Waterpik because her immunity was very low after chemo and he was concerned about infection from a toothbrush. The good news is mom is cancer free but continues to use the Waterpik. She frequently remarked how much she really liked the Waterpik, so I decided to get my own. My only regret is that I did not get it sooner. This is probably the best teeth and gum cleaning device that I have used. I have an Oral-B and a Sonic care and I think the Waterpik is superior to both.  I am so impressed that I have been recommending it to my friends and family. My favorite two beverages are coffee and red wine and that creates a lot of staining. Using it twice a day at its highest setting has visibly reduced the stains and my gums no longer bleed when I floss. I love it.</li>
    <li> My husband was asked by his dentist to get a water pik. I&#x27;d had several when I was growing up &amp; they were weak &amp; didn&#x27;t do anything that I could see, so I was VERY reluctant to buy it.     This one, however, has WAY enough power -- I only use it on \\&quot;6\\&quot; and it&#x27;s enough to choke me if it squirts down my throat!  (If children use it, I suggest to start out on \\&quot;1\\&quot;, for SURE!)  Has a GREAT feature -- you push the button on the handle to stop the water when you need it to (so you don&#x27;t spray yourself or the bathroom with the water!) ;)    I experimented . .  . I brushed, flossed THEN used the waterpik and it  STILL found stuff!  Awesome -- highly recommend.    PROS:  STRONG stream, easy to use  CONS: a bit loud (esp when you&#x27;re holding the button to stop flow) -- has to be NEAR the sink (cord on wand doesn&#x27;t go very far).</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife and she loves it. Takes a little getting used to, she has accidentally shot me across the bathroom a couple of times with it. She has the power at about 1/2 way which is plenty of water flow. After I purchased it I found it at Walmart on clearance for $10 cheaper, oh well.</li>
    <li> It was okay but hardly use it.</li>
    <li> We give it an overall 5 star rating.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  High pressure jets are very effective.    A couple minor observations:  The flip lid on the tool compartment could be a little easier to open.  Also, sometimes the entire tool compartment falls down into the water reservoir.      We still consider this a very good product overall, especially with the great pricing from Amazon.  Free shipping is also appreciated.</li>
    <li> Does better than flossing.</li>
    <li> At first, this product took some getting used to (the jets are no joke), but after a week I was used to it and I actually looked forward to using it. It really does a good job getting the hard to reach back teeth. I tried flossing for a while and hated it. This does a great job and is much easier than flossing. It&#x27;s well worth the price I paid for it. I am looking forward to going to the dentist so he can give me some props!! Be careful not to spray yourself in the eye with the jets like I did...</li>
    <li> We are using this from the last months and its very easy to use, my daugter is 5yrs old and she can handle everything. Recommend this product for everyone.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.    Now I just need to get into the habit of using it daily.</li>
    <li> Had Water Pick&#x27;s at my house since they first came out in the 70&#x27;s.  They have all been good but this one is the best.  And the price... go figure how they can keep it so low.  Sturdy, Quiet, Easy to use.  What more can I say?  I own 2.</li>
    <li> Dental assistant recommended this item. It works great. Provides a pleasant gum massage and removes particles between teeth that brushing leaves behind. The great results it provides encourages using it regularly. Definitely a beneficial addition to good dental hygene. Make sure you start out with a low to medium setting until you find the right strenght to prevent any irritation of sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Waterpik doesn&#x27;t need advertising. This is the best you can get for your gum. This is the 3rd machine I have in the last 15 years. I use it everyday with a smile.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of dental work, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of \\&quot;water jets\\&quot; in my life.  They generally last only a year or two. So far, this one is the best yet.  It&#x27;s heavy, so it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;walk\\&quot; when being used.  It has a lot of water power (keep it low!). The water reservoir holds more than enough for several trips inside the mouth.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We have had the Waterpik Ultra for almost two years.  We were apprehensive because we had gone through 3-4 dental irrigators (Braun) that had combination irrigator and toothbrush over the years.  Each time the hose would leak and we had to buy whole new units.  The last Braun unit had very weak pressure, just bout useless, so we started looking for a new irrigator.  The Waterpik has worked well; the pressure was more than adequate, we only use about 4-7 setting. Only problem was accasional leaks from the reservoir, which could be corrected by reseating the rubber valve.  A week ago the tubing started leaking below the handle and sprayed water all over.  However, this time Waterpik has a replacement part! We ordered the Handle assembly kit ($9) and at the same time a new Reservoir ($11) from Waterpik.  These came within a week and the unit is working like new.  Five stars for working well and having replacement psrts!</li>
    <li> just bought this waterpik,initial thoughts were very positive   * nice big water tank  * adjustable water jet is great   * small and compact   * even the legnth of the water hose is ok   BUT i read of the leakage of the base/tank so i thought i would not fill the tank up each time  but fill the tank with a glass to save wear and tear on the water \\&quot;connection\\&quot; seal   .........but alas only after a few days there is a puddle under the waterpik   seems like we can send a man to the moon, but we can&#x27;t make a waterpik leekproof</li>
    <li> After having to replace my two previous Waterpiks for leaking hoses (they would become brittle and break), I was extremely happy to see that the hose and pik are now replaceable.  The machine is much, much quieter than the previous ones.</li>
    <li> The WaterPik works as advertised. With the special orthodontic pik it cleans hard to reach areas under braces for adults, something you cannot achieve either with flossing or with the sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very good , use it periodically, works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t refer to this Waterpik with its model number, WP-100. That&#x27;s what it is. (they&#x27;ve since changed the name from &#x27;professional&#x27; to WP-100)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Waterpiks over the years, and finally broke down an bought another after years of doing without. As far as their usefulness as a dental device, I think they&#x27;re great. My dentist doesn&#x27;t think that highly of them, but after paying him $5000 for dental surgery, maybe he just wants to assure himself of continued business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t floss much, and I&#x27;m not that dedicated toothbrusher either. So when I use the pik, and there are always some food particles dislodged by it, even after flossing, I figure it must be doing some good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this model goes, it works as expected, but I don&#x27;tr find any improvments over the model I had 30 years ago. From the picture it looks bigger. So it has a smaller footprint than I expected, but the reservoir is also quite small. It&#x27;s just big enough for a cursory cleaning without having to refill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure is quite a bit lower than older models. I don&#x27;t know if there is a legitmate reason for having a lower pressure, or if it&#x27;s a matter manufacturing costs. I&#x27;d like a stronger jet for my preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose that connects the handle is way too short. You really need to keep the unit right next to the edge of the sink, and bend over. Again, I find no reason to do this except cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it comes with several tips (30 years ago, there was only one flavor). Tounge cleaner, pick pocket, orthodontic tip, and plain vanilla. I can&#x27;t say that any of the new designs adds anything to the operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly would call this unit &#x27;professional&#x27;. It feels like it will have a limited life, and is hardly what I would call robust. I think a more apt description would be &#x27;Compact Basic&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 12/2/2006:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Older WaterPiks used to have pressure fit tips (and worked fine). This has a button on the handle to release the tip, and it is located right where your thumb would be when holding it. The tip is constantly popping out because of this design flaw. With the short hose, 16oz capacity, weak pressure, my disappointment with this unit is only growing. I wish I could find a 25 year old model which had none of these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 01/10/2007 - If I could, I&#x27;d reduce my rating of this unit to 1 star. The designers must have been on vacation when they released this thing. The handle has a knurled collar, which you&#x27;d think could be used to rotate the tip, but it doesn&#x27;t. The tips are not keyed, so they won&#x27;t necessarily turn when you rotate the collar. As I said, the release button for the tips is in a place where it&#x27;s easy to press inadvertently. You can&#x27;t turn the unit off and on with one hand due to its light weight. The hose is too short. The reservoir cover holds the extra tips, and is not convenient, nor do I trust it to keep the reservoir protected from ambient germs or bacteria. I really wish I could find one of the old models, which had none of these problems, so I could toss this one in the trash. Don&#x27;t waste the extra money on this one, or if you have a old broken one, get it repaired instead of buying this thing.t where your thumb would be when holding it.

    <li> This is a great oral irrigator.  It has 10 settings, much more than most, and easily fits on my vanity.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I picked up one of these little gems several weeks ago when the handle on my old one started leaking all over the place. I called waterpik to find out if there was anything I shouldn&#x27;t use in it- trying to make it last.  They suggested not using any sodium based mouthwashes, and diluting everything else by 50%.  I also found out I could get another handle shipped for my old one for seven fifty, which I did (and now have a backup).  Anyway a few things about this new model.  The power is 39 Watts, not 100 as someone else mentioned.  Waterpik says at full stream it&#x27;s about 25% stronger a jet.  I actually did a comparison in the bathroom of both by shooting the jets across the room, and the new one definitely hit the wall with a tighter more forceful stream. Anyway, my mouth was actually sore the first time I used it on the highest setting, but fine after that.  My girlfriend noticed the same.  The stream adjustment is on the base versus the handle for the old one. The volume of water this one holds is significantly less then the older model. But the water storage area does have a lid which holds most of the attachments- none of which I have ever used. So far no major leaking problems, but I noticed if the handle is placed lower than the base ( mine sits on a high shelf in the bathroom) water dribbles out of the handle  (with power off)- like when I start using it. I don&#x27;t keep water or any liquid in it when I am not using it. It also seems like the thumb button which interrupts the stream while held in has  started to stick slightly.  Other than than it&#x27;s working well so far.  For people that do have a problems, I would call the company before returning.  They seem fairly decent to work with.</li>
    <li> My fault actually. I tried the wrong AC voltage amplitude on the machine and it immediately short circuited so I don&#x27;t know if it works.</li>
    <li> This is great!  Fits easily on the bathroom counter, adjusts so that various members of the family can choose thier pressure intensity--</li>
    <li> I wish I would have gotten this sooner. Just went to the dentist and had a great check up. No more lectures about flossing!!! I do this everyday unlike flossing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to aid in better dental hygiene and it certainly fills that role. I use it once a day and keep it at the middle (#5) setting. It&#x27;s great when eating certain foods or spices that tend to get trapped right at the junction of the tooth and gum, where it&#x27;s a super thin film almost. It can be gross sometimes seeing the bits and pieces fall into the sink. I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s ability to remove tarter or anything of that nature as my dentist hasn&#x27;t indicated that I have such problems. I think this is a good thing to have for preventive maintenance, so to speak. If used in conjunction with flossing, mouth wash, and good brushing, it can offset or prevent most if not all dental problems. It can be a little messy at first, but once you get the hang of it water doesn&#x27;t splash all over the place. I read a review that mentioned mold/mildew and the way to prevent that is by making sure the reservoir is empty, as well as the tube. Lift the machine, extent the tube all the way and let it drain. I flick it on for a second to pump out any remaining water. Periodically running hydrogen peroxide through the machine at full pressure is a good idea as it will help to sanitize it. I find the tongue cleaner pretty useless, the orthodontic tip not useful to me as I don&#x27;t have braces, and the pick pocket tip not all that helpful. I have used the brush tip a few times on the low settings but primarily use the jet tip. All in all a good thing to have and well put together and easy to use. Made in China.</li>
    <li> I researched all modles and decided on this one. It is everthing I hoped for. The price was very good and with free shipping it was the best offer I could find. I&#x27;am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This is great at cleaning between teeth -- so much moreso than flossing. Other pros are that it actually fits on my narrow sink ledge, and the in-lid storage for extra tips is very handy.    Cons are a really flimsy appearance and feel, and an overwhelming smell and taste of plastic, a possible indication of higher-than desirable levels of Bisphenol-A.  Often, the flimsiest plastics are the highest in BPA, so it is perhaps cause for concern.  I hate to think that what I am doing to improve my health in one area is compromising it in another.    As for the pressure-setting dial, I found the lower settings emit a mild trickle that is so weak as to be virtually useless.  For anything less than 5 (on the scale from 1 to 10), you are prbably better off simply rinsing your mouth and swishing water between your teeth without the device.    It is also not \\&quot;silent,\\&quot; although it is definitely not loud. Anyone in the next room could certainly tell if you are using it, although they probably won&#x27;t be disturbed by it.    Still, it&#x27;s a keeper. At least until the day it is done in by its own flimsiness, or somebody comes out with a stainless-steel model with a declared BPA-free hose and tips. Now that would be a winner!</li>
    <li> I have contacted WaterPik for a replacement handle three times, and each time the new handle breaks within two weeks.  Water leaks (pours!) out of the connecting point between handle and tip, and also at the release button  --so much that you lose all pressure.  I&#x27;ve spent 12 weeks trying to get a fully functional model, and have given up. I am now returning the whole unit to Amazon, but have had to deal with their \\&quot;30 day return policy\\&quot; problems to boot.  I should have just returned the unit when the first handle gave out.  Meanwhile, I picked up a HydroFloss from my dentist today, and it beats the socks off of the WaterPik.  A bit noisier, but better built, better jet action, and larger tank capacity.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist had been after me for years to buy a water pik, but I&#x27;d always resisted because of all the negative comments I&#x27;d always read about them. Well, when this item came out, I finally relented, because it seems to have fixed most of the problems that previous models had. I&#x27;m glad I waited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels wonderful to use! I never imagined it would feel so good! I have teeth with almost no spaces between them, so it feels amazing to me to feel jets of lovely warm water rushing between them! My gums feel like they&#x27;ve treated to a \\&quot;gum spa!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about this particular unit is that it has a well-designed removable section on top WITH A LID that keeps your glass wands CLEAN and protected when you&#x27;re not using them! That means that no one else&#x27;s toothpaste cast-offs or spit or urine or whatever will splash up to contaminate them when they&#x27;re not being used, yet they are convenient to get to when you&#x27;re ready to use the pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speed/force of the water is completely adjustable. I usually use it at just a 2 or 3 setting (out of about 10.) The noise level is okay - not loud enough to wake up anyone in the next room. The flexible water hose is nice and long, so I have enough freedom to aim it adequately and move it around. The hose coils nicely for storage into the little space under the wand holder in the front of the unit. The water tank is an adequate size to do my whole mouth in a fairly relaxed manner, although it will need refilling if you have the jet at a higher level of speed/force, since it doesn&#x27;t attach to the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any complaints, it&#x27;s only that the glass wand is a little tricky to put in securely in the holder until you get the hang of it. Once you do, it&#x27;s easy as pie. Also, the whole water cleaning thing feels soooooo good that I hate to stop! That&#x27;s a complaint I never imagined saying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I definitely recommend this water pik as one that is intelligently-designed, looks good and does the job well!ly-designed, looks good and does the job well!</li>
    <li> cute in design and appearance &lt;br /&gt;much more powerful than the previous version borrowed from my friend, so be careful to increase the power level &lt;br /&gt;no leakage found, which is what we worry most before the purchase according to other reviews</li>
    <li> This Ultra Dental water jet has better features than the original Water Pik.  I was happy with the original until I broke the end pulling it out of the holder.  There&#x27;s no replacement for it.  This model comes with 3 ends, has an eject button so you don&#x27;t have to struggle it out, is quieter, has replacements if needed. And the power dial is on the body and not on the part where your fingers rest so you don&#x27;t inadvertently change the water strength.  There seems to be 1 of 3 reviews of the original where the motor stops working.  I hope that isn&#x27;t the case with this model. I&#x27;ve had it a month, so far, so good.  A good water pik.</li>
    <li> For me this is an upgrade from a much older Waterpik.....and it is smaller, quieter, easier to use - and best of all does an even better job. My dentist has commented on my improved gum health!</li>
    <li> This handy machine cleans gum lines and teeth with ease. A bit messy at first if you take the time to actually read the directions you can keep from having most problems.  As one who over the years has had sensitive gums, the use of the water pic has greatly eliminated this issue. The multiple heads included give it great versitility, and allow other family members to use the machine also.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest appliance for dental maintenance. It&#x27;s amazing how it manages to remove minuscule particles that lodge between the teeth. Flossing just isn&#x27;t enough. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase this long before.</li>
    <li> Pros:  No Dripping. Quiet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  A bit inconvenient that we have to remove the top with the tips on it to fill the tank.  I wish there was another place to store the tips.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works nicely.  My dentist recommended it and I like it.  Even after brushing and flossing I find that when I use the Waterpik more small food particles are removed from the gum line and between teeth.  I think it makes for healthier gums too.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has plenty of pressure.  I found too much, until you get used to it.  You can turn it down and over time turn it back up as your mouth adjust to it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a nice product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this water jet.  I have used other models that just do not have the punch that the WP-100 Ultra does.  There are variable power levels which is great if unit is used by a family.  The force of the jet at Level 10 is nice and strong and does an excellent job.  My teeth feel as good as they do after a dental cleaning.  As a result I find myself wanting to use it 3 to 4 times a day just to enjoy that squeaky clean feeling.  I highly recommend this item and have purchased additional units for family.</li>
    <li> it has great power and that&#x27;s where the compliments end!!! it leaked from day one, but i figured i could deal with that because it did work as advertised. it is [was] very loud, but i could deal with that because it worked as advertised. after about a month the unit stopped working all together, i am very disappointed, it is now in the city dump..</li>
    <li> I got this product ~ 2 weeks ago, and I have to admit that I wish I knew about this product a long time ago.  (note, I also have dental braces right now).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pro:  &lt;br /&gt;- great product for dental hygiene &lt;br /&gt;- unclogs \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; food particles easily &lt;br /&gt;- different levels of water pressure to suite everyone&#x27;s preferences &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Con: &lt;br /&gt;- bigger volume on water tank (I have to refill at least once every use) &lt;br /&gt;- seems like the tip tray could be easily knocked over and the glass tips could break if that happens. (maybe add a hinge to secure the cover to the body?) &lt;br /&gt;- [a very minor point] the yellow tip does not fit in the groves in the tray &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, there is pretty much no other improvements I can think of for this product. Maybe somehow design even better storage for the tips, so I won&#x27;t accidentally knock the tip tray/cover over and break all the glass tips inside (haven&#x27;t happened yet, but I do take caution every night).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;all in all, an *excellent* product if you want to invest in your dental health! I have not shopped for replacement tips yet, but I hope they are not too expensive either!</li>
    <li> I own a Conair water jet. I decided to buy this one for my extra bathroom. This waterpik has a much stronger \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; than the Conair. I love the fact that I saved $10.00 over my local store and paid no shipping! The extra tips are a really nice bonus.</li>
    <li> just had three root canals -- my new dentist all but demanded I get the water pic --- it&#x27;s amazing how much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; it removes AFTER I&#x27;ve brushed with my electric toothbrush ---     I can do very well without any more root canals -- hopefully, this product will do the job</li>
    <li> This model is about 10 bucks more than the WaterPik WP-70 but it is a lot more value for the money.  The design is much better - no leakage.  Also, there is no need to remove the reservoir and invert it as a cap every time the unit is not in use.  The motor is stronger; setting it just halfway past full power is strong enough to keep the teeth and gums clean and healthy. It also has more attachments, although the standard jet is the only one that will most likely be in frequent use.  If you care for your teeth and find flossing inadequate, \\&quot;power washing\\&quot; the teeth after brushing is the best alternative.  If you have no dental insurance, the cost of this unit is just a fraction of what you are going to spend on a typical trip to the dentist.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use. Comes with numerous attachments so more than one family member can use it. We live close to the Water Pik company here in Fort Collins but still used Amazon to make the purchase.</li>
    <li> It is a better design, more features, has a nic lid on to keep dirt out.  Overall, it is the best so far.  It is worth every single penny spend.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> this worked well with daily use for 8 years until the tubing split. The tips were replaced once</li>
    <li> I am a 2nd time Waterpik purchaser. Last model I used for 6 years. This model is new &amp; improved in all aspects Except for resevior capacity, I fill this unit twice for exceptional cleaning. Very quiet. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have it set to get under and clean gum lines.  I do not use it at its full setting.</li>
    <li> Been a regular user of Waterpik for years now and have own several units.  All worked fine and older units lasts about 3 to 3 years then it either gets real dirty or has to clean the black stuff out of the hand jet handle with fine brush or swab.  Using it with mouthwash reduces the life of the product, i.e. the plastic seems to get brittle and break in time, especially the coiled tube, which is why I purchase this latest product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job at cleaning and as a replacement for flossing, although additional flossing can still be helpful.  It can get to areas that flossing can&#x27;t like the front and back gum line where the floss can&#x27;t seem to wrap around completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new W-100 unit is very quiet compare to the older units.  Quiet is good, as it now does not disturb my wife as much when she is sleeping.  The jet on the new W-100 unit seems to be more focused and stronger as I have to put it into #5 setting versus almost full dial for the older units.  The control is also at the base unit versus the older units where the stream power setting was on the handle.  So now the high pressure is off away from the coil tube, which is where the plastic wears out.  So maybe the unit will last longer, albeit you still have to keep it clean from accumulating black stuff.  I am assuming that the crud is dirt and bacteria buildup from standing water.  The stuff is between the removable nozzle and the rotating handle part.</li>
    <li> My husband and I purchased this waterpik after comparing prices/reviews from various websites.  My daughter has braces and we wanted to be sure she was cleaning thoroughly.  It comes with several attachments which are suitable for cleaning braces.  My daughter actually uses it without me constantly reminding her, so that is saying something!  It does make a watery mess on my daughter&#x27;s face and counter, but that seems to be the case with any of these types of products.  It will be interesting to see what the dentist says at her next appointment.</li>
    <li> I got this in house yesterday, and used it right away.  I found it easy to set up, and easy to use.  Good results so far, and like the way my mouth feels&lt;br /&gt;when through.  Seems quiet like the reviews said, and with warm water mixed with Scope, I rather liked it.  It definitely leaves you feeling like you have flossed well.</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik W-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet to replace our old Waterpik that had lasted a number of years.  So far, this one is working great!  I use it at the highest pressure; it cleans as well as the old one.  I really like the smaller size.  The new container holds plenty of water for my usual daily use.    Amazon has provided their usual great customer service.  The product was delivered earlier than expected with no issues.  The price was also competitive.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a recommendation from my dentist.  Works really well to clean between teeth and gums.  This product will still remove things from your teeth even after you have brushed.  This in combination with a sonicare brush get your teeth and gums very clean.</li>
    <li> Since I began using a water pik (first the portable model, and now this one), my dental hygenist has had a lot less trouble cleaning my teeth.  I love the convenience of this unit, and the way it makes my mouth feel very clean.  The first couple of times I used it, it tickled a bit, but I got used to it by the third or fourth use.  It also caused bleeding the first several times, but that too stopped after several uses.  The unit is easy to keep tidy, and isn&#x27;t an eyesore.  I&#x27;m most often using it at full power now; this is sufficient, but I wish that I had the option to go a bit higher.  As for those who say it makes a mess, I&#x27;ve not found this at all -- once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll almost never have an errant spray or splash.  I love how easy it is to refill the reservior.  I sometimes use mouthwash mixed 50/50 with water (they advise that some solutions can shorten the life of the unit, so I always run plain water through afterwards).  I love my W-100, and recommend it to anyone interested in maintaining good dental health.</li>
    <li> The best feature here is the variable pressure, it does make a difference, in fact the instructions tell you to start out at the lower settings to get used to it. I also find the pause button on the wand handy. The tounge scrappers went into the drawer as they are basically useless. Unit doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, noise wise it&#x27;s got a hum, but it&#x27;s not invasive.</li>
    <li> Waterpic Brand has always been tops with me!  This product is just another of their fabulous waterpics!!!  It&#x27;s worth every penny and I know you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  It does a great job of blowing water between teeth, under bridges, etc.  You can&#x27;t help but have clean teeth!</li>
    <li> Before I purchased the Waterpik Ultra Dental Jet my gums were in pretty bad shape. My dentist informed me that my gums were bleeding, which is a sign of gingivitis. I&#x27;ve been brushing, flossing and using mouthwash but it didn&#x27;t seem to clean my gums as well. I was puzzled and discovered the Waterpink Ultra. After reading positive reviews about this product I decided to opt for the best model. In the beginning it was a bit messy with water getting all over the place...  I haven&#x27;t experience  any leaking issues with the device that other users have been experiencing. I found that the tongue cleaner was useless. However, I do like the fact that it has a deep clean head to clean in between the teeth. I also notice that pressure levels 1-5 were pretty useless. The water pressure was really weak and didn&#x27;t massage my gums as well on those levels. I recommend starting at level 5 and work your way up to 10. I suggest if you want a refreshing feeling, mix Listerine with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Waterpik Ultra for about a month already and it seems to do wonders. My dentist definitely noticed the results almost immediately. I would recommend the Waterpik Ultra to anyone... You and your dentist will appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks since the &#x27;70s,and have replaced the worn out ones.The new one,purchased in April,is the best.It&#x27;s a pleasure to use,and has been perfected.I have found that using the Waterpik,means no more six month visits for teeth cleaning.Of course,if you miss your dentist,you can drop in for a social visit,but just think how your wallet benefits!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace the Ultra Cordless Waterpik.  If you have a choice buy Ultra Dental Water Jet.  It is more powerful because it is plugged into an outlet.  I saw this model in a store and decided it would be a good replacement and I enjoy using it twice a day.  I have not used all of the \\&quot;tools\\&quot; that are included.  If you are a beginner, you will soon learn to not look in the mirror while using--this is a \\&quot;heads down\\&quot;  piece of equipment.  I was happy to obtain this item from Amazon as part of their rewards program in conjunection with their VISA card.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks with excellant results.Also it is very well designed.</li>
    <li> It performs as claimed and saves time trying to get the thick floss string between your teeth. I will use for 3 months before next Dental exam and will know then if my gums are stronger. So far it performs as advertised and leaves a fresh and clean feeling to my mouth.</li>
    <li> It was suggested I get a Waterpik by my hygienist because of a problem with some crowns.  It has made such a difference.  I was already a flosser and this just makes it even better for my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product does everything the information mentions; however, it fails to mention how messy it gets when using it.  The force of the water shooting out and hitting your teeth makes the water go everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The only thing negative I have to say about it is that it is a little difficult to use at first. The water pressure is so strong that you have to learn to control the device, or else you&#x27;ll have water everywhere. After a couple attempts it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my first waterpik for almost 10 years. While it&#x27;s still working perfectly after a couple of spiral tube replacement, I bought a second one. I suppose it may not last as long as the first one since now it&#x27;s almost half the pirce, but it&#x27;s pretty good. Only one tiny flaw is that the tank is a little bit small.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  My first one leaked badly so I was without one for a while waiting on my new one.  I missed not having it.  My dental hygenist likes it as well as I do.  I wish they would last a little longer, but its still a great product.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised, easy to use, powerful, effective in the aid of good gum/teeth health care.  Was recommended by my dentist and he was right.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by my periodontist.  It has remarkably improved the condition of my gums.  Does a great job in removing food particles that flossing misses.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  I hope it will help me improve the condition of my mouth.</li>
    <li> Waterpik doe not replace traditional Floss. I did throw it away after 6 month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wearing braces, it may be a very good option.</li>
    <li> It shoots water to get all the food particle stuck between your teeth. It&#x27;s especially useful around crowns and bridges.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and my dentist approves.</li>
    <li> this machine really gets the gunk out of your teeth. I should have been using this thing years ago, maybe I might have saved some teeth. My only beef with this machine is that they should have put a longer hose on the handle to make it more flexible.</li>
    <li> This is a nice compact unit. It doesn&#x27;t have the power of my old unit but it is adequate. What I like most is the compact size which doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the vanity.</li>
    <li> Purchased this almost a year ago after my old waterpik finally died.  The new model has a slightly smaller water reservoir and I&#x27;d like a little more water capacity.  And I think that Waterpik lowered the water pump pressure and increased the flow.  The old Waterpik had a really sharp water stream and this one is a little duller.  I run it at full blast which is adequate.  A little more pressure would help the toughen up the gum tissue.    This gets only four stars because Waterpik use to have more water pressure and a larger water reservoir.  There&#x27;s room for improvement with this model.  Otherwise, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I have not used this, but both of my children have and they love it.  It is much easier to clean their teeth and braces with this product.</li>
    <li> The product is great. It represents a tremendous improvement over the 7-year old model that was replaced. However:    I have one complaint about Amazon&#x27;s Webpage on which, in bold type, I was advised that the Waterpik item qualified for free shipping. When I then clicked to order the item I was directed to one of your suppliers: Allergy Be Gone, and was charged $7.41 for shipping. If this isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;bait and switch\\&quot; operation, I don&#x27;t know what is!!! For my limited budget, I have a resonably good purchase history with Amazon.com and am  very disapointed that your oversight of web-based operations does not prevent this sort of Customer manipulation;this bait and switch has  ruined your reputation, in my opinion....  James Ashton,   jcajr@connectwireless.us</li>
    <li> Feels badly designed.&lt;br /&gt;Button to stop water outlet is wrong, should be button to eject jet of water.&lt;br /&gt;Faulty after 4 months.</li>
    <li> Had a Water Pic years ago and wanted another one.  This one is so much better.  Easy to use and more adjustments.  Much beter design than older one and with more attachments, tooth brush and tongue cleaner in addition to cleanng piks.</li>
    <li> It does manage to remove stuck food from areas where the floss is unable to reach. For me I had to switch between different nozzles to obtain the best suited for my teeth. If only I had this device a few years ago, would have saved me cavities and dental visits / expenses.  I also use the water pressure to massage the gums.   The end product is a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
    <li> No surpirses. It works as expected. I feel clean and fresh after I use it.  I only wish the resevoir is a littel bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Within only a few days of my waterpik purchase, the pump motor failed.  The return went smoothly, and a replacement device was sent.  Unfortunately, after only 4 months of once-daily use, the device that holds the tip in place stopped working, thereby rendering the waterpik unusable and unfixable as far as I was concerned.  I hesitate to purchase another.</li>
    <li> it broke after 2 weeks of use, otherwise it could have been a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this particular Waterpik for about a year now and really like it.  I don&#x27;t use all of the attachments, but at least they store inside the lid - out of the way.  Compared to my old Interplak water jet this one is wonderful.  Higher water pressure, better attachments, larger reservoir, cord storage area and a lid that completely covers the top of the reservoir to keep stuff out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if you think you&#x27;ll use it fairly often it&#x27;s a good investment - otherwise it will take up counter space &amp; outlet space in your bathroom, collecting dust and silently mocking your good intentions (much like my exercise equipment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my cat - hope you&#x27;re sitting down as I&#x27;m about to tell you a story. My Waterpik sits in the left-hand corner of my vanity slightly below a partition separating the vanity from the toilet.  Next to the Waterpik is a decorative little jar/canister that I have cotton swabs in.  My cat - he&#x27;s about 14 pounds of un-coordinated feline who thinks he is smaller than he really is.  He&#x27;d climbed up on the partition to do some snooping (as he does) and managed to slip off of the partition, sloppily onto the vanity, knocking the lid off of the decorative jar as he fell.  The lid came off, hit the power button on the Waterpik and all heck broke loose.  You see, you must push the blue button on the handle to turn the flow OFF, not ON.  Minty fresh mouthwash water pulsed out on my vanity, wall, mirror, some framed prints on the wall and me as I flew into the bathroom to see what kind of mayhem had occurred.  I have discovered that the distance this thing can spray is pretty impressive, the air freshening qualities (while good) are not practical, those tilty oval mirrors we recently installed are pretty but a pain in the hind end to clean behind &amp; even fat cats can move pretty darned fast!</li>
    <li> Before buying this product i read the reviews. Some customers said the pressure of water stream was not as strong as needed, but...I disagree with it. I used setting \\&quot;4\\&quot; and it was strong enough.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 4 months back and it works perfectly. They shipped a new piece with all its attachments.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner, set up in minutes and does what I want it to do.  Product is not unattractive looking on the sink either.  This Waterpik is basically designed for one person&#x27;s use, but comes with an extra pik - so if you were willing to switch out the pik everyday I guess two people could share it.  In addition to the extra pik it comes with a variety of other heads such as a spatula shaped one for tongue scraping, a bristled one like a toothbrush, and a pointy one to navigate braces.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and have not had any problems.</li>
    <li> This unit replaces a very old Waterpik I had.  It&#x27;s smaller so it&#x27;s easier to store when not in use, but can also be left out.  I would appreciate a longer cord for the actual pik device, but still is a nice little unit that gets in those places your brush can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> First off, I have never used a water pick before.  I started using it roughly 3 weeks ago.  I just had a dental appointment yesterday and got glowing reviews.  The doctor commented on what great gum health I had and that was only after a short time of usage.  The unit does leak a little, but I&#x27;m ok with it b/c it&#x27;s only when I fill the tank and transport it to the unit.  The tounge thing is silly and the brush/pik combo is ok, but I still prefer to brush and then water pik.  My husband rolled his eyes when I first decided to buy it (another goofy thing she&#x27;s going to do...)  But then when it came in the mail, he LOVED it!  So I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Water Pick works fine, just the same as the one I had  15 years ago. Still kind of undeveloped, but it does get the job done. I still feel the shipping charges are excessive, but since I&#x27;m housebound for a time I had to bite the bullet. You need to stop making your profit off those charges to more effectvely compete with local stores. Lucky for you gas is so expensive, offsetting your shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this waterpick after the one I had finally gave out. This one is much quiter and the design is more streamlined than the older version. I do like it &amp; it gets the job done. I would recommend this product for the family to keep your dental bills down.</li>
    <li> My dentist recently recommended I use a waterpik.  I had one many years ago but decided I needed a new one because the water container of that one was a little cruddy (we have hard water where I live) so I purchased the waterpik ultra because the water container had a lid and it had several different attachments. Overall, I like this product, there are a few drawbacks however.  I tend to run out of water and must refill the container and I don&#x27;t like some of the attachments, like another reviewer the tongue attachment gives me feeling of drowning.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I adopted a previous reviewer&#x27;s suggestion of adding a bit of mouthwash to the water and find this to be very refreshing.    I wish the top had a wider lip as in my hands it falls into the reservoir when I attempt to replace it.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpiks for years.  This one is as effective as my previous ones but is much more compact.  Like it a lot</li>
    <li> It does a good job. The handpiece keeps breaking. We are on our forth waterpik.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been bugging me to get the waterpik for 6 months now to help with my gums. I finally broke down and purchased it on Amazon (cheaper). I was nervous about some of the negative reviews that talked about leaking from the handle.     I have had the machine for three weeks now and so far it works great. My second day of using it I experienced two problems:    a. The water pik was pulling in air and thus not creating a steady stream.   b. The handle was leaking water    On my third use I tried a few things to try and solve the problems and they worked:    a. I put the cover back on the water resevoir and the air problem went away.  b. I twisted the handle slightly and coupled with the resevoir lid being on, I have had no leaking issues either.     Maybe this will change in the future but so far the product is workinga s advertised. Just need my next checkup to confirm</li>
    <li> Holy crap does my interdental space feel clean!  Like most people, I never find the time to floss, and I don&#x27;t regularly visit the dentist.  I&#x27;m not an expert on the pros and cons of oral irrigation vs traditional flossing, but from what I gathered, this is better than nothing.  I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of using the Waterpik every night before brushing.  My teeth feel great.&lt;br /&gt;  I had a problem with bleeding gums and a very mild toothache.  Those symptoms are gone now, but I&#x27;m sure the real problem is still there.  Take care of your teeth because you only get two pair, unlike those damn sharks.</li>
    <li> This is the third unit we bought in last 12 months. One for myself, my spouse and our picky son. We all love it. It is a bit noisy and vibrated quite a bit while using, but if you need the power to flush out those unwanted stuff in-between your teeth, what other choices? One thing must remember, never run the unit without water in the tank, or start it without first prime the pump if you happen to run out of water in previous flushing. Otherwise you run the risk of burning the pump prematually.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Waterpik that I owned 15 years ago, this machine is better designed.  I thought the spray force was about the same as that of my old model.  There is a small button on the handle that ejects the tip, and this is easy to activate inadvertantly when storing the unit.  This makes for a facial lavage at the next session, so I&#x27;ve learned to check the security of the tip before starting.  There are many tips in the case that sits on the water tank, and I am still experimenting with them.  Overall I am happy with the function and value of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace an old WaterPik (model 49)-- a great piece of machinery that I would have kept on using, except that the plastic hose leading from the water well to the appliance tip split and couldn&#x27;t be replaced.  This new model is remarkably inferior.  I can barely feel the water pressure generated, even with the most focused tip and with the highest setting.    I sent a complaint to WaterPik, via their website and have yet to hear back.    I would never recommend anyone buy this product.</li>
    <li> The pressure is good, but if I leave water in the reservoir, occasionally water leaks out onto the counter. I have to empty any remaining water after I turn it off.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing a while back, replacing another much smaller water pick which puttered out after a few short months. This one is still going strong. It is effective, user friendly and my gums got a thumbs up from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the Waterpik. I like its compact size and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on the counter. This is my first Waterpik so cannot compare it to others, but for one or two people&#x27;s use, it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The water pressure is too high even at the lowest setting.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I was amazed at the residue that it removed from my teeth even after I had brushed and flossed. I plan to purchase the portable unit for travel.</li>
    <li> The unit itself is attractive and well built.  It&#x27;s the business end spray handle and its hose that lack any real heft.  The WaterPik performs well, and it does the job.  Yet, after two months we haven&#x27;t used the extra-special assortment of tips - just the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; one.  A good choice.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to us by our dentist.  My husband and I both feel that it has improved our daily dental care greatly.  It&#x27;s surprising the amount of tiny food particles left after brushing and flossing that the Waterpik flushes out.</li>
    <li> I have one, my husband  has one and now is my son turn</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband.  He loves it, says you can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes.  Use after brushing and see what your toothbrush leaves behind.</li>
    <li> I recently had braces put on and my Sonicare toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t doing a thorough cleaning job. At the recommendation of my dentist I added the Waterpik to my cleaning regiment. It has made a tremendous difference.  My teeth are spotless and my gums are back in shape. It removes food particles that you don&#x27;t even know you had.   I would recommend this to anybody and espcially those who have crowns, bridges or braces.   The one slight manufacturing design flaw I found is the water cord to the handle is on the short side. This becomes an issue if you are right handed and the unit has to be plugged into the left side of your vanity.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son who has braces.  It has really made a difference in his being able to get the food particles out of his braces.  What I did not like about it is that even though it has many different waterpik heads for different uses, it only has one of each so it is not made to be shared among family members because there is only one set of heads.  I would have preferred multiple heads for each family member or the option to select multiple heads for many family members instead of multiple heads for different uses.</li>
    <li> I like the water pic because it cleans up uor mouth nicely. I brush and follow up with the waterpic</li>
    <li> This is my second product from Waterpik and I love it.  I have braces and it keeps my gums healthy and clean.  The variable pressure is great, and more than enough for anyone who hasn&#x27;t grown up with the older models (which I haven&#x27;t).  It cleans great, it feels great, it&#x27;s quiet and there is plenty of water to do a good cleaning.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Waterpik user for over 30 years.   Got the new model about a month ago after the pump on the previous one started to have problems.     The Waterpik Ultra features nice design improvements. It has a collar that guides the water tank so there is no problem getting the nozzles on the bottom to meet. It has a lid so dust doesn&#x27;t get in the tank. There is a holder on the side that holds the hand-held tip so it doesn&#x27;t leave a puddle on the base which over time forms a deposit. There is now a button on the hand-held tip that will release the tip plugged into the hand-held, no more pulling and pushing. The unit has a smaller foot print. The controls are easier to use.    The Water pike is not as powerful as it use to be - the jets use to be very powerful. For most people, this is probably be a good thing. The gentle water jet seem to have more volume of water so it may be better at rinsing thing away.     The lower power jet may mean longer life for the pump.       The unit also came with lots of different attachment tips.  I tried a few didn&#x27;t find them particularly useful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet...I have a bit of gingivitis (especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant) and my dentist said this has definately helped reduce the amount of inflammation and bleeding of my gums.     Everytime I use the waterjet, I feel like I just visited the dentist...it leaves me with a very clean, fresh feeling. It comes with six great attachments, and I use them all except the tongue scraper (my husband uses that one, he really likes it- he feels it&#x27;s helping improve his morning breath).     This would make a great gift for anyone, especially someone who has dental problems. My dad went without proper dental care for years (he grew up in an environment where dental care was not a priority or thought of much, and now in his senior years, the expense, pain and inconvenience of repairing damanged teeth is quite high!). He loved receiving this as a gift.     I wrote a review for anyone who would like to read more on my blog here: [...]    @Penelopes_Oasis</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; Dental Water Pick is a rickety plastic device that works poorly.  Although the instructions warn one not to \\&quot;pick\\&quot; for over 5 minutes at a time, the water bin barely holds enough water for 2 minutes.  You have to jiggle it get it to work properly.  The picture looks as if it is a highly developed machine, but it is really a primitive piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought this on Amazon. 10$ cheaper than Walmart. I bought this prticulr modle because it was the only one left on the shelf! I was int he market for a pik because I started to have some swelling of the gum and couldnt get to it with floss (I&#x27;ve had dental work there and it shreds alll types of floss) I used the pik tonight and it works GREAT and my gum already feels better. I&#x27;m sure it blasted some gunk out of my gums! yey!</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself, and one for my two kids.  My dentist said it is better for gum disease control than flossing.  It was also recommended to me by my kid&#x27;s orthodontist.  It helps keep food out of their braces.  Both units are working great.  The tube could stand to be just a bit longer, but other than that I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  I considered the portable units, but decided against them based on their poor Amazon reviews.</li>
    <li> I have been using water picks for 20 years and have owned several different units. I have found the brand Waterpik has always looked the best and been just as functional as any other on the market, if not more functional. I used my previous Waterpik unit for over 10 years without the seals drying out. It worked fine, I just wanted a newer looking model. It comes with more attachments than I would ever use. The different levels of pressure vary greatly. The hand-held part of the unit feels good and is easy to change the angle of the tip while using with just two fingers. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> We had an old Waterpik that finally gave up the ghost and my husband really missed it.  Our dentist suggested he keep using a Waterpik to keep his gum disease at bay, so we bought this one.  It is wonderful and we have no complaints at all, and my husband thinks it works much better than the old one.</li>
    <li> great for cleaning out what the brush leaves behind.  You&#x27;d  be suprised how much debris just brushing misses.  It&#x27;s great to sandblast around braces and really get clean</li>
    <li> This machine, while supposedly having all the bells and whistles, also  has a little sticker on the underside, near the motor, stating that it  cannot be used for more than 5 minutes per 2 hours!  That means that if  there are more than 2 people who want to use this machine, for example,  before you go to bed, the machine will turn off because of overheating!   The company obviously knows that the motor is insufficient for usage,  hence the sticker.  Save your money, and do not buy this machine.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it does need a more power, I owned another type of water flosser and it was good, but over all this is a far superior product!</li>
    <li> This is a great little machine, not quite as strong as my old water pick  and the storage department for extra picks is just ok</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve used this product, I don&#x27;t wake up with bad breathe anymore. It does its job. I love using it. It&#x27;s a little loud..but I don&#x27;t mind it. Very compact and good for the price. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have a few deep pockets in my teeth. They gave me picks and flossers to help out. I would brush, pick and floss.  My wife suggested a WaterPik.  After doing all of the above, I then used the waterpik and could see quite a bit of food being washed out.  Each time I use it, I can see how effective it is at really getting the gums clean. The bacteria don&#x27;t have much to eat and thrive on.  I have been using the orthodontic tip included. When I went in for my cleaning, she was stunned. Very very clean and the receeding gumline around every tooth had reduced in 3 months. I had never seen anything so effective for my \\&quot;challenge\\&quot;.  Highly recommended if you have any pockets in your gums of want your mouth to be very very clean.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet is as described. It provides a great way to keep your teeth and gums in great shape. I can truly see a difference in the month or so that I have owned it.  The water storage area is small and you will probably have to refill it a couple times while using it but that is the only drawback I currently have. It does what it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> I had a perfect dental exam after using the Waterpik daily for a month. I never had such a good checkup in my life and my dentist was impressed by the improvement in my dental hygeine. One warning - do NOT get the cordless model. Although convenient without the cord, they don&#x27;t last long. I had two of them break down before I switched to this model.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT IS EXELLENT IT DOES EVERYTHING THAT WAS MEANT TO BE.iAM VERY HAPPY WITH IT AND WILL RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY.jUST MAKE SURE THAT PICK IS INSIDE YOUR MOUTH BEFORE IT IS TURN ON.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested me to get  a water pick, and after reading reviews on different machines, this is the one I went for and I think I made the right desicion. I fill it really cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th water pik.  Has helped stopped and even reversed my gingival problems.  Only problem is when you grip the handle you sometimes disconnect the rinse head and get a shower.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and definitely leaves my mouth and gums feeling much better than flossing ever did.  Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a way to have healthier teeth and gums...Thanks</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun water pic and this Water Pik runs circles around it!  My teeth and gums are much healthier and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this waterpik for a month or so and so far it&#x27;s performed as advertised. Reliable, strong and very controllable stream is just what I was looking for. I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a good waterpik type appliance.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing a breeze and really gets the junk out of your teeth. Blend water with Mouthwash for a real super clean.&lt;br /&gt;Then use a sonicare brush and your ready to take on the world!</li>
    <li> This product works as described.  In an effort to prolong pump life (after reading of some people&#x27;s experiences here before purchasing)I am using distilled water.  We&#x27;ll see if that makes a difference.    The only wrinkle I have seen so far is that sometimes when I turn the unit on, with the reservior full of water, no water comes out.  When that happens I wiggle the hose to get the machine to take in more water.  Then when I try a second time there has been no problem.</li>
    <li> I never liked flossing because it took to much time and was not convenient.  This Water Jet replaces flossing, and is convenient. It&#x27;s easy and fast. The water pressure is adjustable and is powerful enough to thoroughly clean.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a water pic but it seems to be working as promised. Initially I had a little difficulty not spraying water everywhere, but after a couple of trys I have it down now. I use it on one of the lower pressure settings and it provides plenty of vibration and cleaning. It&#x27;s also fairly easy and quick to set up, use and clean. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used waterpiks for years and replaced them when they wore out.  This model is greatly improved.  Water tank design provides an easy no spill place and remove.  The handle has a really improved shape and the Piks are easily installed and removed.  Thw water intensity control is on the base, not on the handle.  Best of all!  This model is really quiet.  This time, \\&quot;New &amp; Improved\\&quot;. really means something.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this device to me, and It was a very good decision...     Here in Colombia there is a Waterpik representant, but the price is SO HUGE!!....so I&#x27;ve decided to use the amazon&#x27;s service, it costs me less than the third part of the price of the seller here in Bogota (including taxes, internal shipping,etc etc)...now I&#x27;m enjoying the advantages of my waterpik... vivan las compras por Internet!!!!!  :)</li>
    <li> My teeth have always been crammed together so visits to the hygienist are never fun. Now, I don&#x27;t mean my smile is ugly. It&#x27;s just that I have too many teeth for a small mouth. I brush and I floss. I even eat a pretty clean diet. No matter what I do, the plaque builds up and so do the stains.     After my dentist suggested I make an appointment with an ortodontist to see about straightening my teeth out so they would be easier to keep clean, I started looking into the Waterpik. Some time ago I switched to an electric toothbrush. That was helpful but it still didn&#x27;t keep the bothersome plaque and stains at the gumline from taking up residence. I&#x27;m over 50 so I have been living with these teeth for a long time. I kind of like them. I can&#x27;t get my head around having perfectly good teeth pulled and wearing braces and the cost so I really wanted an alternative.    I read a bunch of the reviews on Amazon so I was ready. My Waterpik arrived. I read through all the directions and I&#x27;ve used it for just a few days and already there&#x27;s a difference. What a great job it does. It can be a little messy while you get used to all the water but for the most part it is pretty easy to use. It feels good on my gums too. I find the reservoir a little small so I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and keep a glass nearby and ready to refill when the water level starts to get below halfway. I find I need 2-3 reservoirs-full to get a good dose on all my teeth but it&#x27;s relaxing in a way and I can already see the difference. We&#x27;ll see how it goes in 5 months when I go to the Hygienist. That&#x27;s the real test.    As for the product, it is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> It feels good to use! I never thought it would feel so good! The space between me and them almost no teeth, so I was surprised the lovely warm feeling that they rushed between the water column! My gums feel that they have to appreciate the \\&quot;hot glue!\\&quot;  I find this particular part of favorite unit is that it covered, allowing you to clean and protect the glass wand, when you do not use a well-designed mobile part of the above! This means that no trade-off the toothpaste or spit or urine cast or any contamination will splash into them, they have not been used, but they are very convenient to go when you&#x27;re ready to use wall.</li>
    <li> This item works very well.  It has a large water supply and great accessories.  It cerainly does the job for which it was intended to do.</li>
    <li> This product really helps remove plaque and makes my gums feel much better.  The circulation of my gum line is also much better and the results happened in just a few days.  This really works!!  Must have for great dental and oral hygiene!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.  On the whole, I am happy with it.  But it does not replace flossing and brushing.  It is a bit of a nuisance to set up, and, if you&#x27;re not really careful, water splashes everywhere.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I are very pleased with the Waterpik.  Our gums are in much better health and our teeth feel cleaner.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  The only thing was that I wish the storage up above would be able to fit all attachements when not in use.</li>
    <li> this products works very well.  at first i had it at the lowest settings.  as time passed and i used it more often, i was able to turn it up just a bit, maybe to level 3.  anything more than that isn&#x27;t comfortable for me.  the blue button on the wand sticks and you have to pull it out or tap it against the sink to make it pop out.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product for tonsolith removal.  It works superbly!  Those little buggers are practically impossible to get out without some type of waterjet system.  Obviously it works well for flossing  as well.  My only gripe is that it is TOO POWERFUL.  Even on the lowest setting, it can still cause some pain in the back of the mouth.   They need to spread out the power a bit more.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested this item.  I obtained one and have been very happy with the results.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  All the accessories are useful in their own way.  If you have braces this is a definite must have.  Flossing is a good thing, this is an added plus.  If you care about keeping your mouth clean, get one!</li>
    <li> All of our waterjets broke around the same time, so I bought 2 of these. They both work great. This unit comes with 6 various tips. It operates very quietly, I can use this before bed and not wake up anyone else who may be sleeping.     I&#x27;m most impressed with the power. I had an Interplak before which I thought was pretty good, but it&#x27;s highest setting was about the same as a 3 on this thing. I notice the one I gave my kids hovers around a 3 or 4. My son says it hurts if he turns it any higher.     This is a great little unit, quiet, lots of tips, and keeps teeth extremely clean. Highly reccommended!</li>
    <li> I have the waterpik WP-60W \\&quot;personal\\&quot; model, I have had it for a few years but never really used it because I didn&#x27;t have the counter space at the time I first got it, and I thought that it was loud like a diesel truck. Man, I really regret not using it, I brush and floss twice a day, but I still got periodontal disease. So I started using it and just putting up with the noise. It actually works great, my mouth and gums feel much cleaner than just brushing and flossing alone.    But I did a search of waterpik on Amazon just to read the reviews on my model, and discovered this newer \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; model was out there now. I read that it had the quietest operation ever and all these new tips, so I got one of the \\&quot;Ultra&#x27;s\\&quot; as well. Works great like the other one I got, but MUCH quieter which is just what I wanted. Also it came with all those other cool tips, but I still think your most useful tips are gonna be the jet and tounge cleaner.    Only thing about the new \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; model that I wish was different, is the water resevoir, my \\&quot;personal\\&quot; waterpik can hold 1200 ml of water. This newer \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; can only hold 650 ml of water. Not a big problem, you can clean your whole mouth once through with the \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; on one filling, but you wont have much water left to spare for a second run through, unless you refill again.    The new \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; is easier to use than my older waterpik, the larger easier to push water stop button is on the front now, where you can acutally use it and I like the water pressure dial on the base better than the old ratching up lever on the handle.    I know this thing is supposed to replace flossing, but I still like to floss and then waterpik afterwards for the ultimate cleaning.    If you have any kind of dental problem, ginginvitis, periodontal disease, dental work, braces, or even have perfectly healthy and perfect teeth and gums, you should get this product, I regret not using it earlier, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have periodontal disease now if I did.</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik Ultra to clean out my deep periodontal pockets where food debris hides and it does an amazing job of cleaning out the debris. I&#x27;m very pleased with the design and operation of this product and would highly reccommend it to anyone who needs extra help with periodontal cleaning.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure wich one to buy... this one, or the portable one.  I live in Brazil, and someone was bringing it for me, so I decided to buy them both.  This one and a portable one from Panasonic, and sell the one I like less.  Well, I will keep them both.  Really like them.  But this one is better... Doesn&#x27;t have batteries, has more power (you never use the top power), and you don&#x27;t have to refill the water reservoir (it&#x27;s the perfect amount of water for an excellent cleaning).  If you are only buying one, and for your home, you should buy this one.  The portable one is good for travelling or to leave at work (that&#x27;s what I am going to do).  It has a good water preasure (but not as good as the full waterpik), but his water reservoir has to be refilled again for a complete dental wash.  Or, you should do like me, and buy them both... they have a discount for that !!</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.   Even after flossing and brushing we couldn&#x27;t believe what was still left in between our teeth. We are still amazed! We would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Initially I dismissed products like these as nothing more than a money-making ploy but I purchased one as recommended by my dentist&#x27;s assistant. The first time I used it was pretty much a disaster, possibly due to my lack of coordination but I kept at it and am glad I did. The product gets to places my brush and floss are apparently missing. The settings allow me to adjust the water stream to my tolerance/comfort level. The handle is easy to grip, especially if you have difficulty gripping a regular toothbrush like I do.</li>
    <li> Out of the box it is fine. Works well. The water storage container is a little bit of a hassle to fill, But i can&#x27;t recommwnd it. The attachement broke after four months. It will no longer seat in the handle and even moderate water pressure causes the attachement to get blown off.    I would recommend looking at another model.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra product is pretty much as the description says.   It is more compact than previous Waterpik models that I&#x27;ve had and takes up less counterspace.   There is storage space for 4 tips, but the machine comes with 5, so I&#x27;ve had to just leave the 5th one loose in the storage compartment.   As a long time user of these devices, I am used to having it produce a lot of pressure in the water stream, and this model seems to produce a bit less pressure than some of the larger, previous models.   However, it seems to be getting the job done.</li>
    <li> Its been 9 months since I brought it and it still works great.    Kids love using it / cleans out the braces very well.    If more then two people will be using it ,I recommend purchasing additional water pik jets at the time of purchase, because you cant find a store that has these things in inventory</li>
    <li> Replaced a similar Waterpik that I had for many years.  My advice is that eveyone should add this to their tools to make your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> The water pic I purchased for myself works so well, I bought one for a relative....and she also likes it!</li>
    <li> I had never used a waterpik before purchasing this one but I love it!  I still like to floss (I know, I&#x27;m one of those people who actually LIKE to floss) but the waterpik is great for rinsing my teeth and getting out tonsil rocks (those calcified pieces of food stuck in your tonsils-I only have to do it occasionally but it is the easiest way to remove them!).  I imagine that this is the best thing if you don&#x27;t like to floss and I even bought one for my mom because she does not floss.</li>
    <li> Replaced our broken Waterpik and love this one.  So many heads to choose from and quieter too</li>
    <li> My dentist was recently complaining about my dental pockets, blah, blah, blah, so I decided I should probably do more than brush twice a day.  Flossing has never been an exciting option for me, so after checking on other possibilities, I chose the Waterpik.  My parents had one ages ago and I remember it as an &#x27;adventure&#x27; :-)  Water, water, everywhere.    Not much has changed overall.  The Waterpik still cleans your teeth (and sometimes your walls!) and in between more effectively than any other option.  Sure, the Sonic toothbrushes try to clean under the gum line, but none come close to the ability of the Waterpik to do the job.    One big concern in the past has been keeping the unit itself clean.  I just drop a tablet of Potable Aqua (also from Amazon.com) in the tank before starting to not only keep the tank, hose, and tip clean but to remove the bacteria and viruses from my teeth as well.  You can buy similar chlorine dioxide solutions as a mouth rinse from Smartmouth, Therabreath, etc. or purchase the less expensive option from Potable Aqua.    Overall, highly recommended.  And, amusing as well :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boys to help with their braces.  At bedtime I do an inspection of their teeth, and they look a lot better now that they are using this Water Pik.  They had no trouble learning to use it, either.</li>
    <li> So far has worked as advertised. I haven&#x27;t yet had a chance to call the phone number they provided for questions, but do plan to do so.  Not sure I&#x27;m using this thing to its full capacity.</li>
    <li> A very nice product. It&#x27;s a good oral hygiene practice to use this product in between dental visits. It comes with attachment you need to deeply clean your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bad flosser and as much as I&#x27;ve tried, I never stick to it.  After just two weeks using this device, my gums stopped bleeding and feel much healthier.  My dental hygentist noticed the improvement but still want&#x27;s me to floss, so, I&#x27;ll keep trying to make flossing a habit.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble using the waterpik x2 per day though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the container doesn&#x27;t hold enough water.  My workaround is to fill a glass before I start and dump it in while I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my teeth but for the past 5 years or so i havent had any dental insurance so I just take extra care on my own.  Ive had this puss coming out of one particular place on my bottom tooth for a long time. Ive been so concerned and always brush religiously every day but its just not enough.  I started researching and discovered I had a \\&quot;pocket\\&quot;. Ok... then i was even more afraid of losing my teeth.  I continued to research and discovered This Water Pik. I was amazed at the feedback and reviews of this product from people just like me who could not afford a dentist and this product actually saved their teeth !  Well, Im happy to report its doing the same for me and im so happy and relieved. I put a mixture of peroxide, Listerine and water in the basin and then I use the Pik pocket tip to flush out the pocket in my gums and wow... I dont even get puss out of my gums anymore and its healing so fast. My breath is fresher than ever and my gums are so pink and healthy.  I recommend this product to anyone that wants healthy teeth that will last them the rest of their life. I know people that have had painful surgery to correct their \\&quot;pocket\\&quot; problem and its just amazing to me that if they had known about this product, all the money, time and pain they would have saved themselves just by buying it !  Its absolutely incredible.... dont hesitate! Buy it and use it everyday of your life. You will not be disapointed.</li>
    <li> Great price.  I saw this product in all the stores for around $60.00.  Amazon had the Waterpik for around $40.00 about a $20.00 savings, and with the free shipping, I was able to keep the $20.00.  My kids have braces and this product does the job!</li>
    <li> I boght this product in US, and toke it back to China. I thought that can be used nomally. Unfortunatly, when I plugged it to the outlet, the product was burned. When I looked it the voltage under the product, 120V voltage is required. I am angried with the product, I hatt there is no clear description from the advertisement.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The new WP-100 has many improvements over the earlier model, but does have one major flaw that is quite annoying. The water resevoir holds almost 50% less water than the previous model that I had. The Ultra holds 20oz. whereas the previous model held 35oz of water. Because it is so important to message the gums, I need to refill the container in order to do a complete job. My dentist agrees. Refilling the unit does lead to a greater chance of spills and is inconvenient.     On the positive side, the WP-100 is much quieter and more compact. The pik fits nicely into the unit and it takes less space on the sink. The water stream also seems more forceful.</li>
    <li> pros- cleans the interproximals of your teeth really good (between your teeth). Also makes your mouth feel about 95% more clean. It also reduces gum pockets by about 2mms. It is a really good product if you&#x27;re not really a flossing fan.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- you have to be careful because you may squirt yourself in the eye. It&#x27;s hard to control in the beginning.</li>
    <li> Works better than advertised. Great improvment over the first I owned several years ago.Good pressure control and pause control. Excellent wand and tool storage.after brushing and flossing. waterpik still found food particles to remove.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an alternative to flossing.  It works very well.  The water pulses out of the tube, and the pressure is adjustable.  I couldn&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d change.  I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks, so my only concern it longevity.  If it lasts several years, I&#x27;ll replace it with another one. ***** UPDATE March 30,2011 - no problems and I love it!</li>
    <li> I was about to contact someone at the company:     For many years I had one of their Waterpiks, very simple design and easy to use.   It finally quit and I bought another brand, which was available on island. It was also satisfactory, but recently its motor slowed down from old age...   Because nobody fixes anything anymore, I thought I&#x27;d get back to Waterpik, by now available via Amazon.    What disturbs me is the on-off switch.     Firstly it should be installed UP &amp; DOWN , NOT side-wise, and much more easily switched without so much pressure.     Has anyone at their firm tried to hold the extended pic in one hand, with the off-button held in,  either over the basin or in the mouth, and then tried pushing that rocker-switch without moving the whole light-weight instrument from where it sits on the counter??? Fancy looks are not the most important:                       BAUHAUS: Form follows Function.</li>
    <li> This is the same product which my doctor uses to clean out his patients ears.  I thought we could do the same at home and same the money.  It is working well and so is our hearing.</li>
    <li> this is the best oral irrigator  i have ever used. i have used a few different ones over the years and this one is definitely the best one yet.  easy to use, does what it is supposed to do very well. i am completely satisfied with it and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Works great, like it a lot.  Highly recommend.  Note: if after a while the pressure gets lower, replace the tip with one of the others that came with the unit.  I found that the tips seem to need to be changed after a while (maybe a year).</li>
    <li> I like this product and it does a very good job. This product cleaneout food particals better than floss. My only complaint is the water spray that will spray across the bathroom while cleaning your teeth. There is a control switch on the handle that is very useful. However, water still sprays out while in use.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a year ago so now I can give it a fair assessment.  Before purchasing this Waterpik I had a history of gum disease for several years, had gone through a deep scaling, and was going to the hygienist every 4 months for a cleaning.  What prompted me to buy the Waterpik was my hygienist&#x27;s warning that I might have to go through yet another deep scaling.      At first I was using it twice a day -- right after breakfast and before going to bed.  The next time I went to my hygienist she said my gums were \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; and put me back to a 6 month cleaning cycle. Since then I have slacked off a bit, generally only using it at night, but I still got a good review from my hygienist the last time I went.       I rarely use floss any more -- only if I am away from home, and even then depending on the trip I try to pack the Waterpik when I travel.  The Waterpik clearly is more effective than flossing.  I&#x27;ve tried both flossing first and then using the Waterpik and vice-versa. Flossing rarely gets out anything the Waterpik has missed but the Waterpik gets all sorts of things out of my gums that a good flossing misses.    The only negative I can think of is that the motor is a bit loud, but that is not enough of an issue to label this product below five stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit when my old Waterpik broke. In that unit, the tube cracked and water was squirting out the side. I was too lazy to send away for a replacement tube. I almost dreaded using my old one because the tips were so hard to get off and it was a cumbersome design.  I love this unit compared to the old Waterpik. In the Ultra, the variable water speed protects the gum from injury, there is a pop off feature for the attachments, and it has its own storage case for tips and looks nice on your washstand. Even after flossing and brushing stuff comes out from between your teeth and I feel it is well worth the cost to prevent future cavities. The cheaper Waterpik units do the job but this is just so much nicer in every way. It is almost fun and I use it all the time. I always fill it with warm water, start at a low speed (since my gum bled the first few times that I used it) and turn up as needed. (They do warn you in the instructions to start at a low speed). Since I eat a lot food that gets caught in my teeth, I use it in the morning and the evening and I don&#x27;t mind a bit.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just get one thing straight right away: I hate flossing, so I pretty much never do it. My dentist scolds me for it, my gums bleed a little bit when I do it (and more when the hygenist does it), so that makes me all the less likely to floss, even though I know I need to do it.    Well darn it, why the heck didn&#x27;t my dentist recommend a Waterpik? This thing is great! I consider myself a good brusher, and thoroughly brush at least twice a day with a sonic toothbrush. Still, I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of food particles that get washed out by the Waterpik after I brush. It&#x27;s both gross and satisfying to see them washed into the sink.    I haven&#x27;t been back for a checkup since I got my Waterpik, and have had it less than a month, but I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next dentist visit. I&#x27;m hopeful and confident they&#x27;ll notice a marked improvement in my gums. If it turns out to be as effective as I hope and as Waterpik claims, I&#x27;m left wondering why dentists don&#x27;t recommend these appliances to patients like me who either don&#x27;t floss or don&#x27;t floss effectively.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after a year that my mom have done it. The product really helps for a better mouth wash.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Water-Pik years ago and then stopped.  My new one is lighter and easier to use and best of all removes food and plaque that my tooth brush misses. The Water-Pik brand is still the best.  Use it to improve your overall dental health.</li>
    <li> After hearing my mother&#x27;s story about her positive results from using the Waterpik, I decided to purchase one myself.  So did her dentist!!  For years, my mother has suffered from gum disease and has tried almost everything.  After using the Waterpik for only 4 months, she went to her dentist for her routine exam.  He said her gums had never looked so good and asked what she had been doing.  She answered \\&quot;Waterpik\\&quot;.  Her results inspired both her dentist and me to also buy one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s so much easier than flossing (I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s a substitute), and you can see how well it removes food debris that tooth brushing alone does not.  This unit is perfect for a family because of the color-coded heads for each member&#x27;s use.  Your mouth just feels fresher and cleaner when the Waterpik is used as the final dental hygiene step.  Other than the normal toothbrush, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used for my dental hygiene and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik. It tends to last a little more then 3 years with two people using it daily. Its worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these units (older model) for years and I really like it so I purchased this unit for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! You&#x27;d be surprised at how much stuff comes out of the cracks and crevasses of your teeth and gums with this unit even after brushing and sometimes flossing!</li>
    <li> I currently have braces and I bought this product because it&#x27;s a bit hard to clean my braces using just traditional flossing and brushing.  I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and I am happy with it.  It does not do an impecable job and it does not replace your dentist, but it does a much better job than traditional flossig and brushing.    Also, I personally like this much better than flossing; although, for those of us who have braces, this can take longer than flossing if you really want to do a good job of cleaing behind your teeth and the plaque that builds around your braces.    Also, my breath and mouth feel fresher ever since I started using this product.    The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 starts was because it can get a bit messy, at least until you get the hang of it, and it makes a bit of noise.  (I personally don&#x27;t mind either of these two cons, but I wanted to provide as much useful feedback as possible.)    Overall, I am very happy with the product and the results.</li>
    <li> Let me first preface this with the fact that I HATE flossing. My teeth are extremely tight (aided by my wisdom teeth which are to be removed next week!) so flossing is not easy. Floss gets stuck, rips, and I end up jamming the floss hard into my gums trying to get it in between my teeth.   We&#x27;ve been using this little device for about 2 months now. Boy is this a whole lot better than flossing!! My husband has enjoyed it better than flossing as well.   It is a little large on our bathroom counter, and makes some noise, but I&#x27;ll take that over painful flossing any day!  We haven&#x27;t used any of the additional tips yet, haven&#x27;t seen a need for them, but nice to have I guess.</li>
    <li> fast shipping; quality product; good communications with seller. What more could the everyday internet buyer ask for?</li>
    <li> I have had the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for a couple of months now.     Initially I was using it last, but after reading the directions I am doing it first. Of course, that means there is much more debris to clear out and it does a fine job. I only use it on a relatively low setting (between 4 and 5 out of 10), but that is what meets my needs. I am worried that I will damage my gums if I use it on the highest settings.      I have braces right now and am using it to help keep my brackets clean. I don&#x27;t have time to do the water pik and brush after lunch before going back to work, but my mouth and brackets still feel clean and fresh with just doing the water pik.    I kept the box and have taken it with me on two trips. I felt the unit was small enough to do this, though others might not. I had room in my bag. These trips were driving, not flying, by the way.    After using the water pik, I make sure that the reservoir is empty because I have found a little bit of water under the unit when I use it the next time. If this didn&#x27;t happen I would probably give it five stars. Overall I am very happy with the unit.</li>
    <li> I have used a WaterPik for a number of years.  I ordered this one after my previous one died.  This model is by far the best I have ever used.  It is smaller, quieter, and easier to fill and dry than any I have owned previously.</li>
    <li> works better that floss at removing food stuck between teeth &amp; gum.  Use it before I floss with Plackers.  Should also work well on braces.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over 1 month now, and it works great! I am very happy with the results. Even after careful brushing and flossing, it&#x27;s amazing the particles that are still removed by the Water Pik. Not as noisy as the old ones used to be.  The price was the lowest of all the places I researched (even lower than Walmart) since Amazon doesn&#x27;t charge sales tax and included free super saver shipping. Item was shipped well within the expected delivery time also. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> We have used WaterPiks for years, and have even tried different brands.  This is by far the best one ever.  We now own two -- my husband and I don&#x27;t have to share.  Highly recommend this model if you are considering a purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used WaterPiks for decades and find them extremely useful.  As others have noted, the build quality has declined over the years.  When my last one (a WP-60W, I think) broke after a fairly short life, I got one of those \\&quot;connect to the faucet\\&quot; irrigators, which was basically ineffective - though, in its favor, it is very simple and unlikely to ever break.  Disappointed, I went back to WaterPik and decided to try the Ultra model.  I give it a B+, with a number of improvements and only one major fault and one minor fault.    To get the major defect out of the way first, it&#x27;s one fault is a lack of pressure.  My previous models were capable of more pressure than I needed, but this one can&#x27;t quite get to the level I prefer.  It&#x27;s probably sufficient for its purpose, though.  I&#x27;m not sure why the company reduced the pressure. Perhaps to reduce the noise level?  Reduce cost of production?  If anyone at the company reads this, please consider increasing the pressure in future versions.  In addition, there is a minor problem with the connection between the reservoir and the body of the machine, which is - at least in my unit - difficult to separate, making it more difficult than it should be to dump the water from the reservoir and to fill it.  I&#x27;ve only used the unit for a month, so that may ease up some with continued use.    On the plus side, the noise levels is dramatically reduced from previous models.  The new design makes stowing the cord and nozzle extremely easy and the on-off switch is much easier to work than prior versions.  All in all, the Ultra works better than the other Water Piks I have owned, other than the pressure problem.    There is a touch of \\&quot;featuritis\\&quot; in the bundling of a variety of attachments to use in lieu of the standard nozzle, but I found them all to be useless.  The tongue cleaner is really silly.  The \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; and irrigator combo tip doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Etc.  Also, the \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; reservoir top to that stows all of those gadgets just gets in the way of filling and emptying the reservoir, so I have tossed the top and all of those excess gadgets.   I&#x27;m guess that the marketing guys would never go along with eliminating these \\&quot;features,\\&quot; but they should.    Good machine, just short of great.</li>
    <li> too many bells $ whistles . . . and less pressure than earlier models.  Not worth the price ov over $50</li>
    <li> She loves all the different attachments, the different speeds, the compact space it takes.  Way better than her much older model that gave up the ghost a while back.  She has even got my dad to use it a few times !</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful piece of equipment.  It does everything from saving gums, brushing teeth, cleaning the tongue and so on.  This is one of the best investments I have made.  The use of salt, baking soda and peroxide, with this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, is one of the best gifts you can give your mouth.  If you don&#x27;t mind leaning over the sink while using it, you will  keep your mouth healthy for years.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have is that I release the nozzle from the handle by mistake some times due to how I hold it.  The water container is a little on the small side, but it is OK.  The feel is a bit cheaper than the older units (I had a 10 year old one that felt much sturdier.    Overall, I am happy with it and expect it to last several years, but not as long as the old ones.</li>
    <li> I love this thing and will always use it. Very quick and easy, and I the kids version works just as well, as I bought one for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;I have a history periodontic issues(lots of 4&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s), had gum surgery and deep cleaning to reduce pockets. I would also see a periodontist every 3 months for about 3 years prior to an out of state move. So when I moved I  put off finding another dentist. So after not seeing a dentist or periodontist for 2 years, I knew I had to go. I did not floss regularly for the 2 years either. Maybe once or twice a week on average. So I ordered one of these and started using twice a day for 3 weeks along with using Gum Expanding floss every other day. This was my attempt to getting my mouth in shape before my visit.&lt;br /&gt;So the day of reckoning came, and my new dentist said after my checkup, &amp;#34;You have one of the cleanest mouths I have seen in quite awhile and whatever you are doing keep doing it!&amp;#34;  He also probed my mouth and I had only one, 4 pocket (in the very back behind my tooth). The rest were 2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s. And the 4 pocket he said was most likely due to the anatomy of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was call my mom, and tell her what the dentist said. Ha and I am 38.&lt;br /&gt;All I know is that using the Waterpik with the expanding floss gave me the best dentist visit, and it works.</li>
    <li> absolutely love it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I dont have to embarrassed when my dentist asks if i do flossing or not..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works perfectly..</li>
    <li> The waterpik works as claimed.  I cannot comment on its durability, but it removes food particles that would be otherwise difficult to remove with floss.  I use it after every meal.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I ordered the \\&quot;countertop\\&quot; version of this product, mainly because of the water storage capacity.  I don&#x27;t think the hand-held version would be sufficient. I understand there is also a water flosser that you can attach to your showerhead, which would might be a good option for some - unlimited water, warm water, too (important if you have sensitive teeth), and no storage issues.  Drying the unit after use takes up a lot of precious real estate - bathroom counter space.  But if you are trying to conserve water and want the option to water floss out of the shower, this unit is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Power switch and pressure adjustment knob are a bit difficult to use with one hand without tipping over the unit. Handle assembly failed within two years (button jammed and water leaks out of handle) and costs $15 with shipping to replace. For less money, check out the Interplak.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my waterpik purchase.  The product is very well make and simple to use.  It took a little bit of getting used to, but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting as wet as I had been at the beginning.</li>
    <li> This is it..  Don&#x27;t waist your money on the cheaper models. I have had water piks for many years and this is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a 20 year old model that I am having a hard time finding replacement water pick when they ware out.  The new one works ok but I like the design and features of my old one.  Had not choice but to get the new onw.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet. I like the pressure. I put it up to ten. Afterwards, my teeth are so smooth, shiny and clean, it&#x27;s rewarding. Sometimes I do have to fill the reservoir twice, but what&#x27;s the big deal about that?!?!?  I personally don&#x27;t mind since it has other features I enjoy. It has a lid to store the nozzles and to cover the reservoir. It also comes with nozzles. It&#x27;s a good size and I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on my bathroom counter. It&#x27;s not an eye sore. I recommend this product to anyone tired of flossing. : ) It&#x27;s so much easier and thorough.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased this waterpik on my dentists recommendation. I have had it for about one month now without any issues. I find that it works well and is convenient.    This model far surpasses the older model that my parents had years ago.  It is smaller, less noisy, has a covered reservoir, and addition small features like the rotating grip which make is stand out.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the Waterpik. I bought my first one (also from Amazon) about two years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the Waterpik. Ever since I have been using it, my hygienist always comments on how well maintained my teeth are and how there is little to no plaque at all. I also like that you can change the cleaning accessories to what you specifically want cleaned. It cleans well between the gums and teeth, which was the primary reason for me buying the Waterpik at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to develop swelling and bleeding in my gums due to particles getting stuck and not having it removed through convential everyday cleaning. After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I haven&#x27;t looked back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets some getting used to at first. The first time I used it, it was messy and my gums weren&#x27;t used to the water pressure. But, as I got used to it, it wasn&#x27;t as messy anymore, and my gums liked the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have never enjoyed flossing, I did it because I wanted to keep my natural teeth.  As much as I dislike flossing, I dislike cheap gadgets more.  I was apprehensive about this Waterpik item because I purchased a Waterpik shower head once and it was absolute trash.  However, the great reviews here convinced me to give the ultra water flosser a try.  The item was very well packaged in its retail box, a good sign.  The item is off good quality and fit.  The lid fits a little loose, but it is great that it completely removes from the container so that you can easily fill the container.  The container holds the right amount of water for thoroughly cleaning all of your teeth.  The little pulses are great at dislodging food between the teeth and the hold button is great for pausing the flow.  It takes a little practice closing your mouth appropriately so that water does not splash everywhere.  Once you master that skill, you&#x27;ll never want to floss with string again.  My unit came with the travel kit, which is great because otherwise I would carry the full unit with me.  The main unit is not overly large and sits steady on the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I am very happy with this unit and I highly recommend that you give it a try.</li>
    <li> This thing really works in cleaning your teeth and its 20 times more enjoyable to use than flossing.  This is no wimpy product; at its highest setting, the water jet out of the nozzle and has enough power to spray across the room.  It works so good that I bought another one for the household.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement and love the improvements. I have peridontal problems that use of the Waterpik has greatly assited in improving my condition. This one is efficient and very easy to use. I would greatly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always taken the best care of my teeth I could, or so I thought. For decades I have flossed twice a day, morning and evening, and brushed with a Sonicare toothbrush. Yet, my dentist insisted that I have a cleaning done three times a year, instead of the more normal two, because he said I needed it.  Then I purchased this Waterpik flosser in March 2014 and have used it faithfully once a day before bed, still brushing with my Sonicare twice a day. After the first cleaning after I began using the Waterpik, the dentist was impressed and said I could go back to a six-month cleaning cycle. Now I have just completed my second cleaning since using the Waterpik and he said I was doing a fantastic job keeping my teeth clean and he didn&#x27;t have to do much at all. Again, don&#x27;t need to go back for six months. And I&#x27;ve stopped using regular floss all together! Buy this item and use it everyday. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I was never one to put much on flossing.  However, with the Waterpik flosser, I am a believer.  I found the direction helpful for getting started.  The heads are easily changed.  I have had mine for a short time; but, long enough to not want to do without it.</li>
    <li> Some people wrote that this unit does not have enough power to throughly clean in between your teeth. All I can say is this, If you can use this unit on setting \\&quot;10\\&quot; and feel that it&#x27;s \\&quot;Not nearly strong enough\\&quot; then I salute you and retire from the argument.     This has revolutionized my oral/dental health, the best 50 dollars you will ever spend, and is sure to save thousands in dental bills.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a waterpick for plauqe control. It definitely does a great job in not only cleaning hard to reach areas but also leaves your mouth feeling very refreshed. I try to use it twice a day but at a minimum of once a day. We&#x27;ll see what the dentist&#x27;s verdict is on my next visit.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of the waterpik for many years.   This product, although more streamlined, does not have the power of the older models.  This has many more applications for brushes, picks etc. and the design ok but the power not as good.  I was disappointed in this new model.  I would have returned but did not want the hassle.  I called the company and was told to return quickly and they would test the motor but I decided not to send back.   It is usable but in comparison to my older model just not as good.  I would not repurchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I bought one previously from Costco. It arrived, as usual from Amazon, overnight. When I tried to use it, it was dead-on-arrival. Enclosed right on top of the unit was a card that said: \\&quot;STOP, Need help? Call us. We&#x27;re here to help. Water Pik representatives are ready to help with any questions about your new Water Flosser.\\&quot;       The customer representative, what can I say? She treated me like a complete idiot. The thing did not work. It did not run. Dead. I could hear the AC hum from inside the unit when it was turned on. So, it was getting power. The Water Pik helper suggested I put water in it. Gee, I never thought of that, the name WATER Pik being somewhat vague. Well, I did it anyway. Of course, it remained dead. Then the ultra helper asked me to put the phone down next to the machine so she could listen to it. Feeling more stupid by-the-minute, I did so. I felt like an actor on Seinfeld. I told this woman that the thing was dead, but, taking me for, are all Water Pik customers idiots? No, she had to hear it because I was obviously lying to her. I told the Water Pik representative I was very disappointed in their quality-control. She responded that \\&quot;If I didn\\&quot;t like it, take it back!\\&quot;        American company making their product in China with poor quality control. I already have one of these; &#x27;had it for over two years. I guess I know how to use it. &#x27;pretty good product; fifty-percent reliability rate.        So, I asked for this representative&#x27;s supervisor. I got a recording. What a company. What&#x27;ve they got? Two people in customer service? There should have been a replacement product coming to me as I write this. Instead, I have to dry the thing out, repack it, send it back to Amazon.        What a crock.</li>
    <li> I have posted feedback already.  Very pleased with the Waterpik which we purchased to replace an old one from another company.  The Warerpik surpasses our expectations.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This Waterpik&#x27;s main improvement is much quieter operation. The tank is easier to get on and off. I got rid of an Interplak unit because of the wrestling match required to remove the tank (I eventually broke it in the process). I also prefer this unit&#x27;s sleek design rather than the older square look. The only reason the Waterpik didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it needs more storage for all the tips. That&#x27;s another point-new tips are a bit pricey. Overall though, a great \\&quot;pik.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This model is quite , powerful, work excellent, clean debris and plaque from your teeth and gums effectively , stylish and nice size, convenient lid serving as storage and cover.  Amazon&#x27;s price of [...] is excellent with free shipping and carry a three year warranty ! it&#x27;s awesome.   True product description, good quality, does the work well, stylish, good price, quick shipping, good service from Amazon. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Its good. Strong but I have had stronger pik&#x27;s. Maybe I&#x27;m just not sensitive to them. Seems like the water gets jammed or doesn&#x27;t flow out properly sometimes? But the water chamber is a great size, gives you plenty of time. The hand held pik&#x27;s don&#x27;t have enough water and you have to refill them. Thats too much work!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT  I USE IT EVERY NIGHT..NOW LOOKING FOR ONE TO TRAVEL WITH</li>
    <li> I am a real person writing this real review.  The reason why I am taking time out of my schedule to rate a product that I have bought (I don&#x27;t usually rate items I buy) is that I am extremely satisfied with this waterpik that I recently purchased.  I have had gum disease for a really long time and every time I brush my teeth I ALWAYS bleed.  I have been skeptical about buying things but trust me this is a great investment for the long run.  I have had my waterpik now for about 1 month and I have seen dramatic results!!!  I don&#x27;t bleed anymore when I brush!!!  Imaging using a pressure hose to clean your car.  That high pressure water will get into every nook and cranny of your car and get everything out!!  The same concept is applied in this product.  Its like using a pressure hose to clean your teeth!!  The pressure goes from 5 psi to 90 psi with 10 pressure settings that you can control.  I started out at 2 with very much bleeding (yeah my gums were that bad!!!) and now I am at pressure setting 8!!!  The water jet blasts its way through all bacteria.  But keep in mind you must be committed to using this product and brushing your teeth.  Like all regimens, it is only effective if you use it every day!!!  So dont get lazy on cleaning your teeth or you will lose them!!!  This is one of the greatest buys i&#x27;ve ever made and I am absolutely positive you will get cleaner more healthier set of gums!!!  And no Im not a person from the company that makes this product or a person from amazon trying to sell this item.  I am a real deal customer who bought this item and is enjoying the benefits of this item!!!  Buy it and you will see for yourself!!!!</li>
    <li> We got this unit because the hose on our Braun Water Pick dried out and cracked, and this whole unit, with free shipping from Amazon, cost less than half the price of the replacement parts for the Braun.    I decided I needed something like this after $5000 worth of dental work, and my dentist recommended it. The first few times I used it after first cleaning my teeth with a brush, I was amazed how much stuff I could see in the white sink that had washed out! I suspect that if I&#x27;d been using this all along, I might not have needed that dental work.    I miss the neat little aerator that the Braun used to break up the water stream, but I never used the Braun much anyhow---only my wife did occasionally. I read in reviews that the Braun had more pressure; but the Waterpik Ultra has enough pressure in the highest range to make me uncomfortable, and so I back it off.     I wish it were made more substantially, but it&#x27;s built as well as the Braun; and when the hose goes, not only will the parts be cheaper and more available, but the hose/handle assembly installs externally, unlike the Braun that needs to be completely overhauled.     It seems like an excellent purchase, and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and have been a dental phobic for many years. When I finally got the courage to see the dentist, and to get ALL the work done, my teeth were in pretty bad shape. I had gum disease that required a deep cleaning and being on a special mouth rinse for a month. But when I went back for a follow up, my \\&quot;numbers\\&quot; were still bad. You know what those numbers are - it&#x27;s when the dentist takes that evil metal probe and pokes at each tooth around the gum line to measure how deep the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; are. My numbers were mostly fives and higher, including a couple tens in the back. They were talking about gum surgery and extractions as being the next option, and referred me to a periodontist for a consult. I left the dentist office, drove straight to Target and bought the Waterpik Ultra, which I&#x27;ve been using every day for a month. I saw the periodontist today and he could not believe the improvement in ONE month. My \\&quot;numbers\\&quot; had all gone down to twos and and a few threes. I will still need to have work done on two teeth in the back because the damage to the roots is pretty extensive. But he said the rest of my teeth are PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee and tea - the Waterpik blasts away the stains. It gets particles from in between my teeth that flossing alone misses. The attachments are great for special jobs like getting under permanent bridges or cleaning your tongue. I add a fluoride mouth rinse to the water a few times a week to help disinfect and put the fluoride where it&#x27;s needed the most. My teeth are whiter and my gums are healthier than they&#x27;ve been in many years. If you&#x27;re on the fence about investing in this machine, BY IT TODAY!</li>
    <li> This product is very good and has settings 0 to 10 for power.  I wish the power was just a bit stronger to get under my bridge work.  Othewise,  this product is a great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much easier and fun to use than dental floss. My whole family loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought waterpik ultra water flosser ,it does a fantastic job.I have had a waterpic before,they have been around for years.Just don&#x27;t be stretchen on the waterpik hose real hard.Once you have one you won&#x27;t go back to floss.Good service ,good product.That,s all that needs to be said.</li>
    <li> I returned this product. I used it for at least 14 days and noticed no difference. I didn&#x27;t feel like the pressure was strong enough to really do anything.  I also sometimes didn&#x27;t start even when it was turned on and I had to start and stop it several times to start.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one. The first one overheated and burnt a hole in the white plastic that the reservoir sits on. I have no idea how it did this. No recollection of when it happened other than one day it had it and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.    I emailed support. They were helpful. They kept referring to the following limitation: \\&quot;do not use this product for more than 5 minutes in each two-hour period. Longer usage can overhead the motor and cause product failure as well as voiding the warranty\\&quot;.    I suspect this is what happened, though I never used it for more than 5 minutes in a day. I suppose somebody else might have turned it on by accident. But that time limitation limits it to one person usage. And you are paying a price for the compact design: not great venting of the heat generated by the motor.    Support sent me a new one. I am unplugging it when I&#x27;m done to make sure nobody accidently turns it on.    It does work well. My gums feel alive afterwards.</li>
    <li> Far superior to Interplak products!  This Waterpik product is well designed and works as intended. The on-off switch and the pressure control dial are nice features as are multiple heads for different purposes. Don&#x27;t even consider Interplak (noisy and leaky)!</li>
    <li> First off, I have to qualify my review by saying that I&#x27;ve never owned a Waterpik-type device before, so I cannot compare this to previous models nor models from other manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;d had many dentists and spent quite a bit of money on their services.  One of my problems has been that I hate to floss, and this has cost me dearly.  If only I could find a way to clean between my teeth, but not hate it like I hate flossing!  Guess what?  Here it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading several dozens of reviews about this product, and being amazed at the extremely high percentage of positive reviews (one of the highest for any product I&#x27;ve researched on Amazon), I decided to get one of these and try it out.  Not wanting to wait, I went out and bought it at the largest big box chain in the world (you know of whom I speak :)  It was twelve bucks more expensive than on Amazon, but if I hadn&#x27;t been in a hurry I would have ordered it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, once home I read the directions (not much there), plugged it in, added water, set the power control on \\&quot;5\\&quot;, the middle pressure setting, and put it to work.  I&#x27;d had a dental cleaning two weeks earlier, and had just rinsed my mouth out with warm water several times before trying this Waterpik, so I didn&#x27;t expect much to happen, if anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned at what came out! It was clear that I had made a very good purchase...  You see, a toothbrush cleans the crowns and sides of the tooth, and flossing cleans between them, and slightly under the gumline between teeth.  However, neither of these clean under the gumline at the sides (out-facing and in-facing) of the teeth; that is what the Waterpik does that the toothbrush and floss cannot.  It also cleans under the gumline between the teeth better than floss, reaching deeper than floss comfortably can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the power setting in the middle at &#x27;5&#x27; and it worked amazingly well, as previously mentioned.  I&#x27;m dubious aboutthe need to go for the higher settings, with some reviews stating that the highest setting could take paint off old furniture.  After all, you only want to dislodge and wash away food particles, not separate your gums from bone!  (Likely this couldn&#x27;t happen in real life, for most healthy people, but underscores the point that excessive pressure is unnecessary, and possibly detrimental.)  Eventually I&#x27;ll try a setting-or-two higher, but my results indicate that it may not be necessary to do the job.  Plus, the higher the setting, the faster you will run out of water in the smallish 20 oz. tank.  (UPDATE: after four years of use, I have found through experimentation with higher and lower settings, that keeping it on the middle &#x27;5&#x27; setting works best for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, fill the tank with &#x27;lukewarm&#x27; water, according to the directions, and have at.  While moving the handpiece around your mouth, don&#x27;t twist the handpiece, instead turn the knob at the end that holds the waterjet attachment to keep it directed at your tooth-gum interface.  At the &#x27;5&#x27; setting the water seems to last maybe a minute or better, give-or-take (I haven&#x27;t timed it).  After using the Waterpik for a week now, this amount of time works out just fine, but when first starting out, I had to refill it one or two times.  Now, one tank fill is all I need because I&#x27;ve better learned how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some mentioned that you&#x27;ll get wet, and if you don&#x27;t use a little care, you will.  Just remember this: water is going into your mouth; unless you plan to swallow all of it, then it&#x27;s gonna come back out, right?  Lean low over the sink when you use this Waterpik and you&#x27;ll be just fine.  Or, stand up straight, complain that the coiled tubing is too short, and let water run down your chest and arm.  When using this product, common sense is optional, but highly recommended.  Even lacking common sense, though, the Waterpik is probably harmless in most ways, but it is great fun to shoot water at the cats, my second-favorite use for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a peroxide-based whitening rinse between flossing and brushing, so now instead of using it like mouthwash before brushing, I just add the same amount to the water as I fill the Waterpik tank, and it makes the cleaning experience even better.  However, remember that some plastic and internal components of the Waterpik are likely sensitive to certain chemicals, so if I add anything other than tap water, I rinse the tank out, and run one-half a tank of plain water through the system to rinse all chemicals out.  The manual states: \\&quot;...Note: use of some antibacterial solutions could shorten the life of your Waterpik®\\&quot;Water Flosser.\\&quot;  Like I said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also (about once a month for me), to help keep the unit sanitized, I will fill the holding tank with a VERY dilute bleach solution, let it sit in the tank for 15 minutes, then turn on the unit and let it run into the sink until almost empty, then turn it off again and let it sit for another 15 minutes to disinfect the internal parts, coiled tubing, and water jet.  Then I rinse out the holding tank, refill it with plain tap water, and run it through the Waterpik to rinse it out good.  Disinfection is even more important if you use well water, or other non-chlorinated water supplies.  Doing this routine with white vinegar is also useful to remove biofilm buildup, which you will have anytime water is stagnant for an extended period of time (especially in warm weather and climates).  In other words, don&#x27;t let your Waterpik sit unused for extended periods of time.  Other reviews have mentioned having black mold forming inside the handpieces, and the truth is this black biofilm will form *anywhere* water is allowed to sit stagnant for too long (this will even happen with chlorinated city water, as the chlorine or chloramines will break down in a short period of time, leaving the water prone to bacterial buildup).  I&#x27;m very surprised that Water Pik, Inc. didn&#x27;t include any sanitizing information in the manual.  Where you have water, you will have bacteria, which loves water as much as we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chlorine and chloramines added to tap water by the city will keep bacterial growth in check, as they are supposed to, but as they kill bacteria, it neutralizes (uses up) the chlorine/chloramines at the same time, so after a while there is no chlorine left; it is spent, leaving the water unguarded, and bacteria will then begin to colonize the water.  The speed with which this happens depends on several factors, and so varies.  It will be worse for some people, and places, than others.  That is why chlorinated water will only keep your Waterpik (or anything else that holds water) clear of most bacteria for only a little while.  Then you start getting the black &#x27;mold&#x27;, the biofilm buildup.  Just so you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT leave the white lid sitting on top of the water holding tank, even when empty, even if you dry it out after use!  Placing the lid on the holding tank when not in use will speed the growth of bacteria!  Covering the water holding tank was only acceptable when the Waterpik was new, in the box, unused, and completely dry.  It is important that any residual water and/or moisture is able to evaporite to the atmosphere.  This is the only way to keep bacterial growth in check, as well as the occasional chemical disinfection, since it is IMPOSSIBLE to completely remove all water from the Waterpik after use.  If you *do* leave the lid on the water holding tank (I know, it does look better with it on), then plan to disinfect your machine more often.  When the water seems to have a bit of a funny taste to it, it&#x27;s usually time to disinfect.  Instead of using the lid, I drape a clean, dry, washcloth over the unit when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING NOTE: As mentioned above, leaving water sitting in *anything* invites bacterial buildup, and the formation of biofilms.  Thus, it is important to empty as much water from inside your Waterpik as possible AFTER EACH USE (it&#x27;s less important if it is used every day, or several times a day).  For instance, after I finish each night&#x27;s use, I...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) remove the water holding tank and shake out any residual water,&lt;br /&gt;2) then hold the handpiece down in the sink to allow as much water as possible to drain from inside the Waterpik and coiled tubing; when the water stops flowing,&lt;br /&gt;3) I remove the clear plastic wand (waterjet) from the handpiece, shake residual water out of the clear wand and handpiece, then place the handpiece back into its holder on the unit, and set the clear jet fitting in the depression at the top of the white Waterpik body where the water tank normally rests,&lt;br /&gt;4) then place the empty water reservoir, UPSIDE DOWN, resting on top of the Waterpik body at a 90 degree angle, so there is plenty of open space for air movement to dry everything out within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very dilute bleach with a dwell-time of 10 or 15 minutes, run through the entire system occasionally, is the best way (along with the steps listed above) to keep the Waterpik clean and disinfected.  Do this occasionally with white vinegar as well, as the vinegar will break up and remove any biofilm build up (any dilute acid would do this, but vinegar is cheap, readily available, and safe).  Keep in mind that although vinegar will remove biofilm build up, it is NOT a very good disinfectant; that is what bleach is for!  I find that by bleaching once a month, I have no biofilm build up, and therefore only vinegar my Waterpik maybe twice a year.  However, if you have hard water (most areas of the country), then vinegar treatments will be needed more often to remove mineral buildup (a dry, white-ish powder or stain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have not sanitized their Waterpiks, I would recommend using full-strength white vinegar first to remove biofilm.  If there is a lot coming out, I&#x27;d rinse out the Waterpik and repeat the vinegar procedure.  Once the vinegar comes out fairly clean, then rinse the system out again with a full tank of tap water, THEN do the dilute bleach procedure.  After that, bleaching every other week, or maybe once a month (it depends), will be sufficient to keep biofilm build up at bay, and then vinegar won&#x27;t be needed so often.  Also know that bleaching too often will degrade components of your Waterpik, so don&#x27;t bleach any more often than necessary.  Vinegar will probably not cause any damage to your Waterpik, unless left in for unreasonable periods of time.  Just run vinegar through, then rinse it out; you can let it dwell for awhile before rinsing, if you wish.  Quick and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also very important, *** NEVER MIX ANYTHING WITH BLEACH!***  Never try to do the bleaching and vinegar at the same time!  This is mixing an acid and a base; bad idea, as it will produce some very unhealthy fumes, and such a concoction will likely damage your Waterpik, you, and your cats.  Think of the cats!!  Always thoroughly rinse out the Waterpik after using anything other than water in it, such as bleach, vinegar, or mouthwashes.  This may seem like a lot of work but your teeth are worth it, and this will also help your Waterpik last longer.  If you bleach and vinegar your Waterpik on the same day, always do a fresh water rinse between the vinegar and bleach processes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if/when you bleach the unit, use very dilute bleach, as strong bleach, or dilute bleach left in the unit too long, will likely damage components of the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And, just to be clear, never use the Waterpik in your mouth with bleach!  Common sense, I know, but I feel I should add that... and the vinegar probably wouldn&#x27;t taste very good either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the unit itself: many other reviews mentioned the many accessories that come with this unit and how most of them are useless; I agree.  I use the &#x27;basic&#x27; waterjet fitting, the clear one, and that&#x27;s probably the only one I&#x27;ll ever use.  The others are more specialized, such as people who have braces, deep gum pockets, inexplicably dirty tongues, etc.  But I might try the toothbrush fitting someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise-wise, the Waterpik is a little loud, but I&#x27;ve never used any previous Waterpik units to compare it to, so all I can say is that I don&#x27;t find it excessively loud.  I put two dry, folded, washcloths under it to dampen the noise, and it helps (acoustic decoupling from the countertop, cabinet, and walls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, do yourself a huge favor and buy a Waterpik!  And *especially* if you have kids, buy one for them too!  I&#x27;ve even given these as gifts; I wish I&#x27;d known about them long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Before I used this Waterpik, my twice-annual teeth cleanings would take forever, and on a few occasions, lasted so long that I actually had to come back in a second time for the cleaning to be finished!  Now, my cleanings rarely last more than 15 minutes, and I am always complimented on how good my gums are and the very low plaque buildup.  Wohoo!  BTW, I have not flossed since buying this (except when traveling when I don&#x27;t have the Waterpik with me).  Many people still floss, but I hate flossing, and wondered how much good it would do to just use this Waterpik instead of flossing, and it seems to be working out great for me, two years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been used nightly, for a little over 2 years now, and still works like the day I bought it.  The only problem has been the button on the handle to temporarily stop the water flow sticks, but resets when I turn the Waterpik off, but I don&#x27;t consider this a major issue; I&#x27;d still buy this Waterpik again without pause, and I will when this one conks out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Dec. 2013:  This Waterpik is still working great, used nightly.  One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Still highly and strongly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Mar. 2014:  Still working great.  Money well spent!</li>
    <li> I bought this item some time ago (1 yr+) It has held up very well and does exactly what I need.  I like the variable speeds that enable you to work up to the blasting pressure.</li>
    <li> Looks very nice with extra tools for alternative uses.  Doesn&#x27;t seem powerful enough like the old model which I used for many years. It appeared to be the best on the market at the moment.</li>
    <li> This is really the best thing for you teeth and gums since the toothbrush.  I give it 5 stars, however I would like it even better if the pressure was stronger and the water tank was larger.  All in all, this is a great buy for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to have enormous bills from the dentist.</li>
    <li> My friend bought this at Target and was learning to use it.  I decided the idea of the waterpik was a good one. So I went to amazon.com and bought me one.  I love it.  I am terrible at flossing.  I hate it.  But I love using my waterpik.  I use it after most meals.  My teeth feel clean...very clean.  At first it is a bit difficult because you are squirting everything...I even squirted my cat.  But after a week, you too will be a pro. I love it so much, I bought a travel waterpik.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST way to floss.  I like how you can change the water pressure.  I do not have very sensitive gums, so I like putting this at the highest setting, and flossing that way.  This beats the normal way of flossing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Waterpik several months ago. I liked it so much I order one for both of my sons. It&#x27;s a total mouth care system with a brush attachment, a tongue cleaner, a rubber tip for tight in-be-tween teeth cleaning and a basic jet. All attachments spray a steam of water.  I hate flossing and you really should still floss, but the spraying of warm water on my gums feel much better. The intensity of the water can be adjusted. It takes a little while to get use to it so you don&#x27;t spray the mirror or your face, but it&#x27;s well worth it. The only reason I gave it a 4 is I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how long the unit will last.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically and only for braces maintenance purpose only for my daughter. What an excellent small investment $ to insure your return on a big investment $$$! She uses it all on her own which is the big key as it is fun and easy to use and refreshing afterwards. I could give all the specific specifics but I&#x27;m just a real consumer and not a marketing rep disguising as one! Besides plenty of other reviews will do that for you. I can&#x27;t see going wrong on purchasing this. I greatly rec-O-mend it. Show your gums, teeth, and those who might smell your breath some love and concern!</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase. I have two kids so no time to floss. The dentist recommend I use this. I love it. You do have to use the top setting to get a good clean. However, it is awesome and addictive. I use it daily...or sometimes twice. It really feels like a \\&quot;dentist visit\\&quot; without all the time/energy. I recommend this to everyone and anyone. It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I FOUND THE PRODUCT TO BE JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDER IT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAT I HAVE A NEW SMILE AND LESS DENTAL WORK TO BE DONE AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 months. I have never felt this fresh with just brushing &amp; flossing. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I priced this item in stores like WalMart and it was much cheaper thru Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for years and this particular model is more compact and comes with additional accessories in its own storage container. Very easy to use... really a great deal!</li>
    <li> It works, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Works better than flossing to get out crap from inbetween your teeth. I deducted 1 star because the cord is too short for me to use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice.I can&#x27;t get the hang of how to keep the bathroom dry while using it.I have decided that using it in the shower might be the best option.The power is great though,and it has many uses.</li>
    <li> My wife was complaining because I had \\&quot;dragon breath\\&quot;, so I went to the dentist and had a thorough cleaning and they found tiny pieces of food stuck under my dental bridge towards the back where it was impossible for me to floss or get anything in there for that matter. My dentist recommended the Waterpik and said that within a couple of weeks, I&#x27;d be good as new. I&#x27;ve used it faithfully for the past 3 weeks and I can honestly say, this thing works extremely well - no more dragon breath. Tiny poppy seeds from my bagel, or anything else for that matter, don&#x27;t stand a chance - the powerful stream flushes them out easily. If you have any type of dental work such as bridges, braces, etc., I highly recommend this unit - the various attachments will definitely help you in keeping your teeth and gums nice and clean. FYI - use warm water - failed to heed the instructions and made the mistake of using cold water: very painful experience.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a consistent flosser prior to buying this product but am now convinced that it is hugely effective in  preventing tooth decay.  As you use the Water PIc you see all kinds of food particles wash  into the sink - particles that were previously between your teeth or under your gums. The  \\&quot;more important than brushing\\&quot; mantra we&#x27;ve all heard seems to be true. This product, coupled with a Sonic Toothbrush seem to me to be the ultimate combination for good home dental care.  Also, it frees you up from the string flossing that is obviously less effective and takes longer.    Robert Cobb</li>
    <li> I am quite disappointed. I had a WaterPik for years which finally gave out. I bought this new one -made in China of course, and it just seems cheaper. Thinner gauge plastic I believe, ill-fitting lid, leaky wand and water delivery is uneven.    To top it off- they do not include two of the most used tools for more than one person but give six one of a kind tools like orthodontic tool and two with brushes. You have to order another set if 2 people want to use the same type tool.    I bought WaterPik because of it&#x27;s reputation and my previous good experience with it but I fear that reputation may be going down the drain if you will pardon the expression.</li>
    <li> I have been using this water pick for the last two months, I consider it a piece of junk,It leaks terribly and no way to fix it.</li>
    <li> Excellent!, a bit messy at first as water splashes all over, but after a few days of practice everything is under control. My hubby loves it.</li>
    <li> I have flossed almost every day for the past 20+ years.  I had good check ups, until lately when my dental hygenist suggested purchasing this device, and recommended the perioprotect product.  I read the positive reviews and decided to try it.  It lives up to all of it&#x27;s positive comments and then some.  Recently I had my next check up.  My gums were in much better shape.  The perioprotect was deemed unnecessary.  I would never have believed it could clean better than flossing until having tried it myself.</li>
    <li> Recieved item quickly. Was very pleased with the quality and it works better than I expected. Water Pic products have stayed high in their quality and always seem to be a step above the rest.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended product not only for the dentally challenged.  You could floss and brush, then use the waterpik, and witness a tremendous difference in the look feel and heath of your teeth and gums. If you do have tightly spaced teeth or other anomalies this product is a dream come true. On this particular model the option to share is tough, the attachments are singular.</li>
    <li> Works really good.  Can be a little messy, but once you get a hang of using it, not a problem.  Excellent price, especially since shipping was free.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old son, got braces  about a month ago. This waterpik has been a lifesaver! It is powerful enough for him, yet gentle enough for my 7 year old daughter. It comes with several diffrent heads to choose from. If I could afford to buy for every person I know, i would.....  If you choose this product you are going to be happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to use with her braces.  It works great in keeping the braces free of food when brushing alone does not work.  It is a little messy if she is not careful with the pause button, so I just make sure she uses it over the sink.</li>
    <li> Have had Waterpiks for years and love this replacement.  Great to have all the little &amp;#34;jets&amp;#34; in a convenient storage case on top.</li>
    <li> is a wonderful product.  My dad bought me one in the &#x27;70s when they first came out to help me clean my braces.  My daughter&#x27;s orthodontist \\&quot;gave\\&quot; her one as part of her treatment.  My dentist recommended that I use one to clean my bridge, which I had never considered the Waterpik as useful for anything other than cleaning braces.  My gums were rated 7 and now are rated 1-2 after a few months of use in conjunction with a Sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Bought this unit to replace my worn out waterpic. It works great! It is much quieter that the last one and although the cord is a little short it a joy to use. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking to keep their smile bright and clean!</li>
    <li> can be a bit messy (water splashing all over the place even when on the lowest power), but still very good!</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and loved how it worked. Then bought more of same for my brother, and both of my children.&lt;br /&gt;This is really an easy to use and effective way to keep you teeth and mouth feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have problems with our gums.  No matter how often we floss, we were still having some issues.  Now we have the Waterpik and it&#x27;s amazing how much flossing misses.  With all the different types of accessories you get, all problems can be dealt with.  We are very glad we made this purchase!  I wish it came with 2 of at least the basic nozzles so more than one person can use it.  We had to purchase additional accessories for that reason and they are hard to find other than ordering on line. Local stores do not carry them for some reason.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 months, and it performs up to my expectations.  I&#x27;ve only tried the one standard attachment, and I use the product at its highest setting.</li>
    <li> The Water Pic is great.  Easy to use and very good for dental health.</li>
    <li> Definitely this is the best sub $50 dental item I have ever bought.  I have a constant problem with my gums receding.  Dentists kept saying I was brushing too hard or grinding my teeth at night, but even with very gentle brushing and wearing mouthgards at night it never went away.  Until this thing came along!    I started out on a 1 or 2 setting, and over a couple weeks, made my way up to a 6.  I can&#x27;t go any higher than that without it starting to be uncomfortable, and the water starts misting inside my mouth and getting into my sinuses.  I use an Oral B Vitality electric toothbrush first, then floss, then move on to this thing.  It&#x27;s amazing to watch all the extra crap coming out from between my teeth and from my gums.  I follow all this up with mouthwash, and my teeth are literally squeaky clean.  No more low gum lines, no more bleeding gums, and no more fillings needed for pre-cavities between my teeth!    The only \\&quot;limitations\\&quot; I&#x27;ve found with this thing: The water that comes out when you first turn it on is really cold from sitting for 24 hours.  I let it run for about 10 seconds after filling it with warm water pointed directly at the drain, then press the pause button and put it in my mouth and start.  Also, it recommends that you drain any remaining water after you finish, but I don&#x27;t think this is necessary if you use it daily.      The nice part about the multiple tips if a bunch of people can use it.  My girlfriend wasn&#x27;t really a fan of it, so I just leave the one tip on it (figuring it&#x27;ll limit wear and tear).  Mine has developed a loud rattle in the handle, but there&#x27;s no indication of any leaking or failure.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple months now.  I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found a waterpik yet that lasted more than a year. Too bad they don&#x27;t make a product that lasts.</li>
    <li> I have been a huge Waterpik fan for years, since I came into possession of an older model a while back. It was ugly and made a heck of a racket, but it had great pressure. A few months ago it started spitting out little black specks--chunks of gasket rubber, as I understand--so I ditched it and started looking for a new model. I had this one in my Amazon cart for months, thinking I&#x27;d eventually get around to purchasing it when I could spare a couple of extra dollars... Recently I went for a dental cleaning and, despite daily flossing, it was the second worst of my life...so I bought the Ultra. I like the smaller footprint and the higher tank capacity, and I love the quieter pump. My gums feel great. I&#x27;d prefer more pressure, but then, I think I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied unless it went to 11 and was able to blast my teeth out of my head. There are more attachments than I need, but I like that they&#x27;re hidden away in the tank lid. I have another cleaning next week, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes. Whatever the outcome, I&#x27;m happy with my Waterpik Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Everything went very well.</li>
    <li> It feels good to use! I never thought it would feel so good! The space between me and them almost no teeth, so I was surprised the lovely warm feeling that they rushed between the water column! My gums feel that they have to appreciate the \\&quot;hot glue!\\&quot;  I find this particular part of favorite unit is that it covered, allowing you to clean and protect the glass wand, when you do not use a well-designed mobile part of the above! This means that no trade-off the toothpaste or spit or urine cast or any contamination will splash into them, they have not been used, but they are very convenient to go when you&#x27;re ready to use wall.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these from 7-8 years ago.  The design has changed immensely.  All for the better.  I love the way the handle feels in your hand and the ability to direct the head has become very easy.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Just received my waterpik.  It is terrific and easy to use.  It holds enough water for 90 seconds of use at a time, which is more than enough.  It takes up very little space and is pretty quiet.  The pressure, even at lower settings, is more than sufficient.  My dentist will be pleased to learn that I finally took his advice!</li>
    <li> Well priced on Amazon. The unit recommended by my dentist holds enough water for on session. Not portable like their smaller unit but great for home use. The tubing for the water could be longer.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth WaterPik I&#x27;ve owned and it is far superior to all of the others.  My first WaterPik lasted for 10-15 years and finally had to be discarded when the tubing wore out, so I was very disappointed when I ordered a new one and found that I needed to keep rocking it on the base to get it to seat properly until the water would start flowing.  I complained to the company and received a replacement that worked only slightly better, but lasted for about 4 years until the tubing broke.  The company has solved the problems I found most annoying on the older models:  A cord that never retracted properly (this one folds up compactly at the front); a reservoir that never connected properly to the outlet (this reservoir is held firmly in a 1\\&quot; deep well); a hole that was difficult to get the pick inserted into (the clip on the front of this model works beautifully).  My pause button on the handle doesn&#x27;t work; however, I see no need for the feature and simply turn it off.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for kids (or adults) with metal braces.  There is an ortho-tip that has a fine brush that shoots the water around the braces connectors etc.  I haven&#x27;t tried the tongue cleaner as yet.  To get additional or replacement tips, I am going through Goodmans.net. The shipping is the most reasonable there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had WaterPiks for over 40 years, and I have all of my own teeth, no gum disease, and good oral heath. I had to replace my old WP-60, as the reservoir had cracked, so i considered this one. I always read the reviews, to gain insight, and help decide. Most are very accurate, a few, a bit too highly critical.     First, I find the style of this unit to be much nicer than previous models, and I&#x27;ve owned quite a few over the last 45 years.    The hose is a bit short, but it does coil up nicely, and that is a plus.    Mine does not leak, and previous ones left a puddle that i was always mopping up. I used to keep my old one on a folded up washcloth to catch all the drips.    It is very quiet compared to previous models, I give this a real thumbs up.    I really like the cover, it helps keep it clean, and just looks neater on my vanity.    I would say it blends well style wise, yes, it is mostly blue, but, it&#x27;s like a nice ocean blue that nost of us associate with the ocean.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve successfully used a Waterpik for many years, I know what I&#x27;m expecting and what I&#x27;m looking for. This pictured version exceeded My expectations. Compact, Easy to use, Easy to clean. No muss no fuss! On the other hand, the hand held version isn&#x27;t worth the money at all! Unfortunately they are packaged together at places like Costco and Sam&#x27;s... Probably to find some lucrative way to get rid of the hand held model! Buy the cabinet model and rejoice! Leave the hand held model on the shelf! Overall, this review is cut and dried and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of verbiage! Cabinet model: Exceptional!</li>
    <li> i get food stuck between my teeth everywhere and bleed with all the flossing i have to do.  my gums were inflamed and bleeding often because i could never get rid of all the particles with brushing (use electric) and flossing. my gums bled for the first few times i used the water pic and now i just get clean teath and gums.  my mouth doesn&#x27;t taste as bad in the morning. i love this product and won&#x27;t do without anymore.  wish someone had forced me to use this years ago. hope this helps someone make up their mind positively.</li>
    <li> This is my first Waterpik Flosser, so I did some research and shopped around...smaller footprint than  others I looked at...well thought out design. So far very happy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> A great product at an amazing price..worth every cent.I would recomend  it for everyone who finds flossing exhausting. This works better and faster than flossing. The delivery was a bit slow but worth the wait.  Billy carter.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it it was like coming out of the dentist.  Liked the product a lot and in combination with toothbrush and Listerine, the experience is delightful. Only have it for two months or so.</li>
    <li> I always brushed twice a day or even thrice, used the flosser or go-betweens... but there was times when it had hard to reach places and food residues still left and giving toothache; getting those food pieces out was a hard job - with pain and bleeding.     It took 36 years for my 1st visit to a dentist. By then, I had my gum bleeding and bad breath. From the day 2, my dentist was really pushing me to get the waterpik after my gums are recovered from the heavy cleaning they have done as a result of periodontal disease.     Well, it still took 3 more months before I ordered this unit. Tell you what, after using it first time, I never felt so good. I added a little bit of mouth wash to the lukewarm water. I am now using every time after having food and I can see that the food pieces coming out from the places I can&#x27;t even know that it is there. Also no pain and no bleeding - I use it on 4 ~ 6 pressure setting.      My dentist recommended 3 months visits until my gums have recovered; which I hate and I am not sure if they see me as a nice pray... but I am very positive that the use of waterpik flosser will be reduce that. I might update my review after my next visit.</li>
    <li> My dental hygentist recommended this water pik. Excellent. Has helped with my gum issues a great deal.</li>
    <li> I used to floss with floss but this is so much easier with water, I use it about 3 times a day and will say it&#x27;s simple to use and a good way to floss highly recommend-you&#x27;ll save money on the dentist bills-thanks</li>
    <li> The Waterpic seems to be a five-star so far. I have used it about one month. Getting use to the release button where it is located was a little tricky for me. I released the utensil that was in place a couple of times in error but have mastered that now. Some of the poorer reviews mentioned leaking or the hose coming loose. That has not happened to me at all. When I last used a Waterpic was several years ago until this one. The older models in my opinion were easier to use in that the it was a square design tank that one could handle easier. With that said new models always change and one has to adapt. Overall I would recommend this product.I usually add just a little mouthwash to the water before I start the Waterpick. That makes the water taste good and leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to clean my mouth and teeth. I have used it for a month and will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I had one of the mid priced models which broke after several years.  This unit is quieter which is nice since my wife is often asleep when I use it.  It also seems to give a better stream, perhaps a little thicker and slower for the same momentum.  I&#x27;m glad that I spent the extra money.</li>
    <li> We purchased two of these about a month ago. One for my bathroom and one for my wife&#x27;s. They are really great. It is like power-washing your teeth! The best part is no more floss. When you have bridges flossing is a real pain and you can&#x27;t possible get everywhere like the high pressure water can. My gums no longer bleed and look very healthy.</li>
    <li> This worked great for about 3 months.  Great attachments, easy to use, but broke after about 3 months!  I think the one that attaches to the shower head might be easier and you don&#x27;t have to refill the container every day.</li>
    <li> This product replaces another Waterpic product which simply wore out after many years of service.  This product appears to be identical and is providing wonderful service.  I didn&#x27;t realize how important it was to me until the older product failed.  Then my teeth felt grimy and I was very uncomfortable.  The arrival of the new product resolved that issue!    Yes, I really like the product.  It&#x27;s not perfect but it is very good.  I&#x27;m pleased with it and I&#x27;d be pleased to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Product arrived from Amazon just as advertised.  The Flosser is a very satisfactory product.  And, by the way, the price from Amazon was much better than the price available at local retail stores.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Interplak with Waterpik Ultra and find this product to be superior to the Interplak.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I originally bought the less expensive Waterpik and upon reading the reviews, I returned it and got the Ultra.</li>
    <li> I bought the it [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]] 3 weeks ago and used it everyday.  My mouth feel refresh evertime I use it.  I told my son about it and he went out and got one too.  The water pik is well made and very powerful. I wish I bought it years ago.</li>
    <li> Very nicely package with lots of attachments. Easy to use and store on my bathroom counter. My 20+ year old waterpik had a little more water pressure, but the Ultra has sufficient water pressure when used at the high pressure setting.</li>
    <li> i have had two other water jets and this is the best I have used.  It has great pressure and handy storage for extra tools.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> THE Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser helps keep your gums clean, just wish there was  a way to start the water flow once you turn the unit on without having to hold the blue pause button.</li>
    <li> This jet is the most powerful I have ever had including previous Waterpiks. I have it set for 1/2 power and that is more than enough. If you want a strong burst of water you may want to try this one out.</li>
    <li> Works very well, no complaints other than it&#x27;s bit overpriced</li>
    <li> The item works well but do not buy it from Hammacher Schlemmer! Ever since buying this I started getting catalogs from Hammacher Schlemmer and then I started getting catalogs from other weird companies. Turns out Hammacher Schlemmer sold my name to &amp;#34;Direct Marketing&amp;#34; and they are the ones spamming me with all the crap in the mail! Never again! The product itself however works well. It holds a good amount of water and it comes with a nice assortment of attachments to connect. My only complaint is how LOUD this device is. I&#x27;m always afraid to use it late at night in fear of waking up my neighbors.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a portable Waterpik from amazon, and I like it so much that I also bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for my family. It&#x27;s very convenient and an amazing product at what it does. It&#x27;s the easiest way to keep food and other undesirable objects off of your teeth. The advantage of purchasing the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser over the portable one is that its tank is much bigger and therefore appropriate for a big family. Be aware though, it&#x27;s not a substitute for flossing. According to my dentist, you still need to floss to get the \\&quot;C\\&quot; effect. That&#x27;s, to make that c-like shape and get under the gum. Our family loves this product.</li>
    <li> This unit is not as powerful as the last unit we had. I use it on max pressure of #10 all the time. Not too happy, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
    <li> This is my third waterpik I&#x27;ve owned and I love this one the most! The other two I&#x27;ve purchased were cordless and the battery life was not very long. I never wanted to purchase the regular waterpik due to the size of it but the new ultra I love! It&#x27;s the perfect compact size!</li>
    <li> This is my third water pick, this one is quieter, smaller and has a cover for the water tank. I hope the tube from the tank to the pick holds up better than the past 2</li>
    <li> The product worked very well through the 2yr warranty period, A few months after the warranty expired the plastic handle insides cracked and rendered the Waterpik useless. I like the product and its benefits but the quality is lacking.  Be prepared to buy a new one shortly after the warranty expires!</li>
    <li> Love it! I wish I have this sooner. Can not live without it. My dentist was so surprised about my teeth, so clean.I am 51 year old woman, have braces , so it well worth the money! Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought one of these, it lasted two months before failing. Not interested in going through the hassle of returning and waiting for some reply about how I must have abused this thing. Can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Really helpfull.  My husband told me this is the best Family use order I have ever made.  As a sensitive gum person I can say: If I had the Waterpik many years ago I could keep many of my teeth! :)  Now I know why not too many dentist recommend this product.   Love it!</li>
    <li> Functions well, works to remove debris, includes 6 piks. Dentist recommended to improve gum issues.  If there is a negative, the Waterpik is a little noisy when operating, but that&#x27;s minor compared to the benefit.  Expecting great improvement at next dentist visit. Yes, I would recommend...highly.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  Purchased this product specifically to use the PocketPik tip to clean between gum line and tooth.  After using for a short time, the PocketPik tip attachment cracked and leaked.  Contacted company and they refused to replace the defective attachment (FYI-part RETAILS for $4.50!)  Draw your own conclusion-will no longer use their product.</li>
    <li> This is the first water flosser I have tried.  It works well and comes with a number of attachments.  I don&#x27;t really use most of the extra pieces but they are nice to have for variety&#x27;s sake.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I do not like the tube that connects the hand held part to the unit and I do not like the manual shut off button.  The tube gets kind of stretched out and does not want to fit back into its place.  The button on the handle is awkward to use.  It works, I just don&#x27;t like the feel of it.  That being said the device works properly and does a good job of removing junk from my teeth.</li>
    <li> Works great until it quits and it will quit sooner rather than later. No customer service for a poor quality product. Buy the attach to shower or to faucet type oral irrigator. They work well and are very reliable.</li>
    <li> Great product. Help alleviate my gum pain. Does the job, worth every dollars. Thank you</li>
    <li> have used Waterpiks for a long time and this is the best one yet.  Highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I got this product because my dentist said my teeth were always beautiful but my gums always bled when they looked at them and I should floss more. I hated flossing, and my gums would get very sore. Finally I got this, and it works good from what I can tell.You can&#x27;t actually see the crud coming out of your teeth, so I am assuming its working,and it sprays everywhere so you have to do it with your mouth closed and be prepared.</li>
    <li> The product works great to get food out of the gums and teeth.  Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than Wal-Mart and Costco as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Waterpik for a long time with moderate success except for removing debris between my teeth. Recently I purchased this new model that comes with various tips. The tip equipped with a tiny brush is a genius idea and does wonder to clean between teeth. I do not floss any longer except may be once a month. Even my dental hygienist complimented me and said that I had very little plaque. It is a $50 very well invested.</li>
    <li> Price was right, easy to use, does what it is advertised to do. The only negative is that the water tube could be longer but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Water reservoir is nice and big, unlike past WaterPiks I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This product is really helpful in keeping the gums in good shape.  I would definitely recommend it for anybody. Outstanding.</li>
    <li> I got this flosser for my husband on recommendation from his dentist.  He hates flossing the old fashion way.  This makes it so much easier that he&#x27;s flossing each night.  I also started using it too and love it.  The flosser comes with extra tips so we don&#x27;t have to share the same one.  This works really well with getting out the food that used to get stuck behind my back tooth.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is the Ultra Water Flosser.  I replaced it with one of the hand held rechargeable ones which was nothing compared to this.  I like the variable intensity of pressure.  I have dental implants and this seems to clean them as well as using it for dental cleaning.  An awesome product.  I would highly recommend this one.      Sande K.</li>
    <li> Works okay most of the time.  Sometimes the pump seem to start but water does not jets from the nozzle. Turning off and then on solves the problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recomendation of my dentist but I really don&#x27;t use it everyday like I thought I would.  It&#x27;s too messy and time consuming.  What&#x27;s wrong with a little floss tape instead?</li>
    <li> A must for the home. Does a great job</li>
    <li> I tried this product with regular jet tip. Generally speaking the water stream from the tip does a similar job as  dental floss. I use dental floss to check if all the residues are cleaned up after using waterpik. Sometime I found there was still residue left between teeth.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend introduced this product to me - I have bad teeth but too lazy to floss everyday. Waterpik cleans my month without a lot of trouble, I love it!</li>
    <li> I use to hate to floss my teeth but now I look forward to it everyday...This product is easy to use and clean.  This is great for people having problems with conventional floss.</li>
    <li> We bought a WaterPik this year, after several years of using the other similar product.  It looked like a good product with quite a few optional heads.  However, the flexible tubing connecting the body and the handle/head developed a crack within three quarters, and it quickly became a significant hoel squirting water everywhere.    Such a tool has only life time of 9 months, that&#x27;s all I can say...</li>
    <li> The new design and controls make this the perfect addition to my oral hygene regiment. Complements to the company&#x27;s commitment to excellence.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 year old who wears an expander. Every time he eats, some food gets stuck around the appliance. This helps a lot in cleaning it out. It has a good amount of pressure, in fact he doesn&#x27;t turn it on high because it hurts. Definitely recommend for those wearing dental appliances.</li>
    <li> So far a great purchase.  I was skeptical, but my teeth/gums have never been cleaner</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my teeth and how clean they feel. Highly recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> I received this waterpik for Christmas I love it, the adjustable pressure and button on the handle to stop the flow of water makes this a great product and the variety of tips is very nice; Also I have had waterpiks in the past and this on is less bulky and runs quieter.( still makes noise just not as much as the older ones)</li>
    <li> The Ultra water pik more than met my expectations.  A good feature is how the handle is held securely when in the correct place and the cord stores very neatly below.  I also like the multiple tips that are enclosed and they are very easily changed.</li>
    <li> I bought this water pik for my husband who has extensive bridge work,and teeth problems.He has been using it for 2weeks and so far has had a vast improvement in the gums</li>
    <li> This seems like a good product. I especially like that there is a 1-10  water pressure setting control.Easy to follow directions which allowed me to figure it out on my own and use it right away.</li>
    <li> Despite being slightly messy, this machine did not disappoint me at all.  The only problem is that it seems weak if you do not use one of the two highest settings.  Overall I give it an A.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t live with out this, not much else to say. Love it, makes mouth much cleaner than just floss and brush. New design is better than last design, but any water pik is better than no water pik. I also have the portable waterpik for on the go cleaning.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik ultra dental water jet is a fine product.   combined with flossing the product keeps my teeth in good condition.</li>
    <li> I had to buy a new one because my sister tried mine and loved it so much, I had to give it to her! :)</li>
    <li> Based on the 1000+ reviews and overall 4.5 star rating I decided that I was going to try one of these.  I simply do not floss often enough and needed something to help me take better care of my gums.    So, I read the reviews and decided to try this thing.    All I can say is that I wish I had done this a long time ago.  Between the Waterpik and my Sonicare toothbrush it feels like I just left the dental hygienist&#x27;s chair every time I finish with my teeth.  It&#x27;s that good.  The two together are unbelievable.    To give you an idea of how well this thing works - the night before I got mine delivered I had eaten some popcorn.  I had some stuck between my teeth so I flossed and picked to try and get it all out.  I thought I had.  The next day as soon as I opened the box I tried out the Waterpik.  I was comfortable using it at a \\&quot;6\\&quot; setting and it blasted out all kinds of stuff that I could see including bits of popcorn.  Two days later I&#x27;m comfortable using it at \\&quot;8\\&quot; and it does an incredible job each time.    If you&#x27;re deciding that it&#x27;s time to get serious about your dental health and want to focus on your gums more, like I did, do yourself a favor and get one of these.</li>
    <li> All the other reviews I&#x27;ve read on AMAZON for this unit, listed before today (January 21, 2010) are accurate, and I love the unit as much as all the other consumers. BUT! Now ordering my FOURTH unit in just over two years, having two units fail within that time as described below. There is a major design / engineering flaw that makes the unit useless when it fails. I like the unit so much, because it has done wonders for my gums too, so, I have a back up unit ready and waiting when it breaks; just like it did this morning, halfway through my preventative maintenance. Just above the blue pause button on the handle, there is a convenient rotating knob to aim the water flow. And, just below that rotating knob, inside the handle, whatever holds it all together, breaks apart and the whole top falls off, along with the rotating knob. With my first unit, I glued the thing back together with some difficulty, while I was waiting for the second unit to arrive. It worked, but the restricted rotation (NONE) made it more difficult to aim into all the crevices, especially in the back of the teeth.    I hope WATER PIK reads this, or is already working on re-tooling / redesigning this very weak connection. I suppose they may get the point after so many are returned to them; I CAN\\&quot;T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO IS HAVING THIS PROBLEM!?!</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using Waterpik my 6 month dental cleanings have been a pleasure.  I had some problems with gum disease prior to using the Waterpik.  This product resolved all of my issues.  My dentist spends much less time during cleanings and said my gums are in good shape.  As always, Amazon had the best price and delivered the product within three or four days.</li>
    <li> best thing I could have ever done for teeth I use it every day love it</li>
    <li> This thing rocks.  Amazon saved me fifteen dollars over local purchase.  Dentist suggested I get this, as my thirty fourteen teeth are starting to show some signs of age.  I can&#x27;t hang with the high settings, but it seems to work, and my dentist can notice the difference. Received yesterday, two days early, dentist appointment this morning.  She said I was doing a good job flossing, and was suprized when I told her I was using the waterpik instead.</li>
    <li> Compared to previous models, this item is a joke. The motor is so weak, even cranking it up all the way won&#x27;t generate much pressure. Worse, it only holds maybe 90 seconds worth of water. This means it constantly has to be refilled while in use.  Waterpik really failed with this model.</li>
    <li> Simply stated..The Waterpik ultra flosser is in a class by itself even though for me the price seems a bit high.....I cant compare it to other similar items because it out performs them easily.  Enough said : )</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the extra features included with this unit. Extra tips, a brush head for brushing your teeth, a tongue scraper, and a newly designed tank with the consumer in mind. Definitely a value bargain!</li>
    <li> This item is a surprisingly compact size, works just like it should. Great value, definitely would recommend to others. Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> Allows me to remove food particles from areas I had a hard time getting with my toothbrush and dental floss.  Wish I  had bought this ago.</li>
    <li> I love using this so much and when i went to the dentist for my regular checkup, i was complimented about how well i took care of my teeth. I loved it so much that i got another one for my parents and they love it too.</li>
    <li> Did you hear my screams?  Last night I reached for my trusty Water Pik and hit the switch, just as I had thousands of times before.  I was expecting to be rewarded with a stream of pulsating warm water in my mouth and little food bits in the sink that were missed by brushing and flossing.  Instead of that, I was doused by water shooting all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little plastic hose that connects the handset to the base had sprung a leak, just at the point where it joins the handset. I guess the plastic had become brittle with age and repeated bending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spin around amazon and the water pik corporate web sites shows replacement handset assemblies for $9-$15.  Amazon conveniently reminds me that I bought the entire unit from them in 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I guess five years of water piking are not too much to ask from a little appliance.  Overall, I have to say that this water pik was pretty reliable, and I don&#x27;t want to live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest in peace, my old friend.  I&#x27;ll be replacing you with your younger sister.</li>
    <li> Works great. Our son had trouble cleaning his gums because he recently got braces. The orthodontist recommended a Waterpik. He&#x27;s been using it every night and his gums look much better. It&#x27;s a little messy to use, but gets easier with practice. The demonstration video on the Waterpik website shows a man using while dressed in a nice suit. Don&#x27;t try that at home ;)</li>
    <li> Got my Waterpik quickly and it is everything I thought it would be.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Hose too short. Highest power setting is about mid range of old unit. Should have saved old unit and replaced the hose as new unit has only half the power as old one did. Don,t know where to go for service parts i.e. hose and attachments?</li>
    <li> This new design is horrible. The water resevoir holds less than the old model.&lt;br /&gt; Both the holder of all the individual pick pockets and othere tips, broke, as did the holder of the handle, within a few months after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;  The whole design of this waterPik is ugly, too.&lt;br /&gt; WHY did they change the design from the original model, which was also more durable.&lt;br /&gt;This new one is an expensive piece of junk.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift to my son.  It&#x27;s exactly what he needed and he uses it every day.  Waterpik is a good brand and stands behind its product.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is just what the doctor/dentist ordered!  I&#x27;m pleased with the product and the resultant cleanliness after each use.</li>
    <li> There is no better water flossing product than this model.  Even other Waterpiks don&#x27;t match up.  In IMHO, it is a best buy.  I have used this model for years.  I was diagnosed with gum disease in 2005 and thought I was going to lose my teeth.  I bought this product as part of my treatment plan.  I have routine cleanings three times a year at the dentists as well.  I have been free of gum disease ever since.  My dentist credits my &amp;#34;home care&amp;#34; for the success.</li>
    <li> I used a waterpik on the high pressure setting, and because of the tip design, it&#x27;s difficult to properly shoot the stream perpendicular to the inner sides of teeth, especially the front teeth.  Within days many of my teeth became perceptibly loose, and my periodontal disease is minimal, with healthy gums.  I&#x27;ve come to realize that my improper use of repeatedly shooting significant pressure down the gum pocket must have separated the gingival connective tissue and even irritated the periodontal ligament that holds the teeth to bone.  I just hope it will reverse over time.  The significant dangers of this device definitely need to be better known.</li>
    <li> Works great and is very powerful and durable.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is an excellent option for ultra cleansing of the mouth. It lasts longer and it is effective.. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser WP 100 is backed by a three-year warranty which is the good part. You need not keep replacing often..            This was actually recommended by my friends who had gum problems and I ignored it at that time. But now I regret of not using this product even earlier.           I used to string floss which takes time and sometimes you do not the patience to do it everyday. This is a great alternative and since it comes with six different types of color coded tips , it is just amazing....           I love the Plaque Seeker Tip and the Classic Jet Tip the most. It does the work perfectly and keeps the gums and teeth healthy and strong. The reservoir is just the right size and it does a good job......Lets come to the price which is a little ok..   because you buy it once and it comes for a looong time.. That is wonderful. Overall I love this product.</li>
    <li> Excellant product for the cost.  As advertised I found the flosser to have wnough power to good a good job. Additionally the water canister holds enugh water for a thorough rinse, and is very easy to refill.  I would reccommend this product to all wishing a easy to use and powerful water pic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a waterpik before.  My friend recently had adult braces &amp; she knew I was planning to get them as well. She recommended this purchase and it is WONDERFUL! not to get too graphic but I floss every night now with my braces &amp; brush, and the waterpik manages to loosen MORE gunk from between my teeth! AMAZING! I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy another one that was less expensive but had mediocre reviews.</li>
    <li> :Love it. Have braces at age 61. THis is the best for cleaning under the braces and between the teeth. So easy to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Trying to get friends to buy one. Never used one before and am so glad my dental hygienist told me to get this one</li>
    <li> I really like the &amp;#34;Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser&amp;#34;. It has an appealing appearance. I really like the convenient storage area, and the adjustable water pressure.</li>
    <li> Not worth the $[...]. It is now gathering dust. Since I couldn&#x27;t get parts for my Interplak, I took the hose off the Waterpik and put on my old (but powerful) Interplak. It&#x27;s a shame that the 5 star rating of the Waterpik doesn&#x27;t hold up. My 9 year old Interplak does the job!</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpick, it is great and no nned to refil water tank, it leaves your mouth very clean and with added mouse wash to the water, you feel fresh and clean</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  It is easy to use and my mouth feels nice a fresh.  It is great for flossing the hard to reach areas behind the teeth where I have problem with plaque build up.  I hope my dentist will see improvement.</li>
    <li> For a while I hesitated to make a review of this product because while I was using it I had some troubles with waterpik hose. It is very taut and hard to use it without sliding back and forth the unit ( I placed a rag under it).I was hoping the hose would get softer the more I used it. It did not happen. Also, unit cover is very susceptible to fall into the tank and you have to very carefully while using it. My daily application was to clean my teeth using median speed. After this I would fill the tank with clean lukewarm water to ensure the system unit was thorougly cleaned.   My concerns were confirmed last night when unit failed to work. The motor runs but the unit does not sucks the water and of course the hose and pick do not get get water and it does not spin. I checked the grommet in the tank and tried to fix but it did not work.  It is a real shame. More than fifty dollars for a unit I used a few months. I don&#x27;t understand the poor quality of this unit. When I bought it I gave to my wife an Interplak water pick I had used for about 8 years with no problems. You can imagine 8 years without a single failure. Now, I guess I have to share with wife the old unit which is reliable, it has a nice soft hose, and it never slides in bathroom counter while I am cleaning my teeth.  It is an experience I have to learn from  Joseph</li>
    <li> Recent dental work requires the use of a waterpik.  I purchased the Ultra after reading reviews and am very happy with the devise.</li>
    <li> The item shipped out along with my Sonicare toothbrush that I ordered at the same time.  Product arrived ahead of schedule and is exactly as described in the listing.</li>
    <li> This one is much quieter than my old Waterpik which lasted 8 years!  Hope this new one lasts just as long.  Takes up less space also.</li>
    <li> Waterpik has a wonderful product, they just need to make it a little more user friendly. Like a bigger water tank and possibly a bigger unit all together. I would go into detail, but Waterpik has been around for years, with the same design. They have to have an idea for updating by now. But this still beats regular ol&#x27; flossing by far!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has braces. It&#x27;s easy to use and really helps get the stuff thats hard to reach. It was a great price too, cheaper than it was at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik water flossers for years.  This is the first one I have seen that permits you to use the tool kit container as a cover for waterpik basin.  I like that.  It is also much smaller than the last Waterpik water flosser I had.  That flosser was a huge clunker that took up lots of space. I get rid of it less than 12 months into purchase because the Ultra Flosser&#x27;s description seemed to have all the qualities I had always wanted  in a water flosser.  I like everything about the Ultra Water Flosser except the water pressure at the highest setting is not strong enough when using the standard pik.  It can become annoying having to stop and switch to one of the piks with a smaller hole to allow increased water pressure.  All-in-all I am happier with this waterpik than with past waterpik products and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The seal in the water reservoir leaked a lot, right from the start. We called the 800 number and they sent us a new seal, this one leaked too. So we are returning it.</li>
    <li> Even though I have been flossing for years, I have not been going to the dentist (bad me).  Now I&#x27;m paying the price in terms of having the go every 3 months.  Well I bought this thing to help my gums and it really does work extremely well.  The water comes out at a surprisingly strong pressure - it pulses.  What you&#x27;ll see is little bits of food fall on to the sink which is pretty disgusting but very satisfying at the same time.  It&#x27;s actually pretty fun, which is great if you hate flossing.  The first time I used it I went back and flossed afterward to see if it missed anything and to my surprise, it was completely clean.  The only bad thing about this is you have to get used to is a small spray of water splattering everywhere.  So I use this, and electric toothbrush, and mouthwash every night and my mouth has never felt cleaner.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wore out my first waterpik and have ordered a new one.  I am amazed at how much my waterpik flushes out EVEN AFTER BRUSHING. It also helps firm up my gums.</li>
    <li> This is the third generation water pik that I have owned.  My previous one now appears to be called a classic.  Now that we have used this model for a few weeks, given the choice, I would have preferred to stick with the classic model.  My complaints with this model are:  1. It comes with a wide collection of tips - one of each.  None of these tips are useful for me - I just want a bacic tip, and since it only comes with one basic tip it appears that this machine is configured for a single user.  Now I have to go buy a second tip for $10, when the whole machine cost less then $50.  It appears that Water Pic has adopted the HP printer ink model.  2. Since this is designed as a single user machine, there is no place to store tips for several users.  The tip storage lid to the tank seems basically useless to me.  3. The water pressure with the standard tip feels to be less then the classic model - adequate when on max, but just barely.  4. The tank is significantly smaller then the classic model.    If you are a new user of a water pik, and it is for only one person, then this machine is probably just fine.   However, if you are replacing a Classic model that died (but you were happy with), you may be happier buying a classic model to replace it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Waterpik over a week now and I have to say, I will never have to floss again.  This thing is going with me everywhere including to Yosemite next week. We are renting a house if you&#x27;re wondering where I&#x27;m going to get the electricity from.  Of course like many others, I made a big mess but that&#x27;s been corrected since.  I definitely feel my gums cleaner and healthier after using the Waterpik.  I highly recommend and I&#x27;ve been bragging about the item to everyone.  I was planning to get one for my brother but too bad the price went up.  I&#x27;m going to wait to see if the price drop and order one for him.  I&#x27;ve read reviews from people who gave it a 1 or 2 stars about breaking down but so far, I don&#x27;t have any problem; so far so good.</li>
    <li> I wish it came with more standard flossers, the specialized ones I don&#x27;t need, now I have to go back and order ones for my husband and my daughter.  That seemed a little wasteful.  Amazon has an excellent price, I saw this same model in Target for 59.99.  Thanks for the deal Amazon.</li>
    <li> The smallest tip stops up allowing only a possibe small amount of water at a reduced pressure.  This is the most importamt tip to reach voids under the gum line.[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model that finally gave out after 10 years or so, well this one has nowhere near the power of the old one. Plus I do like like the design at all, I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Since my late teens I have had an issue with impacted wisdom teeth (decided to come in sideways) unfortunately I do not have dental insurance or I would have them pulled. Anyone who has had wisdom teeth issues know how much of a pain they can be as food can get stuck between them. I mainly purchased this to help with that issue and to keep my back teeth healthy, and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the variable speeds and heads you will be able to find a setup that you are comfortable with, adults all the way down to kids should be able to use this with no problems. The tank holds sufficient water to go over both the top and bottom, front and back of your gum-line without refilling. This unit can also handle mouthwash and or anti-bacterial oral solutions without an issue. It also includes heads for those of you who may have braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a significant decrease in tartar around my gum-line. My only real complaint is the unit runs continuously all the time when it&#x27;s on. The button on the handle will stop the flow for a few seconds, I keep thinking however that it should be the other way around (button turns flow on instead). So if you forget to push the button in before removing it the water will squirt all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have had no issues with leakage like a few have claimed. Over all this is a terrific product and will give a big boost to your dental health.</li>
    <li> We needed a new waterpik and found this one on amazon. Love it. It has a great storage area for the extra that come with it. They are not exposed to dirt or dust. I love the extra&#x27;s, they leave my teeth feeling like I just had them cleaned at the Dentist. Smooth.</li>
    <li> Great power, lots of attachments, seems to work great</li>
    <li> Very good easy to use. Only Problem was getting a Power plug addapter for australia.</li>
    <li> I have had several water pics in the past, but this is by far the best one I have seen.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product as promised and works great. Highly recommend to use it along with floss. Entire family, including my 6 yrs old, is using it</li>
    <li> I have developed wide spaces between some teeth because of growing older and my dentist suggested the Waterpik due to the fact that food gets down deep in between the teeth and I have to keep going into the dentist because floss wouldn&#x27;t get it out.  It&#x27;s great!  It works really well and I haven&#x27;t had to go to the dentist for gum pain because of food lodged deeply and I love that!  I am going to start using the other attachments also.  It really does get food out and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> .  Having purchased this Waterpik about 2 months ago, I must say that it exceeds my expectations.     The powerful stream of water gets between the teeth and deep beneath the gum line. The reservoir is plenty large, I actually fill it a second time for additional cleansing, usually adding a splash of Listerine.     It&#x27;s recommended that you use luke-warm water, but for a real good time, I&#x27;ll occasionally use cold water..give it a try! It&#x27;s like an electric shock!  .</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested it to me.  It cleans where a brush misses</li>
    <li> I bought this for my child who is having braces. It works well in cleaning all the nooks and crannies. And, Amazon&#x27;s price was great. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love my Waterpik.........when I travel and don&#x27;t take it with me I feel like my teeth are dirty. I have gotten in the habit of using it after each meal, and since starting to use it, I have not had any cavities.  It is a God-send when you have something really stuck between your teeth, and in fact, my husband will &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; my machine to use it for this very purpose. I won&#x27;t be without one now.</li>
    <li> I love my water-pik flosser.  My teeth feel incredibly clean now.  My gums are healthier and my teeth aren&#x27;t loose anymore.  I used one as a child with my braces but stopped when I got them off.  This does a much better job than the special toothbrushes.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was quite excited to get my first Waterpik at the recommendation of our dentist.  It was really clearing up my husband&#x27;s problems with his gums and both of us had fresher breath.  Unfortunately, the unit stopped pumping water after only seven weeks.  We used it twice a day.  I returned it for a refund and purchased the less expensive version with the open top.  It&#x27;s been several months now and the new unit is going strong and was WAY less money.  I recommend people just go with the cheaper model, despite it&#x27;s less \\&quot;sleek\\&quot; appearance.</li>
    <li> The best product,next to my skincare.</li>
    <li> I love this brand they always have good products. My dentist said he saw a big improvement in my gums and flossing!</li>
    <li> Our family has been getting good statistics from the dentist after we all started using this.  The problem areas on our gums are actually improving.  We are not even diligent brushers.  We only brush in the morning.  I use the Water Pik 2X or 3X per week.  My gums have no sore spots any more.  BTW, the little rubber gasket in the reservoir has gotten lost twice.  Water Pik has excellent customer service has sent me new gaskets for free.  After years of use, the little button on the handle broke, and I have ordered a new handle for fifteeen dolars (misspelling intentional), including shipping.  As for all of the little tips that come with it, I have no idea what is going on and why you would need them.  I just stick the plain one on and use it.  Occasionally I use the spoon-shaped tip to clean my tongue.  It feels better if you use slightly warmish water.  Usually I throw a splash of mouthwash and a splash of peroxide into the tank along with the water.  I&#x27;ve even used my water pik on very low setting to clean my ears, very carefully (with a separate tip;).  This is not a recommended use...   I would bet that your dentist will give your gums good reviews after using this for 2 months.  Braces?  It is the only thing that will keep the gums in their pre-braces level of health.  This is so cheap and durable for the job that it does.  This is a good gift for an older relative.</li>
    <li> The control on the handle would stick and within two weeks it stuck closed.  This is one more cheaply made product.</li>
    <li> I floss everyday and tried to use this Waterpik as a substitute. I used this for a week before my mouth started feeling dirtier than normal. So I decided to clean with a traditional floss. I&#x27;ve never seen so much plaque come out of my teeth! So I&#x27;m not sure about the claims that it cleans plaque from between my teeth. I&#x27;ve used the strongest setting, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help. For me, Waterpik is only effective in cleaning out food stuck between the teeth but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean away plaque at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second water pik, the first one finally gave out.  The water pik is wonderful for getting the debrie  from between the teeth and I have had better dental checkups since using a water pik.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase. Easy to use, comes with different inserts/tools, and has good strong water pressure at the highest setting.</li>
    <li> I used to have braces and dreaded flossing, wish I had this when I had my braces for 5 years, would have been nice.  Makes it easy to get all the food out of your teeth.  Small, so it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of space.  Get a dentist clean.  Lots of extra heads I don&#x27;t know how to use yet but have had it 7 months and love it.  Adjustable pressure, so multiple people can use it easily.  Part of my night time regiment.</li>
    <li> This thing works great.I especially like that it comes with a bunch of different heads for special purposes.I use the standard head.My daughter needed the one for braces and she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Though I am pleased w/ the overall value of this Waterpic model, I am not impressed with the design of the lid/cover. It easily falls into the reservoir when lifting the reservoir to fill w/ water. Any tools in the lid/cover are then wet as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> excellent.  will never use ordinary floss again.  this is much more effective and comfortable</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for oral health - should be used after flossing, brushing, and using rubber tip stimulator.  Has multiple attachments (all concealed and stored in lid of water resevoir) for various purposes.  Has greatly improved the condition of my gums and my teeth,  less plaque at routine cleanings. Bought this to replace a 7 yr. old Water Pik - many very useful improvements.</li>
    <li> I bought a WP-100 unit to replace a WP-30W Waterpik. This unit is under powered and is not that reliable. The main thing is it does a poor job of removing food from between your teeth.     The WP-30W unit that broke was 14 years old and still cleans well. The hose broke and I hope it can be fixed. Waterpik does not make a quality product any more. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  It has several tools for overall oral hygeine.  The tools include a pik to clean under the gum line for those addressing peridontal issues, a regular water flosser and other items. The pulsating sensation is very soothing.  I like the range in level of pulsating as well.  My dental hygenist suggested Water Pik to keep my peridontal disease in check.  I actually enjoy using it.  The price was reasonable compared to purchasing it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased this waterpic based on other reviews that were very favorable towards it.  I Like it.  It seems to work well and easily.</li>
    <li> I love almost everything about this unit.  I previously had a few cordless units, but like the countertop unit better.    I always liked the Waterpik concept and have been having some gum problems.  Waterpik products have helped with that immensely.  The WP100 is quiet, the reservoir holds enough to do a good job in one fill and it has plenty of adjustable power.  My wife and I use it on setting 8 (the scale is from 1 to 10), and it feels good to use.  THere are no batteries to run down or replace.  I might start using it more than once a day.  Customer service was way beyond what we could reasonably expect, so we will stick with this unit as long as we can, and will then buy another similar Waterpik countertop unit when it wears out.  The only annoying thing is that you have to remove the top, then remove the tank, fill up the tank, replace it and replace the top.  Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.  [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> Dental office price was $30 above Amazon price, yet claimed to be at cost to them.  Item works fine. done and done&#x3D;&#x3D;20?</li>
    <li> Nice unit for the cost and size. Operates quietly enough with enough power to get fresh teeth. Should help with the future dentist visits.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is really pretty cool; it will help my peridontal plus it will clean in between where I just had a new bridge to get out any particles that a thread floss does not get to.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gets teeth really clean. First water pick that I did not spend 20 cleaning up after use.</li>
    <li> WORKS AS DESCRIBED. REALLY CLEANS YOUR TEETH AND MOUTH . I EAT ALOT OF SEEDS AND NUTS THAT GET STUCK BETWEEN TEETH AND THIS DOE THE JOB.</li>
    <li> I ordered this aid/device at the recommendation of my dentist. It is a very good supplement to regular brushing and flossing. Of equal importance was the very good pricing and timely shipping through Amazon. This adds to the ease of Internet shopping.</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoyed the Waterpik it seems to operate as it should no complaints so I would recommand it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn&#x27;t cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I&#x27;m still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn&#x27;t strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I&#x27;m getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.</li>
    <li> This may sound overly effervescent, but even the packaging on this product is fabulous, with the perfect info on the cover and every bit of explanation exactly as you would want it. It reminds me of something from Apple where you don&#x27;t even want to throw away the box. The WaterPik itself is a perfect dental system, with every possible tool to clean teeth and gums.  It fits together perfectly and stores in a compact corner of my sink, with cords wrapping neatly and brushing tips all stored in a little container on top.  The plastic is high grade, too. It&#x27;s built to last and to perform as promised.  Best of all, my teeth have never felt so clean, including the bridge and crowns.     I bought the portable WaterPik a few years ago and it was really useless so I was hesitant to buy this one. I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This is such a bargain at the Amazon price that I&#x27;ll probably give it as a Christmas gift!  No, I don&#x27;t work for Water Pik.  I&#x27;m just so happy to receive one appliance that lives up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
    <li> Comes with everything you could possibly need to begin a Water Flossing regiment.  This device seems to work great and can truly improve the health of your teeth and gums if you incorporate it into your daily routine. I use mine specifically for mouthwash and it seems to work just fine... and because I use an alcohol based mouthwash it allows me to be a little lazier on rinsing all of the tubing out after every use (it is recommended that if you use water to constantly flush the thing out... something I don&#x27;t have a lot of time for... alcohol makes it relatively impossible for bacteria to form).  The unit is a little light and flimsy for my tastes and is rather noisy... thus the four stars. Time will tell whether this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik Ultra after a cheaper one started not working. This one is way better! It&#x27;s quiet and simpler to use. The mechanism to insert and release the spray nozzle is also simple and easy to use. Many other subtle features are superior to the previous model I owned. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this product. Price was wonderfull it was about 30% cheaper then in most stores......FT</li>
    <li> I have owned a Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for over a year and I been very happy with it and the oral hygiene the Waterpik Ultra Flosser provides. When Amazon had posted(e-mailed)about another sale on this product I ordered another one as a gift for my daughter and eight year old granddaughter to use at their home. I also ordered extra tips for them to have on hand, since I had never been able to find replacement tips in my own local stores.  Very pleased with the fast service Amazon provides.</li>
    <li> This is the second water flosser that we have owned and the first waterpic.  Much easier to use and better pressuer adjustments.  drawback is that it only comes with one of each attachment so if you don&#x27;t wish to share you need to purcahse a separate attachments.</li>
    <li> this is my second water pik and just like the first. its a great machine and helps keep my teeth strong and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpic to replace a 10-year-old waterpic that I had dropped and broken. This model, though while new, has a noticably weaker water jet than the old model it replaced. I would have thought that with all the time and wear and tear on the old pump that the new machine would have a much stronger jet. Also, the water holder holds only about 2/3 or less of the old model, so the wash only lasts about 40 seconds or so. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> It is the second that I buy because my sister fell in love with my Waterpik . So I decided to buy one to her too. Was happy.   Super clean teeth and fresh breath :)</li>
    <li> Great product!  Amazing the junk that your toothbrush leaves behind and this thing cleans out.  We bought this as a replacement for thier rechargeable version.  Much better, much more powerful.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Does the job better than floss.  The user will discover that, if the handle is not placed in the holder, the contents of the reservoir will trickle out until gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this in April 2013. It leaked all over the place after 4 months, some kind of gasket issue. Too late to return. It worked okay, but it was never very handy to use. If you were to just use dental floss and a cheap syringe, you would save plenty of money, and get better results. 1 star for breaking down within a few months. It was my first Waterpik product. It was my last Waterpik product.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it was advertised to be and I am very pleased with it. Also with Amazon&#x27;s usual great price and service.</li>
    <li> Product works as described.  Water lasts for about a minute at full speed.  Not really sure who will use it at speed as it is pretty strong.  I use it at on of the medium speed which works wonders for me.    This is so much easier, faster, and from the results better results that using traditional floss.  A far more efficient product that will save you time, money, and work better.    The transaction with Amazon is as easy and low price as always.  I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> i bought this at the beginning of the year when i had jaw surgery and needed a way to clean trapped particle out from the plate that was mounted to my upper jaw for a month after the surgery.  it worked perfectly for flushing all the gross stuff out that rinsing couldn&#x27;t get.  now i use it after every meal to flush lodged food from between my teeth.  i love to eat beef jerky but it seems i always get half of it stuck between my teeth and even after brushing its still trapped, a quick use of the water pik and im amazed how much meat falls out of my mouth and into the sink.  i would defiantly recommend having one of these.  the only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is the button on the wand to stop water flow needs to be pressed down very firmly to stop the water flow and if its not pushed hard enough there will still be a slight jet of water pulsing out all over the bathroom,or your eye.</li>
    <li> Having used Waterpiks before (I grew up using them), I see that the water pressure doesn&#x27;t seem half as much as it used to.  I started out with this one on 10, so there&#x27;s nowhere to move up to.  I like it because it dislodges food that my Sonicare misses and sort of makes up for my relatively rare flossing, and my dentist says that my gums are in good shape.  I just wish the pressure were greater.  As far as the assorted tips, I don&#x27;t use any of them other than the general use one.  I also wish there were 2 sets for both my husband and me; I don&#x27;t get what you are supposed to to when there are more than 1 user, wash the tips?</li>
    <li> We were told to get a flosser by our dentist for better dental health. We researched many and decided to get this one. We are so glad we did. Love the way it makes your mouth feel clean after using it. Check ups have also been better since we started using it.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model of a Waterpic which I liked but damaged by dropping it. I ordered this model as a replacement and like it even more. It has a smaller footprint and love the On/Off switch. My teeth feel so clean and smooth when I am done.</li>
    <li> It arrived a day ahead of schedule and it was great because I needed it to get out some food stuck in a temporary crown causing a great deal of discomfort .... so thanks!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I pick up a water flosser to help keep my teeth and gums clean in between dental visits.  The product arrived very quickly so like always shipping from Amazon &#x3D; awesome. I have to say that the product was a bit difficult to use at first, but after a few days of use it was a piece of cake. Currently have it set at about 5 or 6.. my mouth feels so clean after every use :) only thing I find a bit funky about the product is the little button on the flosser itself....... you have to hold onto the button to keep the water from shooting out... button feels a bit cheap.. but other than that great product. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their gums and teeth super clean in between dentist visits!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for our kids after getting braces.&lt;br /&gt;They have been using this regularly and love it.&lt;br /&gt;Both the dentist and the orthodontist were pleased with&lt;br /&gt;the cleanliness this system provide.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this oral irrigator.  Fits well on the bathroom sink and looks good.  It comes with several different tips and has seven intensity levels, so it is very customizable in application and comfort.  The water reservoir is large enough so that I do not run out of water after a minute or so of use.  The lid pops open to store the tips.  The only real design issue I have identified to far is that removing the top to fill the reservoir with water often results in the tip storage bin to pop open spilling the tips all over the sink.  They need to consider putting a better latch on the storage bin.  The irrigator has a button to cut off water without turning the device off.  Nice touch.  Plenty of water supply tube length, and it goes back into storage easily.  Highly recommneded.  Good value for the price</li>
    <li> works very well ,and is very good quality.we have ours almost 2 years now and it still works like new.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpick flosser. I love that it&#x27;s electric and not a rechargable battery (hate those). I love that it has different power selections and I love that it has a lot of power behind it. I love the coil hose and how easy it fits into it&#x27;s holder. I love the different pics that come with it. I love that the reservoir holds so much water. It&#x27;s a great product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth water flosser I&#x27;ve owned. It works well, good pressure and pulsing action. Tips are easy to insert and swivel easily. Sometimes the top is a bit difficult to take off to fill the reservoir. It flips open easily and/or tips into the reservoir.</li>
    <li> Great product for those who have difficulty with flossing.  Amazing what&#x27;s still left in your teeth even after a good brushing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to help with my periodontal disease. Love it, even on the lower settings its like a pressure washer! The directions say use before brushing but I use it after brushing. There is a &amp;#34;pickpocket&amp;#34; tip, but I am afraid to use it around my pockets for fear of blasting bacteria further up into the pocket. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased two Waterpiks (one for each house) after the dentist told me they&#x27;re helpful for keeping bridgework and orthodontics clean. Since I&#x27;ve spent thousands on dentistry over the years, and am now wearing braces as an adult, I followed his advice. I bought two different models, mainly because that&#x27;s what was available at the time (a month ago). One product is the WP60, the other is the Ultra. The only differences between them are: the WP60 is cheaper, it has two attachments instead of six, and it&#x27;s better designed. The Ultra Water Flosser has six different implements, which I thought was overkill until I tried them. The tongue scraper is pointless, but the Pik Pocket, the two brush heads, and the orthodontia accessory are all quite useful. The most noticeable difference between the WP60 and the Ultra is the design of the item itself. The Ultra has an irritating hinged cover (see the white thing on top of blue tank in product photo) that serves as reservoir top/accessory storage. It doesn&#x27;t do either job very well. The hinges come apart and the lid doesn&#x27;t seat easily onto the tank. When the accessories fell out onto the floor the first time I used it, I put the lid in the closet. (The idea of storing wet dental implements in an enclosed container is disgusting anyway.) The footprint of the Ultra is awkward compared to the WP60 and it seems to take up more counter space. The price difference isn&#x27;t warranted, especially since you can buy all the accessories your heart desires for any of the models. Having said all that, my mouth feels cleaner after water flossing than it ever did with string floss. Interested to see what the dentist says at my next checkup.</li>
    <li> I have had a previous model for years, and it finally wore out. The new model works well and I expect to use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing little tool--makes one&#x27;s mouth feel very clean!  I am so glad I finally bought one after much consideration.</li>
    <li> This product makes the mouth feel clean after brushing or flossing.    For best results, I would still use conventional flossing and follow up with the  Waterpik.    This product reinforces the flossing regimen and makes it more  enjoyable, as well as, effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for 5 weeks and so far, I love it.  I bought this to replace the one I had which lasted about 1 1/2 years and it was not as good as this model.  I love the strong jet spray and the water container holds more water then I need, so no refilling, unlike my old model.  I&#x27;ve read several reviews and go some good advise on how to care for it.  I just hope it last the 2 years.  I use it at lease 2x a day. I have a dentist appt. next week.  lets see what they say about the condition of my gums.</li>
    <li> About 20% less expensive than buying the item locally. Very fast shipping when using Prime.  There are other Waterpik models that cost less, but this one is quieter and smaller.  The water tank has extra capacity for one person but needs refilling if used for more users.  The functions seem the same as our old Waterpik model.  Buy it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> I had mild gingivitis and was having to go to the dentist for cleanings every 3 months. I got this after one dental appointment, used it twice a day, and at my next appointment 3 months later they said I had no problems at all, and put me back to every 6 months. It&#x27;s great. The pressure is high enough to get all the stuff out of your teeth, but not so high that it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I have recently owned both the standard and deluxe cordless versions, and this corded model is quite simply a much better product.  I got less than a year each (probably closer to 6 months each) on the cordless models before the batteries seemed to die. With the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, which is corded, I get three or four flossings from a single fill.  While it takes up a little more counter space than the cordless models, it is quicker to use, more adjustable, and I like the consistent power, insead of waiting for the battery to cycle down on the cordless units.  The hose leading to the handpiece seems a little fragile, and I am careful to avoid kinking it or stretching it too far, but so far, it still looks perfect.  Time will tell ......  So far, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and decided to purchase this item, I started gradually and now up to 10 setting, good product for the money could not find this model locally, and I like the different attachment heads, which store neat and clean on top of the unit, would recommend, and I am interested to see what my dentist says about my gums when I go back.</li>
    <li> More compact than the old model we had, perfect water pressure,removes everything that floss leaves behind, makes my mouth feel so clean ! Love it ! Bought 1 for each of my sons.</li>
    <li> I came from a family with good genes for strong teeth. One of my regular compliments is my great smile and my teeth. I am 40 and never have any problem with plaque or cavities, but unfortunately my wisdom tooth have been a nuisance for twenty years now. I do not have enough space in my mouth to accommodate them, and as a result I have half of the teeth out (all 4 of them) and half covered with my gum. Every now and then some food get under the soft gum and hurt like hell. I recently have one painful episode and decide it was time to do something about it (I know... I know, I should have them removed a long time ago, but the prospect of the surgery scared the hell of me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking closely I found... plaque. I went for a dental cleaning, need more visits because they did not want to remove everything in the same day because the bleeding in my guns was bad. I bought a new toothbrush (Phillips Sonicare Essence) and the waterpik for maintenance and I am so in love with both. I used to smoke and I still drink coffee like crazy, but I did not realize the mild discoloration over time. Here is what I think is the benefits of the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love meat, and because my teeth are so close is an everyday occurrence little pieces trapped in my teeth. My very first experience with the waterpik was after lunch, I brush with the new toothbrush and floss before I tried the waterpik to rinse.  I noticed little pieces of green coming out (green salad), little pieces of meat left behind and shocking, some sesame seeds from the Tuna Steak last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, I tried the other way around and use the waterpik first and then floss and the floss came out clean.  Great, because I HATE to floss, but we get to do what you need to do.  I tried the Pik Pocket Tip between my teeth and it feels like it was pushing easily everything around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely use tongue cleaners, but I try the one with the waterpik and it feels really good after. I think the water helps make it more acceptable.  But truth to be told, I&#x27;m still not a big fan with this tip, I think I need get a little bit more use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did not use the Orthodontic tip because I do not use braces and there is a toothbrush and a plaque seeker tip that I think work better. I tried the toothbrush, it is good, but I prefer the sonic, but the plaque seeker makes your gum feels soo good.&lt;br /&gt;After the cleaning, it feels like you have a good massage in your guns, and there is a fresh feeling in your mouth (maybe is just my imagination?). I do not know how long it will last after some of the reviews, but for now it seems really well built and works like a charm. My teeth are whiter (Surprise, I never realize they were a little off white) and my gun feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;About my original problem, the water pick seems to be doing an excellent job in cleaning around my wisdom where there is absolutely no way for me to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product.  I will write more post about the durability as seems fit. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 08/31/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using waterpik for three years now. I never have a cavity but problems with all my wisdom teeth and occasional red swallow guns. This thing removes food even after your normal floss. I brush, floss with an access flosser and then waterpik.  It has been a good buy and  It is lasting longer than I was expecting. I have hard city water and it did not clog the machine as I was expecting. SO far good. My husband is having dental treatment done and I am getting one for him. He did not want to invest the money on a decent flosser and toothbrush but I think he is convinced now. My deep cleaning full month last less than 20 minutes if. I think they are only doing it because my insurance covers it.  The dental hygienist always said how clean and healthy my guns and tooth are Three years and no pain on my wisdom teeth is a miracle. I had been having occasional problems with local infection on the wisdom teeth  for 30 years but so far no more. They are very hard to reach and there is no angle to move correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Because I am a meat eater I used the access flosser (Reach Access Flosser with Bonus Set of 28 Disposable Heads available here at Amazon) on the go with the Sonicare at work, lunch time (OK, the true is when I have a meal and I can feel it between my teeth. If I don&#x27;t feel it I skip the brushing on the go all together, meaning quite often. Who can afford the time for this every time you eat something?) Mornings and nights, Oral-B and Waterpik. I DO have time for this every morning and night, its only minutes and is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not hard to get used to it because the guns feels really good after the water jet. (unless you have an infection, if pain occurs, visit your dentist. After fixing what when bad you don&#x27;t have to leave in pain never more). If you need dental work (or not) it is an excellent way to keep your mouth clean and problem free.there is no angle to move correctly.

    <li> This is a great tool - I love how compact it is, and how easy to clean it is, too. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very messy to use, but it gets the job done. Just have a towel close by. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a waterpik-type of product after I had some problems with inflamed gums around my back molars that regular flossing just couldn&#x27;t reach. Why didn&#x27;t I know these products existed sooner?? This one comes with multiple heads including ones for gum problems, the stream adjusts from soft to very strong depending on the senstivity of the user, and the cord is nice and long, and the storage for the heads is very convenient. I went for the large container capacity of the ultra model over the cordless and am glad I did because I go through a lot of water (and after reading some of the so-so reviews of the cordless). Glad I did! Great product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This item is great for cleaning gums and clearing food stuck under the gums. I recommend using this along with flossing and mouthwash. I feel my mouth being much cleaner right after every use.</li>
    <li> Had this a couple of years, alternating using this and regular flossing. Works pretty well, except that you&#x27;ll get black spots (mildew?) in the tank, under the lid, and under the tank. Not sure how to stop that from happening except taking it apart and letting it dry each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I was getting splashed by water and found out why: the hose near the handle had broken. That&#x27;s why they sell [[ASIN:B000RLG8JE Waterpik WP-100 Handle Assembly Kit]], I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unit unless they&#x27;ve started using tougher hose or a better design. Or you don&#x27;t mind replacing the handle unit every couple of years for $12.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago and wore it out, this is a long overdue replacement that we love.</li>
    <li> This unit has less water pressure than my old one, but is sufficient.  Plenty of water capacity.  The unit does what it is advertised to do, so I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son after his orthodontist said he needed to do a better job of flossing and cleaning around his braces.  It may be just the novelty has him brushing more regularly but the next visit was much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 waterpiks and this is the best by far.  It&#x27;s a beautifully laid out product with plenty of power.  It comes with like 6 attachments that are very nice quality.  I can&#x27;t think of 1 negative thing.</li>
    <li> It works really well. Clean easilly and fast, giving you a better sensation than when you use reagular floss.  Don&#x27;t remove completly all the tarter, depending how long you have it, but for sure avoid the creation of new plaques.</li>
    <li> Bought this 4 years ago and still working great. Initially bought for teenager who got braces to help out with cleaning his teeth more thoroughly. Does the job, braces are off now, but still uses it to keep gums clean in addition to flossing. I like the extra attachments too.</li>
    <li> I like this one.  I had another one that was much bigger and bulker and stopped pumping after only 6 months so I hope this one last longer.  It is a good size for my very small bathroom and it works very well so far.  Well designed.</li>
    <li> waterpik works well, it was a replacement for an older model and works better than our original. We also like the additional tips for cleaning under your gums.  It pulses which seems to get more of the debris from between teeth.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time in conjunction with brushing and flossing an I really do believe that there are some things brushing and flossing just will not dislodge.  This really makes you feel as though you have cleaned your teeth thoroughly and well and i find that my breath is much fresher in the morning as well as there are no little hidden particles of food stuck anywhere at night when I go to bed as nasty a thought as that is.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s easy to use and important if you want to clean your teeth properly. I had a cheaper one and it broke. It can&#x27;t compare with this water flosser. Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I had Gum Disease from smoking, eating bad, not brushing my gums, and not flossing, I was headed straight for surgery with any dentist that saw me. Every dentist said surgery was the only way to open my gums and clean the insides of the infected area (costing enormous amounts of money) and this was the only way to cure the gum disease the \\&quot;dentists told me\\&quot;. I heard about the water pik from a family member that had the same issue as me and they recommend that a give the water pik a try and if I do not see any improvements within one or two weeks, that surgery might be my only option. After purchasing the water pik within one-two weeks of use, my gums are back to EXCELLENT condition, they do not hurt, they feel great, look great and have a perfect normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill the water pik with half Hydrogen peroxide, half water. I also put Three table spoons sea salt, one table spoon natural baking soda \\&quot;Bob&#x27;s Red Mill Baking Soda\\&quot;, mixing it around good. After water flossing I put in 5-7 drops of: \\&quot;Wish Garden Herbs\\&quot; - Gum Strengthener all around my gums. This is an all natural product. I had severe pain after flossing, so after flossing I would put \\&quot;Anbesol\\&quot;; maximum strength Gel Tube, to give me some assistance with the pain, I would apply and massage it to my gums with a Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the water pik on a daily basis for the rest of my life, I highly recommend the Water Pik to anyone.</li>
    <li> This gadget is so effective. I am unable to use the string floss and I wonder how other people are able to do it; takes a lot of technique an awkward opening of the mouth. But the water flosser is so effective, even enjoyable when using warm water.</li>
    <li> I cant believe all  these positive reviews! they must be the manufacturar of this \\&quot;toy\\&quot; and their friends! I call it a toy because it so very very weak it cleans nothing and its nothing like the one at the dentist as they claim, I hate it and its just money down the drain :(</li>
    <li> This is a great device. Have used for 7 months and my hygienist has commented on how healthy my gums appear (hasn&#x27;t always been the case). And the 6-month cleaning went much easier too. You won&#x27;t believe the particles this flosser blasts out from between teeth and around gums.  Yuck!  Better out than clinging between!  Strong buy recommendation.</li>
    <li> I am very glad to finally have a Waterpik that is quiet.  I like the looks of it, the storage in the lid, and the ease of using.  My last Waterpik was very noisy and the pik was not easy to store on the device.  My husband has a new Waterpik exactly like mine for his sink and he is a happy Waterpik user also!  The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is truly a great tool.  I have not owned it for a long period of time so am hoping that it will give us longer service than the last model. (a different style)</li>
    <li> I got this home and was so happy because now I could do away with the string floss. This cuts time and does a great job. I actually enjoy just shooting water on and between my teeth over maneuvering a piece of string in my mouth. Things might be a little messy while getting used to it, but it&#x27;s well worth it. You will get used to it very quickly. It can go from very gentle to blasting. I stay between the two. As far as how loud it is, well, it&#x27;s not that loud. I mean there are definitely other things more annoying. I just think its a great product and will replace mine if it ever needs it. I recommend getting it.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is fantastic.  The shipping and delivery were excellent just as stated.  I had a waterpik flosser previously that was chargeable and even though it was great the battery kept dying.  I go to the dentist every 3 months because of placque and she was impressed with my teeth after less than two months with this waterpik ultra.  I will keep using it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Product works great!  This is my second one.  Pretty much wore out the old one.  Wanted to update.  Would highly recommend.  Really does everything it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dentist so I know a little bit about oral irrigation. I&#x27;ve had WaterPiks since they were introduced(mid 70&#x27;s). My last one I have had for about 15 years,still works but it&#x27;s getting old. This new model is far and away better. Time will tell how well it holds up.  Dr. R</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this waterpik for over a year now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and durable and still works just as well as the first day I started using it over a year ago.  I don&#x27;t use all the attachments, as I personally don&#x27;t like them, but the regular waterpik attachments both work great (you get 2 of them); my wife and I both use it regularly.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this item.  The interactive element stirs the kids to use it.  It&#x27;as like a mouth water gun to therm.  And then the adults in my house tried it too.  But the best report I can give is that my dentist saw improvement in the conditions of my gums.</li>
    <li> Good alternative for regular floss but not as effective. I still do regular floss some time this is just an alternative to save some time.</li>
    <li> very pleases with quality and price.  am going to get more as gifts. my christmas will be easy when i get more water picks.</li>
    <li> Flosser puts out good pressure, but water hose is a bit short to use easily on a standard height bathroom vanity. Also, the removable top with its tip holders is really a waste of space. The tips don&#x27;t really snap into their holders and usually fall out while you&#x27;re trying to pick one out. Price on unit was good and Amazon shipping was as prompt as it usually is.</li>
    <li> Best tool to replace flosssing!!! Makes my teeth feel squeaky clean and refreshed. Great product! It has 10 water speeds that you can control to flush all that food and plaque away.</li>
    <li> It does a good job.  I am not a fan of the wand and the tubing, but other than it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This machine really goes!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good at getting stuff out of your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Gets my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This product worked fine for the first 3 weeks, it then began to loose the pressure when flossing on a high setting.&lt;br /&gt;Not a very good start.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have not been able to find replacement attachments for the Waterpik in the local stores although they sell the waterpik flosser .&lt;br /&gt;Not that I&#x27;m going to need them.</li>
    <li> In the begining it&#x27;s hard to get total efficiency of it, but as you get used to, it becomes very easy to handle. I liked it very much. The waterpick is very useful.</li>
    <li> I have braces, and honestly dreaded to floss my teeth until I found this product. I love having clean teeth, but flossing my teeth around my braces was very time consuming, this product makes me teeth feel very clean, very happy with the results I am getting and now cant live without the waterpik flosser!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is my second water pick floss.  Used first one for 5 years. There was some leakage at thetube connection.  This one is the same model, and we enjoy it just as much as the first.  MB</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal. Sooooo much easier than manual floss and I think it works better too. The attachments are pretty useful and my teeth feel super clean. You can also use it to spray the back of your throat to get those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Having just recently gotten new uppers I needed a PRESSURE WASHER  or my teeth it works well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Easy to use and makes a huge difference in my dentist visits.  I have periodontal desease and this is one thing that keeps my mouth/bones/teeth from getting worse.  Also very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Finally.  A product with all the features you want - at a nice price - that works perfectly every time you use it. I wish everything I bought worked this well.  Powerful jets. Quiet operation. Big reservoir. Many tools to choose from. Low price.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is cheap to get to keep your gums healthy.  Now I just need to use it more.</li>
    <li> I had gum problems and was afraid when my dentist said it will only get worse. I think the idea of a lazy flossing is nice but it does not live to my expectations.</li>
    <li> The pressure at the tip is not nearly as high as previous models.  So low that I threw it in the trash.  Back to the larger model.</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik. The first only lasted about 15 years, and while it still runs, the buttons are worn out. These piks really help keep plaque from forming and they get food items from between your teeth that you have no idea are even hiding in there. You should be able to keep your teeth forever if you use it at least once a day. Twice is better, but once will do it. I add a touch of hydrogen peroxide to the water.</li>
    <li> I Bought this unit because my dentist recommended a waterpik. I have periodontal conditions so I need to take good dental care now. I would use it two or three times a day because it is very convenient. The pressure can be adjusted but 8 is already plenty strong for me. The water reservoir is big enough that I only need about 2/3 of it for a complete wash.</li>
    <li> I love this appliance. It&#x27;s easy to use and convenient. I leave it out on the counter because I use it every day to get my teeth clean with these  braces. It&#x27;s smaller than my old waterpik and attractive so I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out and it&#x27;s always ready for use. I really like all the head options and have used most of them. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When my 10 year old daughter got her braces on, the orthodontist recommended we purchase a counter model Waterpik (not a handheld one).  She recommended it because of all the features and we&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  My daughter enjoys using the special braces attachment to quickly clean the food out of her braces before brushing her teeth.  I think the fun of the Waterpik has made her happy to spend a lot of care on her teeth.   She has found it easy to use and the adjustments have kept her comfortable.  Amazon had the best price on this item, too.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  My wife says she would buy it again.  Delivery was quick.  I guess that is the best thing you can say about a product is that you would buy it again and from the same company.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. After about the 3rd use the water became soured. No not in the reservior, but beyond where you can empty it. Since the return policy is so lacking it went to the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Old one we had leaked and was hard to fix so  we went on-line and found this one which looked  good on-line.   We received this new waterpik and  were very Happy with the quietness and the   adjustable force of the water through the pik.    Satisfied Customer</li>
    <li> I bought this unit after my dentist told me that I had started getting gum disease and needed periodontal work. I brush at least twice daily, but rarely flossed. I hated the thought of having my gums cut around and decided to buy the Waterpik as an alternative.     I initially used the Waterpik for 6 months and on my next dentist visit, the oral hygenist was AMAZED. I&#x27;m not kidding, the gum damage had been reversed even though I never followed up on my periodontist appointment.     I did this about 3 years ago and I have had no problems with my teeth or gums since. The dental hygenist compliments me on my oral hygene at every visit. On one occasion she asked me if I had a professional cleaning since my previous visit because there was virtually nothing left to scrape.     The only part that I am concerned about is when I go on vacation I sometimes am not able to pack the waterpik - and I can really tell the difference. After about a week I start getting unpleasant tastes in my mouth and I know that the infection is attempting to return. When I get home I am able to fix the problem after a few days with use of the waterpik.    I came to Amazon today to buy a portable waterpik to take with me on trips. I don&#x27;t want gum disease to be able to re-start and I&#x27;m researching a compact portable unit so I can do touch-ups.</li>
    <li> i bought this online first of all it took about 3 weeks to arrive !!!   i was very thrilled to use it after reading all the good things about it but i am afraid this thing did not add any additional benifit to my 4 $ battery brush from walmart   i find it useless i bought it for my braces and i guess i am gaining nothing but a messy bathroom</li>
    <li> I love this Waterpik flosser.  I had a cordless one, which only lasted about a year and then would no longer hold a charge.  This one is plugged into the wall, but has a lot of heads with brushes and different size piks; - something for everyone.  Also has a lot more power than the cordless one.  My mouth feels clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> In a casual conversion, a friend recommended a water pik.  Being quick to form opinions, fortunately they remain in my head, I thought \\&quot;how old fashioned\\&quot;  my parents used them back in the day.  We now have electric toothbrush and they claim to remove everything! I was having trouble with popcorn kernels stuck in my teeth and brushing and flossing didn&#x27;t seem to help.  Purchased the \\&quot;waterpik\\&quot;.  OMG, some of the older inventions can&#x27;t be surpassed.  This little machine removes everything.  My dentist will non longer be charging me $150.00 per quadrant to deep clean my teeth.  Gums improve daily.  Now, I want one for the office.  Highly recommend, signed kissable!</li>
    <li> I had pretty bad oral health. after 2 weeks of twice daily use i see amazing results. my gums don&#x27;t bleed any more and my breath is way better. i feel much more confident speaking now. trust me when i say get this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Waterpik products before and have always been pleased.  I&#x27;ve had the Waterpik Ultra for 2 weeks now and LOVE it.  It is everything and more than I expected in every way and I definitely recommend it.  It&#x27;s very compact and easy to use and it does the job thorougly.  I have bridework and caps and cleaning every tooth in my mouth is easy and thorough.  This is so superior to any of the smaller, handheld devices I&#x27;ve used before.  I especially like that I can control the intensity of the water stream and have multiple cleaning heads to choose from. This model was recommended by several friends, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with it.  I&#x27;ve seen models costing 3 times as much so I know this model is definitely an excellent value.  It&#x27;s easy to use, does the job fast, and operates so quietly.  I would buy it again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had Waterpiks of different design from 1966.  The first ones were great then in the intervening years, the design was not very good. Now this new design is very nice and well thought out. It has a button to cut off the flow; great.  It&#x27;s pressure is set on the unit not the handle; great.  It comes with 5 different points; great. It has a lid to cover the reservoir; great. However, the reservoir is smaller than I would like but it is adequate. One will just have to fill it again.</li>
    <li> I loved this oral flosser better than any I&#x27;ve ever used. Too bad it&#x27;s not made to last very long. First the holder for the handle broke, then the hose cracked and finally broke off entirely. Now I&#x27;m looking for one that is much stronger-probably one that connects to the faucet directly.</li>
    <li> The product works well at getting &amp;#34;stuck &amp;#34; food out of the teeth and gums, but is a bit messy.  Water sprays everywhich way and drips from the sprayer connection...way too much.  It is successful at removing food that is stuck in gum crevices and between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased the Waterpik Ultra to remove a tonsil stone.  I tried for a few days, but was unsuccessful.  I would keep gagging every time the water hit the back of my tongue.  I finally got it out by pushing on the tonsil with my finger (not recommended by doctors, but it worked).  Since I had already bought the Waterpik, I started using it to floss.  I was terrible with flossing, only doing it about once a week.  The Waterpik worked great.  I still floss once a week, but there is barely anything there.  This is something easy to do, which is why I use it all the time.  I go to the dentist in a couple of weeks and am curious how my gums will look.  I use a little less than half of the reservoir each time I use it.  There are several tips, but so far I only use the flosser tip.  I think it&#x27;s well worth the money, especially for a lazy flosser like me.</li>
    <li> The product works good when its new, good product, but when its 2 or 3 tears old and the   unit starts to leak then the customer service doesn&#x27;t want to help you what so ever. they  just want you to buy more parts for the product, its like it has a built in breakage factor,   I had 2 units and the same thing happened to both of them, the first one was getting older so  I opted to buy a new unit, the second will get pitched and thats it for me and waterpic junk.</li>
    <li> Works the way its supposed to. Powerful or gentle, works great. Easy to clean. You can put mouthwash in it if you want. Comes with many tools for tips. Nice storage in lid. This is much better than the portable one I had before. No battery to poop out.</li>
    <li> Waterpik is awesome and a necessary piece of equipment in dental and gum care.  My whole family has their own, we are firm believers in this vital product, that we just can&#x27;t do without.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using these, my dental problems have almost disappeared.   I started with a travel one (needs to be cleaned after every use, or it&#x27;s history), until it finally broke, (after much abuse by me, not cleaning it, etc.) then I got this one. I got it very quickly, and IT IS GREAT FOR GETTING ALL THAT CRUD OUT OF between your teeth!  Way better than dental floss, and you can control the pressure from hardly anything, to more than I need. But maybe the 10 setting is for cleaning  dentures.  So,  buy one of these, and get that crud out of your mouth!!!</li>
    <li> everybody needs good health and everything starts from your tees.you will feel improvement  with in 1st week and make it your habit as every morning routine.</li>
    <li> I have been a practicing dental hygienist for 26 years.  We are now learning how the waterpik can be a very effective tool in home oral hygiene.  Kids with braces face unique challenges.  If they don&#x27;t brush well, they will be left with a mouth full of cavities.  Most kids don&#x27;t brush above the brackets, near the gums.  The waterpik tip I use has a brush and sprays water so it removes the bacteria without being uncomfortable.  In fact, they love using it cuz it is fun! Our last visit to the orthodonist was met with rave reviews on how clean their teeth were.  Adults can use it to!</li>
    <li> We tried another brand... Well needless to say it failed and this one is the best!</li>
    <li> I just got braces and needed a product that would really help me keep my teeth clean.  This works great and I would recommend this to anyone needing a water pik.</li>
    <li> Many years ago a dentist reccommended I use a water pic. After many many years it broke. I replaced it right away. It has prevented the gum issues  and I believed saved the teeth that I have. I use faithfully every morning, and at night if I remember. I would highly recommend it to everyone-I do believe it can save your gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> Rapid delivery and a great price for a super product.  the flosser is easy to use, easy to maintain, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an aging unit with a broken water tube.  This one works as well as the original and has some new attachements that are quite useful.  Good value for the money and overall a great experience in ordering online with Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I saw this item in stores, but decided to come to Amazon to see what people wrote for reviews before I decided to go ahead and buy one.  I did order it from Amazon and was pleased with the entire sale- - -it arrived very soon after I sent in the order.  I have been able to use it for a short while and I have been more than pleased with what it does.  I never owned any kind of a water flosser before ordering this one, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I like it so much more than just using dental floss.</li>
    <li> I hate the design and fit of the reservoir lid.  It has a compartment to hold the extra picks and is awkward to remove to add water.  I tried to leave it off but the pump vibration spays water all over.  The shape of the lid and the little lip that has to align with the reservoir makes alignment to put it back on very precise.  Makes you feel like your assembling a puzzle or a clock instead of a lid just to keep the water from splashing out.  Remove the lid to add water the wrong way and the storage compartment opens up and one or more of the extra picks and attachments fall out.  The fitment of those is another mystery puzzle.  Very user unfriendly.  The product engineers must all have dentures.  I miss my cheap old water pick and its elegant reservoir design with a hindged lid.</li>
    <li> Shakes hard when I use it and it leaks water. Not near the quality I had been used to.  If I had opened it up right away and saved the box when I did open it I would send it back.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff, I bought it as a present to my cousin, and he loved it! I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I HAVE A GUM PROBLEM, MY DENTIST RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT. I FIND THAT IT WORKS GREAT. IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE VERY LONG TO USE, AND IT MAKES MY MOUTH FEEL REFRESHED, AND CLEAN , ALMOST LIKE COMING FROM THE DENTIST. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY BODY THAT DOES NOT LIKE TO FLOSS.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser was just as advertised.  A little smaller than I thought, but it works for me.  If you want to use it amongst different people, you should order extra attachments, as there is only 1 of everything, and not everything fastens in the storage compartment.  The cord between the hand unit and the base could be longer.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!! She recently got braces and states, \\&quot;It&#x27;s perfect for getting hard to reach places that the manual or electric toothbrush does not. The attachments are easy to use and maintain. My teeth are super clean.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works as advertised and is improving the condition of my wife&#x27;s gums.  The price makes it an excellent value.</li>
    <li> I had implants done and my dentist recommended a water pick for cleaning. I love the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. It is small enough to sit on my sink and is very easy to use. The controls are simple and there is variation of pressure. it certainly rates 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Sydell</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommend I use a water flosser and said to buy a variable pressure.  I won&#x27;t have my checkup for about 4 more months, but it works and is easy to use.  I would recommend it. If there are multiple users in your household that will be using it, make sure you buy additional tips.  Amazon had a very good deal.  Don</li>
    <li> It is better than just OK.  It isn&#x27;t near as strong a flow as I got from the older Waterpik that I replaced when it died.  All the other attachments aren&#x27;t something that I find useful.  That being said, when I go to the dentist I a always complemented on flossing, which I hate to do, only using the Waterpik every morning and usually in the evening as well.</li>
    <li> The box says it&#x27;s quiter than earlier models - no ttrue.  This unit is very loud and annoying.  Works great otherwise</li>
    <li> It is true, as remarked upon in other reviews, that the bowl is a bit small, but I have a pitcher on hand full of water to continually fill the Waterpik bowl and that works fine.  Otherwise, this is a great product; it keeps my gums in good shape.  When I have to travel and do not use the Waterpik, I have problems even though I am a thorough brusher.  Without the Waterpik, my gums sometimes even bleed and hurt, but a few consecutive days of Waterpik use and everything gets hyperclean and healthy again.  I suppose I should buy a travel one, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using the rechargeable sonicare for years and was a little concerned that maybe this unit would not be as good. I was pleasantly surprised that it has a lot more action than the more expensive rechargeable unit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s the third water Waterpik I&#x27;ve bought and this is the best yet. I lost the first one on an international move and the second was not powerful enough for me. This one is great.</li>
    <li> I read that others think traditional flossing works better than this device.  I think for tougher calculous, the stuff dental hygienists have to scrape off your teeth, mechanical removal works much better.  But for tartar and food particles, this works much better than traditional floss.  For one thing, it blasts them out from between your teeth and rinses it out of your mouth, whereas floss tends to push it down to or below the gum line if you&#x27;re not careful.  And even then, you still have to rinse to wash what was pushed around out of your mouth.  Why not just do it all in one shot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I appreciate is that water flossing removes those pesky micro beads that are being phased out of toothpastes and soaps.  When I was using one brand with little blue beads, I would inevitably rinse them out with every water flossing.  When was the last time your floss did that?  Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mine set at 8 and it keeps my mouth in good health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those concerned about water sitting in the hose and handle: after using, remove the empty water tank, hold the main unit high and the handle and nozzle low so gravity and air pressure force the remaining water out of the hose and handle.  A quick flick of the handle will release any remaining water in the nozzle.</li>
    <li> I have worked as a dental assistant and this water pik is the next best thing as going to the dentist. I wish it had a suction to extract the water from the mouth. It is a bit messy with water splatter and hard to use on your children. Due to so much water in their mouth.  Great to use on yourself and I have taught my 12 year old with BRACES to use it.  I am hoping this product will keep her teeth nice and shiny for when we remove the braces. It tends to get a bit high in price to buy all the extra tips for multiple family use. So coming with more tips would be nice.  I like to different setting for pressure but wish it went a bit higher. It does not remove plaque or stains but is good for keeping plaque from building up.</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended this particular water flosser and, after shopping around, I found that Amazon.com had by far the best deal.  I was a bit skeptical about the mess in using a water flosser, but that is not the case with a little bit of practice.  The power settings are easy to use and the on/off switch is very well placed.  As for the power of the spray, setting level 1 is as gentle as you&#x27;d want, and level 10 is more powerful than you will ever likely use.  I found level 6 to work best for me.  The first time you see what the water flosser removes you will know that it works as good or better than advertised!</li>
    <li> As others have said throughout the internet, I brush (oral B smartseries), floss and then use the waterpik and it still finds stuff I missed.  I&#x27;m happy I bought this thing and still using it twice a day.</li>
    <li> good machine! great choice!</li>
    <li> Flossing my teeth has never been easier.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist told me she recommended I get the waterpik for better flossing. I had never used anything like this before and have to say it works great!</li>
    <li> My wife is a dentist and she hates the fact that I hate flossing. (Really, what is there to like?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after all her nagging I decided to look for an alternative. After much research I found this beautiful machine. The wife was mad at first because her being a dentist and all, her reaction was: \\&quot;you just refuse to use floss, don&#x27;t you?\\&quot;, to what I politely answered: \\&quot;YEAP!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days of bickering, she is now happy I bought it since she saw that I am using this thing at LEAST once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say I love using this thing, it actually works well getting stuff out of my teeth, gets into pockets that regular floss doen&#x27;t, regular floss makes me bleed out of my gums and I feel minty fresh afterwards since I like to add some mouthwash to the water in the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has settings to control the pressure of the water coming out, but I gotta say, I always keep it at full blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall to me this is a great alternative to regular floss and actually helps keep gums healthier than regular floss.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 2 months &amp; last week at my dental cleaning they asked me what I was doing different as my gums didn&#x27;t bleed and I had way less tarter build up.  I use this product every night and the price was great with no sales tax and no shipping costs.</li>
    <li> I have been having issues with food getting into the crevices of each tooth.  A friend suggested a water pik, as the floss wasn&#x27;t doing the job...this water pik is the best ever!!!!  I have used others, water runs all over.  This gadget gets the job done.  I highly recommend to anyone.  It relieved my tooth pain!!</li>
    <li> This Water Pik is great, I have always hated flossing and this really does the job. It works just as well as traditional flossing, but doesn&#x27;t cause me any pain. It is, however, incredibly loud.  I will also note that \\&quot;pausing\\&quot; the flow of water is kind of a pain. They should have reversed the function so that you push the button to release water flow, instead of holding the button to pause water flow. My finger has, on occasion, slipped from the button, spraying myself and my bathroom with water. I highly suggest you use the warmer water, as I attempted to skip this step and use water that was not warm (I was rushed for time and didn&#x27;t want to wait for the tap to heat up) and it was highly unpleasant.</li>
    <li> water pressure is great dont even need to turn it up very high dosent take up a hole lot of space easy to use and switch out the heads</li>
    <li> I only have full use of one hand and unable to floss correctly. The \\&quot;water flosser\\&quot; was the answer to my delemia. Finally my mouth feels like I just stepped out of the dentist office.</li>
    <li> I had one of the original Water Piks when they came out about 30 years ago.  That one really did not do much to improve my dental health.  Thirty years later, and thirty years older, my personal care has not been enough to prevent aging gum issues.  As a result, my dentist recommended that I add using this Water Pik to my daily routine.  Between the improvements made to the model and the additional types of tips, this Water Pik improved the health of my gums.  Noticeable results came in less than a week.</li>
    <li> Although I have never used a water irragator before, this one seems to works very wee. Different adaptors let you choose the one you need and the pulsated control the best for your needs. The size fits well on a standard sink top. Overall I am very happy with the Waterpik</li>
    <li> Due to pockets because of recessed gums, dental visits had increased due to need for quarterly cleaning.  A friend recommended trying a waterpik, via Amazon, and I  am amazed at the results...healthier gums and no more odors from trapped food beneath permanent bridges.  I&#x27;m saving money because of less frequent dental visits and my smile is bright and fresh! Product is E-Z to use...follow the simple directions.  I&#x27;m 78 and thankful for this wonderful accessory!</li>
    <li> I bought it because of 1,000 good ratings. Then my dentist told me that manual flossing did a better job, and to use this only as a supplement. I tried the brush and found it nowhere near as good as an Oral B cross battery-powered brush. Since I can&#x27;t return it (health product), I&#x27;ll go back to my OralB and manual flossing, and throw this one out. Takes up too much space not to be used. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My aging gums needed a bit of extra cleaning after years of regular brushing but not flossing. The dentist recommended a water pick device and this one was a good choice.  The adjustable water pressure is a good feature so that when I&#x27;m working sensitive areas the intensity can be reduced.  I&#x27;ve never had the power set above 3 (scale 1-10) so there is plenty of power.  I think the hose is a bit awkward and somewhat short and stiff.  It does recoil back into the base so the unit remains quite compact.  The variety of tips is good (brushes, angled, tongue cleaner) although I&#x27;ve only used the standard jet tip so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and dad who both have crowns and therefore, have a hard time cleaning their teeth well.  They have told me how much they love this product.  The different tips are great and their dentist noticed a definite difference.  They couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> This model was recommended to me by the hygenist.  It comes with plenty of different attachements, I stick to the basics.  I tend to use warm water as cold water really irritates me on sensitive areas. I use after brushing and flossing, and am amazed that there&#x27;s always a little something that I missed left behind.  I get my teeth cleaned every three months, so I haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist yet, which is the reason I gave the product 4 instead of 5 stars. I want to see if it has improved my gums first. (I will comment again once I find out). I&#x27;ve had no problems or leaking with the product and am pleased thus far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without my waterpik. I now call my waterpik my boyfriend because it feels so good in my mouth. Wow that&#x27;s gross but it does. It reminds me of using a q-tip--c&#x27;mon now. It&#x27;s a great feeling! This is perfect for rinsing out your mouth after a meal and washing out the toothpaste at the end of brushing. It&#x27;s amazing. I love it. Why aren&#x27;t waterpiks more well known.</li>
    <li> This model looks fancier but not as good as the precedent one I have with them. The water pressure is weaker and the water container is smaller. The only pressure dial we use is 10. It doesn&#x27;t make much sense for us to use other setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switch on the side will move the machine when you try to operate it. The old one was to push down ON and push down again OFF so you will not push it aside like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else seems to work well as it should be. Hope it will last long.</li>
    <li> I called WaterPik customer service when my WaterPik started leaking all over the counter after only two months and was told - get this - leaking is not a defect, that is the way the unit is designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not talking about a trickle from the cord. I&#x27;m saying the reservoir completely empties from somewhere underneath the WaterPik all over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service rep referred me to page 10 of the manual which reads \\&quot;When Finished: Turn the unit off. Empty any liquid left in the reservoir. Unplug the unit.\\&quot; and politely but clearly suggested that the mess was my problem for failing to read the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I explained that I preferred to floss with room temperature water rather than floss with colder water fresh from the tap and didn&#x27;t want to floss with water that circulated thru my hot water heater. She told me that in that case WaterPik recommends that customers keep a separate container next to the WaterPik and that water must never be left in the reservoir. (And don&#x27;t forget to unplug the unit after each use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mighty poor design if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any of the competitors yet but I&#x27;m looking for one that a) doesn&#x27;t leak, and b) will replace the unit if it does.</li>
    <li> It will definitely do the trick.  Can be kind of noisy on the strongest setting, but aside from that, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like the new pic that replaced my 15 year old one.The pulsating could be a little stronger on the high setting and wish the water tank was white instead of blue but other than that, it lives upto the Waterpic reputation.</li>
    <li> I had been going for cleanings every 4 months and still having some issues with my back teeth. I started using it about two weeks ago, and just went for a cleaning. The hygenist said she couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made in 1-2 weeks. She said my tissues were better and she was able for the first time do a deeper cleaning without it killing me. I noticed that the problems areas were feeling better too. I am so happy I found something that can heal my mouth.  It is an excellent investment for your teeth &amp; gum health.</li>
    <li> Pleased with all aspects.  As with many appliances I wish it were serviceable.  Hard water will eventually kill it.</li>
    <li> Flossing is terrible. Admit it. Your options before were jamming thread between your teeth to dislodge food particles or lying to your dentist (Yes, I swear I floss daily. No, I don&#x27;t know why my gums are bleeding profusely!) I bought this because I tend to get floss stuck between my extremely tight back teeth (I know, quit bragging).&lt;br /&gt;This thing works. Period. Only downside is the fact it&#x27;s a fairly big appliance. I keep mine in a drawer, because I&#x27;d rather take up half a bathroom drawer with this than floss again.</li>
    <li> Bought the lower end water pic $25 weak spray so I ordered this model and it is weak also  Very disappointed  looking for a different brand   Would not recommends his or buy another one  Crap</li>
    <li> Feels like it thourougly cleans gums and in between teeth than ordinary brushing. Highly recommended especially if you do not use floss</li>
    <li> This is just the sort of product that screams gimmick to me. Yeah, you&#x27;ll use it for like a week or two and then stop because it&#x27;s too annoying or isn&#x27;t worth the effort, etc. After seeing that it cost well under a hundred dollars I thought, sure I&#x27;ll give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with the Waterpik. First (and most importantly), it is very easy and quick to use. The whole process is done in under 2 minutes - take the tank off, fill it with water, put it back on, put the nozzle in your mouth and switch it on. Another minute of actually moving it across your gums. Switch it off, done. And I really do feel a difference using this. I&#x27;ve actually seen this remove food particles that brushing (with a Sonicare) and flossing missed. I still floss with regular string floss because I&#x27;m just too nervous to take something out of my routine. But the Waterpik is easy enough that adding that on top of brushing and flossing at night is not too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> I had a Waterpik 7-8 years ago.  I liked it a lot, but it died.  My husband&#x27;s dentist told him to gargle with saltwater, so he put it in the Waterpik when he used it.  My husband wasn&#x27;t good at rinsing it out.  Too much salt finally clogged it and killed it.    The store where I bought the Waterpik stopped carrying it and instead had the Interplak.  To me, the Interplak was just useless.  You couldn&#x27;t blow warm butter off a spoon with it.  You could turn the knob all the way up and the pressure was hardly anything.  My dentist started warning me that my gums were terrible and I will soon need special peri cleaning if things don&#x27;t change, so I gave up the Interplak and bought another Waterpik through Amazon.    I like the Waterpik better.  I don&#x27;t think you can blow bricks or paint off the wall with it, but it is significantly stronger than the Interplak.  I can use the Waterpik at full strength and it does pretty good.  I basically only use the regular pick head (none of the fancy brush, tongue, or ultra fine gum heads).  I haven&#x27;t had my next dental appointment, but I think my gums are a lot pinker and less red. They haven&#x27;t been bleeding.  My dentist has been pestering me to buy the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush (he swears by the Sonicare), which will be my next investment.</li>
    <li> Nothing cleans like the water pic. I gave it a 4 because I like more water pressure than this model puts out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a WaterPik user for years, and been very disappointed with the quality of recent products.  As others have said, the tank on this model leaks badly.  Even worse, the handle assembly simply falls apart and starts leaking around the release button, or fails to release the tips.  I&#x27;m about to order my THIRD replacement handle assembly, though I hate \\&quot;rewarding\\&quot; WaterPik for a shoddy product.     Next time I buy a dental irrigator product, I&#x27;m going to try one of WaterPik&#x27;s competitors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and stopped using Waterpiks many times. My dentist told me to start again.This one is compact,well designed,easy to use and keep clean.There&#x27;s no reason I shouldn&#x27;t use it other than laziness.</li>
    <li> I have been using a water pick twice a day for over 20 years since it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised - easy to use and hopefully beneficial to my dental health.  Transaction with Amazon completed with no problems.</li>
    <li> I love my flosser!  And all the attachments are awesome!  It&#x27;s been over a year since my purchase and I still use it.</li>
    <li> I reviewed and studied with great detail other peoples reviews before purchasing.  I was concerned with the issue of the leaking handle, but opted to give this model a try.  My opinion is not that the handle leaks, but it is simply a bit of a messy job.  With some practice you can become more finessed with this pik and not make quite so much of a mess.  But for the first few days, you should put the cat outside!  Great product, great pressure, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned a Water Pik, but I was extremely disappointed with this model which is one of their better if not their top-of-the-line model.  The motor which drives the water pressure to remove the plaque is significantly less powerful than my previous model.  Setting the water pressure on 10 (maximum pressure) on this model is comparable to setting it on 5 or 6 on my previous one.  I have serious reservations about the new model&#x27;s ability to effectively remove plaque since the water stream is so weak.  My previous model more closely emulated the water stream pressure one would experience at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Also, if you have a pedestal sink such as I, keep in mind that this model is big &amp; bulky and will take up quite a bit of room on top of the sink.  In fact, depending on the size of your pedestal sink, you may not even be able to place it on the sink unless there&#x27;s sufficient flat surface to support it.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik was recommended to my 13 year old to help clean between his braces. After being too cheap to buy one, I finally gave in when floss wasn&#x27;t doing the job. What a great thing-it&#x27;s fun to use, not messy at all, and does a great job on teeth. It replaces flossing, and parents can hear it running (not too loud, though) so you know they did it.</li>
    <li> Flossing is as pleasant an activity for me as scratching finger nails on a chalkboard so I avoid it. Using the Waterpik is comfortable and pleasant and I enjoy cleaning my teeth! I think this the best oral hygiene product I have ever purchased because I use it twice a day and I enjoy it! Get yourself one!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past month and can say that it&#x27;s been a worthwhile product for me so far.  I use the Waterpik after flossing and brushing.  Even though I think I do a good job on my teeth with just the floss and brush, I find I still have particles leftover that Waterpik catches.  I&#x27;m sure my dental hygienist is going to have alot less work to do on me the next time I see her.    I like the product&#x27;s feature of being able to dial in the strength of the water jet.  So far, I&#x27;ve only been able to select a jet of around 2.  Even at that rate, the flow is very powerful.  So I would imagine that one will be able to grow with this product.</li>
    <li> Gostei do produto mais siliencioso que os anteriores , por enquanto tudo ok</li>
    <li> I primarily use this for sinus, or nasal irrigation.  It is the best machine I have used for this purpose.  Better than the Hydro-Pulse which sells for more than twice as much!  Hydro-Pulse makes a big deal about pulsation of the water stream, but the Waterpik also pulsates.  Beware, Hydro-Pulse (Hydro-Med) has a very, very strict return policy.     The coiled cord management system works better than any other machine I have tried.  I also like the lid which keeps dust out of the water tank. It is quieter than earlier Waterpik models.      [...]</li>
    <li> This product is more powerful than the super floss. Oral health is very important and I highly recommend this gadget. I bring it with me on holidays, this is something I won&#x27;t be able to live without! I love it! Having a perfect dental health is priceless!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using one of these things and it seems to do the job quite well. From what I read from other reviews, this should last quite a while. The accessories are nice, although I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use them all.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to a review I read and they were right.  Even though the water container is a bit small, I have a plastic container that I use IF I want to refill the water container while irrigating my gums.  I love the holder that I can slide the wand into.  The plastic cord memory makes it easy to lift out and easy to slide back in for storage.  The white lid on top stores the tips and will keep contaminants out of the blue container when not in use.  I never take the blue tank off the unit.  I just add water with my plastic cup and when finished I just lift the whole unit up and dump any residual water out.  It is small and easy to use and looks nice and clean sitting on the counter.  JUST DON\\&quot;T TWIST THE WAND/PLASTIC CORD.  Be sure to twist the circular head for movement of the tip.  The cord does not yield to the stress of being twisted. It is brittle and will split if twisted. That is my only caution.  I trust this unit will last me a long time. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Wish lthey had made these when I was a kid.  I&#x27;m sure my teeth would be in better shape.  My dentist says it is doing a marvelous job and I use it as often as I can.  Usually several times a day.</li>
    <li> My dental hygenist suggested that I buy one and use it in an area that collects food and even flossing does not remove.  Well, I can tell you that this does the trick.  I only wish I would have purchased one sooner.  It does a great job and my wife loves using it also.</li>
    <li> When my dentist made me a bridge, she recommended to me to get a dental water jet system for cleaning - a Waterpik.  Ordinary floss will no longer do the job as it cannot squeeze in between my new teeth.  Not very familiar at that time about what a Waterpik is, I went to do my research and read saw this one with one of the best reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occupies only a small footprint, very easy to setup and simple to use.  The jet has 10 power settings.  1 to 3 is weak, while 8 to 10 might be very strong.  I recommend to start by using the number 3 setting and adjust the knob as it suits you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple attachments included. Changing between tips is very quick.  There is a small button near the base for release and to replace with a new one is just a little push with a click.  First, I thought that the brush is the best tool to clean my teeth.  But then the brush itself is hindering the water jet particularly when the bristles bend as you brush your teeth.  The 2 regular tips are the best for the job.  There is one strange looking tool tip for cleaning the tongue, honestly I find no use for that.  The orthodontic tip, and the Pik-Pocket tip has a much finer rubber tip for the little crevices around your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new dental bridge, I really can not clean my teeth as thorough without a water jet.  Not only it cleans the teeth, it also massage the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra:&lt;br /&gt;- This is also great for cleaning small things thats that are impossible to reach. Good example are jewelries, sippy cups that has rubber parts,, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product.  It also makes cleaning teeth more fun.  Even my kids are having fun with it.  I just wish it includes 3 more regular color coded tips for each member of the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution - There is a sticker underneath the base saying not to use it for more than 5 minutes in a 2 hour period.  I have my waterpik for more than 3 years now and still working good.  Maybe the reason why some owners have their units stopped working in such a short time is overheating.  It is not a heavy duty appliance.he reason why some owners have their units stopped working in such a short time is overheating.  It is not a heavy duty appliance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpick and I had to return the first one as it would not pass water through the water tube.  It works ok but it is poorly designed.  The instructions are not really definitive and in some cases incorrect. The curled hose to the handle gets hung and will cut off the water to the pic until turn the machine off and straighten the hose. The item is not \\&quot;user friendly.\\&quot;  The subject item is supposed to be the best pick but if it is, I would like second best.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t bore you with the nitnoy details of this thing. Everybody else seems to have done that for me.   The durned thing WORKS exactly as it should and gets my teeth (and in between) CLEAN.   It&#x27;s the greatest invention since sliced bread...er, well, since dental FLOSS. SO much that if I miss a day, I MISS using it! I have my pressure setting up to \\&quot;8\\&quot; and I&#x27;m satisfied with it and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I set up the flosser and did not have any issues.  It is working properly.  This is the second unit I bought.  I have the first one for over a year without any problem.</li>
    <li> the error voltage &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;short circuit&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;exploded %&gt;_&lt;% but the price in china is 880rmb($139.92),its more affordable even to place  another order. +_+</li>
    <li> It seems to do the job it was designed for, spraying  fine jet of water with some force.  The dentist did notice an improvement after a few months of use.   I&#x27;d give it a full five stars except there is room for improvement I don&#x27;t like the stiff coiled cord and you need to learn how not to release the tip while using it.  At first I though it did not hold enough water in the tank because it ran out to quickly.  But after a few weeks of use you learn how to work faster and the tank lasts more than long enough.   Minor things really it works \\&quot;well enough\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik mainly to use as a sinus irrigator. I use it with a Sinupulse sinus tip. Works very well, except you do have to take the rubber tip off the sinupulse stem and slip it onto a Waterpik tip stem because water will leak from incompatibility. The Waterpik tip is curved and won&#x27;t line up with the hole in the sinus tip perfectly, but you get the same water pressure. I purchased a Waterpik instead of the Hydropulse and Sinupulse machines because of water pump/motor issues and the warranty. I found in my research that many folks had issues with these machines leaking and inevitably completely breaking anywhere between 6 and 14 months of regular use, and it only has a 1 year warranty- so if it breaks afer 12 months, you&#x27;ve got to spend another $100 for a new machine. The Waterpik has a 2 year warranty, and costs between $50 and $70 less, depending on which Waterpik model you buy. It was a no-brainer to go with the Waterpik and a sinus tip for sinus irrigation, which is a life-saver if you have moderate to severe sinus problems/allergies. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> This is agreat product and easy to use. We bought it for our 10 year old son who has braces. It does a great job and he uses it every day.</li>
    <li> I just replaced an older water pik with this model, which is compact, effective and contains added instruments to facilitate dental cleaning and health.  Good price and very pleased with size - doesn&#x27;t take up much space on counter top.</li>
    <li> The unit works fine and is easy to use. I seems a little flimsy. There is no place to store the piks that we use every day, just specific spaces for all the special ones. We have not had the unit very long and are hoping not to have the problems of motors burning out or other things that previous reviewers complained about.</li>
    <li> This device performs up to expectations, and can be used quickly and simply.  The basic attachment remains the one I use.  Only less-than-perfect feature is the storage area for the various attachments.  It does not latch and you need to be careful lifting it off and on to get to the reservoir tank.  Very minor inconvenience, though.</li>
    <li> This product is something I wish was in my posession decades ago.  It is a must for oral hygiene.  It makes the evening ritual of cleaning the teeth actually enjoyablr, does not take long, and you coma away feeling refreshed, and good knowing you are taking an active role in your health.   The simplicitiy of operation is clear, and very dependable.  My 10 year old son uses it everyday, and likes it too. The settings are basic but logical, and the unit is hiolding up well.  If you have any tough spots in your teeth to clean, this will do it, you will be happy you did</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband on August, and it since to work pretty well. He´s happy with the results of having healthier gums and cleaner mouth. It also has improved his breath tremendously. I would definitely recomend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> first off this is a ok product the effort and mess it makes to get out the minimal food is not worth the 50 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first you have to use warm water and fill the reservoir it is a nice size i never had a problem with it running out but you also have to dry it or it could grow bacteria inside.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.second this thing is loud and vibrates my counter which then vibrates the wall which wakes people up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;third alot of the the tips are useless like the tongue scraper it really does not scrape anything off at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the settings are ok but you will find yourself just using one setting and thats it the higher ones just hurt and the low ones dont do anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very messy and doesnt really get everything out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hose is memory coiled so it goes neatly back into its resting spot so no need to coil it up like a extension cord or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the tip spins 360 so you dont have to keep moving your arm just stick it in your mouth and spin with your thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;large reservoir&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in conclusion  i would rather use regular floss or get one of those plastic arm flosses to help because this is to much of a hassle by the time i warm the water up fill the reservoir with water clean the mess in my bathroom then brush my teeth and mouthwash i could of been asleep. i returned it for a full refund which makes me worried will they resell this ? ewww</li>
    <li> I loved this Waterpik, but brittle hose broke in less than 8mo. This is my 2nd Waterpik with a Broken Hose!!!  SOOO CHEAP!  It&#x27;s like nylons that run .. hose is so hard to replace (for novice) that Waterpik&#x27;s ceo&#x27;s must be laughing all the way to the bank when consumers opt to buy a new one -thanks Waterpik ..BUT NO THANKS!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a dead Waterpik and have no complaints.  Using a waterpik instead of flossing works great for me and my dentist approves.</li>
    <li> This flosser beats the compact models I&#x27;ve tried hands down, and is even more affordable.  Like many people I go for space savers, but the 4.5 x 5.5-inch footprint of the Waterpik Ultra is well justified by the additional options, including six different tips and widely adjustable pressure.  Now that my elderly teeth need more maintenance, this is just the ticket.</li>
    <li> I have always used a waterpik in my dental hygiene.  It does a great job getting in between hard to reach areas and small crevices.  I still floss (it does not replace flossing).  In fact it makes flossing easier.  It&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner your teeth feel because you can actually see how much food was still stuck in your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have one of these already and I bought this one for my wife. The shipping was quick and it was free! However the product did not work right-it had very little pumping power even at the full setting. I returned the product to Amazon. The return process was easy to do and it was a hassle free experience.</li>
    <li> I take excellent care of my teeth, however, even with regular brushing/flossing/mouthwash, I still had acquired pockets around some teeth with the potential of getting gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added the Water Flosser to my &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34;.  My gums are less sensitive and feel better.  I&#x27;m anxious to go to my next dental check up!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the item because I have two areas in my mouth which are difficult to reach. They contain deep &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34;. The Waterpick does a great job on clearing the debris from the &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34;. I have not made as much use of the item for general flossing but from what I have done it worked well. Also, the price is very good and great value, so you don&#x27;t need deep pockets to buy it!</li>
    <li> The perfect tool to complete the trio of brushing, flossing and oral irrigation. My hygienist will love it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and great price to boot.  BUY IT NOW!!!  and save  DOES THE JOB , YOU WILL BE HAPPY</li>
    <li> Very important. This does not replace flossing. There are videos from dentist, documentation, and your local dentist that (should) will say that this does not replace flossing. They pretty much say use this in addition to flossing/brushing.  The reason why I give it 5 stars is because after I floss and brush my teeth, I used this and am able to get every little partical out of my mouth. You didn&#x27;t think mouthwash would completely rinse your mouth, did you? I only use mine at night since that extra minute is precious to me in the morning but would suggest using it twice a day.  Tips:  I suggest for a first time user, brush your teeth and floss like normal. Close your sink up so the water can&#x27;t drain (make sure it&#x27;s perfectly clean) then use this waterpik. For most people, you should see stuff floating around in the water after you&#x27;re done even if you used mouthwash prior to using this. That should justify your purchase if you ever needed any.   I use warm (not hot) water with a small amount of Act mouthwash. I go in between my teeth and gum line, tongue and then quickly all over. It&#x27;s like a spa for the mouth! For safe measures I quickly run a small amount of water through the Waterpik again for a few seconds just to get out any mouthwash that may be left.</li>
    <li> Hey I am a retired dentist, so I guess what I say here might carry a little weight.  Let me on the outset say that I have not reviewed the literature of this product, and this only is a review based on impression.  You need to know that plague has two basic components.  First the water soluble component, and secondly the component that is not water soluble.  That said, because plaque is basically \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;, you need mechanical pressure to remove the plaque generally, and so it goes without saying that floss or a toothbrush works in this capacity.  However, it is possible that you get the mechanical boost from the pulsating action of this product.  I used this product, and found it fairly effective, but quite frankly as to their claims that it is \\&quot;2x\\&quot; as effective as floss I would raise a professional eyebrow at this.  I found (sample size of only one - so don&#x27;t think this is scientific) that mechanical flossing done correctly (that is a big if) is perhaps more effective, for I for the heck of it (don&#x27;t try this as home), didn&#x27;t floss for three days, tried the product, and the gingivitis not completely resolved.  I tried it again with floss, and the resolution almost immediate.  This doesn&#x27;t necessarily prove anything, but I hope you understand.  All that said, let&#x27;s talk about the practical.  I happen to know that people HATE to floss.  I mean H-A-T-E.  Floss probably rates as one of the most hated things besides mothers-in-law or ex&#x27;s.  Especially it you have a bridge or implant - forget it - only the obsessive-compulsive people will sit in the bathroom and floss properly.  So especially for the later folk, this is a very good product, and quite frankly, we don&#x27;t live in a perfect world, and although I still think mechanical floss is probably better, for the 95% of the rest of use, get a look at this.  It might not improve your social life, but it might be good for your teeth.  Oh forgot to say:  check with your dentist before you use this product, especially on thehigher settings, or if you have a previous history of periodontal pocketing - a word to the wise.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Ultra Water Pik device following the replacement of my upper teeth with dental implants.  I find it to be an irreplaceable part of my dental care regimen with the new dental work, and it works great on the teeth in my lower jaw as well. I especially like the differnt attachments; you can find just what you need for about any purpose, from brushing to gentle rinsing, to targeted flushing of tight spaces.  As an extra bonus, it is really helping to improve the health of my gums and I find I am more consistent in using the water pik than I have been with flossing in the past.  A good investment in your dental health.</li>
    <li> This is the way to floss! You don&#x27;t have to look for floss anymore or buy more floss or spend a long time floss. This item is great!</li>
    <li> Power cleaner for your teeth and works in a few seconds even if your on the run.&lt;br /&gt;Removes everything from your mouth in a blast of water</li>
    <li> This item works great and needs to be used every day. I use warm water. It does the job and works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent; has reduced the inflammation in my gums noticably ; I now don&#x27;t have bleeding gums and they look and feel healthier.</li>
    <li> I have had this a few months and I use it throughout the week, It works well and you can adjust the pressure to very strong or not so strong flow, this is a good alternate to regular flossing for those that hate flossing.</li>
    <li> I gave up manual flossing some time ago and bought a water flosser.  I was greatly disappointed with it mainly because after a short time of use it leaked and made lots of noise.  Annoyed with the constant mess from the leaking I decided to throw it in the trash.  As usual I searched Amazon for a replacement and ordered this unit.   I love this water flosser.  Let me count the ways.  It does a great job.  It is not loud like the one I had before.  It holds more water than the one I had before.  It has many settings allowing a person to start out with minimal pressure until you get used to it.  The seal on the tank is well made so there is no leaking.  I love the fact that it does not take up a big space on my vanity.  It is a great machine and does a fantastic job.  This little machine put a smile on my face again.</li>
    <li> Excellent survice and great product.  Just what I wanted.  Best ever model.  Have tried others but love this one!</li>
    <li> My teeth have NEVER felt cleaner, its truly amazing how well it cleans teeth, gums, below the gums, behind the back teeth, pockets, everything. EVERYTHING. I love this product, I am buying a 2nd one to have at work and buying more as gifts. Attn Dentists - SHAME on you for not telling your patients about the WaterPik.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about two months now; my dental hygenist knows I&#x27;m not a fan of flossing (to say the least) and she said, \\&quot;If you&#x27;re not going to floss, please get a water pik.\\&quot;  Then she stopped and said, \\&quot;I&#x27;m not telling you that you HAVE to.  But I think it would help.\\&quot;    Well, OK.  So I went home and did some research and bought the WaterPik Ultra.    I like how small it is on the bathroom counter.  I like that I can adjust the water pressure (what do people use the highest levels for, stripping paint off cars?!).  I thought it would be louder than it is, since my partner had experience with waterpiks in the 1970s and he remembered them as quite loud.  He sleeps right through it when I use this model.    My nightly habit is to use my sonicare toothbrush, then add a little listerine to the waterpik reservoir and fill it with warm water.  I use the regular jet tip, then I&#x27;m done.      I know feelings aren&#x27;t everything, but my mouth *feels* cleaner than ever before.  And yes, I&#x27;m occasionally surprised at the sort of stuff the waterpik dislodges and washes out.    In April or May I have my next dentist appointment; that will be the real test, to see if I get the same \\&quot;You know, you ought to floss more\\&quot; lecture, or if instead I hear \\&quot;Wow, your gums look great!\\&quot;    So we&#x27;ll see.  But in the meantime I love the thing.  I think it helps that it&#x27;s a gadget, and kind of fun to use, whereas flossing never was fun for me.  (I got better at brushing when I got the sonicare, too.)  But that could just be my dork tendencies showing through.    Anyway, I love it.  I feel a bit odd rhapsodizing about oral hygiene, but . . . whatcha gonna do?    UPDATE:  I am just back from my 4-month dentist checkup.  My dental hygienist and my dentist were AMAZED at how healthy my gums were, and how little tartar/plaque was on my teeth, and how my gums didn&#x27;t bleed at all.  I only used the basic plain tip, and I used it on one of the lowest-pressure settings (maybe 2 or 3).  If I put anything extra in the water it was a capful of listerine-- not a high enough amount to have made a difference, said my dentist, so it was just the action of the water that did the trick.    But-- it did the job!  Success!  So to any of you out there who hate to floss, use this machine regularly and you will save money at the dentist!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with other water cleaners to compare this one to.  But it works as advertized.      I always floss first, so I don&#x27;t see how much cleaning can be accomplished, but this kind of product is best used for cleaning under the gums and messaging them.  Often an overlooked chore.    My only criticism is that the water reservior is too small.  At the highest setting, a full tank will be depleted in maybe a couple of minutes approx.  You need to be near a sink to refill it.    I recommend that waterpic provide information on length of time a full tank will deplete, and also whether or not adding some hydrogen peroxide and salt to the water would damage the pumping mechanism.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I use this after I brush my teeth to dislodge all the little debris between each tooth. The waterpik works so well that I have added it to my daily routine for teeth care.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son who has a mouthful of Orthodontia (pallet expander and Herbst device).  Very useful and works well.  Hoping it lasts through 2 sons with Orthodontia.</li>
    <li> I bought it on my Doctor&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;But it is a chore to take it out every night &amp; use it.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because I do not have space in my bathroom to leave it outside.</li>
    <li> I have had this unit for 8 months. Never have a problem with it. Thanks to Waterpik, now my teeth feel clean and fresh everyday.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. After finding out that I had periodontal disease I purchased this product. It&#x27;s faster than flossing and apparently is more effective. Not to mention on the highest speed it gives your gums a nice little massage. I have had it a few weeks now and have not experienced any leakage problems. I already recommended this product to others in my family.</li>
    <li> This replaced my 15 year old Waterpik and it works great.  Comparing the two, the newer reservoir is easier to remove to fill, the on/off button can be pushed with a finger without the whole unit moving and the cord curls up nicely back into place.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use all the extra pik attachments that were provided.  They store inside the top cap but they don&#x27;t snap into place so they are loose inside, and the storage top cap itself doesn&#x27;t snap closed so there&#x27;s a chance the contents could spill out if you&#x27;re not careful removing it.  It&#x27;s annoying but wouldn&#x27;t change me buying the product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I hate going in to have my teeth cleaned. Despite my years of daily flossing, regular brushing etc., whenever I go in for cleaning, the friendly dental hygienist seems to be trained to look gloomy as she measures the &#x27;deep pockets&#x27; in my teeth. This is always followed with a visit from the dentist who warns that if I don&#x27;t shell out X number of dollars for some serious work to offset my disappointing results, I will be a sad, toothless old woman in the future. This maudlin behavior is worse than even the discomfort of getting my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s why, after 12 years I&#x27;m writing my first Amazon review. Something different occurred two months after I began using my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. On this most recent visit, the hygienist oohed with delight about how much better my teeth and gums looked than in the past. I decided not to reveal that I was using the Waterpik flosser, because I wondered what the dentist would say. Sure enough, when she entered and read that the pockets in my teeth had receded, she looked more unhappy that ever. In a shrill voice she assured me that yes, my gums and teeth did look better--\\&quot;better flossing,\\&quot; I mumbled--but then she warned me (basically) not to rest on my laurels, and she implied that I had better get that expensive work done that she had been warning--I mean, suggesting--was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dentist not only proved that she -- and several of the different dentists with whom I have consulted over the years--are sales people as well as doctors: they want to ramp up the fear so patients will shell out more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not suggesting that I won&#x27;t get the procedures I probably do need, but I have to say that it sure was nice for once to walk out of a dental cleaning with a great report. I feel sorry for the hygienist who had probably been trained to look gloomy no matter what the examination revealed, but she wasn&#x27;t able to conceal her delight in my healthier looking teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. I feel as if I have found one of the few products that does as it claims to do. Bravo.</li>
    <li> As others have said, start out at the lower power settings for a few days and then work up to the higher settings. It took me +/- 2 weeks go go from 2, to 10. There is a noticeable increase in cleaning power at 10.    It is amazing the food particle that this removes. Even after a complete brush and floss the pik still find and dislodges things I&#x27;ve missed.     I found it was much more comfortable to use warm to hot tap water rather than cold.    Its been 6 weeks since I&#x27;ve been to the dentist and my teeth still feel fresh from the dentist clean.     We&#x27;ll see how much of a difference my dentist sees when I go for my next visit.</li>
    <li> This is the one my dentist recommended, specifically not the rechargeable one.  Found the best price on amazon.com.  I only use one attachment, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> My husband and I decided to purchase this and have absolutely no regrets.  It&#x27;s amazing to see&lt;br /&gt;what&#x27;s left behind after just brushing!  Our dentist was very happy to hear we were using one also.&lt;br /&gt;We were so pleased that we purchased one for our&lt;br /&gt;13 year old granddaughter who just got braces.....she is also thrilled...couldn&#x27;t wait to try it&lt;br /&gt;when it was delivered.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product.  I had one before and I loved the way it worked.  I just got this one and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I am returning it.</li>
    <li> My 1st dental irrigator (same model) had very strong water pressure, it flushed out everything in between my teeth. I broke it when I tried to use it in Hong Kong with inappropriate voltage. I bought the same model from Amazon since it worked really well for me. I was a little disappointed on the 2nd one because the water pressure seemed not as strong. I contacted the manufacture and sent it back for repair or replacement. They tested my irrigator and said it met the specification and sent it back to me. Now I have to use setting 8 or 9 instead of 6 from my 1st irrigator.</li>
    <li> This newer model has several great attachments that my old water pik did not have. I have only used one of the attachments so far and will enjoy trying all the attachments. Most likely, using this newer model and the additional attachments included will be more beneficial than the older model. The design is more attractive also and the storage unit for the attachments comes in handy. The price was reasonable and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that water alone would be enough to pull food stuck between gums. I floss regularly and flossed before using this for the first time just to see. Sure enough, I saw more food particles come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lowest setting was too weak for starting, but putting it up to around 6 seemed to be fine. You have to be careful not to hurt yourself though as sensitive skin can be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also suggesting adding a little mouthwash to the water so help clean a little more too.</li>
    <li> JUST BUY IT- Your dentest will thank you. BTW still working fine after years.</li>
    <li> I had never used a water flosser or waterpik product before and am hooked on how well the flosser gets in between the tight spaces.  If you have never tried one of these, please consider it.  And the company stands behind their products also.  I accidentally knocked the small valve out of the bowl and it went down our drain.  When I called about buying a replacement, they replaced it free! Sweet!</li>
    <li> Was a bit concerned when reading earlier reviews, but bought this anyway. It&#x27;s working well for us. The reservoir holds enough water, the tube is plenty long enough. We don&#x27;t have any problems with the pause button or with rotating the tip. Our last machine was an Interplak which worked well but only lasted about 3 years. It also left the counter messy and wet...this brand/model doesn&#x27;t drip or leak at all. This is also the best, easiest storage of the tubing of any water flossers that we&#x27;ve had including previous Waterpiks.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and a Waterpik user. It is a bit messy, but I find it to be the most effective tool for dental home care and it is  especially beneficial for anyone with periodontal problems. Using warm water and the highest setting, I trace the facial (outside) and lingual (inside) surfaces of each tooth at the gumline while pausing briefly between the teeth. Directing the stream of water interproximally (between the teeth) is going to be the most important part for most of us. I lean over the sink and don&#x27;t even try to look in the mirror - it will seem awkward and messy at first, but you will eventually get the feel for it. Your gums will likely bleed when you first start using it, but please don&#x27;t let that deter you - they will quickly get healthier with regular use.    I am in no way affiliated with Waterpik or Teledyne, but I believe this machine is the best way to maintain periodontal pockets and the margins of crowns, bridges or any restorations that extend to the gumline or between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Read the other reviews and decided to get this one. It arrived as described.  It seems to work well along with brushing and mouth wash my mouth feels super clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Amazon for a LOT less and my 11-year-old uses it with no problems.  Update: 2 1/2 years later my children are still using this device with no issues (9 and 14 years old).</li>
    <li> I use this as a means to floss, with this in mind, it does the job excellently.  The highest setting might be a little too powerful for most, but it is adjustable.  It also does a great job of getting food particles from the back part of your teeth.  I have found that adding a little bit of mouth wash into the reservoir gives your mouth a little extra clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the downsides of it is that it really doesn&#x27;t power off plaque build up, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re in search of, this item is not it in my opinion.  But if you want to reach places that are hard to get to with floss, and clean your gums and in between teeth better than floss, then this item is definitely it.</li>
    <li> Have had for a year with no complaints. I have braces and it really works well. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than flossing, but it does a good job and has held up now for awhile.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to prevent gum problems</li>
    <li> I have been using my new Water Flosser every Day for the past Month.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so far, and the price was great and shipped it right out.</li>
    <li> WOW!! Cannot believe I went so long without having one of these!  It really cleans your teeth after brushing to where they feel sqeeky clean.  My dentist recommended I get one of these for my gums so I will see if they improve from the massages.</li>
    <li> This water pik replaced a cheaper water pik that I purchased locally and have never been happy with.  The more expensive water pik works much better and is well worth the price difference.  As with all of my Amazon purchases, the interaction was fine.  Amazon provides enough information about the product and publishes both positive and negative reviews so that intelligent selection is easy.  Delivery was on time - I use Amazon Prime.  The product was as advertized.  I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with the product and with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I recently blogged about a grossly disappointing dental jet, the Interplak Dental Water Jet.  It is a delight to post a highly positive review on the Waterpik Ultra.  It is by far the best dental jet I have owned.  It has a quality feel to it.  You can turn it off and on without the thing sliding all over the counter.  It has multiple pressure settings and a workable pause control.  The piks easily insert and remove.  That sounds picayune but the Interplak Dental Water Jet was a major effort to remove or insert the pik.  If you are sharing a unit you will want to insert and remove the piks easily.  My only criticism of the unit is  that I wish they would have included 4 regular water piks instead of two.  My compulsive personality would like to have a backup pik for myself and my spouse.  This is a five star unit and worth every penny.  I got mine at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The unit has a two year warranty and it is now 2 years and 7 months later and the hose has cracked spewing water everywhere.  This would not offend me so much if it hadn&#x27;t happen to the last Waterpik product I had purchased. Waterpik needs to up their game on the hoses on their product.  Loved the unit and the job it did, dismayed I have to drop another $50 just because the hose cracked!</li>
    <li> I recently perchased this item based on other reviews. I have had it for 1 mo,I find it well worth the money.Easy to use w/ great results. I would recommend and would definately purchase again.</li>
    <li> I remember waterpik growing up as a kid but never tried one until age 54! Wow! I love it! I have tried many different ways to increase my flossing but I would get in a hurry and forget (it&#x27;s not my favorite thing to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are not in bad shape because I get them cleaned every 6 months but now that I have quit smoking I want to whiten and take better care of them, as well as my gums. I replaced all my old 30 year old silver amalgam fillings with composites, whitened my teeth and started flossing more. The problem came with flossing. I would keep forgetting. Can&#x27;t wait to get to my dentist to see their reaction now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the waterpik my gums bled but stopped by the third time using the machine. My gums feel so much better. Now I can&#x27;t wait to floss! With my new sonicare healthywhite and this waterpik I am on the way to healthier gums and whiter teeth. The hunt is over.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast, and in great condition.  My dentist recomended this item as I have bridges that are hard to get floss into.It works wonderful, and so much easier than floss for bridges, and tight areas.</li>
    <li> It works very well. My teeth feel and look like I visit a dentist office every day. I also checked a few times with a regular floss to see if anything is still in between the teeth after using my Waterpick and nothing....I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hate to floss, but I do enjoy using this. Works great. I&#x27;ve only had it a short while so I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity of it.</li>
    <li> I have never used a water pik before, but I am now wearing braces so my orthodontist suggested I get one. I really, really like using it. Just one thing - when you hit the button, the water automatically starts to come out, and then you have to push a button the handle to stop the flow of water. Maybe it is just me, but I think it should be the opposite - you should push the button to START the flow of water and release it when you want it to stop. To me, that would make more sense. Other than that, I really like it!</li>
    <li> So my dentist recommended one of these and said that along with flossing and brushing they are the single best thing you can do for your teeth and especially your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to work great, I use warm water from the tap, I pray the jet along my gums and my teeth feel clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to tell if it&#x27;s working? Try using one about 15 minutes after a meal and you&#x27;ll see what was in your mouth/teeth :)</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended the Waterpik for even better dental haelthcare and it really does a wondrful job. Product arrived as promised and i&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
    <li> This waterpik arrived as described, works great!  Good value compared to local stores, came with extra cleaning tips.  I would recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.Its instant gratification to see the food bits being rinsed out of your teeth.But you still got to brush your teeth to keep them white.The button on the handle should shut off the pump temporarily not just the water flow.This kind of annoys me,otherwise i am hooked for life.</li>
    <li> i like the clean feeling but not sure if the device is effective,i used it for about a month and did not see my dentist yet</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  I use it every night at bedtime, and anytime I feel food stuck in my braces. It is very easy to use, and the water pressure is simple to regulate.  I like the clean feeling I get each time I use it.</li>
    <li> I recently got braces a little over two months ago and I was told that I needed to floss. After some failed attempts with regular thread floss I gave in and purchased this water flosser AND LET ME TELL YOU I AM SO GLAD I DID! It really cleans up better than flossing and the results are right there in the sink. (A little gross since I didn&#x27;t expect all those remnants though) Now I use it after every meal just before I brush.</li>
    <li> I love this unit.  I still haven&#x27;t worked my way up to the strongest flow, but my teeth feel totally clean and my gums look healthy.  It&#x27;s an additon to brushing and flossing I wish I had started long ago.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy one of these units.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]    This product is a much improved version over the Waterpik&#x27;s previous designs. The unit comes with easily installed and removable Pik attachments used for cleaning between the teeth and gums.  The unit price is a bargain for what it can do to maintain good oral health.</li>
    <li> Once I get used to or better at directing the water flow, I expect to have an excellent teeth/gum cleaning machine.  So far, though, I have used the Water Pik only four times  because  water gets on the vanity top, the mirror, and   me.  Needing to wipe up a considerable amount of water adds to the overall time needed to perform teeth/gum cleaning.  I need to practice !</li>
    <li> Works much better than the cordless Waterpicks I had (I had two of them) The battery didn&#x27;t last very long on either one of them and you can&#x27;t replace them.   I won&#x27;t have that proplem with this one. I have braces on my bottom teeth and you can&#x27;t believe all the stuff that collects in them.  I really like this pik.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 6 month ago after my dental exam. I had very sensitive gum and it bleeded a lot. After 6 month of use, I renturned to my dentist today. He was amazed by the improvement of my gum. The bleeding was gone.I use brush and Waterpik everyday. Thanks to Waterpik.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED THIS FOR A FRIEND OF MINE AND HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT. HE SAID EVERY HOUSEHOLD SHOULD HAVE ONE. CONSIDERING NOW BUYING ONE FOR MYSELF.</li>
    <li> The new waterpik is much quieter than its predecessor; is very efficient; and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a need for this instrument.</li>
    <li> Got product, it works great. I have a battery operated water pik but the chamber is so small you have to keep refilling it. The reservoir is large enough on this water pik that it has enough water to do my entire mouth without refilling. I also like all the different attachments it has.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 Waterpiks now...2 ultra&#x27;s and they all fail relatively the same and relatively quickly.  They last about a year that&#x27;s it.    The hoses fail.  They pinch off eventually and leak.    Don&#x27;t buy Waterpik junk.  They have intentionally put in a failure point so you have to buy a new on every year.  It&#x27;s garbage.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, Google \\&quot;repair waterpik hose\\&quot; and you will see all the people with the same issue.  You will also see repair kits that cost as much as a new waterpik.  Don&#x27;t bother going down this path in the first and buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> When my dentist told me I had to purchase a Water Pik to care for my bridge, I immediately went to \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; to begin my search.  I chose this Model, and I made the right decision.  It does a wonderful job, isn&#x27;t too messy to work with, and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  The machine isn&#x27;t extremely loud, you can choose the firmness of sprays, they give you 6 different tips, and it&#x27;s easy to set up and take down.  Wish I had known about it sooner!</li>
    <li> We needed this- since my teenager with braces was not prone to proper hygiene standards in the mouth dept.  Both my nine and 14 yr old are able to run this - and like too (!) afterward the bathroom is a bit damp- but not deluged.    My middle-age teeth are benefiting-not sure if it replaces flossing- but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything left after a double cup filling of the resevoir.    It blasts hard enough- thought it might be stronger- but we run it on high and that is fine.</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5 star rating.  I&#x27;m really pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item mainly because the pressure could be controlled, 1 to 10. On my old water-pik, the pressure could NOT be controlled  and the water hurt my gums. I currently have temporary full-mouth implants that require water flush under the implants. I think it will  be much easier when the permanent implants are installed in three or four more months because there won&#x27;t be as much plastic covering  the top and lower areas behind the implants. Of course, a newly designed TIP, with a curvature of 135 to 160 degrees so that it could be  easily pointed to direct the spray under the implants without trying to point the 90 degree points to get under would benefit much more  for implant patients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for almost two years, and have had three different models. This one is the best one that I&#x27;ve used. I like the design of this model better than my previous two. It&#x27;s more compact, and seems to be a much better design.&lt;br /&gt;With this model the pause button on the handle is easier to use and more effective. I also prefer how the heads go on, it&#x27;s also easier and much faster. The setting on this model are on the base, I have no preference as to that.&lt;br /&gt;I like the lid, but it only stores four heads and it comes with six different heads, that annoyed me. I also am not sure I like the On/Off placement, but it isn&#x27;t a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik has helped improved my dental health greatly. I wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner. I&#x27;m constantly recommending this model to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I&#x27;ve had three different models and this one is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> This arrived in a timely fashion. At first I thought it leaked lol but it was me and the way I was using it. It worked fine once I did it right. Love it. Makes my teeth feel so clean. I would recommend it. It came with a lot of attachments and once you register it online you get a coupon for replacement picks and brushes. So be sure to register it. It can save you some money.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for people who have braces. The water flosser makes it so easy to get everything out that shouldn&#x27;t be there :) A step up from manual flossing.</li>
    <li> First I bought the GSI Portable Oral Irrigator but it only lasted a few weeks until water got into the battery compartment and disrupted the unit. Then I decided on this even though the footprint is bigger. I am very pleased with this unit. I like the fact you don&#x27;t have to fill it each time, has adjustable pressure settings and you can swivel the tip with your finger as you floss. Also having all the tips is nice because my daughter now uses it because of the tip for braces. My other daughter uses it as well because she thinks it&#x27;s a cool device. (hopefully the novelty won&#x27;t wear off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was comparing on Amazon for a replacement to the portable unit and I saw this one has the tube coiled in the unit I was thinking what a pain it will be to get the tube coiled back in the unit. But, much to my surprise the tube is similar to an old phone cord and springs back into place very nicely when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about the unit is the water will get a cold in the reservoir which bothers some of my teeth but it&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
    <li> Wow what a product. since I&#x27;m using it my mounth feels different, the clean feeling  it produces makes me feel secure (about breath) when i&#x27;m speaking with some one.  One of the best products I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> I love it, and I am totally happy with this purchase.  The only things I could say that are slightly negative are: the water tube could be a tad longer.  I don&#x27;t like items on my sink and a longer tube would have allowed me to set it next to my sink, no biggie.  I am still very happy.  Also, it come with so many attachments that I will never use and only one classic jet attachment.  Since there are two of us, I will have to buy another classic jet attachment.  It would have been better to leave out the toothbrush and tongue cleaner and give extra jets.</li>
    <li> I recently got braces and this product has made my life so much easier.  Doesn&#x27;t replace string floss but far more effective than brushing alone.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works wonderfully, and as a result, I use it every day.  This unit is much better than the cordless</li>
    <li> I am totally happy with this purchase.It would have been better to leave out the toothbrush and tongue cleaner and give extra jets.</li>
    <li> I have used a waterpik product in the past and just needed extra tips since mine broke. But of course they quit making tips for the old model so I bought this one. The advertisement about all those tips included with this product is just a fancy ad.The different tips don&#x27;t do much at all. For example, the toothbrush tip just rinses away whatever toothpaste you put on,before you have a chance to get it foaming. The pic-pocket tip has such a tiny opening that it is just a gimmick;the regular tip does more than it.They should have just included 4  color-coded tips for family use instead of the current ones.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is everything its advertised and then some. One great feature is the large capacity waer tank that allows you to do a complete rinsing job. It is well made and the price was outstanding.    Miguel A. Zamora</li>
    <li> Never had a waterpik before but having recent bridge work, my dentist recommended to get deep underneath without having to use the floss stick thing.  This does a really nice job.  Strength of the water flow is adjustable and powerful if you need it.  The water resevoir could be a little bigger to hold more water but, over all I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase.  Arrived within a couple days too.</li>
    <li> The Waterpic quit working after one year.  Bad investment!!!</li>
    <li> Well I got mine today and turned it up to maximum and became sad and disappointed, very wimpy!!! I was used to an older model 76M.  I would say my old model was twice as powerful maybe more. If this is your first model you will be OK but for those of us that had older models...well what can you do. Me, I will keep it and use it but I will keep my eye open for the 76M at garage sales and fleabay. It is a purely rectangular model 6 inches by 3 inches and 6 inches tall with 76M stamped on the bottom it is probably from the 80s. I am not sure as I bought it used 10 years ago. Maybe I will add a picture of it as I still have it and may check into repairing it.</li>
    <li> Just returned home from my 6-month dental checkup. Not being a regular flosser (too messy, time consuming and a hassle for me) my dental hygienist was quite impressed with my improved results (no bleeding gums). My troublesome dental \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; have reduced to all 2&#x27;s &amp; 3&#x27;s with a mere 4-month&#x27;s use of the WP-100.     It&#x27;s powerful enough for me (I set it on 6).  While the reservoir volume is adequate for a single trip around the ivories, a refill from a standby glass of water lets me linger around some of my problem areas.     One thing I&#x27;d like to see is additional JT-100E jet heads included for family members.  Also lose the tongue cleaner WaterPik and replace it with something more useful like the new Plaque Seeker PS-100E Tip.     This unit is a vast improvement over my 80&#x27;s era WaterPik!  *********************************************************************  *********************************************************************  9-MONTH UPDATE:  Living in a area with extreme hard water, the unit started to lack power and pumped a diminished stream after several month&#x27;s use.  I filled the reservoir with white vinegar, ran it a bit and then let it sit with the vinegar in the unit for a couple hours. After it had soaked a bit I ran it continuously, recirculating the vinegar through the unit and back to the reservoir for several cycles.  It&#x27;s good as new.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working well and cleans the teeth almost as good as the toothbrush alone.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a 15 year old water pik.  This is easier to fill and use, and much quieter. I hope it lasts as long. New model comes with 6 different attachments, 5 of which I will probably never use.I haven&#x27;t looked yet, but I am getting curious about replacement heads. Will I have to buy an assortment to get the one I want?</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product, it has lots of different tips, which is very unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner and I use it frequently, and for different reasons or purposes, and both are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with our new waterpik ultra water flosser...quality is good, product is light and sits on counter without taking up space and also good for cleaning around the faucet:) Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item on the advice of my dentist. I just had a deep cleaning (UGH!) done at his office and he said if I floss more often, I would not need to have the deep cleaning next time. So I have been using this Waterpik and at my next appointment he said my gums are much healthier. It&#x27;s so easy to use, although it does make a little mess on the sink counter. But it&#x27;s well worth the effort to clean up. I add a little Peroxide each time I use it, which was also recommended by my dental hygenist. As always when purchasing from Amazon, this item arrived earlier than expected at a great price and I&#x27;m am quite pleased with the service and the product.</li>
    <li> this is one of the easiest way to floss, I have always had problems with  getting the string into the back teeth</li>
    <li> waterpic decided that we only get 1 standard jet with each unit now but we can have five other useless attachments because they look good on the web page - they have reduced the power of the unit to further the uselessness of the attachments - the product is still useful but i will rate them with 1 star for negative effort and managing to make a fancier looking product that doesn&#x27;t work as good as the older models and because i have to check off at least 1 star to submit the review</li>
    <li> My husband and I have an oral b smart toothbrush . I bought this at Target for full retail ($60) because I was so excited about it and couldnt wait to try it out. I&#x27;ll be returning it tomorrow. It seems to function as it should but it doesn&#x27;t beat flossing for young healthy gums. I noticed no difference between using this with  brushing vs just brushing with my smart toothbrush that has gum and polish settings. If you use a standard toothbrush it might benefit you but for us was pointless since we are already using a $200 tooth brush daily.   When using it, it is very messy and awkward to use. The set comes with six tips but only has storage in the top for four tips which really bothered me. I like having all of my tooth items stored away and covered. Why only design it with room for four and sell it with six?  Overall I will stick with my smart toothbrush, if you have beginning stages of gum disease this might help I don&#x27;t know. Doing a google search of regular flossing vs water flossing will show old fashioned flossing is still best to keep your gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a grandson when he got braces. We already have two ourselves and had purchased one for another grandson when he got his braces. Fair to say we are sold on what this device accomplishes. Doesn&#x27;t replace brushing or flossing but works in conjunction with them to mechanically clean ones gums and teeth, regardless of having or not having braces. Wouldn&#x27;t be without one.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was packaged well. Easy to set up. I didn&#x27;t need all of the different heads that came with it but maybe one day. Works well. I didn&#x27;t have too much of a problem getting used to letting the water run out of my mouth to prevent a mess. I like the small sleekness of the design so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space. All in all a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful machine.  I&#x27;m sure it is protecting my recent VERY expensive dental investment!    The only trouble?  I ordered one.  I received (and was charged for) two!  How can I return for credit the second one?</li>
    <li> This was a great product while it lasted. My last one lasted 2 years. Buying from Amazon allows me to keep track of how long I&#x27;ve had a product. The motor still works, but the tubing sprung a leak. This is quite disappointing, and yet what other product can fully replace it? So I would give this product a rating of 5 stars for the time it lasted, but the quality must be slipping based on my experience.</li>
    <li> This one is better than the one I replace. The dial on the main body (the old one has the adjuster on the handle)is much easier to control the pressure. The pressure is also in better range. I can only use the minimum pressure setting in the old unit.  It comes with several jet heads. When using the regular jet, I feel my gum is gently massaged.</li>
    <li> After replacing a different model water flosser, this one shines.  It is rounded and sleek therefore easier to keep clean in the bathroom. The jet and handle are easy to manipulate and it is easy to change applicators. It cleans superbly. They claim it is equal or better than flossing but I floss anyway.  The tank, contrary to other reviews, has plenty of capacity so is more convenient than my other brand.  This leads me to maintain better dental hygiene due to the convenience.</li>
    <li> The waterpik removes trapped food particles and scrubs teeth better than even a power tooth brush.  It can be set from gentle to a \\&quot;more cleansing\\&quot; high pressure. I run mine at about 90% and found my Dental Technician, who is very thorough, has very little of that painful scraping to do anymore. What a bonus!  I like it well enough, because it gets those annoying food particles out and leaves my teeth feeling clean, like I just came from the dentist, but it also removes the tooth paste chemical taste that I have long distrusted.  How well does it work?  I brush with the top-rated electric brush, then rinse using a hand brush, and still there is an occasional particle flushed out by the Waterpik.  It reaches teeth that I cannot floss well and does it without the nuisance (I hated flossing, anyway.).  I feel confident when going out in public after its&#x27; use.  This is my second Ultra Water Flosser.  The first is about a year old.  It quit spraying even though the pump was working.  After a couple of weeks, I decided I could not do without one and even though I was annoyed at what seemed too short of a useful life, I ordered a replacement from Amazon.  Only after it&#x27;s arrival did I discover the first one had a plugged nozzle tip.  I cleaned it out.  It works like new, and now my wife has one of her own!  In the weeks that I thought mine had broken, I researched the market and found there is no real competition for this product.  The products you might compare have lower pressure, less flexibility and lower functionality.</li>
    <li> After brushing, cleans your gum pockets out for no bad taste of decomposing food, and no gum/teeth problems. Needed as we get older.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to my Waterpik and don&#x27;t miss going to the dentist one teeny bit!  (Plus, I will not subject myself to x-rays ever again after learning how harmful they are).  As one who has NEVER been able to effectively floss because I have a small mouth which makes flossing difficult, the first time I used my new Waterpik, I immediately loved how clean my mouth felt (just like it does when leaving the dentist&#x27;s office).&lt;br /&gt;I have TWO Waterpiks, one for my RoadTrek RV  and one for home.  The bracket for holding the wand (while not in use) broke on the first one, which is my only complaint to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;In the five years that I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik, I have found that I only experienced ONE dental problem ( a slight sensitivity for which the dentist recommended an immediate root canal at the cost of $900.00!!!! I was leaving for a trip later that day and didn&#x27;t have time to do the procedure so I asked him for  a prescription for pain killers to \\&quot;tide me over\\&quot; till my return from my trip.  BUT.....using my Waterpik with much more full strength oral rinse directed into the sensitive area whenever the slight pain started, I was able to get by without the use of the pain killers and in a few days, the sensitivity disappeared.  The $900.00 I saved by NOT having the unnecessary root canal, (which I have since learned is extremely unhealthy and can lead to inflammation, a cause of cancer) was put to a much better use in remodeling my bathroom at home.&lt;br /&gt;  I use my waterpik every night before bed, with warm water and about a tablespoon of Breath RX (a very effective, safe, sugar and alcohol free oral rinse available at Bed Bath and Beyond and some select drug store chains for about $12.00 a bottle.  Immediately after purchasing, I dilute the bottle with half water because my DH is heavy handed.  I keep a spare empty bottle in which to transfer into).  Before using the Waterpik each night, I brush with my Sonic Aire electric toothbrush using Breath RX toothpaste...(or Tom&#x27;s Natural toothpaste, if I run out of BreathRX and can&#x27;t get to a BB&amp; B).&lt;br /&gt;Last time I went to the dentist (about two years ago when they kept calling me to let me know I was due for a teeth cleaning), they found NOTHING in my mouth that needed attention. The numbers (usually between 1-6 that the dental hygienist reports to their assistant while doing the teeth cleaning), were now HALF of what they were BEFORE I got a Waterpik (putting me NOW in the zone that was NOT considered a problem for periodontal disease).  I paid for my (virtually unnecessary) cleaning and left.  This was a welcome change for me because when I first got my Waterpik, it was because a dentist in West LA told me I needed to have another $2K procedure called \\&quot;root scaling and planing\\&quot; (which I DID have once, BEFORE getting my Waterpik).  This dire prognosis made by this unscrupulous dentist was made just a few minutes AFTER complaining to me that HE could only afford to take a cruise in the OFF season.... not in the HIGH season like I had recently done.  As long as he has patients \\&quot;with more money than brains\\&quot; who don&#x27;t know about Waterpiks, he is probably still \\&quot;conning\\&quot; them into paying for his expensive procedures (to make his vacations more enjoyable at the patient&#x27;s expense).  [[ASIN:B000US2532 BreathRx Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse (33oz Bottle), Large Economy Size.]][[ASIN:B000PZEK3I BreathRx Whitening Toothpaste - 4 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Rated \\&quot;R\\&quot;...CAUTION to those with small CHILDREN!!!:  The very strong direct spray of water needed for the waterpik to \\&quot;do it&#x27;s magic\\&quot; inside your mouth is extremely dangerous to KIDS who would direct it to places like eyes and places other than it&#x27;s intended to be directed.</li>
    <li> My sister bought a watepick and told me how much she loved it so i thought i would give it a try. I am glad i did. I love using it!!</li>
    <li> I like using this item rather than flossing, but it&#x27;s quite messy.  You have to learn to keep your mouth partially open so the water can pour out without opening it too much so the water will spray everywhere.  All in all, I think it works pretty well for getting the job done.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is better than all previous model, is much quiet and has various pressure control, the water jet handle design is easy to install or remove the water jet, Negative is the water container is too small I prefer 850ml capacity</li>
    <li> Got this almost a year ago.  Didn&#x27;t use it that much, yet it broke.  Guess they just don&#x27;t make Waterpik products like they use to.</li>
    <li> I have had periodontal problems most of my adult life which resulted in bleeding gums and frequent mouth sores.  When I my old dentist retired about  20 years ago my new dentist was  fearful that I would start loosing my teeth if we did not strengthen my gums.  Our treatment plan included deep cleaning of my teeth under the gum line and he suggest that I start using a waterpik,  electric tooth brush and to floss daily as part of my daily maintenance routine.  Since that time we have achieved vast improvement in my oral health.  He and his hygienist credit the daily use of the waterpik as a major factor.  I like it so much that I use both before and after I brush.    I have gone through about 4 waterpiks in the past 20 years.  All of them were of the old style with the last two being the WP-65 which is still sold on Amazon.  However, while that model worked well it was a very noisy unit and took up a rather large footprint on our sink area, and the water hose was difficult to replace.  Therefore,  when I saw the newer Ultra Model I decided to give it a try.  As a 20 year user of Waterpiks I think I can give a pretty good evaluation of this model compared to the previous ones I have used.    Pro   Smaller foot print  on/off switch in a more convenient location  water flow control is on the unit rather on the handle  much quieter motor  better storage of hose and wand  The hose and want unit are much easier to replace.  Neutral   both clean your teeth just as well, neither is more powerful than the other as I always used  full power.   Con  The water reservoir is much smaller and I find I have to fill it all the way to the top to get the amount of cleaning time I want  The lid where the extra tips are held is pretty useless on the machine.  I use it to store the extra tips in a drawer, as I always clean out  the reservoir after use and just turn it upside down on the unit to let it dry out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase as it works very well.  I&#x27;ve read reviews saying the pressure isn&#x27;t high enough with which I don&#x27;t agree.  Anything above level 4 makes my gums sting, and I don&#x27;t have sensitive gums.  I use an electric toothbrush and have never had a bleeding problem. I&#x27;ll increase the pressure as I get used to the unit.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I fill a glass with warm water and add it to the unit as needed. Only time will tell how long it will last.</li>
    <li> This is my first water pik- so I have nothing to compare it to.  However, I think it is made very well and it is pretty much as described.  The only  area where I find it can be improved is in the button which  starts and stops the flow of water. Sometimes when the water is flowing and you try to disengage - it is a bit hard to do and on a few occasions -I have had water squirt all over the bathroom - which is quite comical. Also when you take it out of your mouth and the machine is stopped - there is still water in the pik and it flows out over the bathroom counter.  But I still really like it and it has helped my dental hygiene immensely. If any one suffers from tonsil stones- this really helps.  So I am really thrilled that I finally own a water pik and so far this one has been doing a fine job!</li>
    <li> I personally use this and am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this waterpik because, I recently got braces and Iam 40+ and Iam telling  you this is the best thing for flossing any age .Iam very please with my waterpik.</li>
    <li> This unit is great, it works fantastic. I have had other waterpiks &amp; I love them all. They are so much easier to use than traditional string floss, &amp; more thorough. I recommend a waterpik to anyone who is serious about taking care of their teeth &amp; gums.</li>
    <li> I just had lingual braces put in and have had a lot of trouble flossing with them. I heard about the waterpik and I decided to give it a shot. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this thing. My mouth feels great after using it and it really cleans out the braces and between my teeth. I also think it it&#x27;s build quality is very good and the 3 year warranty backs that up. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more and I just wish I got one of these sooner.</li>
    <li> The ONLY good thing I can say about this product is that it does get your teeth clean.  Beyond that, it&#x27;s basically another example of a great idea that is so poorly executed, that its price exceeds its value.  Whoever designed this item should be taken to the woodshed!  It&#x27;s pretty clear that the designers did not actually use the product they designed.    Even when it works correctly, this device is clumsy to use because it requires two hands to turn it on and off or to adjust the water-jet intensity -- ESPECIALLY WITH WET HANDS, which is hard to avoid when cleaning one&#x27;s teeth!  All, repeat, A L L of the outer surfaces are so slick that they are very difficult to grip securely.    The tool compartment just sits on top of the tank. It should have a snap-on connector because it falls off easily. Furthermore, it won&#x27;t even hold all of the tools that come with the device.  One is always left over (not including the one on the hand wand) -- an amazing design oversight!    All but one of the tips use water so quickly that the tank is emptied before the job is done.    Even more amazing is that the tank ALSO just sits on top of the base with little more attachment than the friction of the water seal at the bottom.    The sound this device makes is far too loud for what it does and sounds like a grinder.    The final insult came when the device simply stopped working just barely after the warranty expired!  However, nothing short of returning for a full refund would be adequate -- for all the reasons given above.    Bottom line:  This product is very poorly designed and is not worth even HALF of what it costs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a sonic toothbrush for a few years, and even with regular flossing have still had issues with my gums. My dentist recommended this water pic - the old fashioned, plug in one with lots of power. The difference in my gums is amazing. Even just after a few weeks of use my gums look and feel much better. I used a warm salt water solution for rinsing. Only issue is that the storage case on the top gets stuck sometimes and its hard to remove it to add water to the resevoir, but I still give this 5 stars. I&#x27;ve tossed out my sonic toothbrush and gone back to a regular toothbrush too. Much better!</li>
    <li> An essential part of battling periodontal gum disease is aggressive home care. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is an easy and effective tool against plaque. With several different specialty tips you&#x27;re able to get to hard to reach spots and under the gumline to where bacteria builds up. I only wish that I knew about this product sooner. Also, very affordable through Amazon. Replacement tips can be expensive so shop around and compare prices before buying.</li>
    <li> This is the first Water Flosser I&#x27;ve owned, so I have no previous experience with one. Overall I like the unit and would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It works great and my Dentist, Dental Hygienist and Periodontist have all commented on how quickly I have recovered from periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;-The tank holds a lot of water, more than I ever use in a single session, but not enough for 2.&lt;br /&gt;-I have only used the normal head, but it works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;-The pause button is a device saver in my opinion, it would be too awkward for me without that feature.&lt;br /&gt;-If you have temperature sensitive teeth like me, you can adjust the tap water to whatever temp works for you and then fill up the tank, just make sure to let it run into the sink for a few seconds to let the cold water clear out of the line.&lt;br /&gt;-The power cord is a good length for most counters I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Big footprint, easily the largest thing on my bathroom sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;-Watch the upper settings, level 10 could probably be used to strip paint, no idea whose gums are strong enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t use this right before you leave the house, it&#x27;s tricky to not get your shirt at least a little wet, maybe with more practice.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s kind of loud, it seems to be a bit louder than a powerful electric toothbrush, maybe mine just has a turbo motor in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;-According to both my Periodontist and Dentist, the new [[ASIN:B00CUG270S Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser]] is supposedly much better. I&#x27;m not endorsing the device and I don&#x27;t own one, it&#x27;s just what both of them told me. Kind of frustrated since I bought this like 3 days before that product was announced.</li>
    <li> I found it on the website, lots of people recomend this for tooth. after using it, I find my tooth much more clean, and some time even the sonicare toothbrush cannnot clean some tiny places, it is also can clean. I use it twice  a day and after toothbursh.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered this item. I bought this for myself because I recently got braces and my orthodontist recommended I get a waterpik. First place I looked was Amazon of course. This was the first product in the search. I loved the price but I still had to make sure this was a good product. Looking at the reviews I decided to get it. The day it came in I tested it out. Little tip for the first time user. Hold the button down when your not using it because it will spray everywhere. I had water all over my face and bathroom. lol. I was so amazed how this product really worked. No more struggling to floss. I liked the product so much I had to order one for my niece that also has braces. This is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product! My teeth are really tight together, so it makes it hard to floss. My dentist recommended a water flosser, and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased one! I don&#x27;t go past the \\&quot;2\\&quot; on the intensity and mainly use the general flossing head, but the other heads aren&#x27;t bad either. I also love the large resevior. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s noisier than I expected as it vibrates.</li>
    <li> ... which I never do ANYWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental technician recently suggested that, since I LOATHE flossing, I try picking up a dental irrigator, and so far, I&#x27;m thrilled that I decided to opt for one from the well-known Waterpik line of dental irrigators. I thoroughly read the instructions before my first use (just to make sure I&#x27;d covered all of the bases), and decided, after trying the Waterpik with boring, plain ol&#x27; water, to add a small amount of mouthwash to the water (as suggested by both the pamphlet and my dental technician) that I use to clean my teeth after brushing. I also follow the suggestions made in the instruction pamphlet to flush the Waterpik out with plain, clean water after using it with mouthwash added. And what a difference this thing makes! My mouth feels absolutely squeaky clean after every single use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who DO opt to flush your Waterpiks out this way, then drain them completely after use, here&#x27;s a tip from a jeweler (who typically uses clean but old toothbrushes to clean any gunk out of my jewelry): when you&#x27;re flushing out your Waterpik with clean water, use the stream of water to power-wash your jewelry. You&#x27;ll end up splattering water everywhere, which seems unavoidable with a Waterpik, but it&#x27;s a great way to get your set gemstones sparkling clean and unseat any gunk that may have gotten embedded in the grooves of your jewelry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I haven&#x27;t had my Waterpik for very long (around a month), I have yet to have any problems with it, and remain hopeful that this will continue to be the case. And the Waterpik IS worth any extra clean-up required after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your least-favorite hygienic task is flossing, as is mine, try a Waterpik. So far, I LOVE this thing! It&#x27;s worth every penny I paid for it! Just don&#x27;t try using your Flexible Benefits spending account to pay for it... I found out the hard way that this item is an ineligible expense, at least as far as my account goes..</li>
    <li> Purchased the water pik from the advice from my dentist.  Have yet to use the bleach solution he recommended.  Anycase, it works great and would so far recommended to anyone looking for one.</li>
    <li> I have long been aware of my need to floss, but my teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight and flossing tends to be difficult. Thus, I avoided it. The Waterpik Water Jet simulates flossing (if the stream is aimed correctly) and (with the help of some Listerine) helps clean between teeth where perviously only floss was able to reach and stimulates the gums to keep them healthy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, the water pressure is excellent and the resevoir is sufficient size for a (relatively) leisurely cleaning of both lingual and distal sides of the teeth. The only drawback is that there are no controls on the wand (though given how wet it can get, that&#x27;s probably good). In addition, the button on the wand simply pauses the spray -- the spray starts immediately when you turn the power on. I had to wipe down the bathroom the first time I used the Waterpik Water Jet because water was EVERYWHERE as I got accustomed to the controls. Whoops! Once I used it a few times, though, I knew to get into position before reaching over to turn the unit on.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely recommended for people with dental work (bridges, orthodontics) and for those who, like me, have a hard time flossing. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my detnal hygienist thinks!</li>
    <li> I have used this Waterpik model for over a year without any problems. I use at the highest setting.  I have not noticed any leaking problems mentioned by other users.    Followup: I have used this oral irrigator for 2 years now. Daily use sometimes 2 or 3 times a day. The handle cracked but it still works. I am ready to buy another, but keep my old unit as a backup or for travel.</li>
    <li> Definitely a must have in the bathroom. This is great for braces of just removing food between your teeth. Product is great</li>
    <li> I have only just started using it, so cannot attest to any improvements yet, but it is easy to use and does not take up much space.</li>
    <li> Just what my dentist recommend</li>
    <li> I am one of those people that hates flossing. Even though I know I should, I just can&#x27;t stand the sensation of the floss going in between my teeth, and it&#x27;s hard for me to reach the back teeth. But I knew that my gums were going to suffer if I didn&#x27;t do something, so I purchased the Waterpik in September of this year (2010). Before I started using it, my gums were visibly red and would sometimes bleed when I was brushing my teeth. My teeth were also very sensitive and just didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;right.\\&quot; After a week or two of using this I noticed a difference in how my gums were. They stopped bleeding and turned more of a pinkish color. My teeth also felt stronger and stopped getting irritated by cold things.     Today was judgment day. I had my first dentist&#x27;s cleaning in over a year (a year and a month, to be exact). I was nervous because I wasn&#x27;t sure that my two months of waterpik-ing could make up for my 11 months of slacking. All the other times I went to the dentist, the hygienist would pull tons of food out from between my teeth, and show me where I was missing when I brushed. Today, she found nothing. All the other times I went to the dentist, she would comment on the fact that my gums were red in some areas. Today, she commented on how healthy they were. And when she&#x27;d floss my teeth, my gums would bleed. Today, the floss went between my teeth easily with no pain and no bleeding. I also had two cavities at my last appointment. This time I had none, although of course I&#x27;m not sure the waterpik is entirely to thank for that.    My cleaning today was only 40 minutes rather than the usual hour, since my teeth were already so clean! All in all, I have noticed a huge difference in my dental hygiene, and would strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After many years of not using a Water Pik, I tried one again on advice of my dental hygienist. The result:  I found food particles that remained in place even after thorough brushing, use of a toothpick and flossing.  After several months my periodontist said \\&quot;Nothing for us to do. You&#x27;re in good shape.\\&quot; I would recommend this device to others, particularly those with any sort of periodontal issues.    Far more tips come with this device than I have used.  The most effective for me is the standard tip, and I worked up to a setting of 7-8 in terms of pressure, which is plenty for my needs.    Daily use at bedtime, followed by brushing has reduced plaque - as described above.  It seems to me this is a good device at a reasonable price, particularly when considered against the discomfort, cost, and risk to health of letting plaque build and subsequent scaling.</li>
    <li> This product is a good solution for caring for teeth.  I do not like flossing and this helps the situation</li>
    <li> Newly designed, efficient, functionally better than earlier versions, versatile settings, variety of application devices.  Has better reservoir and lid makes for easier maintenance.</li>
    <li> The product was purchased as needed. Yet enjoy any, but thank you ^ ^&lt;br /&gt;The product was purchased as needed.

    <li> I know it&#x27;s not as bad as playing cat&#x27;s cradle, but regular floss is still a little annoying to get into the back areas of my teeth.  This water flosser makes it much easier to reach the teeth I would otherwise do a poor job of flossing.</li>
    <li> The Ultra Waterpik works really well,although I don&#x27;t use all the special attachments. Also, if more than 1 person will use it, you should obtain separate tip(s) for each.  So far I&#x27;m pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]This machine can blast you teeth with a water jet strong enough to damage your gums so be careful with tip and settings. My main complaint is that the thumb switch on the wand is always on instead off. This makes it difficult to adjust jet position in one&#x27;s mouth, or to change hands. One should not have to turn the power switch off to make an adjustment from outer to inner surface of one&#x27;se teeth. If the wand slips out of it bracket on the reservoir, it will drain putting water in places that will probably make you unhappy. Also, the pump sounds very clunky. I am wondering how long it will last. I had two other other waterpiks, hand held, both failed because of the corrosion issue sited in reviews of that model.  Finally, Braun makes a superior water jet teeth cleaner. I used it when I was in France, and loved it: compact, quiet, forceful, easy to adjust jet pressure and the on-off wand switch is normally off, as in most power equipment. I could not find it in the US when I did a web search.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested a Waterpik so I decided to order one.  They always sounded so messy to me but I decided to give it a try. I loved it so much that my husband started to use it too since it came with extra pieces and now he is hooked also. I was amazed at what you could still get out of your teeth and under the gums after using an electric toothbrush for two minutes and then the waterpik.  After I am done, my mouth feels so clean. It has a pause button on it which I like because I think it makes it easier to have control of the water.  It also has multiple settings which is great.  The tips fit inside the lid when not in use and I have found it easy to use and keep clean. Wish I had started using one years ago.</li>
    <li> This waterpik privided the clean fresh mouth and gumline that we were looking for.  There are three sets of attachments, for three different users.  Level 3/4 has been all the further we need to turn up the pressure.  After brushing and flossing, using the waterpik with just a touch of mouthwash in the water that is in the tank is a great addition to our dental hygeine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that we did not rate this as a 5 is that we needed to return the unit due to a leak that it had in the bottom where the hose coonects to the unit.  We requested a replacement because we are so happy with the results otherwise.</li>
    <li> Good device still working after one year. The little plastic clip that holds a WaterPik has broken. I have repaired it many times obviously Iam  not a professional on repairs but the device still works.  Works perfect for people with braces I still like brushing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using just the Pik Pocket for now, and it works fine. Clean between gums and teeth, and has prevented me time and work with silk.</li>
    <li> I am &gt;very glad &lt; I bought this,  because it is 100% better than flossing and better than going to the dentist to get your teeth cleaned. this is the best waterpik for the best price I could find any place. so go and buy one you will be glad you did.    R.D. Roberts</li>
    <li> I used one years ago when I had wisdom teeth surgically removed and if it hadn&#x27;t been for the waterpik, probably wouldn&#x27;t have healed as easily. And I used for years until it finally wore out. Now, I needed to get another one for problem teeth, spaces where food gets trapped a lot. Helps keep gums healthy and rinses out places that brushing and flossing don&#x27;t get to.....still love the product...thank you.</li>
    <li> This pick is great, it doesn&#x27;t remove things from my teeth that I didn&#x27;t know were there, but maybe I just clean my teeth too well before I get there.  But, I do love the massaging feel my gums get after using it.  Seriously this product makes my teeth happy.</li>
    <li> Before I begin, I have to say that had it not been for of your helpful comments, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the Waterpik. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My teeth, albeit doing a lot better than the past, could benefit from something extra.  Multiple flossings per day had irritated my guns to the point of redness.  Also, I wasn&#x27;t very convinced that flossing was removing every little piece of dirt between the teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I need action. I needed relief! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;...enter the Waterpik WP-100.  It has reduced my gum irritation tremendously, while keeping between my teeth cleaner.  I agree with a few of the reviewers that anything less than 6 &#x3D; waste of time.  I usually just leave it at 10. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;It works! That&#x27;s all you need to know! &lt;br /&gt;Compact &lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Reservoir is big, but not big enough. +20-25% more would be better &lt;br /&gt;The tube NEEDS to be longer. This is one of my biggest gripes.  The coiled tube is a nice touch, but they need to make the tube like 25-50% longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I waited 1 1/2 months for this product on Amazon and at one point was planning to cancel my purchase.  I am VERY glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Waterpik 65 for several years and am completely satisfied with it. As a present to my wife I decided to splurge and get her the Waterpik 100. It doesn&#x27;t clean any better than the WP-65 but it has a much smaller footprint, is much quieter, and easier to use. I like it very much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Murray N</li>
    <li> love my water pik.my dentist says he sees a diference because i hate to floss.i use it everyday with no problems.</li>
    <li> This is my first water pik. I really like it. It gets my teeth much cleaner feeling and looking. It took a little time to get used to using &lt;br /&gt;it but even my daughter can do it and she is 10. I have to get braces next &lt;br /&gt;month and my dentist told me it will help keep my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use the new Waterpik WP-100. I could not believe how good it makes your mouth feel. This is a great product, it does an outstanding job on the gums. The attachment for braces, makes it easy for my daughter to keep her teeth at tip top shape. If you miss a time using it, you just don&#x27;t feel as clean and fresh. The only thing we find is the unit does make a little more noise than I thought it would, but for the benefits you recieve, a little noise is worth it.</li>
    <li> Way easier &amp; quicker than flossing! I love it, it gets a lot of stuff out and cleans a lot better than flossing did.</li>
    <li> I gave this item as a Christmas present and was told that it works well for them.</li>
    <li> I like this model better than my old waterpik. It&#x27;s more compact and not as noisy.  The best deal was Amazon by far. 25% cheaper than Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;The only draw-back is that sometimes the little rubber gasket in the water&lt;br /&gt;tank falls out while rinsing it out. Tank holds enough water to do the job adequately.</li>
    <li> This is relatively easy to use and takes up little space on your bathroom vanity counter.  It appears to be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth far more effectively than brushing alone did.   About the only drawback is that it is somewhat messy to use.  I find water running down my arm; and have to do a big cleanup job after using it.</li>
    <li> I just replaced my broken Family model with this Ultra, and at first glance it seems to be a big improvement. The slider switch that had been prone to hang in the older model is here replaced by a rocker switch. The old nozzle which eventually would leak all the water, has been redesigned. The running noise of the Family model, which was quite loud, has been greatly reduced.    This Ultra model has a smaller footprint. This makes the water container significantly smaller, but its size meets my needs. It is probably because of the smaller footprint that the excess length of the power cord can no longer be stored in the base, which I had found convenient. The new design has removed most of the horizontal surfaces that had caught water and eventually acquired algae and were a bit difficult to clean. The Ultra unit even removes the surface from beneath the hose that would catch excess water, and that was a good idea,     In short, the newly designed Ultra unit appears at first glance to be a significant improvement in design. I won&#x27;t know for a while if there is a comparable much needed improvement in quality.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast delivery, very good product.  The only reason not 5 stars is the on/off switch could be better located.  Picky picky, but this is a review.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Leaves your mouth feeling so clean.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Overall this Waterpik is well-designed, quiet and easy to use.  The water chamber could be a little bigger and it retains some water after the use.  The On and Off switch could be more convenient if it were vertical instead of horizontal. My husband, a dentist, and I are pretty satisfied with it.   Miller, Fairfax, Virginia</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use this after every meal I eat when I&#x27;m at home. Better than string flossing. This pic removes every particle of food quickly. Your mouth feels clean and your gums appreciate the massage. Best of all, the dental hygienist gave my checkup an A+.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now...I use the highest setting \\&quot;10\\&quot;.  I used to brush and floss and use this and it STILL got particles out from between my teeth!!!  I now only Sonic Brush and use this and I don&#x27;t bother with flossing anymore. It&#x27;s been great. I sit it right beside the sink, the curly cord is sometimes unruly...but other than that, I think it great and the amount of water is JUST right for me.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is pretty powerful and does its job. The big downsides however are that one, its very loud. and two the tube that the water goes through needs to be a bit longer. But other than that good, sturdy product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 13 yo old son with new braces who thinks that brushing his teeth is optional.  Easy to use. A bit messy (water everywhere and leaks if he isnt careful with the nozzle) but overall, we have been happy.  Price is reasonable.  Would have liked a longer cord. I am trying to figure out a way to get him to use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Overall, this product works great. We&#x27;ve never had one before, but this has been wonderful to use. Your teeth get that fresh-from-the-dentist feel to them. About the only negative I can mention is that it can become a little splashy with the water, but you adapt to it and develop a technique that works for you. We&#x27;ll probably never not own one of these the rest of my life; it&#x27;s really that good. I should also note that I originally got it because of braces, and it&#x27;s wonderful for cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old Water-Pik had ceased to function, and am I glad that it did -- and I did.  This one is better in every way.  It&#x27;s more compact and the release mechanism for the tips is vastly improved over previous models.  It&#x27;s a winner!!!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this as a gift for my mother.  She has used a waterpik for years and I found out her old one was broken, so I bought her this new one.  She raves about it.</li>
    <li> We bought this after I had some orthodontia work done. Even after brushing and flossing, the Waterpik still gets small food particles caught between my teeth. I wish I had purchased a Waterpik years ago! It probably would have avoided a lot of unnecessary dental work. I would highly recommend this for anyone wanting good oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product, though it could use a longer hose. Definitely has lots of power to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love if there was an optional suction, but you just let the water run into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that it&#x27;s frowned upon, but I may try mixing a little mouthwash in with the water... there goes my warranty.</li>
    <li> I have an older model that works well, but had lost or misplaced the tips.  It is also bulkier than the new model, so I thought, \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot; just get a new one.  Well, the new one is more compact and works OK but it&#x27;s not as powerful as the older model and all the fancy tips are just window dressing in my opinion.  I thought about buying the travel model but noted that it is even less powerful.  So, in summary, it&#x27;s an OK product but nothing to rave about.</li>
    <li> Good product, I used it for an year</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and just love it.  Make it your mouth, teeth and gums&#x27; best friend.  I had a much smaller water pick and although quite inexpensive, was decent enough.  It was a Yugo compared to this Lexus of water flossers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.  You reduce placque and bacteria considerably and the water jet can reach places where dental floss never reaches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and so far so good.  Im so glad to reduce the amount of waste I create using string floss.  I use only distilled water and have found it unecessary to fill it all the way to the top.  I just fill the reservoir half way.  I let the water drain out completely after each use and turn the blue reservoir upside down to dry out along with the attachment(after cleaning it).  Every week I run a mixture of white vinegar and water through it to clean out the base of the unit that you can&#x27;t get into.  I do allow the vinegar water mixture to sit for about 20 minutes then i shake it a bit.  After draining that out I just run water through again to flush out more of the vinegar.  I have had no problems with mold or any smell of mold since I&#x27;ve used this product.  My teeth feel cleaner and its so nice being able to floss along your gum line.  I have noticed my gums looking more pink but can&#x27;t relate that directly to the Waterpik.  I bought this based on the number of great reviews and glad I did.</li>
    <li> My dentist said that this would be a good addition to my brushing, well I thought Ok.   This thing is real good. It gets stuff out from  between my teeth after brushing with the water pic Sonic tooth Brush, that I would not have known was there.  It took some getting use to with the water jetting out, but once you understand how to use it it is good.  Shipping time was excellent.</li>
    <li> We have bought several water piks over the years, but this one is by far the best one we have ever purchased.  I love all the different attachments it comes with.  I bought one for myself and one for my husband.  Now Im going to buy one for each of my kids bathrooms.</li>
    <li> Leaked at the handle and made a mess constantly.  Order two new handles--took several weeks to arrive.  Both of these sprayed water all over the counter.  All dumped in trash.  No more Waterpik products for me.</li>
    <li> It is quieter than my five-year-old Waterpik Ultra, but the trade-off is the powerfulness...For the old one, The level 7 is my up limit of tolerance, while I have to move up to level 10 in the new Ultra to get the same feeling of clean flossing. But whether the teeth need superbly powerful daily flossing is still a open question.    PS. My old Ultra still functions as well as before.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. Looks impressive.</li>
    <li> Great product that works better than expected.My wife saw me using mine and now she wants one too.The water tank is the perfect size and emptys with plenty of time to finish my whole mouth.I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son after he got braces.  Excellent tool to aid in getting teeth clean. This is in addition to the sonicare toothbrush.  Easy to use and maintain.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! One of the best things I ever bought!! It cleans your mouth better than flossing and you don&#x27;t get te gum damage your get with the floss... it is almost as good as the one the dentist has!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a water flosser and I am glad that I chose this one.  It comes with lots of tips and is easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space.  And it works great!  It cleans my teeth better than floss!  I love it!  It feels so good, too.</li>
    <li> Outside of the electric toothbrush we use, this is the next best device to keep your gums and teeth healthy! Feels great as it cleans between and around the teeth. Excellent product and highly recommended! My friends that have bought one after I mentioned it to them, also love it.</li>
    <li> In my case, it was starting to erode the gum from the tooth. Might have been my fault but I went back to the brush and gums are now repairing themselves. Truthfully, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works great, gets out all the junk ca&lt;br /&gt;ught up in your teeth, makes your teeth feel squeaky clean, I advise it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I had an older style Waterpik for years. It leaked and was somewhat awkward to use.  When it finally died, I decided to try another brand that did not pulsate.  I really liked using the new one, but on my last trip to the dentist my gum pocket measurements went up somewhat that indicated the new product was not doing the job.    I decided to give the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser a try.  It is a much better design than the older unit.  I am 100% happy with my purchase.  I can&#x27;t speak to longevity as I have had it only a few months.  But everything works perfectly so far, and it&#x27;s much easier to use.  I believe my next dental appointment will show improvement.</li>
    <li> Offers excellent cleaning between your teeth, much better than you can do with floss and also much less work.  Also can clean right down at the gum line.  This is where you can get infections and start having gum trouble.  I used to dread having my teeth cleaned because it hurt, sometimes quite a bit.  But having a waterpik solves these problems.  So when my first one wore out, I searched the internet and found the best deal here at Amazon.  And as usual I had excellent service!  So if your dentist is telling you that your gums are in \\&quot;trouble\\&quot;, this is what you need to get to fix them back up!</li>
    <li> As someone with large gaps at the tops of my teeth (and close contact so my smile is normal), this thing is a Godsend! It gets so much out of my teeth. I use it everynight before flossing and it is just fantastic!</li>
    <li> This review is for the Waterpik Ultra ... I don&#x27;t think many of these reviewers have the same item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leak, it doesn&#x27;t spray all over, it doesn&#x27;t have too low or too high pressure.  How can it? It has adjustable pressure.  And a button that turns off the water flow when you have it out of your mouth so you don&#x27;t spray the bathroom walls.  If the reservoir is pushed properly in place, it won&#x27;t leak (if it&#x27;s not in place, it certainly won&#x27;t pump any water, either).  If, for some strange reason, you don&#x27;t put the nozzle back upright in it&#x27;s holder, the water will certainly start to drain out. Then again, why would you keep water in it when not using it - it will start getting floaties and growing funny things! The reservoir also holds enough water for 2 of us to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply follow the directions with the Ultra, &amp; I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> As others here have noted, the quality of Waterpiks is not what it used to be.  After 1.5 months, the unit broke and became unusable, due to leakage from the hose to the handle.  Apparently this is a common issue, and in fact has a separate entry in the manual, stating to contact Water Pik customer service (which I will now have to do, since the product is outside the return window).</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT IT&#x27;S THE PRIZED JEWEL OF MY BATHROOM!  I GIVE IT 10 STARS BECAUSE IT WORKS TWICE AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD &amp; AFTER READING THE REVIEWS OF OTHER CONSUMERS, I FIGURED IT WOULD ALREADY BE A 5 STAR PRODUCT.  IN ANY CASE, THE VESSEL CONTAINING THE WATER IS WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR A NICE DEEP CLEANING SENSATION EVERY NIGHT!  MY DENTIST TOLD ME TO FLOSS, BUT FLOSSING IS SUCH A HASSLE COMPARED TO THIS UNIT.  PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR THE WATERPIK ULTRA DENTAL WATER JET!</li>
    <li> I bought the waterpik \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; model to replace an older waterpik because it has the best user reviews, with the fewest negatives, of any current dental irrigation device from any manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use I will say it works as well as any of the three or four prior waterpiks I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;The big question is how long will it last?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s probably as good as you&#x27;ll get at any price if, like me, you&#x27;ve become addicted to water jet irrigation.</li>
    <li> this is the best product I have ever bought from amazon. It cleans my teeth throughly. I don&#x27;t even need to use my regular brush anymore.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to get a Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet and followed his advice.  Love it!  Service was quick and I received free shipping and did not have to leave my home. Was cheaper than Wal Mart too. Yippee!  Would buy here again. Great service and product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read a lot of the feedback concerning this item and Waterpik, the company, until after I received this item and it stopped working 6 days later.  My son absolutely loved it the 6 days it did work, but on day 6, all it would do is make a loud buzzing noise. Too my surprise, several customers had left feedback describing the same issue that I had with my unit.  But worse than the defective unit, is the Customer \\&quot;No Service\\&quot; that Waterpik provides.  I also saw those warning too late also.  I followed Amazon&#x27;s advice and tried to contact Waterpik about my defective unit.  My first warning should have been that there was no customer service telephone number anywhere on the Waterpik site.  The site says to email them.  I did, twice.  It has been 2 weeks and they still have not responded.  Unlke a lot of customers, I stayed within Amazon&#x27;s 30-day refund window and asked for my money back.  You may get lucky, but this company definitely has some severe quality control and customer service issues that need to be resolved.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it in Singapore but didn&#x27;t notice that Singapore uses 230V power supply while this water jet uses 120V by default. The machine conked out within seconds. So, when you need to use it in a country which does not supply 110V AC power, remember to get a voltage transformer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one form of waterpik (off and on) for decades. This ULTRA is by far heads above the rest and I liked all of the ones I used. It is quiet and capable. It&#x27;s the easiest to fill I have ever used and the pik and handle stow away after use better than any of the previous models.</li>
    <li> I used my first WaterPik for 7 years and it worked perfectly until it just plain wore out.  After 4 uses,this one stopped working, the motor would only buzz.  This one was made in China.  My first one wasn&#x27;t.  Enough said.  Let me pay more for a quality American made product.  I will say WaterPik was great about replacing it.</li>
    <li> This works wonders for the teeth and gums!  If you have something really serious lodged in between your teeth you may have to do it in the morning and in the evening to get it out if you can&#x27;t reach it by floss.</li>
    <li> It works.  As part of preventative maintenance on good oral hygiene, I use an electric brush, floss, waterpik and mouth rinse.  All compliment one another.  The accessories our nice but I only use one.  Easy to assemble and operate.  I do like the dial for controlling water pressure.  A couple of improvements I would have is a more secure lid for the water compartment and a button that can actually stay in the off position until you press it again.  If you are to let your finger off the button on the current design, water is free to flow.  This works out well if the pik is in your mouth and under control.  If not, you can get water everywhere.</li>
    <li> The Waterpick Waterflosser is excellent.  I have used a Waterpick for many years, and I have excellent dental health.  Every time that I go to the dentist for a check-up, I get good reports.  This model, Waterpick (ultra), works well, and the improved design may allow the hose conection to last longer, as it is less likley to crimp.  I am happy with my purchase, Amazon did an excellent on pricing, and service.</li>
    <li> I used this water pik for only 2 years. The hose was uncomfortable and tight and over the time the hose just simply broke. And it&#x27;s impossible to replace it. It wood be more helpful if the hose was made from softer, more flexible material. :(</li>
    <li> I swore by my Reach flosser for years before I bought this. I figured that there is no way a water flosser could be better than my Reach, but this thing is seriously amazing. I don&#x27;t even bother with my Reach anymore. Not only does it blast everything stuck in your teeth cavities away (including plaque), but it is also great if your gums are receding or bleed easily. After using the waterpik for a few months, I went into the dentist and I had no plaque or cavities! Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> this machine is much easier to use and works better than the original waterpik which i owned for the last 15-20 years.  it has many new fanled tips some of which are a little sily.  the one fault i find with it the old one had 2 regular tips so my wife and i could each use one this machine only comes with one regular tip</li>
    <li> Great product , it performs way beyond my expectations, you&#x27;ll never want to be without it. Highly recommended A+++++</li>
    <li> Nice design. A little awkward with trying to keep water under control in mouth while under higher pressure. But use at mid&#x3D;level pressure is good</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever used a waterpik and I have to say it&#x27;s the best thing I have purchased in along time.  I just love it and what a difference it makes on my gums.  I actually use this more often than I floss becuase it seems to work better.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE GUM PROBLEMS. MESSY TO USE AND NOT AS STRONG A WATER STREAM AS I WOULD HAVE HOPED.  MUCH BETTER THAN THE PORTABLE MODLES WHICH ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend has really bad teeth and gum. Since i got him this water jet. his teeth stopped bleeding pretty soon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and my daughter because they are both in braces, and neither one was flossing sufficiently.  It helps keep those braces plaque free.  They seem to like it.  I personally don&#x27;t use it, I floss instead.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]My dentist suggested that I use a waterpik. I found a long forgotten one and started to use it.  Although it worked,. it leaked, so I decided to sent for a new one.  I an very well pleased with the new improved model, especially the retractable cord.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Waterpick and I am not dissapointed in the least.  It has just the right size water tank &amp; adjustable pulse strength.  I add mouthwash to my water &amp; it feels as though my mouth has taken its own shower. (And, indeed, it has!)  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks  This unit works well. It is messy.  My gums feel better already!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews. This is compact, plenty of water capacity to use properly. I put Listerine in with water, then rinse it and run some plain water through for maintenance. Be sure to read directions! Certain pics must have low pressure or it can ruin it(read directions)! No problems and it does an awesome job!!!!</li>
    <li> Item works great. Cleaned out between the teeth as claimed.  Add mouthwash and it gives your mouth a nice clean feeling.    Only cons?  A little noisier than I expected.  But I didn&#x27;t even think of it as making noise, so that&#x27;s not a huge thing.    Splashy.  It may just be me and my inability to not make a mess... but unless I completely closed my mouth I splashed water all over.    Still love it though!  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a four star rating with a caveat--don&#x27;t plan on having it work for more than a couple of years.  My first one just stopped working; my second unit had one of the glass inserts break off--I am now on my third device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that the device cleans your teeth, especially in between.  I went to the dentist many years ago and asked about food sticking between my teeth--his response, \\&quot;Well, when you get older. . . .\\&quot;  My sister suggested the Waterpik to me a few years ago, which she and her husband swear by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the comments from my dentist, the device has helped keep my gums in excellent health.  I use mostly water, with some hydrogen peroxide and some mouthwash when I use the device--you can experiment with the proportions.  I clean my teeth with it in the morning and before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It vibrates and slides around so try putting a non-skid pad under it. It can be drippy too, so keep your arm over the sink unless you like the puddles on the floor to remind you to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
    <li> I have recently replaced a ten year old model waterpik due to its loss of power. I was pleased that the new Ultra model has an improved cap and storage area for parts and that the controls are easy to use.  Provided the interior workings ( parts) compare to the older version for longevity  ( rare these days), I believe this product is a cost effective and valuable aid to proper dental hygeine</li>
    <li> After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn&#x27;t floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, \\&quot;But I do floss!  Twice a year!\\&quot; (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.    So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven&#x27;t changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on the various Waterpiks available I&#x27;m glad that I opted for the Ultra.  It holds enough water for a complete mouth jet, I usually empty the dish at the end of my rinse to avoid leaks (which it has done)but I can live with that.  I much prefer it to flossing, which I still do occassionally just to check if it&#x27;s getting all the gunk out and it does!</li>
    <li> Mine broke after less than two weeks. it simply stopped working! I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything!</li>
    <li> Using this product for about 5 weeks now. Works well and comes with an assortment of piks neatly enclosed in the lid of the waterpik. The waterpik is on the noisy side but I don&#x27;t know of any that are very quiet. Also be prepared to waterpik over the sink or you will find yourself and the floor to be very wet. The controls are very simple to use: on/off power button, pressure selector(1-10) and hold button on the pik to stop the pressure when you remove the pik from your mouth while the power is still on. To date I have found this product to be effective and dependable.</li>
    <li> I used it for a week and now it sits on the counter. It is loud, kinda messy, and didn&#x27;t do much for me.    There is nothing bad about this product and if you have bleeding gums I would recommend it. If you don&#x27;t have gum issues this probably won&#x27;t do anything a Sonicare, floss, and Listerine won&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a clean feeling mouth.  Easy to use, and well-made.</li>
    <li> I bought my Waterpik in November, 2006, and the jet handle has failed twice so far.  Both times, the pause button became stuck.  The second time, water also began leaking out of the end of the handle where you insert the different tips.  Waterpik has been good about replacing the defective handles, but the failure rate on the jet handle is very high.  You&#x27;d think Waterpik would redesign it to prevent these problems.  OTHERWISE, I really like my Waterpik.  It does a great job.  And, as I said, Waterpik&#x27;s customer service has been very accommodating.  I just wish I didn&#x27;t need to go through the hassle of replacing the handle every 8 or 9 months.</li>
    <li> Since purchasing this product my wife and I  use this twice a day with the excellent results. I will be disappointed if the next dental appointment does not confirm this.  PR in NH[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> I priced this Waterpik in a local store for $20 more.  I am so happy with it!  The water strength is adjustable and there are extra attachments.  The best thing is that it cleans between the teeth and in the gum line.       My dentist told me to get one.  Use it and floss BEFORE you brush, so that any debris is loosened up, and can be brushed away.  It is so easy to use that so far I have used it every night without any excuses.     I rate this Waterpik HIGH.  I hope it helps you with your mouth just as it is helping me.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Amazing how much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; this gets out, even after a thorough brushing.  One word of caution: this flosser can blow or force plaque or debris up under the gums, resulting in infected gums which require a dentist&#x27;s attention.  Happened to both my wife and I.  I am still using it, but am very careful when I do.  It is NOT easy to use this in such a way as to prevent forcing plaque up under your gums.  All in all, I gave this 4 stars because it does work great, but I would probably NOT recommend it because it is so susceptible to causing gum problems.</li>
    <li> I have never had a problem with this waterpik and i have been sharing it with my spouse for over 6 months! This thing gets abused twice a day with each head at least once (It comes with about 6!). I keep a cup by the pik so when i need to use it at night i just pour a cup in, that way i dont have to lift the water tank out, fill it , and then replace it. When i am done using it if there is still water inside i just like my pik run the water out until it is all gone!</li>
    <li> I had an earlier waterpik model that worked for years and was great.  When it finally bit the dust, I bought a newer model thinking it must be better -- NO.  Their new model is made of cheaper material (probably to save a few cents on cost).  Specifically, the hose that connects to the handle broke in about 6 months and started leaking water.  The whole thing went into the trash.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of water pics - the portable ones always ran out of water before I was finished.  This one has a tank to fill so that&#x27;s not a problem.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this item - you quickly learn to use warm water!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve admittedly neglected my oral health until  two weeks ago when I purchased the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in three years and I was not in the habit of flossing my teeth.  At my last dentist appointment I was told I had a mild case of gingivitis but at the time I wasn&#x27;t concerned, so I didn&#x27;t make any changes to my oral hygiene.  I recently decided I wanted to start flossing but I couldn&#x27;t use string floss because many of my teeth don&#x27;t have very good spacing so flossing becomes difficult. So I decided to do some research and came across the Waterpik.  After using it I can say my mouth has never felt cleaner.  I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik at least two times a day for two weeks and I just got great remarks from my dentist.  I went in for a cleaning today and after examining my mouth he said I had no plaque or tartar buildup and he didn&#x27;t need to do any cleaning.  He also assumed that I had always been extremely conscious of my oral hygiene but I let him know that I had just started a new regime that involved me using the Waterpik two weeks ago.  He advised me to keep doing what I was doing because it was definitely working.    I avoided flossing before I purchased the Waterpik because it was so difficult with string floss, but I actually enjoy flossing now.</li>
    <li> A gift to me and I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a floss-alohic. I&#x27;ve got very compact space between my teeth and any bit of trapped food is like have a log wedged painfully between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often find, at the end of the day, my flossing gets quite aggressive so as to ensure no stowaways before I use my nightguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dentists had recommended the Waterpik for quite some time and we finally decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few uses I discovered the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The highest pulse speed is NOT necessary, nor is is necessarily more effective. In fact it totally left my gums tender. I know the instructions say ease your way up, but I wanted to see how it felt. Not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This cleans VERY well, so long as the food is not tightly packed in. As I noted, the space between my teeth are compact. There were a few times I Waterpik&#x27;d and despite using the entire tank, food remained in my most troubled spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Is it just me, or can I not figure out how to use this thing without getting water EVERYWHERE on the counter, the mirror, myself. I&#x27;ve tried every which way I can think of and basically have to be way down in the sink to ensure the least mess possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I haven&#x27;t tossed the floss because I have the Pik. Instead, I use the Pik a few times a week for a more thorough cleaning after flossing, but I still rely on my floss for my regular between-the-teeth needs.</li>
    <li> I had great misginvings about investing the $$ to purchase this product but, with about $20,000 worth of bridgework to maintain, I gave it a try.   I was surprised! The Waterpik does a great job and it is not difficult to use! I flossed after each use for the first week, thinking that the gentle jets of water just COULDN&#x27;T be getting my teeth and bridgework as clean as flossing. To my surprise, I found NO debris left by the Waterpick.(Sounds like a sales pitch, doesn&#x27;t it?)   I&#x27;m very satisifed with this great tool. Because I just purchased it a few weeks ago, time will tell if it is a durable and lasting tool. I can say, though, that it is an efficitive one!</li>
    <li> Purchased this a few months ago.  Used to have the portable battery operated water-Pik.  Battery started wearing down and wasn&#x27;t getting good power.  Then, I lost the power cord and couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.      Like this one much better than I thought I would.  Not as big as it looks.  Sits nicely on my bathroom vanity.  It&#x27;s AC powered, so I also get a good stong water stream.  Comes with several cool attachments, though I find that I never use them.  Water tank is big enough so that I can gat my whole mouth done with one tank.  (Portable one I used to have had to be filled up several times)    Only downside is that I can&#x27;t take it into the shower like I could witht he portable device.  I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it, so not much water spillage, but it can still be a little messy sometimes.    Teeth and gums are definately healthier.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!  The whole family loves it and uses it.  Great for  dental hygiene.  Very helpful for kids with braces.</li>
    <li> The handle is awkward and the coiled plastic hose does not safely extend far from the unit forcing one to place the unit at the lip of the sink. The on/off button on the handle frequently sticks in the off position. It is easy to inadvertently push the tip release button. The tip locking mechanism breaks easily. I have owned the unit for only 3 months and the tip locking mechanism is already broken. If one purchases this unit I highly recommend you save the receipt for warranty claim as early handle replacement seems to be quite common. In summary the handle is just not durable enough.    On the plus side when the unit is working, it does a very nice job of flushing out food particles missed during brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> One of the best investment I have made for the welfare of my teeth.  I absolutely love using this water pik and it is extremely easy to use as well as set up.  Took about 5 minutes or so.  I even had a rebate coupon from my local dentist.  You may also be able to find one on their websites (no guarantees) but hey it&#x27;s $5.</li>
    <li> really cleans in between teeth, best for those with braces, strength dial is spot on, and you can beat amazon&#x27;s prices! do you teeth and gums a favor that will keep on giving and get one of these waterpiks. its better and more thorough than conventional flossing.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really clean you mouth and my dentist recommended it to me. I had bought a cheaper one before and I regreted it very much because I had to take out a part of my ink and then I could not use it to wash my hands or face, and it is made of a cheap plastic who wets you all if you do not use it in the lower pression of water. Save the money and get the Waterpik!</li>
    <li> Just had full implants on lower jaw. This style Waterpik is invaluable to help keep them clean during the 4 month healing stage, as I think it will be when the permanent teeth are installed. It also works well to keep my two upper implants clean.</li>
    <li> This new Waterpik is alright, but I think the older model that I bought this one to replace was better. The new one has more attachments but it does not seem to have as much water pressure as the older one and therefore doesn&#x27;t clean as well. Also, the water tank is not as large, so it runs out of water sooner. I&#x27;m sorry if this makes me sound like Andy Rooney, but re-designing something so it can be \\&quot;new\\&quot; is not always an improvement. It is too bad that a product that works well has to be \\&quot;improved\\&quot; just for marketing purposes. I wish I could still buy the old design, but I could not find it on the market.</li>
    <li> good design, but bad application. I don&#x27;t care how neat of a person u are, if you use this tool properly you will make a mess. Countertops, mirrors, and floors. Go with the \\&quot;ShowerBreeze w/ 3&#x27; hose Oral Irrigator by ORALBREEZE that connects directly in line with the water supply IN your shower (where the splashing belongs). No dead batterries after a short time, no weak water pressure from rechargable units, and no refilling the water every time either. And if you can&#x27;t figure out how to put it in you deserve to clean up bathrooms full-time. If u read this before you purchased anything someone must be looking out for you upstairs. Good Luck, Joe.[[ASIN:B000CEMWHI ShowerBreeze w/ 3&#x27; hose Oral Irrigator]]</li>
    <li> Ok this unit works pretty good, its been about 3/4 of a year and no problems yet.  It blasts out the junk from my teeth if i eat stuff like nuts and other things that would rot in the spaces.  I personally think you should floss to at times but this unit works pretty well.  I didnt care for the toung scraper head even though it works ok, i would rather use another kind of toung scraper.  Some people mentioned that another unit dosent have a lid, this one does and you can store the acessories in it, i found i like to put the lid thing in the cabinet and leave the reservior open,then when empty i put it upside down to dry out and wipe the unit down real quick with a towl, i seen some mold/bacteria on the bottom between it and the sink if i didnt do that..not a big thing anyway..that happens if i leave water on the sink fittings/surface anyway.  I like the unit, it took a few days of teeth blasting to turn it up to the max, (gums have to adjust to the blast, or maybe my technique got better) but now its 2x per day..  No bad breath, no chance of rotting debris lurking between them teeth..  and i will buy again when this unit is worn out...  al-r</li>
    <li> I was interested in this product for its deep pocket cleaning abilities. After reading other reviews before purchasing, I would say that they are pretty accurate. The jet is VERY strong (especially at the 10 setting) but the water reservoir does deplete quicker than comfortable. However, this is not that big of a deal in my opinion as since I don&#x27;t have much counter space, refilling only on \\&quot;extra-cleaning\\&quot; days is more preferred to me than a unit with a reservoir twice or even three times the size.     As for the leaking rubber grommet, it is also true. It is due to the fact that the water level is higher in the wand than at the grommet so that when you put it away the residual water eventually settles down and leaks out at the grommet. However, I want to note that the water doesn&#x27;t spill out and over onto the counter. This is because the grommet is inside the basin area that you insert the water reservoir into and is sort of designed to catch drips. I have found that if I simply hold the wand down into the sink area for a few seconds after I&#x27;m finished and while I am dumping the unused water out of the reservoir, excess water will leak out of the cleaning tip so that when I replace the wand back onto the unit, no more water leaks out of the grommet.  Yes, this is an extra maintenance step, but really no big deal.  After all, I am already spending lots more effort cleaning my teeth.      My bottom line is that this unit does what I need it to do most which is to produce a strong jet of water.  The fact that the water hose retracts so nicely, this thing seems like it will last a while, and that the unit looks quite stylish overall to me is well worth the $50.</li>
    <li> I find flossing to take too much time, and this water jet is a great time saver to help keep my gums healthy. One drawback is that food tends to stick on my teeth easier when eating since using the waterpik.  Another note, the handle started leaking little by little and finally became unusable after 6 months of use. I went on the waterpik site and contacted customer service. My replacement part was promptly processed, and I received it in about two weeks, no problem.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Ultra Water Jet replaces a WJ7B Conair Interplak Water Jet.    The Conair lasted two years, I replaced it with the same model, and the new one lasted only a week.  I liked the old Conair (that&#x27;s why I re-ordered it) because it had a low price, a very strong pulse, extra jets (my spouse used it also and they can break), and a reasonably small footprint.  Although the new one was the same model number, it failed in one week for the same reason that the old one did after two years -- the pump tried to push water but couldn&#x27;t, at all.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money and I ordered the Waterpik Ultra.    The Waterpik Ultra has about the same footprint as the Conair.  I didn&#x27;t like that the price was almost double of the Conair, it came with only two jets, and the pulse wasn&#x27;t as strong as the Conair.  Nevertheless, I liked it because it works despite the lower pressure and it is more quiet (the Conair vibrated and rattled a lot on the bathrooom vanity).    Unfortunately, the first Waterpik Ultra I ordered lasted less than a week.  Like the new Conair, it made a loud humming noise but couldn&#x27;t pump any water.  Fortunately, Amazon replaced it without any fuss (I am very impressed with Amazon&#x27;s refund/replacement policy that includes free return shipping using their label).  The replacement arrived more quickly than Amazon&#x27;s original shipment, which I think is nice because I was stuck without a Waterpik while I waited for the new one.  The replacement has worked a few weeks as of this review.  I hope this one lasts a few years.  If not for the first Waterpick that I had to replace, I would have given this product 4-1/2 stars.     By the way, I also recently purchased from Amazon a Panasonic EW1270AC portable water irrigator for traveling.  (I also bought one about a year ago for my daughter for use at college.)  Although the Panasonic is not as effective as the Waterpik for regular use, which I would not expect of a battery-operated product, it is prettygood for the intended purpose.    UPDATE 6/2009: The button on the handle to stop water temporarily doesn&#x27;t allow water to flow when released.  I simply don&#x27;t use it but this is dissapointing.</li>
    <li> This item needs to be up dated by the company who makes it. I read most of the reviews concerning this item and agree with the things they wrote, but I needed the item and of all the products this was the better one. But, the coil cord is too short. I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; tall and have it sitting and a shelf on my sink and still have to bend over for it to reach my mouth. For people with a bad back this is not good. Even though it tells you to use warm water, it does not tell you that there may be water still in the tubing and for people with sensitive teeth this is a very rude awaking at 5AM. The button you push to stop the flow has to be push just right or it will not stop the water and you get water all over the place including up your nose, which again does not feel too good at 5am.&lt;br /&gt;When your dentist says you have to use this kind of product, you have to go with the best in reviews, but this does not mean that it cannot be improved if the manufacturer reads its customers reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JLW</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by my dentist to buy a waterpik.  I bought the original Waterpik, since I trust the name.  So far it has been working great and I love it.  It would be great also for anyone with braces.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]  The product is really great  but it needs a devise to attatch it to the wall</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed with this unit is how quiet it was.  I have had several of these before and they were noisy.  I also like the style and the storage tray for various tips.  Only one negative comment- the on-off switch should have been placed such that the unit doesn&#x27;t slide back when the switch is pressed.  Or the rubberized feet should be more \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;.  I recommend this model.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent devise to keep your teeth cleaned. I am paranoid about keeping my teech clened after every meal and this is the best way to do.</li>
    <li> Start out with low pressure and work your way up.  This is a powerful machine that will leave you very clean.</li>
    <li> Is great I love it. I would recommend it to others. And the price was great. I love the pics</li>
    <li> This is my first water floss.  I have been using it every day.  Works great. Like it.</li>
    <li> How did I ever think that my teeth and mouth were totally clean before I ever used the waterpik. I think this is the best. Even my husband uses it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am so enthusiastic about this unit. I have always had problems with periodontal disease, and under the recommendation from my current dentist I decided to buy the Waterpik. Previously, I have always had a hard time with flossing. My sensitive gums always caused bleeding when flossing or eating hard foods. I was prone to deep cleanings every 3-6 months (expensive) depending on the progress and escalation of my oral health as noted by me previous dentist. I thought this was ludicrous, and switched to a more credible dentist who recommended buying a Waterpik and adding some hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this unit for 3 months. I just went back to visit my new dentist two days ago and initially, I was scared by his reaction. The dentist looked into my mouth and said, \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; in an almost ominous way. He later clarified that he is amazed that this simple solution has worked so well. Much to my and the dentist surprise, I had no bleeding after a manual/hand cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual unit itself is very easy to use. I do not use all the attachments, only the classic jet tip. The WaterPik has many different levels of water pressure. My dentist urged me to increase the pressure one tick or setting every month. I have been only using this unit for 3 months and I might have bent the rules a bit because I am now up to 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir holds plenty of water for flossing. Although, once you set your pressure to 10, the water depletes very quickly. I have heard several users complaining of the reservoir leaking. I have NOT had this problem, because I do not leave water in the tank. The functionality is very user-friendly, the handle has a pause button, and the on-off switch is on the actual unit. I feel the cord is ample length simply because I am hanging my head down in the sink anyways to eliminate water splash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very messy...or can be messy task; since high water pressure is pumped into your mouth, it would make sense right? All in all, this product has done a tremendous job in promoting better oral health for me. Adding hydrogen peroxide as a debriding agent has helped me immensely. I definitely recommend this product in general or anyone who has experienced periodontal issues.ght? All in all, this product has done a tremendous job in promoting better oral health for me.

    <li> I ordered this because I find it really difficult to floss with braces on. I borrowed one from a friend that was a different brand and knew I had to have one.  This unit has some good attachments, I threw the tongue scraper out though since there isn&#x27;t enough storage in the lid for all the attachments. The cord and the hose are a nice length suitable for most bathroom set ups. The pressure on the unit is not as strong as I had hoped. I have to crank it to 8 or 10 to get a real feeling of clean. The lower settings would be good for irrigation. I find that one full tank of water is enough to \\&quot;floss\\&quot; the teeth. If you have trouble flossing or have braces, I highly recommend getting this machine.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik does an excellent job on the teeth. I am particularly impressed with the range of control for water pressure. My one complaint is the lid for the water reservoir. It must be removed in order to fill the reservoir. I have used devices like this for years that had flip up lids that made it easy to fill with water. This WaterPik comes with several optional attachments which are store in a compartment in the lid. Personally, I would have preferred a separate storage unit for the attachments and a single flip-up lid on the reservoir. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and I still find this to be annoying. However, the bottom line is that this device is very versatile and does an excellent job at cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik dental irrigators for many   years and they have definitely raised the bar with   this one. I highly recommend this particular   model.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]This is an excellent product. It is vastly improved from the others that I have owned in the past. I would recommend this to anyone.    It works very well and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews before buying this, even though my dentist pretty much told me I had to.  I am glad I went with the dentist&#x27;s suggestion.  I am not having any of the problems I have seen listed here.  I see a lot of people talk about leaking and needing to empty the reservoir after use to prevent leakage.  Well, it tells you to empty the reservoir in the manual.  I saw a complaint that the curled collar does not turn the tip, mine does it just fine.  People have complained about the pause button, and I can&#x27;t really respond to that, as I have never seen the need to pause it.  People have complained about the amount of water they spray all over themselves and the bathroom, but if you place it in your mouth before you turn it on, as it tells you to do in the manual, i have not sprayed any water anywhere.  Several people have complained about the tip popping off because the button is where they place their thumbs, and my thumb is nowhere near the release button.  As far as the minor complaint about the cord length, I prefer to lean over the sink when I use the device, so it is not an issue with me.    All I can say is that I am amazed by the amount of particles that are left behind after brushing with a sonicare and flossing.  My gums are in much better condition, and I wish I had bought this before the 6K dental bill!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VVHD44 Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet]]  I have a periodontal problem and the Waterpik is especially useful for this.  It thoroughly cleans my gum line and opened up pockets so they could be cleaned.  I am very happy (my gums are much improved) that I purchased this product.  It has many tips to use and really works!</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with this product..my dentist wanted me to get it and I wish he had told me about it sooner..</li>
    <li> I hate to floss so when I heard about the waterpik I was instantly curious. I bought one and I fell in love with it. My mouth has never felt so clean without having been to the dentist. The waterpik seriously makes me feel like I just left the dentists office. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> the replacement worked seamlessly. Now my waterpik is like new.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I use it after brushing, and I notice it cleans more from my teeth.  It does not bother my gums. I like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik to replace my 5 year old model. The older model never really impressed me much so I was hesitant to choose the same brand but based on the reviews I read, decided to take the risk. Thank goodness I did!!! They have improved dramatically over the old model. The pressure settings are fantastic. The periodontal cleaner is a welcome addition along with the toothbrush. The tongue cleaner is just fluff but it was on the older model too, so there was no expectation there. The handle has been designed better with the coiling cord being much handier and making the unit easier to store. The top compartment holding the tools is a great improvement over the old store it on the base design. The tools stay neat and organized and clean. Overall, I would recommend this model Waterpik to anyone. From the braces attachment to the standard Waterpik wand you will not be disappointed. Great value for the price also!! 5 Stars Waterpik, you got this one right.</li>
    <li> My new Waterpik works well to clean between the teeth.  It&#x27;s amazing to see how much debris remains after brushing.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations. This is my third h20 pik first of this model and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to. The water resoviour seems a little smaller than those of the past but water flow is great the pause buttoni is a plus as well as all the goodies that come with it</li>
    <li> Bought this not just to clean out food debris, but because my dental hygienist said it would clean debris AND plaque from the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; around the gumline better than floss alone.  I agree with the people who say it sounds a little like a cement mixer, and it is a little messy, so you&#x27;d better be leaning over the sink, BUT it does a fabulous job at removing not only debris, but plaque as well.  I used to be able to scrape calculus (hardened plaque) off the back of my bottom incisors about three days after a professional cleaning.  It has been weeks, and I still have no buildup.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the job it does. My mouth feels so clean.  But best of all,  I KNOW it will make my next cleaning MUCH more pleasant.</li>
    <li> I had just read in a health magazine how good the waterpik is for your gums. Easy to use and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I had owned a waterpik in years past (over 10 years ago) and when it broke I never replaced it.  Recently I had a problem with a gum infection and my dentist recommended the waterpik.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with his recommendation because I remembered the old beast was large, took up a lot of room, and leaked.  But, I really needed it due to my gum problems.  At first I purchased a cordless waterpik at a local big box store.  I thought it would be better because it would take up less space.  When I got it home and took it out of the box I saw that the water tank would be way too small.  I packaged it back up and took it back.   I looked at this model in the store and it seemed to be much better due to water capacity.  Also the design had changed and now it was smaller and would take up far less space in the bathroom.  I compared the price at the store with amazon&#x27;s and was happy to see that amazon&#x27;s was less.      It arrived right on time, 2 days after ordering and it is meeting all my needs.  I like the way the new model has a cover for the water tank to keep out dust between uses.  Also, the new design makes it much easier to store as the tubing coils up nicely and stores easily.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now daily and I think it is helping a lot.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to do a good job of cleaning along the gumline in addition to brushing.</li>
    <li> The set includes water jet with reservoir for water and a number of heads for the waterjet, including but not limited to tongue cleaner and orthodontic cleaner. Personally I have no use for most of them but it&#x27;s nice to have them just in case. Reservoir can hold more than enough water for one cleaning. My husband and I have been using the waterpik for a short period of time but can already see some results - our gums became healthier and our teeth look and feel great. The waterpik is a bit messy but nothing you cannot deal with. You can easily regulate the strength of water pressure to find the one you are comfortable with. It&#x27;s a great tool to use and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Even good at cleaning other bathroom nooks &amp; crannies - around faucets, drains &amp; handles. Oh - works on teeth too!</li>
    <li> Gift to my husband.  He loves it and uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many Waterpiks over the last 35 years, but this is the best one yet.  The smaller water reservoir is not a problem for me, although prefer the larger one previously standard.  Controls are easy to adjust, &amp; the tip swivels effortlessly.  The only problem is that it is a little too easy to hit the \\&quot;eject\\&quot; button for the tip.  All in all, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I tried another popular brand which cost about half as much, but I returned it.  It did not perform well.  This unit is super!</li>
    <li> A well designed product. Compact, efficient, water capacity sufficient to cover both upper and lower teeth completely without needing to refill.     Noise is kept to a minimum while operating. The Pause button is a very desirable and often used feature. A drawback is length of the connective hose. Another 10\\&quot; to 18\\&quot; would be a welcomed addition. The ease in which this hose retracts makes for easy clean up. There are no regrets in having made this purchase for the purpose of improving dental health.</li>
    <li> Totally amazed by what a great job this product does. I have not had any of the problems I have seen listed here. All I can tell you is that I feel as though I have just walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office every day. I am less inclined to eat food that is bad for my teeth (and for me) because I love the sparkly clean feeling to last all day. I use the Sonicare Elite and the Waterpik Ultra at least twice a day. I do floss with the Reach battery opperated flosser once a day but I feel this is probably over-kill. I feel great when I go to bed and I wake up with squeaky clean teeth in the morning. I WANT TO BRUSH MY TEETH AND USE THE WATERPIK!! It gives you a very comfortable, fresh feeling. Try it, I guarantee you won&#x27;t be sorry! I did not have trouble adjusting to the settings and I vary between high and low just because sometimes that is what I want.</li>
    <li> My previous water pik was a battery handheld with one speed. Worked great but had a short life span - about 12 to 18 months. This water pik has more options, 10 different pressure setting and the smaller pik attached to a light hose is easier to manipulate in the mouth than the larger cordless handheld. Worth the extra $30.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik and I am addicted to it.  Hate to floss now that I use it, and I get great dental checkups.  Can&#x27;t convince my husband to use it and it is messy, but so is floss.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.  Word of advice, start with low pressure and work up once you&#x27;re used to it.  Grandchildren use it too for braces.</li>
    <li> Of course, I&#x27;ve seen the ads for Waterpik for years but had never tried one.  My mouth and teeth have never felt so clean.  My only caution to new users is to start the \\&quot;intensity\\&quot; control LOW and work your way up to an effective and comfortable position.  That water jet is amazingly strong.</li>
    <li> I tell my dentist at every cleaning, no I don&#x27;t floss.  She always gets upset, but hey, I don&#x27;t like to lie.  Well now I&#x27;m getting older and I want to keep my pearly whites, bright n healthy.  These water flosser&#x27;s were at the dentist&#x27;s office for sale, I bought one on Amazon at a savings and I have to tell you they work and they aren&#x27;t bad to use.  Feels funny at first, but effective at cleaning the back of your teeth and in between your teeth.  I would highly recommend to anyone who loathes flossing.</li>
    <li> I bought the waterpik for my son 3 months ago after he got his braces.  It has been a lifesaver!  It&#x27;s easy for him to use, and it does a great job cleaning all those brackets. The best part is that he LIKES using it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;m impressed with the strength of the jet and how it gets between my tight teeth.  I have a hard time flossing because the floss shreds and gets stuck between my teeth.    I also use it to remove tonsil stones.  If you decide to try it, use the LOWEST setting.  Tonsils are delicate and tear easily!    I agree with the other reviewers who mention the small tank (I fill it twice) and the lid that could easily fall into the tank (hasn&#x27;t happened to me because I&#x27;m careful).  However, I like that it doesn&#x27;t require much room and I love the storage in the lid.  The tank feels like it could break easily so I handle it gently and have had no problem with it.  The cord is long enough for my needs.    Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this waterpik to everyone. Its a great way to floss. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;It will be everyones christmas gift this year.</li>
    <li> I was very amazed at how much food was still stuck between my teeth after brushing them.  Compared to flossing this is a much better way to get things out of your teeth!  This waterpik is a very good investment and will help prevent gum disease is what my dentist told me so I bought it here and have been happily removing things from my teeth ever since I have had it!  Great investment!</li>
    <li> I bought the unit(Waterpik ultra flosser) in June of 2009 from Amazon.com.  In Jan. 2011, less than 2 years later, the unit developed leaking problem and intermittent motor operation problem.    When I contacted Waterpik, the calls either kept on getting dropped or I keep on getting passed to Waterpik sales place.    I thought the warranty was 2 years, but apparently, they want to save money by not honoring the warranty.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this company&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Waterpik for 1 month now. Very good price at Amazon. I&#x27;m a first time user and have been wanting to try it for a few years and has been recommended by my Dentist. . I went with the Ultra. I read where some people have trouble with water spraying all over the place, well they just don&#x27;t know how to use it. With a little practice there is not a problem. I use the Gum fitting, and it works great as far as I&#x27;m concerned. The particles of food come flowing out with ease. My only problem is my Bathroom sink, I have no place to set the Waterpik down on a flat area, so I have to hold it on one spot of sink with one hand as I use the other to use the pik. Works for me and have no other choice at this time. Next month is my Dentist appointment and I&#x27;m curious to see if they notice a differents. So, you can say I&#x27;m VERY happy with my Waterpik Ultra.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Water Pik (in one form, or another) for over 40 years.  I was beginning to think maybe the company had changed their design philosophy, or succumbed to the economics of making something so &amp;#34;cheaply&amp;#34;, that it no longer suits the original need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two water piks purchased  over the last three or four years were way less than satisfactory.  (I don&#x27;t know what the model numbers on these two units were, but each one had problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one, the tip (that goes into your mouth) kept breaking at the insertion point.  It was both difficult to insert, and remove.  It was, in my opinion, a deign flaw.  Replacement tips were expensive, and didn&#x27;t last as long as I felt they should.  In fact, when the unit was brand new, (with the second use!) the tip broke.  I called customer service, and the lady who answered was totally disinterested in helping resolve the situation.  She said I could purchase additional tips, and left it at that.  After further discussion, when she admitted it should last more that two times, and begrudgingly offered to send another one.  It took six weeks for the replacement to arrive.  Great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other unit was so LOUD that it was uncomfortable to use.  In addition, several of the plastic pieces began to mold, and turn black, even though I dried it off thoroughly after every use.  Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was beginning to think there would be no more Water Pik use in my future.  Then I bought the Ultra Flosser.  The tips insert easily, and pop right out when the button that secures them is depressed.  It is relatively quiet (so it doesn&#x27;t wake my wife when she goes to sleep before I do).  It does the job the Water Pik is supposed to do, without any issues, to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to keep clean, and looks well made.  Hopefully, this foretells the future, and I can look forward to many more years of good dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> This water pik is better than flossing.  You can brush, floss and still remove particles from beneath your gums with this water pik.  I&#x27;m a popcorn lover and nothing works better than the water pik for good dental health.  Your dentist will be doing less work on you if you use this device consistently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for about one month now and I&#x27;ve been enjoying it. It&#x27;s a great little appliance and I would strongly recommend it to anyone thinking about purchasing a water flosser, anyone interested in having better dental health and anyone with a \\&quot;complicated\\&quot; dental history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Although you&#x27;ll likely have to work up to full strength, at that power it is extremely effective at dislodging difficult to clear food, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- You&#x27;ll never have to lick at something stuck between your teeth again.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable to use; although the stream is pretty strong at full power.&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of different tips for different needs.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves you feeling more confident that your teeth are clean.&lt;br /&gt;- The cord naturally curls up so it&#x27;s pretty easy to keep your counter-top free from clutter that an appliance like this might otherwise create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s loud. Especially at full power. Loud enough that you&#x27;ll have to turn it off before having a conversation.&lt;br /&gt;- Especially at first, you may accidentally spray water sometimes. Once you get used to keeping your mouth closed and pushing the button to pause the cleaning, you&#x27;ll be fine, though.&lt;br /&gt;- The water reservoir is really only good for about two uses. I&#x27;m lazy, so that kind of turns me off. I guess they have to negotiate with the size so it doesn&#x27;t clutter your counter-top though.</li>
    <li> Bought it because I didn&#x27;t like dental floss. Works marvelously. I love how you have different pressures and different piks for different purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish we could put more water (one minute and a half seems a bit short). Other than that great product! Also, I use it to wake myself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, good dental hygiene will not only make your smile more beautiful but save you lot of money by not going to a dentist.</li>
    <li> Great while it worked - but the unit only lasted 2 months before the button on the handle became stuck, making the entire unit un-usable.  You can hear plastic rattling around inside of it, so clearly something snapped off with the spring mechanism.  Fairly disappointing that this makes the entire thing worthless.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend spending the money for this one, the basic works just as well if not better.  True the lower cost one is bigger and makes a little more noise but it is easier to use with the controls in the handle, has a larger reservoir and it actually is more powerful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned probably 20 Waterpiks from the time I was a teenager on.  Waterpik has really done a fantastic job in product improvement.  I probably started with the original Waterpik which I&#x27;m sure had one design.  Over the years they have added to the high and and low end and I&#x27;ve bought in the middle.  This design is excellent.  It is quieter, more solid, efficiently designed with the storage on top.  The storage is sufficient and basically just is a great unit in all respects.</li>
    <li> I am a first time buyer of the Waterpik Ultra 100 w/c. The tank is too small and the motor seemed troubled and stopped after our first use. The manual said the Waterpik could only be used for 5 minutes before needing a rest to cool down before next use. We tried every thing in the manual to make it work. After an hour of doing whatever we could, I am sending it back. Motor sounds bad with a beeping sound that would start every time it was turned on. Looking forward to trying again (as all good Americans will) every time I need a good cleaning. Long live our one sided trade with China. Is it too late to relocate the American firm?</li>
    <li> I had an older model that finally gave out.  This is a better, updated version with multiple attachments.  It&#x27;s quieter than the old one and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, but after a year the water tube broke off and cannot be replaced.  The machine is now useless.</li>
    <li> Love this product, shoots a stream of water in between the teeth to get out any food that may be in there that the tooth brush can&#x27;t get out. Also has quite a few diffent attachments that go with it. Mouth feels fresh and clean after brushing then using the flosser.</li>
    <li> Personally I think the tank capacity is enough and the jet power are actually more than strong enough.  My dentist says I should use one so I ordered this.  She specifically says don&#x27;t use full power it might do more harm than good, in my situation, any way.  The footprint is small to fit on a typical glass shelf and easy to move around, it may be even too light when not filled with water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an improvement over my 1980s Waterpik, but the translucent plastic reservoir&lt;br /&gt;can be melted by essential oils, and while the manual warns vaguely about this,&lt;br /&gt;my old 1980s model 71 reservoir was of hard opaque plastic that was impervious&lt;br /&gt;to just about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the new operating features are good, though the jet stream is not as forceful as the&lt;br /&gt;older model. The choice of tips offers good variety and easier insertion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the company could make a few bucks and solve some problems for users by offering&lt;br /&gt;replacement reservoirs of hard dense plastic impervious to oils. Puzzles me they&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t already, because they could sell a bundle of them.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my son has braces and flossing was taking too long and his gums were getting unhealthy even with flossing.  What a difference this makes not only for him but for the entire family.  It is so much faster and efficient than flossing.  The box says you&#x27;ll have healthier gums within 14 days of using this and that is absolutely true.  I used to floss every day and thought my mouth was clean but this made a huge difference on what I thought were already healthy gums and teeth.  It takes a couple of times to get used to the water pressure but once you&#x27;re used to it, it&#x27;s fast.  I am extremely happy with this product--my teeth look whiter and my son&#x27;s gums look great.</li>
    <li> I have used dental irrigators for &gt; 20 years. This model works great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this system as a recommendation from my dentist, having difficulty reaching some deep areas on the back of my gums with the dental floss. Before using it, even flossing and using an electric toothbrush daily wasn&#x27;t enough to keep those areas clean, having to go for the occasional deep-cleaning and suffering a lot with regular bleeding,etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Waterpik and everything changed. It is not magical and it has a somewhat steep learning curve, being easy to run out of water often, hurting my gums while finding the correct pressure, etc and as everything with your body, your mouth will take time to adapt to a new way of cleaning it, the same it happens when using a different model of toothbrush or a new electric shaver. But don&#x27;t give up, after a few weeks of sticking to your daily cleaning routine you&#x27;ll learn how to use it and you&#x27;ll feel better, and your gums will start to thanking you. This is far better and efficient than using a dental floss, mostly because after using dental floss for my entire life, mastering the technique of flossing is very difficult. With Waterpik, it is fairly easy to learn how to use it when compared with flossing (weeks vs years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test was my first visit to the dentist after using it regularly: the back gum pockets were gone and I got kudos from a very clean and healthy mouth; cleaning and check-up visits then became shorter and easy. Why not 5 stars then? Well, I feel like the reservoir system could be better designed with a bit of more capacity, and the hose can be difficult to manage at the beginning with a high-chance of breaking it as it is very stiff. And of course, better electric cable management, like guides or something to keep the cable nicely stored around or behind the body.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet works very well.  The pulsating action is great.  I keep it on a low number of intensity, as not to damage my gums.  I think it&#x27;s a good device to have and use!</li>
    <li> I will start out by saying that the term WaterPick is kind of lame.  This thing is more like a pressure washer for your teeth and gums.    A few years back I broke my elbow (something I strongly suggest avoiding).  Since then, flossing has been nearly impossible (not that I ever did so religiously).  I thus decided to give the Waterpik a try and my only rgret is that I did not buy this many yeas ago.    From a design perspective this is much more attractive than many of the other units out there.  It is easy to fill, easy to use, and the stoage compatment in the lid is very convenient and eliminates the need to display your picks.    This unit literally blasts your teeth clean.  There are lots of pressure settings, at he highest setting it is almost painful.  If I skip a night using it I can definitely tell the difference.  During cleaning I always had a lot of gum bleeding.  On my last cleaning there was almost none at all.    You only get one set of \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; teeth so take good care of them.  This unit will go a long way toward minimizing your time in the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
    <li> The waterpic works well enough for awhile.  Then the tiny brittle hose breaks and their website only recommends a replacement under certain conditions:  \\&quot;In order for the hose repair kit to work you must have at least 2\\&quot; of hose from the base of the unit, and the hose must be in good condition non-brittle.\\&quot;  It is brittle when purchased and not made to splice without cracking, no matter where you splice it.  This is a made-for-the-landfill product.</li>
    <li> At the beginning of the year I decided I was going to start flossing - twice per day at first, and then I&#x27;d go to once per day once my gum health improved. Except it didn&#x27;t.. my gums became so inflamed and sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t eat firm or crunchy foods. So I finally decided to invest in an oral irrigator, and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- MUCH more efficient than regular flossing&lt;br /&gt;- Being able to brush and floss at the same time means I spend less time per day on my mouth, but still do a better job cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- Being able to add mouthwash and peroxide to the reservoir, and having the different attachments, means I can do a really excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;- This device is much smaller than I had feared, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- While being able to store tips in the reservoir lid is neat, the device comes with six tips and the storage only holds four. So.. what do I do with the other two?&lt;br /&gt;- The storage/lid comes off the reservoir VERY easily. Like, if you bump it wrong the lid just plunks down into the reservoir. It&#x27;d be nice if it snapped on or something.&lt;br /&gt;- Water gets everywhere! It drips down the cord and gets on the counter. If you press the \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button on the wand and then turn off the machine, and then you release the pause button, water sprays out. I know there&#x27;s a learning curve but still, it doesn&#x27;t seem like you can use this machine without having to wipe up the counter afterward.&lt;br /&gt;- If you set the wand down in the sink, it dribbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say though that the cons are FAR, FAR outweighed by the pros. I am so very happy I bought this item!</li>
    <li> This unit has many jet heads.  I find the basic jet head most useful.  If you do not need other jet heads, I suggest you buy a less expensive model.  Because it shoots water, you need to use it next to a sink and it does wet your hand and chin.  The unit is big, not for travel use.  Thus, you still need dental floss when away from home.  Amazon shipped the unit quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this because it was recommended by his periodontal hygenist.  He has a problem with his gums receding and always needs the deep cleaning done at the dentist&#x27;s office.  He received this product about a year ago and has been using it every night before bed.  The results are amazing.  His hygenist says she just can&#x27;t believe what a difference it has made in his gum tissue.  We would highly recommend it!.</li>
    <li> I found it difficult to floss due to TMJ, so I didn&#x27;t.  Now I&#x27;m paying the price....big price...at the dentist&#x27;s office.  So, I thought I&#x27;d give a Waterpik a try.  I used to think it was a bit of a gadget, but boy was I wrong.  I can&#x27;t believe the amount of debris it flushes out...and with popcorn my evening snack of choice, it&#x27;s a lot of debris.  When I follow up with a good brushing, I find no further crumbs, hulls, seeds, etc.  I love that there&#x27;s no setup so that no matter how tired I am at night all I have to do is pick up the wand and press the &#x27;on&#x27; button (I refill it with water after use so it&#x27;s ready for the next time).  I have absolutely no excuse for not using it regularly.  I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with how easy it is use, how throughly it cleans. It was amazing how much it cleaned after eating popcorn and brushing my teeth. Friends of mine said they loved it and i understand why</li>
    <li> I replaced the interplac device I had with the Waterpik Ultra dental water jet and we are finding that it does a much better job flushing out the daily accumulation of food particals. We are a family who flosses daily and sometimes even twice and with the interplac we still had times when the gums would still be very sensitive. We are finding that with the Waterpik that sensitivity has gone away. I would highly recommended this product to anyone who cares about their daily dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Pro: Performs very well.    Con: only two jet tips come with the unit. It will cost about $10, including shipping, to get an extra set of tips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS ONLY TWO MONTHS NOW AND SO FAR HAVE NO COMPLAINTS OR PROBLEMS.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT SURE IS A GREAT FOLLOW-UP TO FLOSSING!  AFTER FLOSSING I EXPECT TO HAVE MY TEETH CLEAR OF FOOD DEBRIS, BUT WHEN I USE THIS WATERPIK AFTER FLOSSING, I&#x27;M SHOCKED HOW MUCH JUNK WAS LEFT BEHIND.  IT CERTAINLY IS A MUST, EVEN WITH GOOD FLOSSING!! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
    <li> Compact and more quiet than the earlier model Waterpik this one replaced.  Wand hose storage is also a plus.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Have had this for several years now. Leaves my mouth feeling clean in a way just brushing or regular flossing doesn&#x27;t. It gets to spots nothing can reach except water, especially useful for the gum under bridge dental work. I love my waterpik.</li>
    <li> The ultra waterpik is great. Even after flossing, the waterpik still gets rid of food particles. I&#x27;m always surprised how much I miss with floss. I have some dental work, and this is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve done to help keep them clean. Sometimes I add mouthwash and /or peroxide to the water when half full. It can be messy if you try to look at your teeth in a mirror while using the pik. Follow the directions and you won&#x27;t have a mess. The smaller size and shape of the unit fits nicely on the sink counter. not to bulky, and the cover hold the piks so they are not exposed to dust or germs. It&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this to anyone work great add some frouride to the water and you get some flavor while cleaning your teeth get two things done at once</li>
    <li> Replaced a waterpik that wore out and this one is even better than the last one.  Very good product and highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik brand for many years and this one has been my favorite.</li>
    <li> LOVE MY WATER PIC!!  I use it at the STRONGEST settings needle point.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended it to me, and after I got it and used several times, I began to love it. It provided clean feel after I used it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet to upgrade from my [[ASIN:B000F54AQA Interplak Dental Water Jet, 1 each]] and eventhough it is twice the price it is well worth it!  First of all the jet pulses and gives a much more invigorating and deeper cleanse.  Secondly, the cord wraps in own little place in the front whereas on the Interplak it is constantly catching around the handle.  Thirdly, this wonderful reservoir makes it possible to add the concentrates designed for such a purpose much better than the interplak whose reservoir has many corners making it impossible to clean and therefor have to replace within a month if you want to use the oral irrigator cleansing solutions in the water.  I wish I had splurged in the first place for this WP-100!  I got mine in a Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet and Sensonic SR-1000 Professional Toothbrush Combo Kit for 84.75 including s/h and tax from just4teeth and have seen the same combo kit at Costco for 89 plus tax.  Oral health greatly impacts your whole health!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product with the pik pocket attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well and leaves my mouth feeling very clean and fresh. The power settings take some getting used to. This unit puts out way more power than I can use on the higher settings but it is nicely adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of the holder for the various attachments. They really don&#x27;t clip in easily and filling the reservoir is a bit awkward. There aren&#x27;t enough spaces in the holder for all the furnished attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you figure out which tips you want to use and how much power to give it, it is a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I started using the Waterpik cordless which was great at the beginning , but lost the ability to hold charge pretty fast but taught me about the waterpik product and how well it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for a great price and has very good pressure and just enough water to complete the flossing  in one fill.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with several different tips , is relatively quiet comparing to the old one.&lt;br /&gt;To anyone who never used this thing before , start with the low setting as slight bleeding may occur , but in a week or so it disappears , plus ive tried flossing after using it and the floss stayed clean!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Waterpik and so easy to use.  My husband even uses it - and that is a first.&lt;br /&gt;The price was better than we could find it in town.</li>
    <li> I did some research on water piks and this got great reviews. It was $10 more to purchase it in your local store so buy it on amazon. Great water pressure unlike most water piks. Came with lots of extra attachments and a storage place for those inside the lid. I have only had this a few months and love it. It is easy to use and we have had no problems it also comes with a warranty through the manufacturer so go online and watch the video. I hav a friend who bought another type of water pik she has only had it a short time and has already had problems.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate and to maintin.  As an adjunct to the tooth brush, the Water Jet really seems to clean teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> If you thought you were getting your teeth clean with just brushing, you should use this product after, to see what still stay in your teeth. My teeth feel cleaner and my gums feel great.</li>
    <li> This does the job and the accessories are excellent, particularly the toothbrush and tongue cleaner. But the tube is a bit too short and it is not as quiet as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Well made, superior type of waterpik.  Where have you been all my (dental) life?</li>
    <li> Easy to operate and does not take up a lot of counter space as did the old one.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had this product almost a year now and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. Although I think it is about time for my brush attachment to get replaced for the first time, this product has gone above and beyond my expectations. I&#x27;ll admit I may be one of the lucky ones because my product has lasted so long. I use it at least 4 times a day to clean my braces after I eat anything. After reading some reviews on here I thought my unit would have busted a long time ago. I only use it on the 5 setting and always make sure to dump the extra water out when I&#x27;m done (not sure if that does anything). So I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it will continue to last and I will not be mad if it eventually fails on me. I&#x27;ll just get another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit August 2013: It finally broke where the hose connects to the handle. Water started squirting everywhere!!! But this is definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. Over 4 years of constant use was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Works Great!!  This was a replacement of a very old one that eventually had a plastic line go bad.  This one is even better.  Convenient.  Would recomend it</li>
    <li> Great flosser get the job done.</li>
    <li> Do not understand the negative reviews of this product.  I have used a waterpik for over 8 years.  I used the old type as well as the new waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaint about the well capacity:  It holds at least as much, if not more,  water then the old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaint about pressure:  I only use it on half pressure since that is more than my old unit had on high..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaint about position of release button:  I have big hands but yours have to be Hugh to hit this button while holding the activation button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaint about the length of the hose:  When using the unit I lean over the sink bowl.  It would be very messy if I stood straight up while using the unit.  It is neat that the hose fits right back into the base so that I do not have hose all over my vanity.  It is bad enough that the electrical wire is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost did not buy this unit because of the bad reviews I read.  I am happy I did not listen to the reviews and purchased the unit.  I knew if it was as bad as the reviews I could always return it to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally pleased with my new Waterpik.  The only question left is if it lasts longer than some of the complaints stated.  I have had the unit for 6 weeks and it sounds and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it falters I will be sure to come back and re-rate it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two weeks and I can confirm that it does floss my teeth very well.  After using the unit and then the wire floss I noted there was nothing visible on the wire floss.  I wont be giving up on flossing with the string, I&#x27;ll use the string at least twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously at this point I can&#x27;t attest to all the things Waterpik says the Waterpik flosser does, as it&#x27;s only been two weeks since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Maybe in a few months when I do visit my dentist I will get a definitive answer that the Waterpik really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I will have to return the unit because after 2 weeks of using it the button that stops the flow of water has been sticking and has become quite irritating.  Except for this issue, I have no other problems with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted Waterpik and they will be sending me a new handle, I am optimistic that new handle wont have the same defect as the old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 8/12/13 - I was annoyed that I had to wait 7-14 days on Waterpik to send my replacement handle in a timely manner and as such, I contacted Amazon and as usual, they provided great customer service and sent me a replacement Waterpik via one day shipping.  I received the replacement last week and it&#x27;s working just great.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this at Walmart and when it worked, I loved it as it would clean my teeth better than any flossing.  However, it only worked occasionally as often there was no water-flow so I exchanged it for a different cheaper model that I didn&#x27;t like as it has less water force and was very noisy.  I bought another Water Pic (no model number but looks just like the Ultra)  and it didn&#x27;t work at all and I returned it the next day.  I wanted one so bad, I tried this model a third time from Walgreens but still had to return it as the water would not flow.  I would like to get the $10 online savings but afraid of a repeat experience and am looking into \\&quot;HydroFloss\\&quot; or the \\&quot;Ocean Breeze\\&quot; I have seen some people mention in the reviews.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, dental tool storage is  nicely organized.  The only drawback is there could be more motor power, have my setting on \\&quot;10\\&quot;.  My next teeth cleaning appointment will tell whether or not it has done the job.</li>
    <li> I had my old water pik for YEARS and it finally developed a hole in the hose so I was forced to buy another.  But I love this new version.  It is lighter, quieter and looks like a Star Wars storm trooper.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my parents because they both recently had implants, so they gums were too sensitive to be brushed both physically (any contact with the toothbrush would have them wince) and chemically (toothpaste can be pretty lethal stuff in large doses, mind you). They loved it! It&#x27;s worth all the money I paid for, and more. They wanted to buy another set they can leave at the restaurant, but being technologically impaired as most older folks are, they didn&#x27;t know how to purchase it online and bought a cheaper version for $20. And of course, it didn&#x27;t even compare to this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s both gentle, but strong enough to be a sort of replacement for brushing, almost (for them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents are in their late 50&#x27;s, early 60&#x27;s, and they&#x27;ve always preferred gifts that are more practical than sentimental. I would definitely purchase another set for myself later on in the future when I&#x27;m done moving in!</li>
    <li> My gums were bleeding at times and I thought I would give the Waterpik a try.  It eliminated that problem if you use it regularly.  Sometimes I get busy (or lazy) and skip it, then skip again.....and pretty soon my gums bleed again.  Used daily, though, it solved the problem.  Your teeth feel so clean after use, and you can even see food particles washing into the sink after you have already brushed your teeth.  I really think it replaces flossing, with better results.  The unit is small, easy to use, and isn&#x27;t as messy as I thought it would be.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good useful product that completely replaces flossing. Easy to use. I use it everyday and I love it. I haven&#x27;t seen water leakage after two months&#x27; use, and I hope it&#x27;ll last long.</li>
    <li> Me periodontist recommended this and after several months both the periodontist and my dentist were very impressed with the results.  I only wish I had been using one years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad is that some time ago the handle started leaking during use, which wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal, but the on/off switch on the handle began sticking in the closed position.  Finally it froze shut and the unit never worked again, so I got six months use out of it.  As poorly made as the product appears to be, it&#x27;s still cheaper to buy a new one every six months, than to pay more periodontist and dentist bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here it is over a year later and I&#x27;m on my second Waterpik. It failed too and at the same place -- the on/off button on the handle.  I keep some needle nose pliers handy to pry it out when it gets stuck but mostly I simply don&#x27;t use it and just keep it set to on.  Waterpik is most definitely a piece of junk.  If you&#x27;re thinking of buying one, I&#x27;d look around for another make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s more on the Waterpic. I&#x27;m now finished with yet another Waterpic which makes 3 or 4 in the last several years. My latest one stopped working a few days ago. This time I didn&#x27;t use the button on the handle which seems to be were the failure is, but it failed anyway after just five months. There&#x27;s a small rubber valve on the bottom of the tank and one that matches it on top of the body and the water is supposed to pass through these two valves and then pumped through the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the failure is on the valve on top of the body which is no longer letting water in and also contributing to flooding from under the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael</li>
    <li> I had a personal waterpik for years, one of the original small models. Had to replace the tubing once, but other than that it kept chugging along with no problems, and probably would have outlasted me, if it were not for the loud noise it was making. I got used to it -- for my money, I&#x27;ll take having healthy gums over a little annoyance like this any time, but when I saw someone on Amazon to mention that this model is unusually quiet, I decided to retire my old one and give this one a try. A discount from Amazon plus free shipping helped to decide too, of course.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for couple of months now, at least once a day, and so far, I love it! It is indeed very quiet, and with no trade offs in pump performance that I could tell. One other very useful new feature is that the nozzle can be rotated. The rotator wheel is on the handle just where your fingers are, so you can use it easily with the same hand, instead of having to twist your neck and/or the tubing, the most fragile component of the system. Just turn the nozzle where you want to be in your mouth. When done, the tubing coils itself in in its little niche with no effort. There a little button on the handle that releases the nozzle that actually works. There is also another button on the handle that can be used to pause water flow, but I&#x27;m not sure how useful that feature is, because it does not pause the pump, just block water flow, causing minor shaking and racket. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Among other things to like about it is a small footprint and a transparent water container. The container comes with a cover, so that you can leave it with water in and not worry about some junk and stuff getting in and ending up in your mouth. I wish the container was a lighter shade of blue, but you can still see through, so you don&#x27;t run out of water. It&#x27;s probably not good for the pump to run dry.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are also all kinds of extra different nozzle types. I haven&#x27;t used them, so I can&#x27;t comment on them,except to note the way they are tucked in inside the container&#x27;s cover until you need them, rather than sent in in a plastic bag, with you having to put them somewhere, and then remember where to find them when needed. What you get does not include the waterpik&#x27;s new sinus irrigation nozzle, and that is simply because it does not fit this model&#x27;s handle. I&#x27;d guess pretty soon they will be making one for this model too, but not now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And finally, it&#x27;s just very pleasing to look at. I saw other reviewers nitpicking on this and that not to their liking. Not that I disagree, but come on, nothing is perfect. I also saw others reporting problems like water leaking out. Can&#x27;t substantiate any of them. If you have such a problem, it&#x27;s not an inherent problem. Must be a defective gasket somewhere that just needs to be replaced under warranty. Overall, it&#x27;s just a great little appliance. Do yourself a favor and get one.</li>
    <li> it don&#x27;t get any better than this, this is my second product in five years, super powerful will cut your gums at full power if your not careful</li>
    <li> Works great. No issues. Easy to clean. Lots of attachments but I just use one. I haven&#x27;t had any issues since I purchased it a few months ago.</li>
    <li> So this product takes a little while to get used to. The first time I tried when I was done it looked like a shaggy wet dog had shook himself all over my bathroom! But now I&#x27;ve gotten much better after a few weeks of use and can contain the spray. My dentist was very happy I bought this and suggested to string floss, then brush, then waterpik and there should be almost nothing left on or in your teeth! Works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item about a month and have been very happy with the purchase.  I use my waterpik just about every day and it really gets the tiny stuff, that gets jammed in with dental floss, out.  I haven&#x27;t had any leaking problems. The instructions say to make sure the attachment is flush, with no gaps, against the wand.  There is a tiny gap and there is no other way to put it on but it doesn&#x27;t leak. You do have to put your head down in the sink because you do have all this water squirting out your mouth. That&#x27;s the whole idea right?  I like the setting from 1 to 10 that lets me control the force of the jet stream.  So far I&#x27;m very happy with mine and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS UNIT F/MY HUSBAND AND HE IS VERY PLEASED.  IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AND WORKS WELL.  HE REVIEWED THE ONLINE VIDEO ON THE HOW-TO&#x27;S WHICH MADE IT EASIER TO USE.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I got braces and it works wonderfully.  I even took it on vacation. Cord retracts easily.</li>
    <li> Strength of the water flow wasn&#x27;t as strong as I like but other than that it gets the job done</li>
    <li> THE WATERPIK IS EASY TO USE, COMPACT IN SIZE, AND POWERFUL IN REMOVING DEBRIS FROM YOUR TEETH AND GUMS. FLOSSING BECOMES A TRUE SPA EXPERIENCE! IF YOU ABSOLUTELY DETEST THE TEDIOUS TASK OF THREAD FLOSSING, YOU WILL LOVE THE WATERPIK. WATERPIK MAKES FLOSSING FAST AND FUN! THIS COMPACT MODEL OFFERS A VARIETY OF WATER PRESSURE. A GREAT ORAL MASSAGER- WATERPIK MODEL WW100</li>
    <li> After several years of good service my old Waterpik just stopped working. I was expecting to get basically the same unit. I bought the New Professional Ultra and WOW it is so much nicer than I expected. It is smaller, quieter along with looking and working better. I highly recommend this WaterPik.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these.  One for a gift and one for myself.  We both love them.  We haven&#x27;t had any of the problems others mentioned.  I had never used one before.  The directions are very simple and the item is also uncomplicated.  I also like the compact design.  I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone wouldn&#x27;t benefit from the use of this.</li>
    <li> For $50 you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Does a good job cleaning in between teeth, but it can be a tad loud when dialed up to 10.    My only complaint is that the hold button gets stuck a lot after three years of use making it difficult to operate.</li>
    <li> I debated on ordering this because I did not want to spend the money.  Now all I can say is...IT IS AMAZING!  It feels so good on my gums and my teeth feel so clean.  It is easy to use and so much easier than flossing.  It also feels like it does a far better job.  If you are debating weather or not it is worth it defiantly give it a try. I wish I would have had a water pick sooner.  I may have avoided some of my dental work.  What is $46 dollars compared to paying for just one filling. I will have all my kids use these when they are a little older( They are babies).  I feel like I have been missing out on water picks! I can not compare to any other brands or models but if you have not had one before I can say you will be more than impressed.</li>
    <li> There are three kids in our family with braces, we got this water pick and none of them got cavities or any kind of problems with their teeth ever again.</li>
    <li> Use with new bridge work, Very easy to use, Lots of tips. Great for cleaning and care of all teeth,</li>
    <li> Very simple review......This Waterpik is the best investment I&#x27;ve made in years....I use it every chance I get.  It does a GREAT job cleaning and feels wondeful.....BUY ONE NOW!!!  As Tony the Tiger would say..\\&quot;It&#x27;s GRRRRRRRRRRRREAT!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> All the benefits of flossing with less effort.  Works great for my daughter with braces.  It is powerful and effective,</li>
    <li> I really recommend this Water Pic.  It is easy to use, not very noisy, and very compact. It has plenty of room in the reservoir for enough water, and it really does a great job, in cleaning between teeth.  I am very glad I chose this product, and the price was right.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I hesitated to buy from Amazon.  I was concerned that if I received a defective Water Pik the return process would be a major hassle.  There was a $10 off coupon so I took a chance. As it turned out the first Water Pik I received had an on-off switch stuck in the off position.  I went through the return dialog, and because I chose \\&quot;defective\\&quot; as my reason for the return, I was given the opportunity to choose between a refund and replacement, and to print out a postage-paid return label.  I chose a replacement, which arrived in just a few days.  I was warned that if I didn&#x27;t return the defective item within 30 days I would be charged (seems reasonable to me).  I just received an email confirmation that Amazon received the return.  Five Stars for the shopping experience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the Water Pik, I give a functioning one 5 stars, so I figure the average is 3 stars.  It&#x27;s quieter than the older models, the lid holds all the attachments (well I didn&#x27;t try to put the tongue cleaners in, but the diagram shows how to do so), and there&#x27;s more than enough power.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I wish I purchased it several years ago.</li>
    <li> I have used several others and this one is by far the best yet. Easy to operate and use.</li>
    <li> I used to own a WaterPik back in the early 90&#x27;s.  I quit using it because it was too noisy and vibrated too loudly, was not gentle enough on my sensitive gums, I could not pause the stream of water and thus had water going everywhere when I had to spit out what was already in my mouth, made a mess, etc.  I decided to try this newer model because the benefits of a water pik (it does clean between your teeth, let&#x27;s face it) are endless.  This new and improved model is just that....new and IMPROVED.  It is less noisy, gentler on my gums as I can better choose the intensity of the stream, AND it has a PAUSE BUTTON which allows me to get rid of the water in my mouth before continuing to clean.  All in all, it makes less noise and less mess.  Moreover, the different tips included are wonderful.  I use the one with the rubber tip as it does a good job directing water between my teeth which are spaced closely together.  I give this newer model 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I replaced a twenty five year old waterpic with a new generation machine only to discover that they leak, customer service is poor, and two replacements lasted about six months each before leaking. Tired of the cost and hassle of returning bad units to water pic I found a setup that hooks up to your shower head. It&#x27;s cheaper ($30) and extremely reliable and has a wide range of pressure settings. The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t pulse. I got it at Amazon and highly recommend it over any waterpic product.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit after reading a number of reviews on Amazon. It performs as described, i.e. very well. The retractable cord is a good touch and the adjustable dial lets you control the force. Most importantly, it cleans between my teeth very effectively and I like using the water pik much more than flossing (my dentist recommended I get a water pik). The unit doesn&#x27;t leak and has a small enough footprint so that it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the sink. &lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I do not like to floss. The Waterpik WP-100 does a better job than floss and is much more convenient. One of the great features of this model is the pause button on the hand held device. This allows you to pause the flow of water without having to turn it off while cleaning your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great dental aid for those who do not like to floss. My hygienist highly recommends this product as well.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. SO glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don&#x27;t leave water in it, it won&#x27;t leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don&#x27;t fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it&#x27;s very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it&#x27;s not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there&#x27;s the compact size trade-off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I&#x27;ve found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good performance at a good price -- can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> This is the first WaterPik product I&#x27;ve ever owned and now I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t buy one of these years ago! The water flosser works a lot better than conventional flossing. Also, the reservoir allows me to add flouride to the water so now I can help my gums while I&#x27;m flossing!</li>
    <li> Top notch appliance. Bought my wife the rechargeable type and this one is way more effective. The variable pressure is a must feature. If you want the best and most effective method of water flossing, next to the dentist&#x27;s office, this machine is it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpik units for years and the Ultra Dental Water Jet is by far the best one on the market. The quality and function are number one. The storage of the pik is very well designed. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My father had such bad gingivitis that he had some of his gums removed. This man was a diligent flosser and brusher. It was genetic. My mother&#x27;s side also had issues. So I was left with a probable destiny of dental horror.    About 6 years ago, in my early 40s, after my dentist started to discover the deepening pockets in my gums, it seemed I was going to end up in the same situation as my parents. The hygenist made an off-hand remark about using a Waterpik and a little mouth wash on my gums. I questioned him more about it. It seemed common sensical, and I was willing to try it.    Lo and behold within 6 months, the pockets stopped deepening. Within a year, instead of visiting the dentist every 3 months, because my gums were now looking so healthy, they said I only needed to visit every 6 months.    Years later, every visit, they don&#x27;t even pay much attention to my gums, other than to say they are healthy.    Wow. I can&#x27;t say enough for this practice of irrigating your gums.    It&#x27;s common sense: Bacteria live in the gum line, and if you don&#x27;t eradicate, eventually they&#x27;ll take root, and root out your teeth in the process. Blast the area with water and mouthwash, and a little hydrogen peroxide, regularly (at first I did it every day, then I backed off as they got better; now only a couple times a week), and the bacteria cannot grow, cannot take root, and your gums will start healing and becoming pink and healthy.    I think this practice would eradicate gum disease, for the most part. But it takes some dedication; but what of value doesn&#x27;t?    As far as this Waterpik unit, it provides the strongest blast of the units I have tried over the years. My wife has the Interplak, which seems to work fine, but it doesn&#x27;t have the strength of this Waterpik.    My only nit with the Waterpik is longevity. They last a couple years, then something goes wrong. But for dental health, particularly reversing and holding at bay - even healing - gingivitis, the cost is nothing.</li>
    <li> My kids and I love this. Our teeth are alot cleaner with the Waterpik than just flossing. My daughter has braces and this is excellent for cleaning the teeth. I love this Waterpik and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am not ashamed to admit that I need to take better care of my teeth. While I brush and use mouthwash frequently, I hate hate HATE to floss, it just doesn&#x27;t sit right with me. Of course, this results in my gums stinging a fair amount and the dis-approving lectures from my dentist everytime I go for a cleaning/exam.     After one of those visits, the hygenist he had there recommended a water pik if I didn&#x27;t like flossing, she mentioned they work just as well as flossing and they&#x27;re less of a hassle as well.       Well lo and behold there was credence behind her words. I initially used the cordless version of the Waterpik and while it did do an admirable job of cleaning, the small reservoir and the pump&#x27;s dislike of adding mouthwash/rinses to the chamber was a source of quite a bit of frustration on my part. It ended up futzing out after about half a year.     I decided to upgrade to this version since it had the larger reservoir and the extra tips. I also didn&#x27;t mind that it wasn&#x27;t cordless, my countertop is more than adequate to hold it next to my electric toothbrush. I should note however that the connector hose is rather stiff and doesn&#x27;t have a very long reach. Extend it carefully as it doesn&#x27;t like to bend very much.     I&#x27;ve been using this puppy every evening for the past month or so and I notice a marked improvement in my gum-line. They&#x27;re stinging almost not at all and the initial bleeding has stopped as well. I found that adding mouthwash directly to the water does a great job of cleaning out the gunk that&#x27;s accumulated between my gums and certainly leaves them feeling clean and pink.     I should advise that after about level 7 in the pressure dial (it goes up to 10), it really starts to shoot pretty darn hard. Even after using it for a while at level 7, when I switched to level 9, the pressure significantly increased to the point my gums started bleeding again and got quite sore after a few sessions. They&#x27;ve subsided since then, but it should be noted above level 7, it feels like you&#x27;re using a pressure washer on your teeth, so increase the pressure gradually so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums in the process.     All in all, a fantastic product. I&#x27;d say the only downside is that the pumping mechanism is rather loud, but so was the cordless version, so I guess it&#x27;s the nature of the pump that generates the noise, but it should be noted nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I have been using almost a year which was a very satisfying result with the better gum health and clean floss feel . This product has a 3 year warranty. However, the product started leaking through valve in the connector area on the handle so even with full power of 10, water pressure from the tip was a mere rinsing.  Stop button on the handle was also a problem as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have not contacted Waterpik yet and hopefully they will either guide me to fix it or replace the flosser.</li>
    <li> I just got my first water pic,I never had any idea how much food would be washed out of my mouth even after brushing,it works great,t comes with several different attachments from which you may choose to suit you,I bought it on the advice from my dentist as I could not use dental floss,if you don&#x27;t have one , go get one.</li>
    <li> Order placed over a month ago has not arrived despite several emails.&lt;br /&gt;I ve used my old one for several years and found it great for dental health.  Removes what my toothbrush misses!</li>
    <li> I have gum issues..My dentist strongly recommended this product and I went right to Amazon and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I schedule visits to my dental hygienist four times a year.&lt;br /&gt;The improvement in my gums over these past three months of using this product has been sensational ! I started at the lowest speed and worked my way up to #6 speed now.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the improvement in my gums and my dental hygienist was thrilled with my improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The product is flawlwss in design and efficacy..Not too noisy or cumbersome. There simply is nothing negative to report. To the contrary, this product is superb !&lt;br /&gt;A five star product in all respects.</li>
    <li> Insist to use, the effect is very good, big noise, the brush head matching complete, the late high cost of replacement。</li>
    <li> Really like this new pik &amp; especially all the attachements.  The only con is that my trusty old pik had a larger capacity reservior where as the new pik needs to be refilled at least once or even twice to do a thorough cleaning.  Very happy with it otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik&#x27;s most of my life with very good results.  I am 72 years of age and my gums and teeth are still \\&quot;hanging on.\\&quot;  I think my regular use of a Waterpik has helped my teeth and gums stay healthy.   &lt;br /&gt;This new model is quieter than the old one I had.  It does a good, steady job of pulsating, getting any small particles out of the teeth. &lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have is the top storage lid that covers the water container is not as easy to use as older models that hold the pics in the base. Its functions work great.</li>
    <li> If you value your gums and teeth at all, this a a device that you should get. It comes with all the attachments so there is nothing else to buy. Works as advertised, and my periodontist has already indicated my gums are getting much better. Also, you feel better after using it, as your mouth is totally fresh. Love this device.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit needing to clear any food matter remaining between my teeth after brushing and the unit is doing just that. The only thing that I believe is negative is the plastic cable that the pique is attached to as it can acquire a slit and cannot be replaced causing one to have to purchase a new unit which would be much more expnsive than replacing the cable.</li>
    <li> I was perfectly happy with this product until it stopped working on me after 3 weeks of use. There is no water damage, still is in perfect condition. I am totally perplexed as to why this happened.</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve in getting the hang of it. Once accustomed to it, it does a great job of cleaning the teeth and gums.The Ultra model is an improvement on the older model.Definitely a better made product.It does a good job for its intended purpose. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was the first I&#x27;ve have bought in about 10 years ...it is terrific.  Big improvement over the one I replaced.  It&#x27;s nice that is smaller too making it fit on the sink better.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> It was much better than the older Waterpik I had used for many years.  My wife likes it better because I don&#x27;t make as much noise with this one.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been after me for the last six months to get a waterpik.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  I could not believe how much was being left behind with just brushing alone.  I have ordered another for a gift.</li>
    <li> My dental office actually recommened this particular waterpik and suggested I purchase thru Amazon.  A great value for the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I bought this item.  I love the water pressure settings &amp; it holds more water than my last Waterpik.  This makes flossing so much easier and is more effective.  I agree that the water hose could be longer yet it coils right back into the holder and looks tidy.  It came with so many attachment heads I haven&#x27;t tried yet.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been in the market for a water flosser for a while.  We tried the one that hooks up to the sink, but my sink wasn&#x27;t compatible.  I chose this one next, I figured 4000 people and over 4 starts, it had to be great.  Um, its great at watering the countertop.  The first day we used it, we left the house only to return to water all over the cabinet and floor because the housing leaked.  I figured I didn&#x27;t put it together right, but after multiple attempts we&#x27;ve resigned to just emptying it when we are done using it. After reading other 1 star reviews, we see that it might start springing water from the handle as well....but the kids want to wait it out because they like using it.  So...its functional currently (we are only a week in) just doesn&#x27;t hold water.</li>
    <li> I love this design!  It&#x27;s clever, small and easy to use.  So much easier on my hands than flossing.  Because of its ease of use, I clean my gums more often than when I was flossing...</li>
    <li> The waterpik W-100 is easy to use ,provides a wide range of stimulating water pressure , hold enough water to get the job done &amp; stores easily for daily use !</li>
    <li> After receiving the Waterpik W-100 (on/off toggle switch didn&#x27;t work) and notifying Amazon.com, they quickly replaced it before I had a chance to ship the defective one back. Having owned an older Waterpik which took up space on our vanity, the Waterpik W-100 had a smaller footprint which is why we purchased it. The Waterpik does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, but I wish it were quieter.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Great attachments. Holds alot of water, not like the cheaper ones that run out mid-brushing.</li>
    <li> I like the jet tip and how it get debri out of the spaces between the teeth. It also stimulates the gum line. You can control the pressure very easily. Everything works.    I floss a lot. Yet, no matter how much I floss before using the Waterpik 100 Ultra Dental, I ALWAYS get more trapped particles out.    Great Product. I look forward to using it. Along with my Oral B and Listerene Gargel, I am considerably Healthier in the Oral Hygene area.    RRB</li>
    <li> I love this product! It was just what I needed. It gets a lot of what my toothbrush misses. I also have braces and it helps keep my white bands and my teeth whiter by them being more clean.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  It has been a great help in removing tonsil stones and I use it everyday.  I was not a religious flosser so this is making up for it.  It&#x27;s a little loud a little messy but it has done wonders for my mouth and teeth.</li>
    <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t believe it when \\&quot;supposedly\\&quot;, \\&quot;there would be a remarkable difference within 14 days.\\&quot;  This was stated in the manual issued by Waterpik.  Well, they were wrong!  It took 10 days and there definitely was an outstanding difference!    A little more than 2 weeks after I purchased the Waterpik, I had an appointment with my Periodontist.  She couldn&#x27;t get over the remarkable change.  Instead of a great deal of bleeding &amp; unhealthy looking gums, I had virtually no bleeding and much healthier looking gums.      I definitely would reccommend this product.  It was a world of difference for me.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased a \\&quot;brand X\\&quot; water pick from Wallmart to replace my old brand name Waterpik and it was a nightmare.  Very poorly made, barely functioned and impossible to clean.  I was happy to see this on Amazon at such a reasonable price.  My dentist recomended this product.</li>
    <li> My old Waterpik was so loud and the base shook so violently that it kinda&#x27; reminded me of a jackhammer.  This new version is FANTASTIC!  It&#x27;s so nice and quiet, doesn&#x27;t shake, and has all these neat new attachments.  Here are some other great features: the top of the handle rotates so it&#x27;s easier directing the water stream, there&#x27;s a covered storage tray for the attachments, and there&#x27;s a pause button on the handle.  By the way, I&#x27;m a comparison shopper: WalMart&#x27;s price for this model at the time was $59.99 in-store.  I saved around $15 by buying it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  We use it every night after we brush our teeth with an electric Oral B toothbrush.  It is amazing how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; it still cleans out after a thorough brushing.  I did have a leak where the plastic tube connects to the unit. I removed the tube, but a small drop of superglue on the connector and pushed the tube back onto it and it no longer leaks and we have used it for over a year.</li>
    <li> The variable pressure control on this unit makes it worth the extra cost.  The tank holds PLENTY for one use (you probably want to fill the tank before each use anyway, because otherwise the water will be rather cold and uncomfortable if your teeth have any cold sensitivity).  The hose is pre-coiled and easily snaps back into place for storage.  I didn&#x27;t think this would really work, but it&#x27;s magic. The pressure is plenty strong - I have never used it at the max setting.  I use about 80% and I would not want to try it any stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used the extra nozzles, and I don&#x27;t see a lot of value there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you find my review helpful, please \\&quot;like\\&quot; it. Thanks.)</li>
    <li> the water pressure on high just slides through the teeth and cleans remarkably well. just before bedtime and better breath in the morning.</li>
    <li> It is quiet compared to the personal dental water jet and has more attachments.  Also does a great job cleaning the gum line and between teeth.</li>
    <li> I find this water pick does everything it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now.    A couple tips:    If you let the hose hang on something hard, that contact will make more noise. The way my machine is set near my sink, it needs to rub on the sink. I placed a washcloth between the hose and the sink and the noise was reduced significantly.    As another reviewer suggested, keep a glass of water next to the Waterpik and filling it when it gets near empty. This will allow you to quickly fill it if you want more time than one filling requires (I do).    Yes, water will drain out of the tip when the machine is off if you have the tip lower than the machine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It does the job.  The price was right.  Shipping was fast - as always.  I would highly recommend this product for purchase.</li>
    <li> The water pik had added features such as a swivel head. This allows for a more through cleaning. A feature that were not expecting. All and all we were pleased with the product with the sleek design and the explosive , quiet power in such a small unit.</li>
    <li> A very good waterpik, much better than our old one. Very good design, quiet, powerful, and convenient.</li>
    <li> good no issues so far. makes little sound but that&#x27;s fine. I suggest this product. worth for money. I rate 4 for this</li>
    <li> A tremendous device.  I look forward to using it every day. I don&#x27;t know how I got by before. All the attachments are great.</li>
    <li> What a difference this makes in teeth/mouth are. The attachments are fantastic and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks (after mouth surgery) and find everything healing much faster than anticipated .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have one!</li>
    <li> I love my Waterpk Ultra Water Flosser.  my teeth feel so much cleaner and I do not understand why dentists do not recommend this product.  After I brush my teeth (and scrub really well), I can actually see some of the tiny food particles that it removes so I know my toothbrush is not getting everything.  No wonder I have so many problems with cavities.</li>
    <li> Ok, I never had braces before until April of this year (2011). I had never heard of a Waterpik before but I don&#x27;t know how I would live without it now! It gets rid of food that&#x27;s stick in between all the nooks and crannys of braces. With this, I practically eat anything I want without restricting myself. I still have common sense and stay away from taffy, popcorn, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*But* I called my dentist and they specifically told me that this SHOULD NOT REPLACE FLOSSING. So I still floss once a day but use this after each meal. Then I brush with my Oral B Floss Action toothbrush (which I will review next). I promise you, the Waterpik will make your life in braces a heck of a lot easier. Trust me.</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous product! It cleans out the stuff that mere flossing leaves behind and is simple to use.  I am sure my dentist will be impressed by the condition of my gums and teeth as a result of the Water Pik use!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik is a great item.  It works well and is easy to use.  The price on Amazon is very good compared to local stores.  If you buy, get the extra tips since there is only one set with the unit and they are not stocked in many stores that sell the unit.</li>
    <li> I purchased a cordless waterpik for my mom about a year ago. However, she was not very happy with it and she kept telling me the problems that she had when she use the cordless. Until last month, her cordless one broke and she told me she wants a regular one.  The next day she receieved this one, she called and told me that she is soooo happy with this one. She said it is very easy to use when compared to the cordless one. Water tank is big enough, no need to refill water in the middle of cleaning.   She said this unit is small which does not used up lots of counter space. The cord goes back to the slot that it supposed to be in easily. No mess. The switch of adjusting the strength of water is also a plus. She falls in love with this new device and she wants me to write a very good review on this product for her!  Hope her comment helps!</li>
    <li> Cheap and effective tool.  If you use this product after every meal you will feel better and pay fewer dentist bills.  You will be amazed at the material this device will remove from your mouth.  While it does not completely replace the need for flossing it takes cleansing to a new level.  It took me a while to get used to the device, but once you master a few details (how to prevent splashing and the setting level you need) you will be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Compact  Easy  to use.  Gums are stimulatef.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Painless to clean in between your teeth compare to traditional flossing.  I have been using this for about almost a month and I can feel my gums improve!  I am very happy with this purchase and urge people to get it if you have gum problems, or if you are just too lazy to floss.  90 seconds twice a day is all you need.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I get a Waterpik so I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price (and I trust their purchase dept).  Great product and price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.    I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn&#x27;t cutting it.    I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I&#x27;m still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn&#x27;t strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.    I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I&#x27;m getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.    My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)     Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I&#x27;m refilling it. If I&#x27;m careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.    So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn&#x27;t sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I&#x27;d have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)     Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN&#x27;T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn&#x27;t want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)    The dentist HADN&#x27;T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!</li>
    <li> The WP-100 is the best Waterpik yet. The jets are strong and it has adjustable settings for the pressure - it certainly has enough force to clean out anything you may have stuck between your teeth and gums. The noise level is minimal and the extra reservoirs are stored in a compartment that doubles as the cap. I bought it about 5 months ago and it still works great. It seems to be very well built and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the compactness of this waterpik.  I had the larger one and this one is far more convenient.  You don&#x27;t have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model.  Granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but I just keep another cup ready to refill it while I am still using the pik.  It is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has.  I most often use a salt &amp; warm water solution and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks. It is quiet, powerful. I just need to adjust the power to 3 of 10 which is strong enough.    In the future, I&#x27;d like to compare it with Showerpik, Redipik and Quickpik etc. which do not need electricity.</li>
    <li> Got this Water Pik and it was an instant hit.  The entire family started using it immediately.  It took the kids a few tries to get the hang of it , and the bathroom was soaked, but look at the bright side, less money on dental bills!&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would come with more regualr piks, (although I think you can get them) and the tooth brush attachement and tongue scaper are not necessary.  I like it turned up hight, but the kids are happy to use it at a lower setting.  It is a good addition to a healthy dental routine of brushing and flossing.  I wish everyone would take care of their teeth so I don&#x27;t have to endure their stink breath!</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you wear braces. Very easy to use, just fill it up and turn on the switch. I like the neat compartment on the lid that holds the various spayers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a waterpik for many years now including the time I had braces.  I think this machine is indispensible for cleaning your teeth.  At my last regular cleaning a couple of months ago, the oral hygenist gave me raving reviews.  He told me \\&quot;I knew you had to be using something because there&#x27;s no way your teeth could be this clean.\\&quot;    No cavities.  No tartar.    So I hear that the quality has gone down or is not that great.  I purchased this new model about 9 months ago and it&#x27;s still working as good as new.  I discarded my old one after the plastic water hose got brittle and broke into pieces.  I just decided to discard it and buy this new one which is quieter and has more features.  In any case, the way I feel, if these units only lasted for one year, even six months, it would still be worth buying.  We only have one set of permanent teeth (well, most of us do)!    If you&#x27;ve never used one, try it.</li>
    <li> Helps clean my teeth without all the bleeding of flossing. Within one week, no more bleeding. Great tool for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who now is wearing spacers.  It is an excellent item to remove the food that gets wedged in under the device at the top of her mouth.  It works much better than the pipe cleaners that the dentist gives you!  The water pressure is adjustable and the higher settings are pretty forceful.  It is a very handy product.  The one major design flaw with this item (and all water jet devices that I can tell) is that you have to press the button to stop the water flow.  It should be the other way around.  It would be so much easier to press the button when you are ready for the water to shoot out.  You have to handle the wand with care and constantly depress the button otherwise you have water shooting everywhere in the bathroom.  After a while, your finger gets tired of holding down a button, positioning a child in your lap, spreading the towel out, and then aiming!  Again...a great product with a major design flaw.</li>
    <li> I had never used a Waterpik but after a freind as well as my dentist recommended it, I tried it. I am delighted with the way it dislodges tiny food articles that I never thought could be there, even after I had brushed thoroughly. BUT, there is one thing that I consider a design flaw. There is a button on the handle that you push in order to turn off the stream of water. The problem is that there is a natural tendency to push the button to turn it on, not off. So, even though you think about what you are doing, if you accidentally let up on the button while the pik is out of your mouth, it squirts all over the place. The designers should have reversed it, so that you push the button when you want a jet of water and release it when you want it to stop. However, once you get used to this, the Waterpick works great. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This has been in my home for about 6 months now and I have only good comments about it.  It&#x27;s small &#x27;footprint&#x27; is wonderful since I have a very small counter.  In addition the various settings allow me to adjust to my personl needs.  The water line extends when in use yet curls right back up to store without any effort on my part.  Another wonderful feature, once I remembered to use it regularly, is the dial on the hand piece that rotates the jet tip while you&#x27;re using it.  Overall an absolutely wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> Great path to clean teeth and healthy gums said my dental assistant on my last cleaning.  She was correct, the pik does a great job at removing debris as well as plaque.  Should of had this years ago!</li>
    <li> Recently bought the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  Even after a good brushing, the waterpik will still find food to wash out! The Waterpik works as advertized.  Not complaints at all.  It is my understanding that many people lose their teeth not to tooth decay but to gum disease. Regular use of the Waterpik will no allow this to happen!</li>
    <li> Strengths: Compact size, sleek design, less vibration, and less noise.  Weaknesses: The water jet power can be a little more, and the water tank is also kind of small.  I&#x27;ve had several waterpik products before. The old model is good too, but the size is bigger, and has more noise and vibration. The portable model was the worst. The battery normally died within a year, not a reliable product at all. This new waterpik WP-100 is the best among the old ones. The stylish product is the best compromised products which has a little bit less power and the smaller water tank, but give you the good look, more quiet, and compact size. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 3 months, so far so good. Sometimes you will need more than one tank to clean your teeth, but that&#x27;s not a big deal to refill the water.</li>
    <li> I bought this water pic on the advice of my dental hygenist.  Love it!  It&#x27;s faster than flossing and feels good too.  No more shredding of floss when you hit a rough spot.  After you brush and you think your teeth are clean, then use the water pick.  You can actually see food particles being rinsed out of your mouth.  The only drawback is that the pause button sticks a little.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with this product in every way.   Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> You notice right away the difference of regular flossing than using this product, it does take away particles between teeth and gums that brushing and flossing won&#x27;t take away.    It&#x27;s fun to use, I paid close to $1000 for professional cleaning (I was developing a periodontal problem eventhough I flossed and brushed often), not anymore...    Would recommend to pair it with an electronic toothbrush, it will save you time and money!</li>
    <li> We had an old one (far too long), a big heavy thing. Upgrade to this one, plenty of power (but also adjustable for a delicate tooth), plenty of water, easy to keep clean, and an easy price.  Absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> It´s amazing how much food gets slodged between your teeth. Even after brushing and flossing, the Waterpik stil dislodged some chunks of food. Incredible.</li>
    <li> My dentist prescribed me a water jet device time ago and a had not purchased it yet, finally I decided to buy one and found very good rating and review on the \\&quot;Water Pick Ultar Dental\\&quot; water jet. Now I already have been using it for a month and can not go to bed w/out using it, I love it, it works great I had never felt my mouth so clean before and also is a lot quicker, pleasant and less tedious than flossing. I easily made it part of my daily routine and can&#x27;t live w/out it now.</li>
    <li> When I started using it about two months ago with middle power (5 of 10), my gums were bleeding a lot (my dental had said that it&#x27;s OK). One week later they stopped bleeding at all and I increased power to the max (10 of 10). Now I feel that my gums are more stronger and healthy. The jet power is good enough to clean everything between teeth.     Cons: water tank is too small. I use one for upper teeth then refill it for lower teeth.</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised.  Any problems were because it takes a while to get used to using it.  Practice makes perfect!</li>
    <li> I like the new design a lot better than the previous models, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of them since they don&#x27;t last more than a few years.  I noticed that they are selling replacement hoses and I hope it works on this model so I can hopefully replace the hose when it breaks (and it will).  I use my Waterpiks twice a day and the average life of them is a couple to three years.  They do what they say they&#x27;ll do and remove junk flossing alone won&#x27;t.  For the money, it&#x27;s worth it for the gum/teeth health.</li>
    <li> I think it is helpful for my gum, but I am concerned with the sanitation of the product itself. I cannot open the handle or the internal box to clean them, but I suspect these are places where bacteria can easily grow (see other comments). I would expect the design to improve in this aspect.  update 04/30/2016. It was just one year and then the device broke.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!!!  I don&#x27;t know how anyone does without this thing.  I absolutely love it.  My husband also was very relungtant about using it and it is just the best thing in the world.   We are both so impressed with it.</li>
    <li> Just got the Waterpik WP-110. Set it up according to the instructions in the convenient \\&quot;Quick Start Guide\\&quot;, i placed a classic tip into the handle, added water to the tank and started her up.    OK ran the unit, works very nice ,not too noisy, the coil hose is adequate in length, i also like the pause button feature on the handle, my first generation water pik unit did not have that.    Does a nice job of cleaning the gumline, and its fairly easy to use.    BUT, after turning it off, i attempted to remove the tip from the handle [you have to press the release button to make the handle release the tip] BUT THE BUTTON IS JAMMED!!!!!  ugghhhh Made in China what else grrr. the old design waterpik made you place the tip into the handle and screw it down until it was tight. this is some kind of pushbutton type release method.     Now i know why they have this card staring you in the face when you open the box that says STOP! before you return this product to the retailer ,give us a call, we are here to help.\\&quot; !~~~~~~~~~~~    Damn you would think that if they were making a quality product, that card wouldnt be necessary.  So its too late to call now, i have to wait until the morning to call Waterpik corporation. I wonder what they are gonna tell me when i tell them i have a defective product.    I might be returning this thing, will update later.[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]    Next morning i decided to firmly press the release button against the edge of the sink, and the flossing tip popped out, and the release button functions normally now. Weird......  I will contact Waterpik anyway so they can make a note of it on my warranty registration record.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  I use it all the time and it still works great after many months!</li>
    <li> Purchased this when my son had braces.  Worked very well between all the wires, bands, etc.  We also have purchased extra tips for all family members to use.  Really cleans teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> this water flosser cleans the teeth and gums to perfection. Really easy to use and offer a multitude of optional tips. It is the best!</li>
    <li> Just as promised.  Love this product. I was skeptical after reading a few of the reviews, but there was nothing to worry about.  I use this product faithfully and have had no issue.  Power is perfect, no leaks and my gums feel great.</li>
    <li> make sure you have it pointed away from the mirror and your face when you toggle the on switch -- other than that, I have no complaints.  It does a great job and teeth feel really clean.  I got this because I was having trouble with inflammation after getting a bridge.  It solved the problem within a week.</li>
    <li> This water flosser replaces an older model whose seal failed.&lt;br /&gt;I think my toofies will have a blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tolerable footprint on counter&lt;br /&gt;Adequate fluid capacity&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of power&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy unit</li>
    <li> I love the waterpik! Easy to use once you get the hang of it.  I think it really keeps my teeth feeling clean.  I have some crowns so I find thread floss hard to use.  My dentist recommended the waterpik.  My grandfather loves the waterpik.  Hoping for a non-cavity checkup in February!</li>
    <li> Just in case you&#x27;re wondering where and what to buy:    Waterpik prices for the following are $8.99 plus shipping for a pack of 2 of each type.  Amazon prices are about 50% less, but the tips come from different vendors, so the shipping may add up.

    <li> While I had some misgivings about using the Waterpik \\&quot;Ultra Dental Waterjet\\&quot; I will say they were quickly brushed away!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Joking aside, the Waterpik is an effective and powerful way to clean between your teeth. After just week of use I have already noticed that my gums are less sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The price on Amazon can not be beat and creates a great value. I have noticed that brick-and-mortar stores are typically about ten dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;- While the resevoir is not huge - it seems to be about the right size to effectively clean your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;- The retractable hose works very effectively. I wish that could make a garden hose that retracted this well!&lt;br /&gt;- Variable settings - trust me- you probably want to work your way up to highest level... unless you enjoy your gums bleeding!&lt;br /&gt;- A bunch of different instruments come with the device. Not that I need most of them - but again - it is nice that everything is included in one box.&lt;br /&gt;- Will clean jewelry in a pinch. I am kind of surprised that they don&#x27;t use this in their marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas for improvement-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Our bathroom is attahced to the bedroom, and the unit is a little loud. While it is not on the level of a jack hammer - you canhear it in the nex room.&lt;br /&gt;- If you are not careful you will get water EVERYWHERE. Probably not an item that should be used by small children (because of the mess and safety issues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Final score - 5 full stars. I can honestly say that I am fully saitisifed with the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet...even if the name is a little too long!</li>
    <li> I have new braces. It takes 10 - 15 minutes to floss at night, and due to time and frustration have been avoiding flossing during the day, but this left my gums sore, since braces make food get stuck along the gum line and in between teeth. First I brush, and this (the \\&quot;pik\\&quot;) removes the remaining food from my brackets, beneath my braces and in between my teeth. I still feel better flossing afterwards at night, but during the day, this is great! I might not need to floss if my teeth weren&#x27;t so close together, but for tight areas, I would think most people would want to do both, to get out any wedged in food.      I like the pause button feature on the handle. That way you don&#x27;t have water constantly shooting out of your mouth, since you can turn it off and on. It is pretty easy to not spray water all over your bathroom, or yourself, with this feature&#x27;s help. You just press in the button,  to pause, and then move on to the next tooth and release....     I am certain I will continue to use this after the braces come off, to clean in between my teeth and up around the gum-line.</li>
    <li> My DDS recommended this after diagnosing me with an enlarged &#x27;periodontal pocket&#x27;.  This device is excellent and really cleans my gums.  I don&#x27;t use all of the extra attachments, knowing that I might have purchased a less expensive model but it is great.</li>
    <li> I love love love it, my mouth is already healthier!</li>
    <li> My husband needed this for his braces on his teeth.  Works great. Does the job he said.  I thought the price was Great since I saw this product for 10$ more at the store.</li>
    <li> For the price this thing is def worth it.  I never have to floss again.  in the beginning it was a bit difficult as the water pressure was too high.  but after a few tries your gums get used to it and you can continue up&#x27;ing the pressure.  i love the fact that i never have to floss again which i hate to do.    this product is great and the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> Would give a 5 star if I don&#x27;t have to replace the tools which I&#x27;m sure cost a lot, but I do so like this product. I had a really bad gum infection for 2 weeks. Without the waterpik I don&#x27;t think I would have got rid of the infection that was causing me pain and loss of sleep. I use the pocketpik to get into my deep pockets that delivered the diluted hydrogen peroxide and rid the bacteria that caused the infection. Flossing alone will not be enough. My routine is floss, waterpik, then brush or floss, rinse, brush and waterpik depending on the type of food i eat, soft or chewy.  Just make sure you use waterpik daily for thorough cleaning. If you&#x27;re going to be without power, try to eat softer food that won&#x27;t get stuck in your mouth, and floss then rinse before brushing. Try not to poke your pockets or that might cause another infection where your gums are trying to heal. It has been since the 25th of July since I had my gum infection. The dentist recommended I have tooth pulled but I was not ready to go there. I would like to save enough money and go to Washington and see Judy who has been treating patients with a non invasive procedure using a gel and a specialized equipment to heal gums, deep pockets, and regrow bone. Her website is PerioPeak if you like to check it out.    9/4/11    A few days ago I had a recurring gum infection, not sure why, maybe from risky chewing on that side though the gum was not completely healed. I used the rest of the Peridex prescribed to me and put in the waterpik(first time using peridex in the reservoir.)  The next night I used periogen to help minimize plaque build up. I have used periogen several times before. I started noticing stream difference in that it is weaker than before with the pocketpik attachment.  Maybe this was due to the Peridex clogging it, or perhaps my daily use of the pocketpik has made it less productive and in turn I was not getting affective cleaning, so I had to deal with another round of infection until I decided to use the regular attachment and it made quite a difference.  The stream came out strong on low level and I&#x27;m able to rinse with the diluted hydrogen peroxide to rid the infection once again.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised - a great product. Should you try using this on your spouse as a squirt gun, you will also discover that this doubles as the ultimate bathroom weapon.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing! It hurts my gum, I miss spots.. is a pain. My dentist than recommended this particular model (she uses it too). It turned out that I missed more than a few spots. The water jet loosens plaque, cleans in places I didn&#x27;t know I had, and leaves me with a good clean feeling.   Has a bunch of attachments for things to do with your mouth.  I subtracted one star for a small leak mine developed from the start ( my wife&#x27;s is OK).</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by my dentist, it works great removing particles hardly reached by a toothbrush, after one week of use I can see the difference in my gums, clearly the toothbrush cause some damage when you try to remove plaque and debris in hard to reach areas but waterpik make it easy, and I&#x27;m using only the traditional tip,   Definitively if you can afford it, get it.    Amazon have the better price, no other place and you get free shipping.</li>
    <li> A tooth  brush isn&#x27;t enough any more, water pic gets it all off and perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> My teeth are really close together, and flossing was always a pain.  Forcing the floss up in between my teeth, then when it finally went, cuts my gums...  I&#x27;m sure many of you have experienced that. Anyway, I purchased the water flosser and I absolutely love it. It has plenty of pressure, and the water reservoir holds more than enough water to do the job.  All the attachments are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this unit!</li>
    <li> I bought the waterpik because someone recommended it. I was surprised at all the food and junk that came out from between my teeth. Its a great machine. It has different attachments so that multiple users can use the same machine.</li>
    <li> after purchasing a handheld battery op, which i sent back, this is the bomb. Really has a cleaning effect. I use it AFTER brushing so no toothpaste taste lingers. IM still a meat eater and particles stay in there where a brush can not reach. My perio guy says he does not like them tho. Oh well I do. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Glad I got it, but it takes a little time. Allot for at least 5 extra minutes in the a.m. and p.m. Not a replacement for periodontal treatment. Do both.</li>
    <li> I used an Interplak for over 15 years until it just wore out.  I tried the Waterpik based on the reviews and the features.  I have been pleasantly surprised by how well it performs and the ease of operation.  Several points--the tank holds much more than my Interplak and is sufficient to for the entire irrigation process, the OFF/ON toggle switch works well when there is fluid in the tank, but, when the tank is empty, care must be taken to turn it OFF because the entire Waterpik likes to \\&quot;walk\\&quot; because of the decreased weight when you put pressure on the switch.  I found the Waterpik must be fairly close because of the relative short connection between the pik and the tank, however, one learns to work with it.  Overall, a good irrigator and one worth the cost.  I&#x27;m looking to many years of use and would recommend this to any potential buyer.</li>
    <li> The WP-60W is just as powerful and works just as well.  That holds more water and requires fewer refilling.</li>
    <li> Unit working good, two issues, no pressure adjustment and on/off is reverse, you hold the button to stop water.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wish I had one of these years ago when I had all my teeth...At least my kids have a chance to...</li>
    <li> The waterpick is great...I use it all the time and the dentist  said it makes a big difference in the amount of placque on my  teeth. Almost none....it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Recently the on/off switch broke for the Waterpik classic WP-60 that I had used for 4 years.  I considered getting another WP-60 but the actuator for the switch was a very flimsy piece of plastic and I could easily see it breaking soon in a new machine.  I decided to give the new \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; model a try.  So in this review I&#x27;m basically comparing the classic model to the Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Fluid capacity of . . . . Classic: 4.5 cups . . . . Ultra: 2.5 cups&lt;br /&gt;2) Counter Space of . . . .  Classic: 31 sq in . . . . Ultra: 28 sq in&lt;br /&gt;3) Water pressure control for the Classic is on the handle.  For the Ultra, it&#x27;s on the base unit.&lt;br /&gt;4) Water Pressure - the Ultra has slightly less water pressure than the Classic.&lt;br /&gt;5) Noise - The Ultra is quieter than the Classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/of switch on the Ultra is clearly more sturdy than the Classic.  In addition, there is an on/off valve on the handle.  Between the electric switch and the water valve, the control of water flow is greatly improved.  With the Classic, you had to put the water head in your mouth before turning on the water pump, an operation which may require 3 hands.  With the Ultra, you can hold the water valve closed on the handle while you flip the electric switch for the pump, and then put the tip in your mouth and release the valve.  It still requires some amount of dexterity and coordination.  I suspect the people who complain about how messy the WaterPik is are unable to master the simple trick: the tip must remain in your mouth whenever water is flowing through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with only one standard tip, so if you are sharing this WaterPik with others who are fussy about sharing tips, you&#x27;ll need to buy an additional package of standard tips.  I&#x27;ve tried all the other tips that come with this model, and I don&#x27;t see much use for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the decreased fluid capacity of the Ultra.  The 2.5 cups isn&#x27;t quite enough for two complete sessions.  The Ultra countertop footprint is only slightly smaller than the Classic, so making the tank so much smaller was not a good tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Ultra has a lid for the water tank, because I often found drowned bugs in the tank of my Classic with no lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix water and mouthwash in the tank, about 3-to-1 ratio.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody using any WaterPik for the first time needs to start at a low pressure setting, and take about a week to work up to the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use the WaterPik to get garden dirt out of my wedding ring.  It&#x27;s very messy, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: All things considered, if I could get a WP-60 Classic with improved electric switch and a tank lid, I&#x27;d go back to that.lassic, so making the tank so much smaller was not a good tradeoff.

    <li> I recently had braces put on (I am over 40 yrs old) and wondered how I was going to manage flossing as my teeth are very sensitive now.  A friend recommended a water pick.  After reading about 15 different brands I picked the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and I have not been disappointed.  It does a great job and the water dispenser hold plenty of water.  My orthodontist says that my teeth are doing terrific and I am looking forward to a nice straight smile real soon</li>
    <li> Love this waterpik.  Doesn&#x27;t take up much room and works great.  Love that it comes with different types of heads.  Also like the fact that I can replace the hose if and when it needs it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]I have used this product in the past and love it!!  Works great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Waterpik products for 20+ yrs. The build quality - in particular, the &#x27;pump&#x27; isn&#x27;t what it used to be. A very noisy motor doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> After following every instruction I cannot get the Waterpik to stop leaking. I need to keep a towel underneath because the leakage is so pervasive. I do like how it cleans, but it sure is messy.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  I definitely notice the difference with how my teeth \\&quot;feel\\&quot; when I don&#x27;t use the waterpik.  It takes some getting used to initially, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Have been very happy with the Waterpik. Already got an A+ from my dentist after using it just a couple weeks! My gums are definitely healthier! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> dentist recommended this product I ordered it that day and had it in 5days  it is the best product of this kind that I have owned.</li>
    <li> bought this waterpik after purchasing the cordless water pik. the cordless unit waslike a toy noise and poor pressure and not a lot of capacity. the corded unit is much better with more pressure and greater volume.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is doing great job on cleaning between your teeth and the gums. I was hoping to have more nozzles for the family: there are only 2 main and additional special for different tasks which are less usable. Anyway - doing what is expected with no issues yet...</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift.  She loves it!!</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik ultra.  It is easy to use and has many attachments.  I use it at least once a day, sometimes twice, and it amazes me how effective it is.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is a great way to get ALL of the material out of your mouth,and it only takes a few seconds to get the job done.</li>
    <li> The WaterFlosser  stopped working after less than 2 months. Somehow the amazon return window was covering this product for  less than 1 month and a half. So the only option I got is to just throw the flooser away, and stop purchasing through the Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wish I would of started with this 50 years ago.  You can not have good gum and teeth health with out this.  It has made all the difference to me, with a dentist suggesting one for my tight teeth.  Wow, food is always, always trapped in our teeth and this is the only real way to keep them clean.  Flossing, does not get it all, but does scrape down the teeth.  If you use this after flossing, you will probably still find food flushing down the sink.  I keep mine next to the kitchen sink, with out the top for easy fill.  Put it where its most convient for you, and enjoy.  My teeth and gums have never been happier, and you should not have any real problems.  My on off button is sticking a the wand a bit, but a good spray and wash gets it responding again, in case I want the flow to stop when I have it in or out of my mouth.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, &amp; he really likes it.  So much so, he says I also should order one for myself.  His was purchased because he has bridges, &amp; neeeded a more thorough cleaning.  Oh, did it work wonders.  I think I honestly could say you could skip flossing with the Waterpik.  A great investment!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been an avid flosser. Even with that in mind, I&#x27;ve never had an issue with cavities... each time I&#x27;ve visited the dentist I would leave with upset bleeding gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few times I picked up flossing I found it to be very tedious and difficult as my teeth were \\&quot;wedged together\\&quot; in such a way that caused the floss to break. A task that should take two minutes would take about thirty minutes to do properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately i&#x27;ve been having an issue of food getting wedged pretty low, to the point where it would get stuck in my gums, and the gum would become irritated for quite a few days. (And by irritated I mean inflamed and profusely bleeding) Floss would do nothing to get this gunk out. It was under the gum, I read that it was in a \\&quot;gum pocket\\&quot; and the gum was irritated because the food was being dissolved and becoming an acidic hell hole (essentially the beginning stages of gum disease). So yeah, I was concerned, in fact I wanted to see a dentist immediately, but they were booked up until October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend was recently using another water flosser similar to the waterpik, the sonicare air floss and insisted the thing worked great... only, however, after about six months of owning it the thing became clogged. Still, it performed the deed well, so I looked into the water pik to see if it would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the waterpik two weeks ago (today is Aug 21, 2013) and well, I have to say I am very impressed. The first day I had the pressure set on low, and blasted the tender inflamed gum areas. The process of cleaning between teeth with the waterpik was quick and easy. The next day I noticed a significant reduction in inflammation. I continued morning and night, using the rubber lined head option especially designed for gum pockets. The second evening I had the pressure up a bit more, the inflamed gum areas bled, but chunky bloody food came out of the small gum pockets. It was a disturbing site, but my god was it relieving. After my water flossing, the sink housed several chunks of food, I&#x27;m sure their ages varied. The next morning the inflammation had almost completely subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a week later my gums are glorious and no longer red, throbbing, and bleeding. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased the waterpik as I&#x27;m not sure if I would have been able to get that kind of result as quickly without it. I use it day and night, and have the setting on medium and it gets out everything wedged between my teeth and cleanses my gum pockets (really, it&#x27;s not something you hear about, but it&#x27;s important that it can do that! Making sure your gum pockets are washed out and cleansed of developing bacteria will prevent gum disease).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say this is a fantastic product. I let my boyfriend test it out using a different head, and he stated it was good, but the pressure wasn&#x27;t what he was used to and thinks it should be higher. Apparently the sonicare air floss has a higher pressure. I personally think the pressure does it&#x27;s job, even at its lowest setting. My only issue is the waterpik is a bit... loud... and by a bit, I mean, wow! That&#x27;s loud! (apparently this is a lot quieter than what it was, and now I really want to hear what older models sounded like) And the sonicare air floss is certainly a lot quieter... however, the sonicare doesn&#x27;t produce a continuous stream of water, it&#x27;s just a quick blast, so I don&#x27;t believe that it would do as good of a job as thoroughly cleaning between teeth and in gum pockets. In fact, I don&#x27;t believe the sonicare would have been able to give me the quick results the waterpik did - I don&#x27;t think it would have been able to reach down and stream out that food (or blast it out). Oh, also the overall size of the sonicare is also a bit much, and perhaps looking into the cordless version may be of some interest to you! I didn&#x27;t get the cordless purely because it was sold out at Target and I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already traveled withthe waterpik and can say that it&#x27;s not particularly easy (I bought this on my break from college and headed back) but it is doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because without it I would have probably needed to make an emergency visit to a dentist I didn&#x27;t know for a thorough cleaning! And now that I have it, it&#x27;s sure to potentially save me loads of money due to it giving me glorious gums of mightiness (and squeaky clean sides on my teeth). I&#x27;ll update and let you guys know if my gums bled during my routine dental cleaning, because that would genuinely be a feat to behold. (everyone knows how brutal dentists can be when it comes to their flossing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: UPDATE June 10, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dentist for my annual cleaning recently.

    <li> I have used the Waterpik Ultra for about three weeks on a dialy basis. My gums feel really good. When using the Waterpik, you can often see small food particles being flushed from your gums and between your teeth. This is after brushing with a tooth brush. I recommend using the Waterpik to really clean your teeth and prevent gum and teeth problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using Waterpik products for over 45 years and my dentist/hygienist see healthy teeth and gums as a result.  All these machines seem to wear out in 3-6 years. but this one seems better built than the last two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really n love with it, because it sprays all over.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these exact models, one after the other, and both broke within weeks of purchase. This was not from abuse or even changing parts. I kept the same tip on and kept it at the same mid-level setting! Because I did not have time to go to a post office to mail the first one back, I bought another. I have dental pockets and they require constant attention.&lt;br /&gt;  The problem is that after a while the tip just starts to wobble and breaks off. I have gone through 4 tips. Also the handle where the tip is inserted just gives out and begins to leak water. I had the same problem with Water Pik years ago (I went through 3 machines then), but because I like the feeling of clean I get when they work properly, I decided to try the product again recently. I&#x27;m sorry I did.&lt;br /&gt;  It would be wonderful if someone could make a similar product that can be used with mouth wash. The only ones that I see that might not be prone to break, attach directly to the sink spigot. But you can&#x27;t use mouth wash with those can you?</li>
    <li> Our family has used a Waterpik product for years. The Ultra model is by far the best we have ever used.  Buy with confidencde.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is small/compact  but wish it was more powerful.  My old waterpik was too big but flow of water was much stronger.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product as it actually cleans your teeth and massages your gums.  It is not time consuming and your teeth feel like they have just come from the dentist!!  A shower for the mouth!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks for many years. This one is a top-of-line unit.  It&#x27;s quiet and works as advertised. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been a Waterpik user for a few years.  My last model had great water pressure and large water reservoir; but it&#x27;s performance started to decline.    The Ultra comes with a smaller reservoir and the highest pressure setting does not match my previous model.  Waterpik might have perform some studies and found that the pressure is adequate; but the reservoir capacity must increase in the next model.    All in all, it gets the job done and is much quieter than the previous model.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I just got it today and used it for the first time after I ate 4 slices of pizza.  I used the waterpik and tried out the toothbrush tip, jet tip, pik pocket tip and tongue cleaner so far.  The tongue cleaner worked great and cleaned my tongue really well.  The toothbrush is great too, however i think im going to put toothpaste and brush teeth first before i start the waterpik cause it washes most of the toothpaste away, but that&#x27;s my first try and experimenting.  I put some listerine with the water too.  The tip i like the most though and reason why i bought it was because of the pocket pik to get rid of built up food between my teeth from eating. it worked really great.  After everything, I wanted to see if they got all of the food between my teeth so i used floss to see.  I noticed that there was no residue on the floss. It&#x27;s an amazing product! I would recommend it to everyone! It is worth the price for healthy teeth and gums and no gingivitis! :]</li>
    <li> it is valueable.good price and good exprience,i use it everyday and my friends also like it,they want to try it later</li>
    <li> After discovering such thing/device I decided to give it a try, it is awesome , effortless way to floss, I use it every night</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that should be used by everyone. It will prevent you a lot of trips to dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having dental issues and thought this might help with a more thorough cleaning. It does just that. It&#x27;s more thorough then flossing alone and works great in combination with brushing and flossing. Takes a bit getting use to (and you might end up with a few squirts to the face) but well worth the time, effort and price.</li>
    <li> I have used the waterpik ultra water flosser for several months and love it! It does a great job of cleaning the tooth surface as well as between my teeth.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product. It has the power and flexibility to do a good job, and it&#x27;s footprint is compact and well designed. Hopefully it will hold up to everyday use. It was highly recommended by my dentist for people with bridges and furcations, and I can see why now that I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> I had an old waterpik.  The new one is more compact. I like the off/on button, extra piks are stored conveniently.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is a substitute for flossing with dental floss, but it&#x27;s an excellent supplement for those who are so inclined.  I&#x27;m a regular flosser, so I can&#x27;t say whether this thing will suddenly eliminate your plaque buildup, but I can say that it makes you feel a whole lot cleaner.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m enjoying the Pic.  I feel my teeth are much cleaner now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 3 years, always with excellent performance and results. The one I bough recently was a gift for one of my sisters, and it was the the 5th or 6th that I bought as a gift for a relative. They all love it![[ASIN:B000VVHD44 Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely the BEST! I love all the features and the variable water pressures. Great for the teeth and gums! [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.  It does remove more stuff from my teeth than brushing alone by getting into places the brush can&#x27;t reach.  I would recommend this product as long as you follow the directions (not pointing it directly at your gums).  Even though my dentist hadn&#x27;t recommended it, after I told him I was using it he said it was good.  The Classic Jet Tip is really the only tip I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I hadn&#x27;t expected - It&#x27;s a two handed operation.  I have one hand holding the sprayer handle and the other hand turning it on/off and adjusting the pressure. This means it must sit on the left hand side of my counter since I use the handle in my right hand.  This might not be an issue for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some annoying little things that could be improved - The nicely coiled hose isn&#x27;t going to stay nicely coiled unless you give it some special attention when you put the handle in its holder (they should have made it retractable).  The tips swivel, but it swivels a little too easily and ends up pointing the wrong direction.  The temporary off button on the handle is in the middle of the handle, so if you have large hands or move your hand up to keep the tip from swiveling the button might be hard to reach. It&#x27;s a little clunky to refill; you take the cover off (which is probably wet and dripping on your counter) then you take the reservoir off (which might be wet and dripping on your counter) and fill it then you put it back being very careful to align it correctly because you don&#x27;t want to encourage any leaks and then you put the cover back on and if you don&#x27;t have the cover straight it falls into the reservoir - it&#x27;s not bad, but it should be better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for only 2 weeks, and I have seen a difference. I have moderate periodontal disease and my gums would bleed after almost every brushing/flossing for the last few months. Now, no matter how hard I brush or floss (before or after I use the WP), my gums aren&#x27;t bleeding anymore, and they&#x27;re pink where they were red before.     I&#x27;m still saving up for periodontist&#x27;s deep cleaning that will cost me $1100, but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m using this now, and only wish I&#x27;d been using it for years.</li>
    <li> My old one wore out after years of service.  The new one is smaller, yet easier to use and comes with a variety of flossing tips.</li>
    <li> Waterpikest in the businesst. Does what its designed to do and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;Good price and fast efficent service.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews by people who had problems with their waterpiks. I almost didn&#x27;t buy one. I had to write and say that mine works as advertised, no leaking, no false button pushes. Perhaps those folks should try walking and chewing gum first. My teeth feel as clean as the day I left the hygienist. I would buy the WP-100 again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks. The hose is a little short but not too bad and it is a little noisy when I turn the water pressure up. Overall, though, it is doing what it is supposed to do. No problems so far. Worth the money. It seems to have PLENTY of water pressure.</li>
    <li> I JUST WANTED TO HAVE MY GUMS HOLD MY TEETH BETTER, WITHOUT BLEEDING. SO WITH THE STIMULATION OF THE WATER JETTING ALONG THE GUM LINE OF EACH TOOTH MADE THAT HAPPEN.  NOW MY DENTIST HAS NOTICED LESS BLEEDING IN MY GUMS.  HOORAY! BEING OLDER NOW IT IS IMPERATIVE TO PROVIDE STIMULATION.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product lately and it works great. The Water Jet has various speed settings which increase pressure gradually and helps in cleaning the gum tissue. I am very happy with this overall.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great.  I am an adult with braces and the waterpik is excellent at removing foreign substances from my mouth.</li>
    <li> The use of a Water Pik had been suggested to me after having a not so good moment at the dentist on my last visit. I wear braces, both top and bottom and I had been flossing however it seemed to take too long and it was not enough to get the job done right. I had purchased the water pick after looking at numerous other similar products and am glad I decided to go for the Pik. After having used it for a week I noticed that my problem areas had diminished because I was able to clean out the pockets between the teeth more efficiently than flossing.  In fact it seemed to work just as well as getting a cleaning from the dentist. Considering the price, I am glad I paid the $40. It was a good investment. It takes some getting used to if you never have used one before, however it does not take too long to learn how to effectively maneuver the pick. As for deciding size of the reservoir, I am glad I decided to get the water pik with the highest water capacity. I find that the water is generously put out by the pick and I have to refill the reservoir 3-4 times each time I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks for 30 years, and I&#x27;ve found the Ultra to be the best model yet. It&#x27;s quieter, the controls are more convenient, the wand head swivels better, and it even looks nicer sitting next to the sink. I would recommend this model to anyone who likes to rinse and clean under the gum line after brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> This machine is an excellent addition to thorough teeth brushing. Even after brushing with my Sonicare brush this thing makes my mouth feel so much cleaner. It thoroughly gets to all the holes and sapces between my teeth and rinse out any food residues. You will be amazed by the amount of food residues left even after brushing and this can flush them away. Takes a short time to get up to max pressure but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I had tried some others but I never was satisfied with the product.  I am so glad I tried this one.  It cost alittle more but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is by far and away one of the top oral hygiene products available to non-professionals. Highly recommend to anyone (and who isn&#x27;t) looking for healthy gums and better check-ups...</li>
    <li> so far this is the best waterpik i have ever used.. especially liked closed water storage and  pressure adjustment and quietness!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as replacement for an older Model and am quite pleased with it.  The water tip connetion is faster and easier to use, the improved pressure adjustment is helpful and the ability to rotate the tip is a big improvement.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product to me.  I have been pleased with the ease of use and the quality of the product. I like the fact that it has several different tips to choose from depending on your personal circumstances.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean. I have bridge work in my mouth and this gets under and around every nook and cranny of that work. Love it!!</li>
    <li> II had a Waterpic flosser in the past that was better than this one but this is OK and meets my needs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bleed from my gums since I was five years old.  Originally, I believed that this was a simple undeniable right of genetics and lack of discipline towards oral hygiene.  Well, regardless of my faults a savior has been brought upon me.  After one week of using this product my gums have STOPPED BLEEDING.  Twenty years of uncertainty have been brought to rest of one amazing product.  If you were thinking about studying in dentistry I would seriously consider another line of medical practice.</li>
    <li> I had a Waterpik when in my teens, many years ago, and it was great.  The new one, I&#x27;ve had about 18 months, has the same basic functions but the fluid, I use a mix of water and Costco brand anticeptic mouth rinse, in the basin leaks all over the base and onto the counter.</li>
    <li> Good price n quality. Work as expected. So far has no problem.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and in good order.  The reservoir is smaller than I would like but it performs well.</li>
    <li> A little noisy, but kids enjoy using it &amp; finally they are flossing on their own.</li>
    <li> I really like this pik.  I have no complaints.  I love how much water it holds and the adjustable water force.  Works great for me!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet for my boyfriend for Christmas. He ABSOLUTELY loved it! The quality of the product was fantastic and he said it did wonders for his teeth. I thought the price was very reasonable. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a waterpik.</li>
    <li> When I first tried my new WaterPik, it was such a disaster that I nearly gave up and didn&#x27;t try it again.  However, I did use it again -- and again an again, and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty adept at using it.  It does a really good job of rinsing your mouth with high pressure water.  You have to be ready to have some water splashing down in the basin because you have to keep your mouth cracked to let the excess water run out.  I use it at the end of my regimen, after a gum stimulator, flossing and regular brushing.  It leaves your mouth really fresh, sweet and clean.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I get one. Now I understand why, but can&#x27;t understand how I could&#x27;ve gone so long without one! totally addictive!</li>
    <li> We find the WaterPik an excellent choice for anyone interested in dental   hygiene. My wife and I find it refreshing and orally satisfying. It feels as if you just left the dentist office  after a thorough cleaning. A great trouble free product we recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> FIRST TIME OWNER OF WATERPIC AND VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  VERY EASY TO USE AND VERY EFFECTIVE CLEANING TOOL WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Amazon did a good job of getting me this product right before Christmas in 5 days less than they had stated.    This product was recommended by my dentist.  I thought I brushed my teeth well, especially at night.  When I used the Waterpik after brushing, I was amazed to see how much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; the pik removed.  I&#x27;ll never go back to only brushing.    The Waterpik Ultra is terrific.    Bob</li>
    <li> This gadget does its job, but suffers from three design flaws that, taken together mean I only use it when I must:  1. The \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button on the handheld piece (pick) turns *off* the flow, meaning if you&#x27;re using it and for any reason the pick leaves your mouth, you and your entire bathroom get sprayed.  There is no way I&#x27;ve found to set it to only turn on when the button is pressed, which would greatly reduce such accidents.  1a.  The pause button is pretty stiff, and holding it down for any length of time quickly becomes tiresome. I&#x27;m a guy with relatively strong hands.  I can&#x27;t imagine how unpleasant that would be for a kid or an older person.  2.  The cord connecting the pick to the base is extremely short, reaching really only up to my face.  There isn&#x27;t much room to move around.  If I were three inches taller (at 5&#x27;11\\&quot;!) I would have to stoop to use it.  This, combined with how stiff the cord is, make the pick hard to use.  3.  The base, even filled with water, is light enough that just stretching the cord out to reach my face means it&#x27;s in danger of tipping over.  Since the reservoir is so loosely attached (and the top of the reservoir is not well secured to the body), the whole thing can easily fall over off my sink onto the floor, as it just did, drenching the bathroom floor with water.  This product is a mess.  There are probably better alternatives out there.</li>
    <li> I am a new waterpik owner... When I first bought this item, I put it on the level 10 pressure and let it run a little water though it! (directions said to) I than placed the Plaque seeker tip on it and began using it! I have had it for a week now and have used it everyday and i can not get the water pressure about 4, and that is pushing it! I got my wisdom teeth pulled a week ago and the waterpik has came in handy when it comes to rinsing out the holes in my gums from where my teeth are missing... I love this product... This is however my first waterpik, and the first time I have ever used such an item, but I am very pleased with it.... I dont know how I have made it the last 23 years without it..... My four year old son wants to use it also, I allow him with my help and on a low water level... Next to convert is my husband...   Week One: My gums look and feel healthier, they dont bleed at all on level 4 level like they did the day I started use!!!</li>
    <li> This waterpik is so amazing! My gums and mouth have never felt so clean and invigorated. I pretty much fell in love with this thing after the first use. This is perfect for braces, too. I know that waterpiks aren&#x27;t supposed to substitute regular flossing, but sometimes I just go ahead and use this alone. I figure that something is better than nothing, and on the highest pressure, it seems impossible that it could leave any plaque or food behind! I LOVE my waterpik.</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to do...good quality, nice design, better than older models..great price it&#x27; $14 more at Walmart!</li>
    <li> After a year of satisfactory use, one wing of the handle holder on the base unit snapped off. Now the handle cannot be held above the water reservoir, causing the unit to leak onto the counter unless the reservoir is emptied after each use.  This is so annoying that I will replace with a different brand.</li>
    <li> Hate going to the dentist n being asked how often you floss??  This waterpik is AWESOME n makes flossing so much easier. I have perfect looking teeth BUT I&#x27;m constantly getting food wedged between my teeth and floss doesn&#x27;t get it out. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, I guess it has to do with aging. I used a Waterpik 20 years ago but once it went out I didn&#x27;t replace it.  Waterpik has come a long way...I can adjust how hard the pik sprays, plus it has a button to stop the water jet to adjust the angle.  It has a lot of different jet attachments.  I fill it with warm water n a tablespoon of perioxide daily. My gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore n those little pieces of food are easily flushed out from between my teeth n gums.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT AT LEAST TWICE PER DAY BEFORE BRUSHING. ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS YOU CAN MAKE FOR DENTAL HEALTH  I HAVE PURCHASED 2 AS FAMILY XMAS GIFTS AND WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO HAS TEETH USE ONE</li>
    <li> I have used a waterpik for almost 50 years.   It was first recommended by an orthodontist.  This one [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser] is much quieter than my most recent one. The water flowing through the brush is great.  I especially like the deplaqueing attachment.  My only complaint is having to open the lid to change attachments.  Too bad there is not a way to have 2 handles.  Overall it is great.</li>
    <li> I use this on the lowest setting. it can really squirt the watter hard if you want</li>
    <li> When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn&#x27;t like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.&lt;br /&gt;This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.&lt;br /&gt;Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don&#x27;t have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.</li>
    <li> I was a little intimidated with all the attachments but it was the attachments, that I was interested in for my periodontist disease, I don&#x27;t like flossing so figured trying this item out...  You need to keep filling receptacle if you&#x27;re using the HIGH settings cause the water depletes more rapidly, found the pressure was not as strong, as I thought it be, thought, maybe it was defective, so returned it! Takes up bathroom counter space too and needs to be plugged to electricity (not too much of an issue but it&#x27;s nicer to have less connections and less stuff on your counter)... Tried the Redibreeze instead, the one that attaches to the faucet (NOT the PLASTIC valve) and was AMAZED of how this SIMPLE attachment could put out so much pressure!  It doesn&#x27;t have the attachments like the Flosser and the tubing should be redesigned, so it could easily turn but for the price, it&#x27;s worth much more to me, than the Flosser being it put out the most important thing, which was the \\&quot;pressure\\&quot;, so it could get the job done!  Goodbye Water Flosser, HELLO Redibreeze!</li>
    <li> After using the Water Pic for 6 months or so I saw the dental hygienist. She thought that I had been flossing more and better. My secret.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  It does do the basic job it&#x27;s intended to do.  But in my mind, it could be better.  My biggest criticism is the standard tip and the way it fits in the handle.  It&#x27;s too fidgety.  I understand the goal was to allow one to turn the tip for best aim as one navigates through the mouth.  But the tip always feels to me as if it&#x27;s about to fall out of the handle.  I also think water leaks where the tip and handle meet, though it&#x27;s hard to prove because my head is down when in use and some water will always be dripping from the mouth.  Myself, I&#x27;d prefer a non-rotating tip which mates solidly with the handle and doesn&#x27;t leak.  I can aim using my hand and don&#x27;t need or want a rotating tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second criticism involves the top to the water reservoir.  It is dual purpose, serving both as a cover and a storage area for other tips.  The storage area wants to open too easily and risks dumping its contents.  Secondly the cover seats poorly with a tendency to dip and fall into the reservoir.  I constantly have to remind myself to grip the cover in such a way as to simultaneously prevent it from opening or falling into the reservoir.  Again, it&#x27;s just too fidgety.  Still, the unit DOES clean my teeth and gums.  So it is performing the function it was designed for.  3 stars.</li>
    <li> very good product, I use it every day and I get enhanced care for my teeth, I recommend it strongly</li>
    <li> I will make this short and sweet, this is the best waterpik I have had yet and I have been using them for well over 20 years. One of my favorite aspects to this unit is the size, its much smaller than my previous Waterpik which means it takes up just that much less space on my bathroom counter. Its also more powerful than my previous unit. In fact, its a bit too powerful for me. I prefer to use this unit with the power setting turned to 8, 10 is a bit to strong for my gums. With that being said, its better to have to much power than not enough. Having the ability to turn it up a notch, if I have to, is a very good thing. Perfect for those Tootsie Roll binges. Basically the power ranges from 10 to 90 PSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 Tips are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - The Plaque Seeker which is best for implants, crowns or bridges.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Classic Jet Tip which is best for overall general use.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Toothbrush Tip which is also best for overall general use.&lt;br /&gt;4 - Orthodontic Tip which is best for braces.&lt;br /&gt;5 - Pik Pocket Tip which is best for Periodontal Pockets.&lt;br /&gt;6 - Tongue Cleaner which is best for freshening your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really only use 2 of the tips, the Classic Jet Tip and the Pik Pocket Tip as I have Periodontal Pockets. Both work amazingly well with the power of this unit, which is roughly 1200 pulses per minutes at again 10 - 90 PSI. For those that are unaware, Waterpik&#x27;s are roughly 90-93% more effective than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Teeth run in my family and I have been plagued with teeth problems my whole life. With that being said, my oral health improved DRAMATICALLY once I started using a Waterpik on a daily basis. In fact, there is really no comparison between the before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - A Waterpik should be considered mandatory in everyone&#x27;s home. They are inexpensive and do wonders in regards to improving your oral health. Considering all of the medical information that is available today that basically shows that bad oral hygiene can lead to LOADS of medical problems....well, buying a Waterpik should be a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars and then some!Waterpik should be a no brainer.   5 Stars and then some!</li>
    <li> Whoever invented this thing should get a nobel prize, seriously.  OK... Here&#x27;s my deal (sorry in a rush)  #1: had MAJOR CHRONIC GINGIVITIS (constantly) for about 7 years.  About 6 months ago, antibiotics became useless.  After 2 short (1 min) cleanings with Waterpik, the gingivitis was gone.  It has not returned since.  Never!  You cannot imagine the relief.  #2: I had a few painful and visible cavities.  Believe it or not, I don&#x27;t know how long it took but no more than 2 months, the cavities were gone!  I think if you have healthy teeth and use the Waterpik, you may never have a cavity or even need to get a regular cleaning at your dentist.  I think that&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  And the best thing is that it&#x27;s actually really fun to use.  I&#x27;ve always hated brushing my teeth but I look forward using the waterpik.  Your mouth just feels fresh and super clean afterwards.  I had to use a brush recently and it felt horrible.  I will never go back.</li>
    <li> Very useful..i like it too much</li>
    <li> I am so glad I brought it.</li>
    <li> I have a temporary bridge over my two implants that will be crowned in March and my teeth overall are problematic so my dentist advised me to buy Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet to clean small areas that you can not clean with a floss easily. I feel so refreshed and clean after using this device. So far I have used plastic like tip, circular brush and the other brush. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am using it every night after brushing and flossing.  It can still flash out particles of food from behind gum lines. It especially works well for my deep gum pocket between two molars.    I bought a small handheld model first but it was difficult to handle.  This desktop model has a small handle and a big water tank to finish cleaning with one fill.</li>
    <li> good, I used 3-4 times everyday after got this&lt;br /&gt;- Made in China&lt;br /&gt;- 110v&lt;br /&gt;- half price of buying in China</li>
    <li> well pleased,would recomend to anyone</li>
    <li> I bought this and it works great, much quieter than the older model I had.  Easy to change tips and many choices for different kinds of tips.</li>
    <li> Purchased my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser last month.  I use it once a day everyday.  It&#x27;s almost as effective as flossing.  The Waterpik is very effective and the spray cleans all debris from between teeth.  I love using it.</li>
    <li> The product worked as I had hoped.  I am having issues with my gums, which can happen as people get older, and if you&#x27;re really not a fan of flossing a couple times a day.  My hygienist said this was a good alternative.  I say it is a great alternative.  A little messy, but really get stuff between the teeth and to the gums that even the OralB electric brush misses.   The shipper was great too, really quick...and it was Amazon free shipping!</li>
    <li> Works great, isn&#x27;t too hard. Easy to use. Having a fun time playing with the different tool heads (nerd talk). I&#x27;m glad I got it and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing from my dentist to see what he says.</li>
    <li> I had an older basic model which was noisy and took forever to get \\&quot;up to speed\\&quot;.  I have since been using the Ultra model which is quieter and very powerful even at lower settings.  It is very effective at removing gunk...I call it my \\&quot;pressure washer for the mouth\\&quot;.  I love it and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Good price, reasonable shipment.  Works just like the one it replaced.  Waterpik could modify the design so the hose would vibrate against sharp corners.</li>
    <li> Product is high quality for sure.  although the top is a little flimsy considering you must remove and replace the top every time you use it.  And I think the water pressure could be a little higher for deeper cleaning.  Aside from those 2 points, I would recommend this product for good oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This waterpik has lasted for 2 years in comparison to its cordless version that would go out every 2 months or so. I am so happy with it, I got it for my birthday 2 years ago. I have braces, the waterpik cleans very nicely all over my braces. I do, however, use the waterjet piece shown in the picture to clear around my braces, it has really nice pressure that works, in my mind, better than the other piece especially designed for it. The tooth brush piece with water jet combined are okay. I usually only use the pointed waterjet piece to get rid of meat and veggies in tight corners of my teeth. Also, the bigger waterjet with higher pressure as picture is what I use. The rest is given to my husband who has more tender gums and likes more gentle settings on waterpik. My dentist was outraged when I told him about waterpik, he wanted to make sure that I still do flossing. I think he&#x27;s seen a few people who would give it flossing after using waterpik. I personally think it&#x27;s a good substitute to flossing, it can really minimize the amount of time on flossing, but I still have some missing areas that need flossing here andthere even with the waterpik.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has braces and struggles flossing around her brackets. Her teeth look awesome after using this for just a couple weeks. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik.  I worked up to level 6 for the strength and it is pretty strong.  Some of the attachments I don&#x27;t get, I just use the regular and the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have gotten 5 stars if it came with multiple regular attachments for my boyfriend or son to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the water container is plenty big.  If I fill it up, I finish cleaning right before it runs out.  For me, that&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> My wife and I really appreciate the different accessories that accompanied the unit.  The adjustable pressure compliments our individual requirements</li>
    <li> This is great to have if you ever get anything stuck between your teeth.  It is a must have for after eating popcorn.  It is better to get that stuff out right after instead of a couple of days later.</li>
    <li> One reason I decided to go with the Waterpik, among others, was the lack of batteries. I hated the rechargeable water flossers / irrigators. Plus this one felt a little more powerful to me. The main reason I decided to purchase an oral irrigator in the first place was because of my tonsilloliths (or tonsil stones to some). This irrigator, along with the normal jet attachment, blasted those suckers right out of my mouth, with very little pain, I would normally use a Q-Tip to get them out but that never worked out too well. On top of that the irrigator was able to reach a little further back and blast out some tonsil stones that were out of sight (for me) and further down.  I was going to make up a pro and con list but I couldn&#x27;t really think of any cons to put on that list. The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I could think of is that when you fill it up and turn it on, the water starts shooting out, the button on the handle stops the water flow. It woulda been a little more convenient for me if what you turned on the machine the water would only flow when you press the button, alas it&#x27;s the opposite and not huge deal.  For me, this product got the job done and did it well. I would recommend that first time users of oral irrigators, if you go with this machine, read through the manual and keep the pressure setting on the lowest when you are using it. Depending on the attachment and what you&#x27;re doing the higher pressures can cause unnecessary bleeding.</li>
    <li> My Dentist had long recommended a waterpik but I had imagined all the counter space I would lose. The scale of this new Waterpik is smaller than ones I had seen before and I am very happy with my purchase. It is a little noisy, but root canals have far worse side effects. I shopped price, and saw what looked like bargains, but Amazon&#x27;s service is so awesome, that it is worth a few extra pennies.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Conair water flosser, which I really liked but it was old and stopped working. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is quiet, compact, and looks nice on my bathroom counter. One thing I do is to leave off the top cover (which is also the storage place for the nice variety of attachments). I use the Waterpik daily and putting on/removing the top was an unnecessary step. Since I use it so often no dust ever settles into the water chamber. It&#x27;s always clean. You can put mouthwash into the unit too but the instructions say to avoid those with hydrogen peroxide. Excellent product. I&#x27;m completely satisfied. I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. The part I hate most is putting my hands in my mouth. This solves that issue, and after using it consistently for a while my dentist had very nice things to say. It definitely improves my dental health. I wish it didn&#x27;t require letting the water just drool back out of my mouth, though!</li>
    <li> My kids dental inspections got soooo much better.  Improved Gum health insanely. 199 times better than flossing. Broke 1 bought another. 4 family members gave way better health because of this thing!! Way worth it!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my use of this item that I  purchased at Amazon.  It has exceeded all of the claims statedbed in the Amazon description of its virtues.  It quickly removes food particles impacted between my teeth; it cleans this intertooth space more rapidly and more efficiently than the use of dental floss.  It efficiently removes the remaining tooth cleanser after brushing,  It is a significant improvement over my previous Waterpik appliance which ca be described as a tooth[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] cleanser/remover.  I strongly recomment it for all adults.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best, I use it before bed after brushing with an oral B...  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought but it&#x27;s a really good fit on the bathroom counter. Very easy to use and cleans thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, it&#x27;s very helpful to keep dental health. The only issue I have with this model is that the pipe is easy to have leaks, need to replace it less than one year.</li>
    <li> It gets all those little pieces of steak or chinese food that get stuck between your teeth and also things I didn&#x27;t even know were there.  You can feel the watter jetting in between the gums.  It&#x27;s like a refreshing massage.  My mouth just feels better</li>
    <li> We both love it and didn&#x27;t realize how much healthier our teeth &amp; gums appear and feel plus, plus, plus</li>
    <li> It has been interesting and fun learning how to use this product.  So far, it seems to be doing a much better job of flossing my teeth and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Has large water tank so can get 2 or 3 flossings.  Also has a push button rocker switch which makes it easy to turn on and off.  Have two idential water piks, one for home and the other for winter vacation property.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent machine.  It&#x27;s my first Waterpik and I love it!  I recently got a permanent bridge and it&#x27;s impossible to floss between the appliance and the gum.  This works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons for me but for no one else:  I have not yet figured out how to do this without getting completly soaked (yes, I know, keep your mouth closed)  I also haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of how to hold it at the proper angle, primarily because I have to bend over the sink and the water runs down my arm.  Also, I nearly took out an eye when I took it out of my mouth without holding the &#x27;pause&#x27; button, but I&#x27;m working through that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than my own stupidity and incompetance, this is exactly what I needed to do the job.  My teeth are so clean and sparkling when done.  If the water reservoir were a little bigger, that would be nice.  I usually have to fill it twice each application - but maybe that&#x27;s me being over zealous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d change.</li>
    <li> Got a great report from the doctor after my purchase</li>
    <li> bracket arm broke after 6 months.  I should not have used it as leverage to remove resovoir, but ...I did.  Other than that...the extra tips are useless.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Removes food particles lodged in gums and between teeth that are not removed by flossing or brushing. Works especially well in removing impacted food from inflamed gums. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Amazingly helpful for tooth sensitivity. Use every day religiously. Haven&#x27;t seen a dentist in years. LOVE this thing.</li>
    <li> The machine cleans your gums quickly and easily. It&#x27;s much better than I expected. Plug it in. Fill the water tank and use it. Simple with great results. Hard to imagine what would make it any better.</li>
    <li> a great device! a lot of tips, long power cord. I am very pleased that bought waterpick.&lt;br /&gt;very convenient that the device has a handle on the pause button .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finally doing what I should have been doing for my teeth.  This is especially good if you have bridges and crowns.</li>
    <li> The product is great.  It has covnenient storage, a dust cover for water chamber, and is easy to use.  What more could you ask.  It is much better than the previous waterpik I had.  The old waterpik worked great but was not convenient to store when not in use.</li>
    <li> The product does just what it is supposed to do. The reservoir is just the right size. It does a great job - better than flossing. The only slight negative is that the pressure could be a little greater.</li>
    <li> I purchased and have used my water pik for about 1 month. It is great and my gums feel great. This is an essential product if you have any type of bridge on your molars. It was impossible for me to get the \\&quot;loop\\&quot; type floss into my back teeth. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Works well, only problem is there are too many attachments still learning them</li>
    <li> My Waterpik ULTRA Waterflosser is excellent, except for 2 minor annoyances: (1) The lid for the Tip storage too easily opens when removing to put the water into the container; (2) The Tip holder rotates too readily while using to floss my teeth.</li>
    <li> I owned the hand held battery version and as most people have already reported, after only having it about a year or two it stopped recharging.  Decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power on this is great and since it has plug one doesn&#x27;t have to wonder if it will recharge.  If I had a larger bathroom counter it would be perfect.  It is too big to fit on the edge of the sink.  If I don&#x27;t put the pic back on the holder exactly right, water drips everywhere. It is also easy to unintentionally spray yourself and your surroundings.  The cord from the pic to the base could be longer though I didn&#x27;t find it as much of a problem as other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, he hasn&#x27;t stop using it. He loves it, and it does work very very well. He had allot of hard places to get to that food dig into, and this water pik works far more better than floss! Just be careful not to have the dial up too high, that will hurt your guns.</li>
    <li> I am an adult who recently got braces for the first time. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried has worked as quickly and efficiently in dislodging food from under wires and cleaning between teeth as this Waterpik. My mouth feels so clean after I use it. I&#x27;ve found that it can even clean around orthodontic wax on the highest setting without dislodging it. When I mentioned to my regular dentist that I had purchased one, they were very pleased and said that the WaterPik is what they recommend to patients who have braces and find it difficult to floss regularly. My only regret is that I did not purchase my WaterPik from Amazon since it is more expensive in stores. Great product that I would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using interplak for years and now I understand why waterpik is the winner.  It is just the best!</li>
    <li> Great deal... awesome product that was recommended by my dentist. My husband uses an older version of this. But I love the handy storage compartments. And the size is very nice. My only complaint is that it is a bit loud, but the fact it works well and is sturdy I am more than happy to put up with this mere annoyance. Great deal great product!!</li>
    <li> I have a couple of bridges and have sometimes not flossed adequately simply because it was a tedious task.  No more.  This Waterpik flosser does a superb job and is so easy to use - no more threading the floss through the eye of the plastic needle (always had to put my readers on)  Just point and shoot, so to speak.  I should have bought one years ago.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Wish the hoses lasted longer before breaking, but at least they can be easily replaced.</li>
    <li> Great waterpik.  It does everything it claims and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product it literally can save your life. Great, clean teeth are a joy. Don&#x27;t wait get started today.</li>
    <li> My dentist has recommended a water pik for years and I have kept putting it off.  Why pay money when I can use regular old dental floss?  Well, once I used this pik for the first time, I could immediately tell it works.  Who would think the power of water could clean your teeth?  This pik is really powerful and can really make a difference in your dental hygene.  This is my first one so I cannot compare to others, but I will say I am happy with this purchase and the price.  This pik can reach places you never could with regular floss and can really clean and help heal an irritated gumline.  It is a bit more work to use this machine instead of floss, but sure worth the time.  I will also add it is a bit messy.....you will get water on your counter and mirrors but again, well worth it.</li>
    <li> We replaced our older model with this one. While it&#x27;s more compact and nicer to look at on the counter everyday, it lacks the power of our older less, attractive model, plus there are a myriad of attachments we will almost never use, which are stored in the water tank cover, but it doens&#x27;t snap shut, so that&#x27;s a little odd too.  All in all, it&#x27;s got great contemporary looks, but could use more force and functionality.</li>
    <li> The voltage that can be used not just in the South Korea.&lt;br /&gt;I know this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;However, the quality is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, follow the directions, cleans between teeth like no tooth brush. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these after seeing how much difference in made in one of my friend&#x27;s smile after 6 months to a year.  I hadn&#x27;t seen him in a while and asked how he got his teeth to look so great. He said it was due to his waterpik.  I&#x27;m not the most stringent person when i comes to oral hygiene. Hated flossing as a kid and as an adult may get around to it 2-3 times a week, so i was intrigued with a possible alternative.  After trying it for about a month, I&#x27;m hooked.  While taking more time than normal flossing, this thing gets your teeth feeling like you just got out of a biannual cleaning at the dentist; without the uncomfortable chair or the painful pokers.  I was curious how clean it was getting things so a few times I&#x27;ve followed up with floss.  have yet to find any chunks of things that this missed.  Giving it only 4 stars as I feel the reservoir is too small. I have to refill it every time i use it. Not a big deal but it is annoying.  Also the hose is kind of short so you have to have the thing within arms reach of the sink, unless you want to swallow all that grimy water...</li>
    <li> had this for a year now and worked flawlessly until my son told me he noticed it leaking from the reservoir gasket but it took me less than 5 minutes to look up the number on their website and call and get a person -very nice lady from FT collins CO who said they would be happy to send me a couple of the rubber plug things so i would have a spare if it ever wears out again!  I was so pleased at how quick and easy it was i had to write this review. I could have bought the whole plastic reservoir for 21 bucks but i only paid 45 for the whole thing on amazon, i simply gave them my address and they said they are sending them right away! good job Waterpik! and great product!  Sometimes i use this thing to clean the tile grout! its like a mini pressure washer.  My dentist told me i need to floss or i will lose my teeth and since i bought this thing my gums NEVER bleed anymore and my gums are much healthier and my teeth feel so clean.  it does take a few days to build up to full power on the dial but once you get there its like a massage and it gets stuff out even if you brush first. i am really glad i got it and i want to get one for my bathroom but waiting til the price goes back down. hope this helps!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Maybe I should get back to you after my next dentist appointment.</li>
    <li> Button works opposite of how you think it should.  Releasing the button shoots water, holding it stops the water from coming out.  Very hard to use without getting water everywhere.</li>
    <li> It could have a better industrial design to fill the tank more easily and top cover to be more sturdy.  Otherwise, it works fine.  Efficient and powerful enough.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s begin by saying I had not had a Waterpik of any kind in a while. I forgot how great they are. My breath is better, my teeth feel better. My gums feel better. Make sure you have one or get one.    As for this particular Waterpik, it is good, not great, but maybe the best one on the market. My only complaint is I wish the top setting of strength was higher. Sometimes I want more pressure. But it is plenty strong enough to get the job done. It is simple and easy to use. And my girlfriend has had the same model for a year. And neither of our Waterpiks report any problems.</li>
    <li> This is a very well design product from the beginning and this model even have more aed power. I especially like the brush jet. One thing need to improve if they watch this review, the water container should has a slop bottom so it can drains all the water into the machine instead a flat bottom. those water not drain into the machine will evaporated inside of the water container, over a period of time mineral deposited may build up and turns into a thin layer of ugly yellow thing.</li>
    <li> The product works well and has good pressure.  The only down size is that several different type of picks are with it that most people will not use.  If you want to use it for more than one person you have to buy extra picks.</li>
    <li> For years I had bleeding gum problems that I treated with a rubber tipped end of a tooth brush, but each time I returned to my dentist my gum problems persisted. My dentist finally suggested using a water pic but he did not instill much confidence in me the way he casually mentioned it. After dragging my feet on this issue I finally yielded to the suggestion of getting a water pic, and what a difference it has made. I told my dentist that he should have shouted at me to do this earlier and to \\&quot;strongly\\&quot; tell his patients to use this pic for oral hygiene. After several years of using this religiously each night before retiring my pic broke and I could not wait until my new one arrived that was ordered through Amazon.com. I highly recommend that anyone with gum problems use this for their personal cure.</li>
    <li> On two separate models I purchased a hole opened on the tubing between the machine and the pik, without my putting any kind of unusual pressure on it. The only conclusion I can draw is that the company is using inferior plastic in the tubing. I will not buy another.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this item years ago.  It has excellent flow, adjustable for beginning use and large reservoir.  Multiple tips are nice but not necessary.  It leaves your teeth feeling like you just had them cleaned at the dentist.  I fully recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am an experienced user and have owned 5 different models including this one. The others were Trisa, Bosch, Braun and Phillips. All of them better than this.       The machine is designed around looks alone, with no concern about practicality or ease of use.    First - Handle in front of reservoir. Usually the machine will be placed against some surface (eg. bathroom mirror). Now with the pick in front and the wall/mirror behind, you have to carefully sneak the reservoir between the two to place it or remove from the machine. That&#x27;s why most other machines have the handle to the side of the container    Second - Lid doesn&#x27;t come off. The reservoir lid is hollow and opens up to reveal spare attachments inside. When you try lift it off to fill the reservoir, the lid opens instead of coming off. It&#x27;s extremely tricky grasping the lid to lift it off instead of opening it up. I&#x27;ve had to leave it off permanently.    Third - Bad tips. The clear transparent tips become invisible in your mouth. When looking into the mirror to gauge where to place the tip, you have to give it a few twists to see exactly where it&#x27;s pointing. They are also too thick and bulky to easily manage while in your mouth. The bend of the tip isn&#x27;t correct to point into the spaces between the back teeth.    Fourth - Unreachable button. The flow stop button is located in the wrong place on the handle. Holding the handle properly, with your thumb and index finger on the twist ring during normal use, the button finds itself down in the middle of your palm!!  Impossible to reach without fumbling and re-positioning the whole handle. On other machines the button can be pressed by simply shifting your thumb.    Fifth - Bad handle holder. You&#x27;d expect to be able to insert tips while the handle is on the machine. Wrong. The cheap handle clip/holder on the front of the machine flexes open when pushing down on the handle to insert a tip and the handle slides down. You have to remove and hold the handle first, before inserting the tip.    Sixth - Hidden water level. The bottom part (about a quarter) of the reservoir fits into the body of the machine. That whole section is concealed from view. Once the water level goes past that point you have no idea how much longer you have water left.    Seventh - Bad pipe design. There is a long section (about 2 inches) of straight pipe that enters the bottom of the handle. This section is all that pushes the rest of the curled pipe into the machine. Being new it&#x27;s still stiff enough to do the job, but I see it weakening very quickly after regular use, eventually making it very difficult to keep the curled pipe pushed back.    Pros - Good looking. Quiet. Tips insert and eject very easily. Cheap.    However I would not recommend it to anyone.       UPDATE: The machine has broken down now after only 2 days of use. I will return it for a refund.     Eighth - Terrible build quality.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the waterpik flosser, It gives my mouth that refreshed clean feeling and knowing that my mouth is healthy. It is user friendly as well.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is everything they say and more. I just love the clean feeling, and polishing features with all the advanced attachments. It is a must have for oral hygiene.  This was the absolute best price and free 2 day shipping. However, I received mine the next day.WOW! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Worth every dime. I love it! Thank You, Marsha</li>
    <li> I needed to replace original WP-100. I got the same looking one, but labeled WP-105&lt;br /&gt;at Target at the beginning of December 2014. The current model of the WP-100 is&lt;br /&gt;significantly lighter than the original WP-100, so it seems the pump in WP-660 made&lt;br /&gt;it to the WP-100 line. Not only is the new WP-100 lighter, but it is quite a bit louder&lt;br /&gt;than the 3 year old WP-100, the pressure seems less (subjective test), and the pump&lt;br /&gt;stutters depending which way the tip is positioned in the mouth. I was quite disappointed,&lt;br /&gt;so I repaired the old one. The new version seems cheapened from the original I got&lt;br /&gt;3 years ago. I am not sure whether Amazon is selling the original or the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; WP-100&lt;br /&gt;version. Just be aware of the possible design changes made if you replacing your&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;old&amp;#34; WP-100. The new one is not the same.</li>
    <li> Well , there is nothing to hide here , I do brush regularly , but flossing , well that was a different story. and was  reminded every time I go to dentist. This product changed flossing for me.&lt;br /&gt;Hats  off to it, it bring out leftover from hard to reach place from even brush , I wish somebody suggested this to me earlier. well spent money on dental care.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik, I tried several other makes and found this the best for my sensitive gums. Easy to control flow.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik came quickly and was just what I had in mind. The price was right, too, as I&#x27;ve seen it advertised locally for $5 more.</li>
    <li> A neat looking device. Much quieter than the earlier model. Larger water capacity  would be useful. Two each of the narrower nibs so that husband and wife could make use  of them independently. Overall,I like using it.</li>
    <li> This waterpik serves it&#x27;s purpose for someone who doesn&#x27;t floss.  However, it is very loud and will wake up others in the house so you really have to plan out a time making it hard to form a routine.  There are lots of different tips to figure out as well.  Not as simple as expected.</li>
    <li> If you are having problems with your gums, this is the product to try.  Stop using tooth paste and mouth wash with saccharine and start using the Waterpik.  It worked so well for me that I purchased a second one for a friend. Use it twice a day and after a few weeks you will be surprized at how healthy your gums will become.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this waterpik would be any different than my previous one. I had a cordless one that seemed to work just fine.  I can&#x27;t tell you how impressed I am with this one.  I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  The pulsing sensation it gives out is amazing.  You can really feel it clean your teeth and gums.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I hated flossing before, I tried all different types of floss and hated em all but I dont mind using this machine at all. .the water pic was very easy to use and I am very satisfied with the results from it. Although it&#x27;s a little messy and takes some getting use to but still works great and is worth a little water spill!</li>
    <li> I thought the boast that this water-flosser was better than dental tape was a bit too much, but when I tried this instrument, I was amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it cleaned my teeth and mouth.  I would have bought it a long time ago if I had known how well it worked. Dental health is quite important to me, as I am middle aged, have all my teeth, and want to keep it that way. I am betting my next dental visit will be better than my last!</li>
    <li> This was not a very powerful product.  The original waterpik that I replaced was much better.  It doesn&#x27;t  have a very strong stream of water to floss teeth.      I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> The device works great.    Regarding the technology of water flossing - at least for me it&#x27;s not a complete substitute for regular flossing.  It&#x27;s just different.  I use both regularly.  That&#x27;s not a knock against this specific product, which does exactly what it should.</li>
    <li> Although I do lots of shopping on line with Amazon,I purchased the Waterpik ultra in Walmart...I&#x27;ve been through 3 different machines with all the same outcome..After a few months of use the pause button on the handle gets stuck and wont release the water...You dont want to buy this product,its poorly designed and obviously</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I had periodontal disease and had to pay over $800 for the cleaning and scraping and medicine injected into my gums.  I bought this right after the cleaning and have been using it since and my gums are 100% now and I have no problems what so ever using this product.  Its plug and go and just works.  I have braces but find myself using the standard pick more than the orthodontic pick.  If you have this and a soniccare brush you would be set for life.</li>
    <li> At the advice of my dentist, I took my 24-year-old model 300-W WaterPik Delux out of the storage bin and started using it again. (I quit using it when I began using an electric toothbrush.  Now I am using both.)  It still worked but it was noisy, so I decided to try the new WaterPik to see what today&#x27;s technology could do.  I was pleased.  The new model is much more quiet, has some good new features and it looks good on my bathroom sink counter. I think the swivel mount for the jet tip is an improvement.  I eventually had to replace the hose on my old WaterPik when it broke from all the twisting and turning in my mouth.  The swivel is easier and it lets you turn the tip without twisting the hose.  The new model lacks a self-storing reservior, but instead has a lid that covers the reservior and stores extra tips and attachments, so that&#x27;s O.K.  One or more of the various kinds of specialized tips may be useful to people with certain dental issues.  I usually use the classic tip.  I might benefit from also using the Pik Pocket tip, but it is too soon to tell.  The WaterPik does a good job of removing food particles that jam in crevices between my teeth and between my teeth and gums below the gum line. My electric toothbrush misses some of these food particles, although it has other virtues.  My dentist says it is important to get them all out to prevent tooth decay and gum-related problems including sub-gum bone loss.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;identical\\&quot; item that my partner had previuosly purchased has a much stronger jet. I like theirs much better. Wah.</li>
    <li> This product was the best thing that I have purchased in a long time.  It is simple and small in space.  It cleans great and it&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I hate to floss I find this much more refreshing and less stressful on your gums.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik a few weeks ago.  Unlike so many I find it a challenge to use without getting water all over the sink top or mirror.  I also do not like refilling the water container every morning or each time I use it.  If time is important to you then prepare for an extra 4-5 minutes each time you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One must insert the Waterpik nozzle in the mouth while holding your head over the sink.  At a #5 setting the water comes out fast enough to fill your mouth in a few seconds so you either must shut it off with the button on the handle and spit out the water or open your mouth a little as you use the pik and let the water drain while you use it. If you somehow forget to hold the off button down and remove the nozzle from your mouth the pik will shoot a stream of water in what ever direction it is pointed.  Moving the nozzle along the gum line is no easy task as you have to twist a ring on the handle to adjust the location of the nozzle.  All in all this is way to much time for me. I will stick with my braun electric tooth brush and floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this device correctly it will flush out debris better than a toothbrush in my opinion.  This type of device a dentist uses is very effective but it is by no means a Waterpic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of positive post on here so a lot of people must do very well with it. Lucky them. My wife did not like it. I did not like it. Next in line will be my daughter who I shall give it to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews on this waterpik last year and took note of the good reviews that it had, so I went to a local retailer (CSV) to buy this for $64.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jet settings are very weak, it&#x27;s best to leave the water settings at 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous generic waterpik was so strong, that it made my gums bleed....(thorough cleaning), but this waterpik is too weak in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This waterpik will get the job done for you, removing food particles between your teeth, but you will still need to floss your teeth on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS  :  NONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS  :  Weak water pressure, Messy sink, Water storage too small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a three star because in my opinion, it&#x27;s overly-hyped.</li>
    <li> when i broke my wrist was when i needed one of these because all i could pray for was the ability to floss my teeth, but with a broken knee it was impossible to get to a store and since it took disability two years to process my application, i couldn&#x27;t afford one of these until i shattered my finger and decided it was time.  i&#x27;ve always wanted one of these, so what a great excuse to get one.  fortunately for you, you don&#x27;t need to break parts to justify one of these.  it&#x27;s the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my teeth.  even better or comparable to brushing in the shower.  my dentist and hygienist love me.  if you must hear pros and cons, well the only weak feature is the flexible hose that kinks at the base, but this can be corrected by moving the base to the other side of your sink.  or you can turn your base around facing away from you.  no matter.  the point is that i&#x27;ve only used dental floss once since purchasing this unit.  i&#x27;m using it all the time.  what i particularly like about the water pik is that it doesn&#x27;t ruin the flavor of what you just ate, so i use it immediately after i eat.  thousands of satisfied customers can&#x27;t be wrong.  take a look at all these five star reviews.</li>
    <li> We purchased it for our daughter who needed braces. The cordless model didn&#x27;t seem to be powerful enough. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the bathroom counter and we recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> use with hydrogen peroxide and mouthwash (diluted in water) for a super clean feeling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a dentist, but my teeth are a mess (cancer).  About a month with the machine, results:    1) Gums are pinker and healthier (n.b. I&#x27;m going by what my oral surgeon says I should be looking for);  2) Teeth \\&quot;feel\\&quot; cleaner- distinct visceral difference before and after;  3) Definite visible difference of areas between certain hard to floss teeth    I noticed in other reviews there is an issue with the power of the unit.  A properly functioning unit is actually powerful enough to tear your gums apart.  I ran the unit through a flowmeter (I&#x27;m an aquarist) and it is more powerful than needed.      Many of the reviews that say the unit is underpowered were obviously written by intelligent persons who carefully evaluated the unit prior to posting.     This suggests to me that they may have received defective units.     I mean this with sincerity.    I would exchange the product or check the model number.  Or perhaps bring the unit with you to your next Dental appointment.  I really believe that if you have the same unit I purchased,  functioning correctly you won&#x27;t be disappointed.    In terms of use I use at least 3 attachments with every use:  The toothbrush; the plaque seeker; and then; either the 1) Pic pocket tip or the 2) Classic tip.    Hope this review is helpful</li>
    <li> fast delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this device a few times now and my mouth is noticeably cleaner when finished. It gives me almost a dentist clean feeling. :)    Pros:  1. I love the multiple attachment options. I&#x27;ve found good use from all of them  2. Devise is pretty quiet (compared to older models)  3. Fits on countertop neatly  4. Sufficient water pressure  5. Removes tons of extra debris from your teeth that normal (or electric brushing will miss)  6. Great for people that don&#x27;t want to take the time to floss    Cons:  1. Water spray can be sort of messy  2. Water tub runs out quickly and doesn&#x27;t hold a great amount of water  3. Doesnt have enough holding slots for all of the attachments???    Overall if you&#x27;re someone that wants beyond average cleaning, then this devise is perfect. I dislike the time it takes to floss and the fact that it causes my gums to bleed because of how rough the flossing is. This is a perfect solution for me.     When I was in highschool I had braces and used an old school waterpik and the dentist told me upon removing my braces, that I had some of the healthiest, whitest and cleanest teeth/gums, he&#x27;d ever seen. I know it was because of my daily use of my waterpik. I wanted to get back to that feeling of a healthy clean mouth so I decided to purchase this one because of the reviews. I was immediately happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik for over 5 years now.  Had oral cancer in 2005  and surgery, chemo and radiation.  Was left with no saliva so have to clean my teeth diligently after meals.    Use waterpik after brushing three times a day. This is the second one I have bought.  It waorks great and is easy to use, also buy a portable one for traveling   THank you! Luann Robertson</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two different models before this.  It looks like this one will be as good as any, assuming it holds up for a long time.  I have tight teeth and need something like this to blast out the particles.</li>
    <li> I am completely amazed at how well this little gizmo works.  It shoots a stream of water just like at the dentist&#x27;s.  There are ten settings for the strength of water, and I use the highest--10--all of the time.  The lower levels do not seem to be enough to do any good.  I think it actually works better than flossing as I have a couple of pockets that I need to keep clean.  Since I&#x27;ve used this, I don&#x27;t floss anymore. and I feel my mouth is cleaner than ever.  It is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is just what the children needed while having their braces. Using room temp water, this gets the food out between the braces.</li>
    <li> im not sure if i posted a review on here or not, if i did then i cant find it and you guys can stop reading this new review lol.    but anyways i just want to say that my experience with this water pik was awesome!! it works perfectly no problems like the others claim    ive used it for 2 weeks now and so far it looks like my gums are healthy again...i use this to keep food particles away from my gum and teeth area during the day or after every meal    this doesnt help with removing bad breath stop saying that....use mouth wash. I MEAN good mouthwash    the pulsating function is incredibly comfortable my comfort pressure level is at 6 anything above 6 hurts my gums...    also when you first get this product set it at 2 on the pressure setting...just trust me its best so you dont damage your gums and after 5 days use any pressure setting you want    i know the pressure at 2 doesnt feel like its enough but trust me it is.</li>
    <li> I purchased two WaterPiks, one for me and one for my wife.  Because we both like using the WaterPiks (on level 4), we usually clean our teeth at least twice a day now.  We have rarely, if ever, flossed twice a day.  I have many food traps and the Pik does a great job of washing away the debris.  After two weeks of use I visited the dentist for my normal semi-annual cleaning and received rave reviews from my hygienist for the condition of my gums and teeth.  I would recommend this product to anyone. As usual, the price at Amazon was better than Target, etc.</li>
    <li> I found a new dentist after my old dentist retired.  My new dentist recommended Waterpik.  I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary since I brushed, flossed and gargled with antiseptic daily.  He said using Waterpik would make my gum healthier.  I was still hesitant.  I&#x27;m thinking maybe Waterpik was paying him for the sale.  I reluctantly ordered one and to my surprise, LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik Waterflosser is small and compact and doesn&#x27;t take too much counter space.  It is also super easy to use.  Just fill the tank with lukewarm water; pluck the tip into the handle, press the power button on the unit and you are ready to go.  You can turn the tip angle by twisting the knob between the tip and the handle and you can also pause the water flow by pressing the blue button, also found on the handle.  I played with the pressure control dial and found it made my gum bleed when I turned to 10 (the highest pressure number).  The water was like a needle!  I played with the dial and found that #4 was my comfort pressure number for now.  What I liked most about this unit is that I can point to the back of my mouth where it was rather difficult to reach by floss or brush alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with 6 tips but the storage cover can&#x27;t accommodate all of them.  I put away those tips that I don&#x27;t need (i.e. Pik Pocket Tip for people with periodontal problem, or Orthodontic Tip for people who wear braces/dental work.)  Now I have enough space in the storage cover.  Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Waterpik before I brushed and found that it left no food particle on my toothbrush.  I brush my teeth and still floss (for in between the teeth) and gargle as before.  Hopefully with this new dental regiment, I can keep my teeth for as long as I can, because next to shopping, I LOVE to eat!  So glad I found this new dentist!</li>
    <li> I love it, I have had absolutely no problem with this product, I even used it with mouth wash instead of water and it worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> This works like a charm</li>
    <li> i bought this waterpik four years ago; i love it and use it every day unless we&#x27;re on vacation. there&#x27;s nothing like seeing food particles shooting out of your mouth you really feel like your doing something. i don&#x27;t think i can ever go back to traditional floss and my dentist was impressed by the lack of plaque building up i had on my teeth even though i hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist for four years (no insurance until recently!).    my only complaints is that the pause button stopped working within the first few months but i got used to not turning it on until i put it in my mouth so it was no big deal. now though these years later it&#x27;s really starting to fail. i have to push down on the water container to make it come out of the spout; it&#x27;s like the suction type whole in the bottom is not connecting. so i think it&#x27;s time for a new one and i will buy the same thing.    my dad has had his waterpik for thirty years and he complains that \\&quot;they don&#x27;t make things like they used too.\\&quot; well my generation isn&#x27;t the one that sent all manufacturing to china so you reap what you sow. of course i wish it had lasted me longer and it is made of flimsy plastic but i still think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I received the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser in perfect shape, sooner than I expected and am very happy the the product and the vendor.  I would definitely recommend the vendor.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I consider using a waterpick to improve the clearing of food debris that was getting stuck in my gums. The pick works as advertised and is easy to use. It definitely helps removing the food particles and with little effort.    The Amazon vendor offered a good price, was very fast at shipping. All in all a good transaction.</li>
    <li> The Amazon price and delivery time fit the bill on this Waterpik Flosser.  I have had recent dental work and this is great for getting under and around appliance.</li>
    <li> I floss, rinse, get my teeth cleaned regularly and do all the right things, yet the Waterpik leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than anything.</li>
    <li> This is my third Water Pik. It is primarily used for nasal irrigation with a Grossman tip. My tip did not fit this unit but I heard about cutting off the tooth tip and pressing on the Grossman tip, and it works great. Anyone with sinus infections need this unit. However, my old unit had a large water tank and this one is half the size. So, I mix my saline solution in a 1000 ml container and have to pour half during the irrigation. No big deal, but this unit really uses the water even on the lowest setting.. It is much better than my old 650. I haven&#x27;t used it for teeth yet but I am sure it will excel. And the Amazon price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Would recommend to all.  My daughter has a much easier time with her braces.</li>
    <li> I wanted to hold of a while on this review because I know there are several complaints in prior reviews so I wanted to be able to address them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest complaint is that you&#x27;re going to get wet using this Waterpik.  I think that this complaint is very much overblown.  If you are very concerned about any water getting on the sink it is possible to use the Jet with your lips closed and then press the temporary stop button and release the water from your mouth and then start again with your lips closed.  Personally I think this is silly and I don&#x27;t mind a small amount of water getting on the sink.  Could Waterpik bend the tip in such a way so that no water would run down on your hand?  Maybe but I think that would also make the unit really awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint is that the Waterpik is not powerful enough.  I&#x27;m up to level 6 out of 10 and it has taken me about 3 months to get there.  Even though I now have a lot of experience using the Waterpik there are still times I \\&quot;miss\\&quot; and hit a soft spot in my mouth and it hurts--even at level 6.  In short, the Waterpik is extremely powerful, IMO, and I&#x27;ve been stuck on level 6 for over 2 weeks (I may not go any higher).  When I turn it up to level 10 and point the stream at the bathtub it is scary strong.  My advice is to start at level 1 and work up very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen it mentioned that it is too easy to pop off the tip while in use.  This has not happened to me in 3 months of use.  I DO think that the placement of the button for the tip release is unfortunate because you have to be careful not to press it while you&#x27;re using the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have suggested that the reservoir is too small.  In my experience the reservoir is the perfect size for a single use.  I always find that by the time I&#x27;ve done my whole mouth the unit runs out of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen suggestions that there are leaks.  I want to make a very careful note here that the way the unit is designed you have to push down firmly on the reservoir once you drop it into the unit.  There is a rubber valve that has to make good contact in order to form a seal.  It isn&#x27;t necessarily obvious that you need to do this just by looking at the unit (but it is in the directions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I&#x27;d just like to add a couple of my own observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; of this unit is very small.  I really was happy about that because I have a tiny bathroom sink and i was wondering where I would put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a waterpick is a really important part of dental hygiene and I think everyone should consider using it.  I don&#x27;t personally think it replaces flossing but it makes your flossing much more effective (I generally use the Waterpik after flossing and before brushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any questions just leave me a comment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Long term follow-up.  The unit still works but the temporary stop button sticks now every time I use it.  To unstick it I have to turn off the unit and then tap the handle until it unsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final follow-up 9/15/11:  The unit finally stopped working altogether.  I&#x27;m not upset about it.  I can see by my order date that this pik lasted about 2 years.  Also, I think it says something that just today I ordered the exact same model.rmly on the reservoir once you drop it into the unit.

It isn&#x27;t necessarily obvious that you need to do this just by looking at the unit (but it is in the directions).    Finally I&#x27;d just like to add a couple of my own observations.

    <li> I use it every night and it makes my mouth and teeth feel cleaner than just brushing.&lt;br /&gt;should have bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> Yes indeed, this water pick does all that it is supposed to. It&#x27;s very good at cleaning, and ha lots of nice accessories that can be conveniently stored in the cover. The reservoir stores plenty of water, and the pressure variation dial allows you to choose the strength of flow. If you have never used a waterpik before here&#x27;s an interesting observation. Even after carefully brushing and flossing my teeth the waterpik dislodged additional food particles that the brush and floss operations missed. The Waterpik seems to be well made. I also own a water jet made by a competitor that I&#x27;ve found to be very flimsy (Conair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big problem with the Waterpik is its intermittent leaking. I make sure that the tank and the pick attachment are properly seated yet the machine will periodically and inexplicably start to leak. I will go in the bathroom at various times during the day and find that everything is OK with it. Then I will make another trip and find the Waterpik sitting in a puddle of water. To be able to use it without having this problem I have to empty the storage container after every use. That&#x27;s something you are not supposed to have to do. In reading other reviews of the Waterpik on the internet I&#x27;ve found that I am not alone in having this problem.</li>
    <li> After using this product for 2 weeks the stop button on the hand unit started sticking and is no longer useful.</li>
    <li> I was honestly surprised that I had to crank this one to full power to feel like I was getting the same clean as the old one that sprung a leak.  All in all, we&#x27;re pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> This water pik is a best buy for the money.  It has several great features and settings to help keep your gums clean and in great condition.  I found this to be very easy in the morning and evening to use.  It is very simple and user friendly.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  GOOD VALUE</li>
    <li> With the exception of the clunky re-chargeable units, Waterpick continues to be a favorite of mine.  This unit is easy to fill and keep clean.  The adjustable pressure range could etch marble ( : at the high end, and be used on a baby at the low end - really a good unit!!  Comes with all the doo dads for any dental daydream you could ever have.  I like to splash some Crest Ultra mouthwash in the water tank for a really clean feeling.  Happy, happy!</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I have used waterpik products for years.  This model is our favorite.  It&#x27;s a little more compact than the regular, but comes with more tools for your teeth.  My husband uses the tool for caps &amp; braces.  It works wonderful.  His teeth are a little sensitive &amp; very close together--he says this is the only way to get out food wedged between his caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gal who cleans my teeth rates my teeth an A+ at my 6 month cleaning.  We highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist and just bought my second waterpik from Amazon for my other home and it works great.</li>
    <li> the waterpik ultra is far superior to any water flosser we have ever used.  i use this waterpik at least once daily and sometimes twice.  my dental hygienist has noticed a difference in staining and gum health since i started using it.  the water stream is a STRONG pulsating stream.  on high setting it&#x27;s so powerful it hurts when aimed wrong into your cheek or back of your throat.  but that&#x27;s fine because the power is what you want to wash out all the plaque building particles between your teeth and gums.  for me, the water pressure is like the water pressure in a shower--it can never be too strong.   i also pour a little listerine in with the water and after using it, my mouth feels like it just got a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. excellent product--will definitely purchase again when the old one wears out.</li>
    <li> My cordless tooth brush works better for plaque removal. This is a little complicated to install the water bin. It has to be just right or it won&#x27;t work. Rarely use it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. It cleans better than any floss or brush-pic ever could. I was surprised at the value you get for your money.</li>
    <li> My classic Waterpik broke after 5 years (see my other review). Although more expensive, this one takes up less space on the faucet counter and is quieter (for the moment). The switch mechanism is better. I prefer the new power control which is located on the reservoir rather then the handle.    The advertised size is the size of the box, not the device. It&#x27;s actually 5 1/2(w) X 7(h) X 4 1/2(d) inches.</li>
    <li> i finally bought a new waterpic after many years of using an old model. the old one always suffered from not enough water capacity. always had to mix a separate container with water/and hydrogen peroxide and mouthwash. before i could finish a good job of cleaning i would always run out of liquid and have to refill container. well the new ultra flosser i bought is much worse about running out of liquid before i finish flossing. it also has less pressure than old one. i would have kept the old one if i had known.</li>
    <li> I like this item, The handle with the hose line retracts well into the unite for a neat appearance. the pressure knob is easy to adjust. It does a good job of flossing your teeth they feel really good afterward. I also like the storage tray on the top it stores most of your picks. Unite seem heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I used the reviews on line to select the Waterpik Waterflosser Ultra. I used it and liked it very much...at first. It is compact and was effective, with a great choice of pik heads. One evening about three weeks into using it the darn thing slowed down on its own, sending a spray with hardly any pressure. The next day there was no pressure. The pik no longer worked! After 21 days of use it no longer works. Amazon won&#x27;t take it back. A waste of money. I am now looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> Serves everyone&#x27;s needs.  We have a &amp;#34;his and her&amp;#34;s, where we need to change out the piks. That&#x27;s the one minor problem and it is most likely operator error.  Two components need to be checked when you change out the head or you will be squirted. Otherwise, it feels wonderful!  Get the water temperature right and bye bye painful, temperature sensitive teeth. I suggest you check that you have enough surface area around your sink to use this.  For some, sink space is a deterrent.  You&#x27;ll need approximately 6 inches x 3 inches for the container to sit  within approximately 1.5 feet of a sink with an outlet nearby.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I discovered I have tonsil stones. Anyone who has these knows how horrible and painful picking these little bastards out can be. My ENT recommended this, so I gave it a shot. To my horror and delight, stones actually came out.  I picked the pointy attachment on a low setting, put the end in the tonsil crypt, and let er&#x27; rip. It took a few tries which soaked the bathroom, but it is the best solution there is, compared to a tonsillectomy. Be careful not to use a high setting because it can injure the tonsil, with bleeding and infections and all that. Next I just need to learn how to use it on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with features that far surpass the comparable Conair model.  The top lid storage is a great improvement and the pressure adjustment is well-metered via the knob.  Overall it is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.  After having used the Conair version for the last three years, this is a welcomed improvement.</li>
    <li> The product works great, wish i could use mine.  The button which stops the water malfunctioned (stuck off) contacted support suggesting that they could just send the replacement part.  They agreed, lost an email with my address and finally said they sent it but would take 20 business days.  I am still waiting.  really, how hard would it be to send this item priority mail.  It has been over a month without use of this product.</li>
    <li> I paid twice the price for a Waterpik at my pharmacy that didn&#x27;t last very long, probably because I used it so much. This one is more convenient to use and takes up less space on my counter. Needless to say, it does a great job. My hygienist says that since I have used the Waterpik, my cleaning takes less time. She also says I should floss, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary now. My dentist concurs. I wish I had started using a Waterpik years ago to avoid the expense of all the fillings and crowns I have needed.</li>
    <li> 3 1/2 stars... This was a replacement/upgrade.  I like the larger water tank and the settings allow a great deal of flexibility.  The power cord is a nice length; a nice look; the storage in the top is convenient; the variety of implements is a plus; and you can use mouthwash with it.  Minuses:  Noiser than my other ones (rattles like the dickens!), coiled tube connected to base not long enough to reach to mouth, holder design makes for a bit of an awkward insertion back into base&#x27;s holder--definitely needs to be re-engineered with more consumer input; top has a tendency to slip into the tank when being re-placed if you&#x27;re not really careful.  As for the pik implement, the ejection button is placed a bit too close to the area where I hold the pik and several times, I&#x27;ve moved my hand a bit to get a better angle and ejected the pik, getting a lot wetter than I wanted.  All-in-all (this is my 3rd WaterPik), it&#x27;s not a bad little system for the price.  It would be nice to see them fix the above minuses.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this wasn&#x27;t recommended earlier in my life but I am glad to have it now. This machine works wonders.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it, Cleaner than clean gum line,</li>
    <li> Have used it for a month now and found it works as promised.  It took a couple of tries before I realized the tip has to \\&quot;click\\&quot; in before the seal is tight.  Once I did that, no more leaking and the water pressure was just right.</li>
    <li> Pros: &lt;br /&gt;Works as you&#x27;d expect; Got two of these, one for me and one for my fiancee. Both work great. No issues in the past 1.5 months we&#x27;ve owned them. The pressure setting of 2-3 is plenty sufficient for me. Many tips included, but I only use one or two.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Water runs out before I finish - the water tank could&#x27;ve been a little larger. I have to fill-up twice to finish. But, I guess this is not such a big deal and also helps to keep the size smaller. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Comments: &lt;br /&gt;I hate flossing, so this is a big deal for me. My dentist says I should floss and use this for flushing out stuff, but I&#x27;m going to ignore his recommendation. He also said that my teeth are in good shape. I&#x27;ve decided to use this, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m gonna do. We&#x27;ll see what he says on my next visit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product. I used a Waterpik 40 years ago when I wore braces and decided to buy one for my 13 yr old (now in braces) and 9 year old (who doesn&#x27;t like to floss). We&#x27;ve divided up the multiple floss heads so we each have our own. It does the trick and they think it&#x27;s fun! It&#x27;s got powerful pressure - so be prepared to sacrifice water spots on your mirror (if your kids don&#x27;t suppress the pause button while spitting) for the peace-of-mind that it&#x27;s helping to prevent cavities and future dental bills!</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended an oral cleaning progam using a waterpik , which suprised me as I have no serious dental problems. The original New Ultra  Water Jet by waterpik seemed too pricey but it had more features. It took  a long time to descide because of so many cheaper one&#x27;s on the market. Amazon was the best price beating Wal Mart by $20.00.plus free shipping minus tax. It&#x27;s wonderful for using precribed Oral rinse a cap full diluted. Anyway it&#x27;s very powerful jet stream as I can only use it on 3 power and it goes to 10.  IT IS MY BEST EVER CHOICE.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get a Waterpik since I have sensitive gums.  I use it at least twice a week and my gums feel good.  Glad that I got the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Compact, light and much more quiet then old machines.Water jet has more powerful  then older models. Only negative is the tip release button is up front on the same  same side of your thumb. When using you tend to hit the button and eject the  tip and  water goes everywhere.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dentist to use this to improve my teeth hygiene, and was asked to revisit in a month. It made a night and day difference for my teeth&#x27;s cleanliness before and after. But of course you still need to floss :)... and that is why 4 stars and not 5.</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this item.  My husband was complaining that he had a toothache and I decided to replace a previously departed water pik that had bit the dust about a year ago.  Lo and behold the toothache turned out to be a popcorn kernal skin stuck below his gum line and from that day forward, he doesn&#x27;t miss a day without using the water pik.  You just can&#x27;t beleive what is left in your mouth after brushing and flossing!  This unit even comes with a tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> This waterjet is not lacking in power.  I started using it on the lowest setting, the power has diminished slightly over the past 2 months but I just turn the power up a notch.  You will not be dissapointed in this purchase.  Makes your teeth &amp; gums feel great.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS FOR MY DAUGHTER, WHO LOVES IT AND USES IT EVERY DAY&lt;br /&gt;WHICH MAKES ME HAPPY.GUESS I&#x27;LL GET ONE FOR MYSELF TOO.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this product that I ordered a second one for my wife. Probably could have gotten away with one since it is so easy to change tips and it comes with extras but I figured for the price I&#x27;d just get us each one. One word of caution though it is very powerful and works much better than flossing, a couple of times I have set it too high and caused myself some discomfort. It is just a learning process. My Wife and I both agree that it is amazing how clean and refreshing our mouths feel after using it and it is so easy to use that we do it twice a day, something we never seemed to accomplish when flossing.</li>
    <li> Dosen&#x27;t leak, has plenty of power, looks and stores nicely.  I thought I left a review about a month ago but I don&#x27;t see any reviews since 2007 on the page, hacked maybe?</li>
    <li> I bought this thing after getting Invisalign braces, because I&#x27;m constantly cleaning them and my teeth.  My kids, who hate brushing, love using this with me, and we brush our teeth three times a day now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to make a HUGE water reservoir, because I refill this thing at least once every time I use it.  If anyone knows where to get a larger reservoir, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to have the portable unit as well, for when I&#x27;m at work.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, and has some advantages over the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; that we had for about twenty years.  We had to give that one up after the little bayonet flange that held on the top of the pump cracked, causing a severe leak.  The Ultra is unnecessarily tall [doesn&#x27;t fit under medicine cabinet door], and the horizontal on/off rocker switch requires holding the unit so that it doesn&#x27;t just slide down the counter when pressed; the vertical slide switch on the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; was much more convenient.  The instructions for this one suggest placing the nozzle in one&#x27;s mouth before turning it on; even at half-power that could cause considerable trauma [we always test it in the sink first]  And the lid doesn&#x27;t even include enough slots for the nozzles that are included; some will inevitably be lost or ignored..</li>
    <li> Love it! My teeth are so much cleaner</li>
    <li> Was as described and works as expected.</li>
    <li> I love my new waterpik that my dentist recommended.  My only complaint is that it has soo many heads they don&#x27;t all fit into the compartment easily.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I&#x27;ve had problems with my gums for years, so on my dentist&#x27;s advice, I started using this with a warm salt water solution.  On my next visit to the dentist, there was noticeable improvement and my dentist told me if the improvement keeps up, I could start coming less often.  Easy to use, reservoir holds plenty of water, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is our second Waterpic.  It does a great job and since we have owned the Waterpic, dental checkups have been better.  The service was great and fast!!!</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT THAT THE JET STREAM WOULD BE JUST A BIT STRONGER. BUT IT DOES THE JOB. PRICED WELL. :)&lt;br /&gt;THANX</li>
    <li> I have used an older Waterpik for at least the last 40 years.  This new one is amazing!  Quiet, easy to use and much better designed.  A real winner.  Also does a better job.</li>
    <li> You know that this product is a winner when your periodontist and your general dentist both tell you to keep doing what you are doing to maintain healthy teeth and gums. Twice a day does it.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this machine!  In fact, we bought another one for our second home and use it every day!  This is as important as your toothbrush!  Every house should own this water flosser!</li>
    <li> I hate to floss.  My teeth are tight and it&#x27;s hard to get to my back teeth.  So I am always getting preached to at my dental cleaning.  I haven&#x27;t been to one since I got my waterpik, but I think it&#x27;s going to be good.  I love how it feels and love how it removes all little food particles I didn&#x27;t know were there.  I use it sometimes more that twice a day just for a quick cleaning. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> This is my third Waterpik.  The second one I had lasted for years.  This one works very well.  The one complaint I have is for some reason this new one is so loud.  The other 2 I had were not loud at all.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very happy with my waterpic. I&#x27;d rather use it than floss.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quiet.  Has alot of attachment.  I find the pressure a little weaker than what I am used to.  It is a good water pik.</li>
    <li> A MUST have for those with braces. I think I&#x27;ll keep using it after my braces are removed. Much easier than flossing. I love it. I&#x27;ve had mine for about two months now with no problems.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  It works very well and I look forward to my next Dentist visit for confirmation of it&#x27;s effectiveness.  There are some improvements that I can see immediately.  The instructions were not very detailed. While it seems obvious how to use the device, a description of the functions on the handle would have been a help.  How to position the various heads as well as their function would have been valuable.&lt;br /&gt;The connecting hose between the body and the head of the device will be a point of failure.  An extra hose and the instructions for changing it should have been included.&lt;br /&gt;While I enjoy using the product, I have not owned it long enough to evaluate it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t floss regularly, this is second best and actually flushes out more particles than you&#x27;d ever think are still lodged between your teeth. I had a piece of popcorn stuck that floss could not remove and voila&#x27;, it came right out with this.  The kids love to use it as well and we saved the special pik for the hubby who always has to endure \\&quot;dental scaling\\&quot; even if he flosses daily. I was tempted to get a rechargeable one but didn&#x27;t like the idea that I&#x27;d have to refill it several times. With this, I fill the tub and it&#x27;ll do both rows (inside/out). Easy to use even for my 9 yr old. We&#x27;re only at #2 and the jet is plenty strong.  I recommend it for family use. Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Great product! Many welcome improvements over the old model, which I had for over 10 years. The W-100 is much quieter and vibrates substantially less. The flow-stop button works perfectly. The in-lid nozzle storage makes a lot more sense.  Overall, the new design is much more pleasing to the eye. The new design also wisely reduces the amount of pressure available, thus lessening the likelyhood of tongue, gum or other tissue damage.( My dentist told me he always recommended that his patients set the earlier model on the lowest possible pressure.) I strongly recommend the W-100.</li>
    <li> This is the third Waterpik I have purchased. I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I just received this item last week and I love it.  It really does clean in between the gum lines and it feels like I was just at the dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Waterpik in August, 2006 from Wal-Mart.  It was ok except for some inconvenience with the water-holding button in the handler.  The unit stopped working this year, a little earlier than the purchase anniversary.  I bought a second Watrerpik, this time from amazon.com (for $10 less than at Wal-Mart).  It is very good, certainly feels better than the first one.  So, I suspect that the first one was just defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I hesitantly contacted Waterpik&#x27;s customer service, and explained what happened with my first waterpik, and the fact that it was still under warranty.  The customer service was very helpful and prompt.  It agreed to send me a brand new waterpik for replacement at no cost at all.  In about a week or ten days (don&#x27;t recall exactly now), I got the replacement unit.  It works as great as the new one I bought at amazon.com.  So, now I have one waterpik at home and one at work.  I definitely would recommend this product and their customer service!</li>
    <li> After you get done flossing with this WaterPik your whole mouth fills clean. After I finished brushing my teeth all around, you would think your teeth is super clean. Think again, So I used this WaterPick and all kinds of little pieces of food came out of my mouth. You cannot go wrong buying this.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik. I am 30 years old and have decided to get my mouth straightened out starting with an expander and ending with braces. Food gets stuck everywhere, but I just use the waterpik right after I eat and never have to worry about the food. I have the expander in my mouth for 12 months and then braces for 24 months so I figured this was a good investment. Some of the reviews complained about it leaking. I have not had any problems with mine. It is so powerful too. The first time I used it I turned it up all the way and bruised the roof of my mouth. I now have it set lower, but the power is certainly there. There are so many attachments too. It is making this whole orthodontics experience much better. Definitely a worthwhile purchase!</li>
    <li> very good, worked as described in the specifications. small with small foot print. a great buy if you want to better floss your teeth.</li>
    <li> Waterpik must have hired the engineers from Braun. This is a well-made QUIET running machine equal to the Braun I had that finally failed after 3 years with a broken hose. The pressure adjuster is smooth and solid, and the handle has a button (just like the Braun did) that you can temporarily stop the water flow while you you move the tip somewhere else in your mouth or to the sink. Small footprint and heavy weight so it won&#x27;t \\&quot;walk\\&quot; around on your sink top. Highly Recommeded - the first Waterpik I really liked - I&#x27;ve owned 3 Waterpiks (all NOISY and clunky) in  the past.  BTW, I&#x27;ve still got 31 of my 32 teeth at 64 years of age - one 3rd molar is gone. No root canals, no bridges, no head... I mean, toothaches.</li>
    <li> I am very satified with my new Waterpik  Much better than the previous one.  It has many options and works amazingly well.  Very versatile.  I like the smaller footprint</li>
    <li> Wow. I was way disappointed with this product. I had been wanting to try this for a long time and was given this as a gift because I am teeth cleaning freak. I tried all the different devices and was particularly let down my the tongue scraper, it did nothing but spray water everywhere, the toothbrush leaked too much unless you used the pause button, but the worst is yet to come. While using the actual waterpik spray device the force of the water, and I only had it set on THREE caused a chunk of my gum to come out. I bled everywhere and was spitting out tissue. I have very healthy teeth and gums and the force from only being on a low number was shocking. I couldnt feel it on one or two, and a three was so forceful it caused damage. Upon reading more about the product Ive pretty much determined mine is defective, and have contacted Waterpik about the freak accident!</li>
    <li> perfect in all ways -  better than sonicare tooth brush. - teeth feel great after use and appear cleaner. A.  Koenig</li>
    <li> Immediately after eating I used it to see how it would do on food particles. Using the simple nozzle attachment and a low power setting, it removed virtually everything. Subsequent flossing only removed a small amount of plaque-like material.    There is a brush attachment which does a nice job of polishing teeth and massaging gums. Other attachments function more as the product name indicates. The pulsating action feels great.     I highly recommend this device!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1 month.  I had a dental cleaning this morning and the dentist was very pleased with the results.  I told him I was using a waterpik (I don&#x27;t like flossing) and he stated that it was easy to tell it was working.    I really like this unit.  It takes up very little room on my vanity, and hold just enough water, the adjustable intensity is very nice and the unit is extremely easy to clean.  No leaks, no mess and has just enough attachments.    Buy this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought it for my family and they loved it. However, some of the tips were useless to me.</li>
    <li> I would like a turn off on the hand unit rather than just an interrupter pressure button, and it takes up too much space on my counter top.</li>
    <li> This is a good powerful device with flexible power settings. I use it twice daily on average. My old self contained model that controlled stream strength by changing attachments died. This model simply uses a dial to do the same thing while providing multiple strengths. Multiple attachments for different functions are also provided. I haven&#x27;t used any, other than the standard cleaning one. Don&#x27;t be put off by the attached tube; it magically goes back into its holder. Great product.    Amazon provided excellent response, as always. They&#x27;ve become my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; on-line shopping center.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because my dentist, Dr. John McAllister recommended it after having laser surgery on my gums.  I can feel the difference using this device instead of just brushing and flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are very good and easy to follow.  The only complaint we have with this is that the cord attaching the flosser to the tank is too short and too curly.  But it works well.  The real test is if my dentist sees the difference on my next visit.</li>
    <li> I recently replaced an older version that had a grey/brownish tint to the water container. This new version is quieter and the hose is improved, however this is outweighed by the fact that it is less powerful than the older version that I was using. Even the older version seemed like it could use a bit more power on it&#x27;s highest 10 setting, but this new version&#x27;s highest setting&#x27;s pressure is equivalent to the the older version&#x27;s 7 or 8 setting. I feel that this is only useful for removing particles that are pretty loose, and that is pretty useless to me, thus two stars. When I have some free time, I may open it up to see if there is a hack way to turn up the power.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to. Once that is accomplished and you understand how to set the pressure you&#x27;ll find that this machine does an excellent job of water flossing. Leaves the mouth feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> It really is just a great product&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday the multiple speeds really help if you have extra sensitive gum-lines&lt;br /&gt;One thing is if you dont need the higher settings I would reccomend just to get the cordless one&lt;br /&gt;The cord itself is nice after each use it stays coiled and everything keeps together in a nice little package&lt;br /&gt;Ive had it for several months now and even when i go on trips i will go through the trouble to take it with me</li>
    <li> No sooner had I started using this than I wondered how I could have gone my whole life without ever having one. I can&#x27;t stand it when my teeth feel dirty, and there&#x27;s only so much that regular flossing and brushing can do. The Waterpik dislodges particles even after I&#x27;ve already cleaned my teeth thoroughly with other methods. It is also great to use on occasions when you want a cleaner feeling in your mouth but don&#x27;t want to ruin your palate with the strong flavors of Listerine or toothpaste, such as right before eating a meal. After two years of daily use mine is finally starting to have some problems with low water pressure and the button sticking, but I think this is just a consequence of scaling from hard water, so hopefully a good vinegar cleanse will restore it to normal functionality. If not, I&#x27;ll be investing in a new one.</li>
    <li> This changed my life. You need to change your life too.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for those sensitive to regular flossing!</li>
    <li> My dentist is impressed with how white my teeth are &amp; how good of shape they are in as well.&lt;br /&gt;He recommended this product so I purchased it from Amazon and had it in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;You will not believe even if your a diligent brusher, how much food particles are still left behind &amp; how much the WaterPik Ultra removes for you. A must is to fill the reservoir half way and always mix about a shot glass of your favorite mouthwash. I never use this with just warm water. A must for great mouth hygiene.</li>
    <li> Really gets in between my teeth were I can&#x27;t always floss. Good price</li>
    <li> This is easy to use for my kids and works well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is b/c it really does not take enough water to get your teeth cleaned so you have to stop and refill and I wish you can change setting while using it.</li>
    <li> Works great for one user. A second set of piks would be helpful to allow  another user. This is a replacement for another that lasted 5 years.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik was recommended to me by my hygenist, and although Amazon&#x27;s price is highly competitive, and the product works adequately, it is flimsy, and in my opinion, not well-made.  Not many pik/flossers on the market, so it is probably the best in its category.</li>
    <li> My dentist tells all of his patients to get one of these.  After shipping around for months and found the best price on amazon.  This product does a great job of cleaning your teeth and gums.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and recieved it yesterday. I am not very impressed personally. I dont own anyother water piks so i cant compare to other models, but this product is not 100 percent what i expected. Its ok for the price i guess but there are still some problems that i would like to adress.    1) the water tank is not large enough for me. I usually end up refilling it at least once when i use it.     2) i think the pressure could be a little higher. I have never used one before and the first time i did i had to turn it up to 10 to get results.     3) I wish the water didnt pulsate. I guess i needed to do more research because i didnt know that it would do that, and i dont like it. It shakes your whole mouth along with the water cord and the handle. It would be better if it was a constant stream instead.    I dont hate this product i just wish i would have looked a little more for a product that fits me better. This product is nice and it does what it is supposed to i just think that for the price it could do it a little better.</li>
    <li> I NEEDED this unit, as I have, well, &#x27;gum issues&#x27;, and let&#x27;s leave it at that.  Got the text message that the package had arrived at home, and was thinking about how clean my teeth would feel tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got home, unpacked, read instructions, removed cardboard, rinsed out the tank,  and then......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned it on, it ran for 5 seconds, but it wasn&#x27;t right.  It started out weak, ran down to a stop, and died!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a slip of paper inside that said &amp;#34;Call us first before returning to retailer&amp;#34;.  I tried, got a &#x27;Sorry, we&#x27;re closed, try tomorrow&#x27;.  Missed by 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will drive to the store, pay more, and just get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason for 2 stars, instead of 1, is that I got Instant Credit, really easy UPS return, and that counts for something.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old one.  The design on this model is quite an improvement.  The reservoir is more ergonamic.. the coil on the pick retains it&#x27;s shape and returns to it&#x27;s place very easily...smaller footprint.  I don&#x27;t gerneally use the cover, because I turn it the reservoir upside-down to air dry, but it is a handy place for the accessories.  I would have given this item 5-stars had it not been for the pause button sticking.  After about a month of use, whenever it&#x27;s pressed I cannot unpause it without turning the whole thing off</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this waterpik anymore! But you should use this in proper way especially if you have sensitive gum.</li>
    <li> A nice product for blasting out the gunk from your gumline and between teeth.  Makes a chugging noise but is minimally annoying and to be expected for a device like this.  Be sure to follow instructions about shutting off the stream before you take the tip out of your mouth otherwise you will have water all over the place, or zap yourself with the waterstream which can be pretty strong.  The side mounted on/off switch could be improved to make it easier to turn off the stream because right now it is side-mounted and so you might end up pushing it over instead of turning it off.  If the switch was top-mounted it would be easier to press.</li>
    <li> I think this is effective as a supplement to flossing, but not as replacement. I think this may depeend on your teeth. I easily get things stuck in my teeth. I&#x27;m sure this is cleening under the gums better, but it can&#x27;t dislodge everything. If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement for flossing, probably not the way to go, but again, it may depend on your teeth.</li>
    <li> This product replaced my rechargeable flosser which had trouble holding a charge after only one year.&lt;br /&gt;I like the larger capacity of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received it only two days after ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;Because it runs on AC, it&#x27;s always ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;Only dislike: The on/off switch being on the reservoir instead of on the flosser.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my first water flosser purchase based on the recommendation of my dentist. So far, it&#x27;s great. It does make a pretty loud noise when its on, but i have no other experience in other water flosser to see if its louder than usual. I use it after i brush my teeth and often times i can still see little bits/pieces of food coming out after water floss. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is a great Waterpik.  The pressure control dial is accurate, and the reservoir tank is the perfect size.  You have an ample amount of water to do a thorough job for your entire mouth.  I use this in addition to flossing.  Adding a mouthwash to the water is a good idea.  I have owned mine now for a few years, and it still works just fine.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the new model. It is much quieter,( just like they said it would be.)  The rotateabl tip is awesome.</li>
    <li> I wish I had something like this 20 years ago.  For manufacturing quality I rate it a D-.  I think it is cheap and flimsy, and the tank valve leaks sometimes.  For its function it gets an A.  I love the quality of cleaning that I never got from flossing.  At 68 years of age, I have all my own teeth and I want to keep them that way.  This will definitely help.  My dentist cautioned me not to go too deeply below the gum line, but otherwise he endorsed it.  Buying on Amazon saved me $10-$15 over buying locally.</li>
    <li> I hated flossing just because of how crappy of a job I always did. I got this on recommendation from the local dentist and come to find out it is awesome. It comes with multiple heads to allow for different types of cleaning (targeted, braces, etc). Sadly when you fire it up it sounds like a generator and defiantly cant be used when people are sleeping as it sounds like a lawn mower stuttering out when it runs out of gas (not that loud but the same idea). Remember to set it low to start (i went with 3) and give it a 3 second wait time per tooth following the gum line to the next tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE READY: It gets messy and you cant stop it. It looks like a bird played in the sink after Im done with using my waterpik and somehow the whole bathroom gets water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all its quick, easy, and more enjoyable than picking with a flossier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Run some mouth wash in the tank to get a better clean, but after done using run some water through the tube to get it out. That&#x27;s enjoyable freshening.</li>
    <li> We really like this Water Pik. It works really well and is easy to use. I would recommend  this to anyone looking to buy one. My son has braces on his teeth so that is the main reason we purchased it and it works great since it is difficult to floss when you have braces.</li>
    <li> great for braces works great</li>
    <li> This is a good unit though not as sturdy as i would like for it to be. You can often feel slight seperation of the hand unit when the unit is running. nice sized tank works perfect for single use. (note: if you add a little mouthwash to the warm water your mouth feels much much cleaner after using it)    The attachments work great and i find myself using most of them for their intended uses.    Only operates off of 120V so don&#x27;t travel overseas with it and plug it into 220v</li>
    <li> if you thought what floss pulls out was gross, wait til you see what falls into the sink with the water pik.  you can use the plaque head with warm water and feel like you just left the dentist</li>
    <li> I got this on the advice/recommendation of my dental hygienist. Time will be the ultimate arbiter. It is supposed aid with my gums.&lt;br /&gt; Everything has worked correctly and hopefully I will have long life out of it.</li>
    <li> Shipment came on time as stated. It is very easy to use and performs better than I expected. It works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just really happy with this product, my gums feel cleanier and healthier. I would have liked the tank to be bigger, but I believe it has this size so that you don&#x27;t over use it, like I sometimes like to do...</li>
    <li> I love this ultra waterpik.  My Gums are feeling better everyday, which is completely different from how they would feel after flossing.  I would recommend you read the directions and start on the lowest setting when first starting because this thing will blow your gums off.  I am able to turn the setting ups an I feel good about that because it shows my gums are getting stronger with every use.</li>
    <li> works great!  has the lightest flow all the way to the very powerful.  nice and quiet... much better than my last one... I have used 4 different types over the last 20 years and I like this one the best so far!</li>
    <li> This stuff works well in flossing with high pressure water into your mouth between your teeth and gums.  Definately removes alot of junk and rubbish.  The ONLY reason why 3 stars here is because after a few months of daily use the water flosser looses its POWER at pressure.  Either that my gums gotten stronger.  But I have tested it on sniping bathroom container at a distance in beginning.  Then I did it again, and well it doesn&#x27;t knock the containers down anymore.  Worst thing its the same distance and there is less shampoo or body wash in it too! P.S. adding some listernine or mouth freshener into the h20 liquid really  makes it even better at cleaning.  Although waterpik don&#x27;t recommend it.  I say F them!  Obviously its NOT quality then!</li>
    <li> After 3 months of use, some internal little bit of plastic in the handle which holds the piks failed, making it useless (unless you just want to spray water all over your bathroom.)  Very disappointing because it seemed to work fine prior to that and is supposed to be the top of their line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this water flosser because I can get a little obsessive over dental hygiene. I would rather spend a little bit of time and money to prevent any dental issues and expensive visits to my dentist. I floss, brush, rinse with mouthwash, and scrape my tongue. This water flosser seems loosen and remove plaque, bacteria and food in places the toothbrush, floss or mouthwash can&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of items that prevented a 5 star rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The reservoir is a little small. I like to make sure each area between teeth gets an equal amount of time flossed with water, so I leave the water pik at least 4-5 seconds and a couple seconds around the gums of each tooth. If i do this, the tank is usually more than halfway empty by the time i reach my bottom set of teeth. If I spend a little time with the back of my teeth too, I would have to fill up the take 2 - 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pretty loud. I&#x27;ve read reviews that it is quiet and I would have to strongly disagree. It&#x27;s basically a miniature powerhose, so it&#x27;s going to sound like a a minature powerhose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of attachments, most of which I don&#x27;t use or haven&#x27;t found the need yet.</li>
    <li> This product is substantially improved over the previous WaterPik I owned. It is quieter, the water container has a lid with accessories inside, and the water tubing spirals into a slot. However it would be a superior product if the container-forming lid snapped shut. It tends to drop open when lifted. And the spiral water tubing should be made easily replaceable.</li>
    <li> The dental hygienist and dentist recommended I get a Water Pik Ultra Dental Water Jet for daily use to reduce the size of the measureable pockets in my gums, especially those that pose a risk which are next to a couple of costly crowns.  I was skeptical.  To my surprize, this thing works, as I&#x27;ve seen it remove food particles I would have had no idea were still trapped between my teeth, and low in the gumline.  I can&#x27;t vouch for the pressure of the jets of water this model produces as I have nothing to compare it with ... this is my first such machine.  Soon, I will get a report after six months of use.  I hope it works as suggested.    The specific details which may help others decide:     Such a simple machine was more expensive than I thought it should be, and the plastics used seem rather flimsy and easy to break, and they certainly do wear quickly with vigorous use.  But, when it comes to that preventative maintainance cost versus dental fees for meds and special treatments, you put your money where your mouth is.      You gotta practice using this thing, holding your head over the sink bowl, because if you want to see where you are pointing the tips inside your mouth, it is easy to squirt water all over the bathroom mirror, walls, etc. I took it into the shower with a ground-faulted extension cord a few times, but that&#x27;s a hassle I now skip.     The only important attachment to me is the one tip provided to produce the strongest jet from this simple water pump, and this tip has gotten plenty of use ... and is now split after approximately 100 to 120 uses. So, I am looking for replacement tips.  The other tips to me are useless, and the container tray which affixes to the top of the tank is in the way when I want to fill up the tank for use.      I bought the 100 WC here at Amazon for a discount over a local retailer and big box store.  It was the best price and a good deal as it included prompt shipping costs.     I give it three stars.</li>
    <li> I took the advice of my dentist and hygienist and purchased this item after my last appointment. It is easy to use and works quite well for the special care my permanent bridges and gums require.</li>
    <li> The design of this latest iteration of the water pick is better than previous models. It&#x27;s not perfect and contains implements that are not really useful, but overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> About time they made a replaceable hose!  I was not going to buy any more of these because the hose rots and breaks and then the whole unit becomes worthless as there is no way to fix it.  After three of them I was fed up. I think built in self destruct so you have to buy another one. They may say to get the best hose it can not last long and be a great hose or something but the other brand I have used the hose does not rot out but it does not have enough pressure.   I like this brand more than the other products I have tried because it has much higher pressure options.  I also like the storage feature on the lid.  Looking at the applicator handle it looks like there is no way to connect the replacement hose to the handle so I assume I will have to pay for a handle and a hose when it rots out?  I certainly would never buy the models that do not have the replacement hose option,I have three of them and they don&#x27;t work because of broken hoses!</li>
    <li> As others have correctly mentioned, this device is very low quality and does not last long.  The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet stopped working a week after I received it from Amazon. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed at Amazon for selling such cheap products. Save your money and purchase something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks for over 35 years, and as far as oral irrigation is concerned, they are excellent.  Daily use will toughen  gums and dislodge food particles that might otherwised be missed with brushing, which generally means less tooth decay and healthier gums.  Every dentist I&#x27;ve ever had recommends them, though the Waterpik is NOT a substitute for flossing.    I&#x27;ve used many different models of Waterpik, since as with any appliance, sooner or later, things wear out.  For the circa 1970s models, it was later; for the 1990s, it was much sooner.  The more recent models have grown particularly irksome with their inconveniences.  I am happy to say that many improvements have been made with the Ultra, to wit:    The Good  This model has many refinements, including a smaller footprint on the counter, a reservoir with a covering top that provides storage for a myriad of attachments (though still haven&#x27;t figured out how -- or why -- to use the gimmicky tongue cleaner).  I also like the placement of the wand, which is now in the middle rather than on the side, and it neatly fits into its holder with the cord coiling behind it.  Said cord seems a tad longer than previous models, though this might just be the better placement of the wand.  Additionally, this model seems somewhat quieter than my older one.    The Bad  The water pressure doesn&#x27;t seem quite as strong as earlier models, but it is adequate to do the job.  The reservoir is on the small side, and those really enthusiastic about oral irrigation may find they need to refill it to get the job done.      The Ugly  Whoever decided that the reservoir should be blue has obviously never looked at most bathroom countertop accessories, because this color goes with nothing!  I almost didn&#x27;t buy this model because of the wretched color, and I am planning to cover the reservoir with contact paper.  What&#x27;s wrong with an inoffensive frosted white?  This is the single worst thing about the Ultra (and why I refuse to giveit five stars), and only a strong desire to hold onto all of my teeth as long as possible overcame my aversion to something this unaesthetic.  However, sometimes one must make sacrifices.    I&#x27;ve only had this model for several days, so I can&#x27;t testify as to its reliability.  On that score, so far, so good.    Bottom line:  It&#x27;s much improved over more recent models, and I definitely prefer it to the \\&quot;personal\\&quot; model.    UPDATE October 23, 2009:  I&#x27;ve had this unit about a year and a half now and use it daily.  Unfortunately, the semi-circular wand holder cracked and then broke off on one side a few weeks ago.  Unless the wand is fastened with a rubber band, it will not stay in what remains of the holder, and the slot in the base is insufficient to keep it from falling over.  Until the motor gives out (which it eventually will), I will suffer with this inconvenience, but I&#x27;m still hoping the competition comes up with something more reliable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these, one for my wife and one for myself.  Both work excellent.  They leave your mouth feeling clean.  They don&#x27;t replace flossing completely.  It was a great help after having wisdom teeth extracted, on the low setting it was easy to keep things clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away two other types in the past.  The Waterpik \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; Dental Water Jet works well, better quality product and easy to keep clean.  I highly suggest to use with a mouthwash in the water, as that will help keep it germ free.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help floss while enjoying braces. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does a good job and I like the different attachments. What I don&#x27;t like is the go-cart like motor. HOLY COW! Noise aside, this thing is powerful. Should you make this purchase you&#x27;ll like the attachment that is suppose to go along the gum line. It&#x27;s great. There are complaints about the button. I think the on/off switch should have been placed on the handle, but that would have brought electricity closer to water and my mouth... the \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button on the handle is nice because it allows me to move the pik around freely instead of having my hand firmly on the button. The pik does take some getting used to and is generally messy until you&#x27;ve mastered it. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but think i&#x27;ll stick to floss when my braces are off, as it&#x27;s just as time consuming, portable, and in the end, does a better job if done correctly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I love how gently it cleans between my teeth and then cleans my tongue.  I feel so much more confident and am happy to do something positive for my gingivitis.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a much older version and am happy my choice.  I like the features but will only use the basic style tips.</li>
    <li> I just bought the product a month ago.  I have been using since then.  Do not feel good without it.</li>
    <li> I found this Waterpik to be much quieter than my last Waterpik. It has equal water pressure but is much quieter and less vibration of the tub unit. My only complaint is the Waterpik tip dislodging from the handle during operation. I am not sure if the detach button located near the top of the handle is accidently hit by myself (because of its location) or if I am putting some sort of pressure on the handle which is causing the tip to disengage from the handle. This action causes the water to spray either on me or on the wall until I re-engage the tip. Other than this problem I find that the unit does everything that I expected. I would probably buy this unit again.</li>
    <li> Received the Waterpik Ulta Dental-opened the box, spent 3-4 minutes ( or less )on the instructions, set it up in about a minute-and Voila----it worked perfectly. Couldn&#x27;t have been easier.  Minor drawback. The reservoir could have held a bit more water for my taste, but it is not very meaningful at all.</li>
    <li> After PAINSTAKINGLY perusing the reviews for every water jet known to man, I chose the Waterpik Ultra. The motor is quiet, the design is sleek with a small footprint, and it&#x27;s easy to operate. My last Waterpik ran well for 12 years, and I used it exclusively for sinus irrigation. I look forward to another happy relationship with this replacement machine.</li>
    <li> Good device and really gets stuff out from between your teeth, better than a tooth brush and dental floss (though not a substitute for either).  It&#x27;s got 4 cleaning picks and other gadgets.  The cord retracts and has variable pressure.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. My dentist recommended it and I feel that it really helps keep my teeth and gums clean. It is worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]I had a waterpik water jet over 30 years ago, but lost it during a move to a new house. This new model is even better than the one I had before.I did try the smaller travel waterpik, but it didn&#x27;t hold enough water to finish the job without refilling the resavoir.My dentist recommended these as well as the sonic tooth brushes.  Dale 8/2/08</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this machine. My mouth feels so clean after use, and it truly is amazing the stuff that still comes out after brushing and flossing (although flossing seems unecessary if using this machine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely says in the instructions to empty it after every use, and to unplug the unit, so don&#x27;t pay attention to reviewers who say the reservoir leaks, especially if they are leaving water sitting in it after use (which is kind of gross--the idea of using water that&#x27;s been sitting for hours to clean your mouth????). I can&#x27;t imagine not using up the water anyway, it only takes about 2 minutes---the recommended time to brush your teeth, so I can do 2 minutes for each to get teeth THIS clean.&lt;br /&gt;And you can always just put less water in. The reservoir is very easily lifted up so that you can run water into it, and dump out any left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the test, I used Listerine Smart Rinse after brushing and flossing; this particular product \\&quot;shows\\&quot; leftover plaque by clinging to it and helping to remove any left in your mouth---it turns color so that you see clear rinse with tiny colored liquid---supposedly the plaque. I originally thought the rinse didn&#x27;t work, because it ALWAYS had colored particles when I spit out after brushing and flossing, no matter how careful and thorough I was. Well, after using the waterpik the first time, I tried the Listerine rinse again----not a single bit of colored liquid pieces, all of it was clear---proving to me that not only did the waterpik get at all the gunk in my mouth, but the rinse really did work. I won&#x27;t really need it anymore (I originally bought if for my kids---they didn&#x27;t ever use it, so I was just using it till it was gone) since I know the Waterpik gets it all so clean!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how long it lasts---I don&#x27;t know. But it has a 2 year warranty, and I would definitely buy another if I had to in 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/6/12 - Still have it, still love it, and it&#x27;s still working great. The only thing that broke was the lid hinge that holds the extra brushes. definitely able to deal with that after 4 years!t. The only thing that broke was the lid hinge that holds the extra brushes. definitely able to deal with that after 4 years!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik model last month after my old model had sprung a leak.   I decided to buy this upgraded model &amp; pay a few more dollars, and now that I have used it, it&#x27;s well worth the extra dollars.   I like that it has 10 different speeds.  The unit is very compact.   The lid holds the other pieces for storage.   The hand unit has a much better holder when not in use on this one also.   This is the first purchase that I have made on Amazon.  It turned out very good.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  This is my third unit over a period of 10 years   This has a brush surroundin g the pick that works great.  Suprised that everyone doesn&#x27;t use a waterpik.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Water Jet.  This my second Water Jet.  The first one is many years old and still working.  Bought a second one for seasonal residence.</li>
    <li> This model is so much more quiet than the other older models. Amazon&#x27;s price is much lower than retail stores (at the time I got it). It seemed Ok at first, but after a few months it lost power then finally stopped. Never buy this model (the blue one)... get the older moder (white one 70). I have two and they have lasted for years. I use it after each meal.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with gingivitis, and have trouble dealing with disciplined flossing, but the water pik is easy to use, and as I understand it, more effective than flossing.  I am a very happy user of this, and look forward to going to the dentist for my check up next week.  I have used it practically every night since it arrived, and I am very impressed with the visual results of it&#x27;s effectiveness.[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> Good product, though I can&#x27;t match the overflow--splatter like the suited guy in the video.  My dentist highly recommended the product and I like the clean feeling after use.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser does a good job in removing what should not be in between your teeth and gums. You have several different water pressures to pick from and it&#x27;s easy to use.  Just make sure you&#x27;re over the sink and keep your mouth open when using.  The first few times I would use the lowest setting until you get use to how it works. oh yes, remember to keep your thumb ready to push down on the blue button to stop the water flow or there will be water all over your bathroom.  It&#x27;s fun to use, I like it.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job at flossing and eliminating pockets where plaque can build up. I won&#x27;t go back to regular floss again.&lt;br /&gt;They could make the On/Off switch just a little softer on the On side can be tough to do one-handed sometimes.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My dental hygienist recommended I get and I haven&#x27;t missed a day using it, so easy and better than flossing.</li>
    <li> I threw out my ex-husbands really expensive water pik by mistake - long story! I purchased this one and had it sent to him. He loved it. It shipped quickly and in perfect condition.  A really great waterpik, priced right. I would definately recommend this product and this seller.  Red.</li>
    <li> Love this still using it.&lt;br /&gt;Less dental work when I go see my dentist :)</li>
    <li> Works great! Even the dentist was impressed with how well this took care of tartar buildup after just 3 weeks use! Easy to use!</li>
    <li> I like the various speeds available with this item.  Does a commendable job.  Easy to assemble and use.</li>
    <li> I had done research after my dentist suggested I get a water pick.  There are a lot of them out there and some are very expensive.  Between the reasonable price on the Waterpik Ultra Flosser and the terrific reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  I have had it for about a month now and could not be happier.  I always brush my teeth for about two minutes and, I thought, very thoroughly. This machine has shown me that no matter how long I brush it is not good enough.  It is not a fancy thing, but it has several attachments and is very easy to use.  I rarely write reviews but since I am (surprisingly)very pleased I wanted to let people know.</li>
    <li> This product comes with a whole bunch of extras. Multiple attachments, pressure selection knob and plenty of water capacity. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do not usually write reviews but I want others who may be considering this product to know how wonderful it is.  A couple of weeks ago I got braces (for the second time) and a co-worker of mine who also has braces recommended this product to me.  He told me it is absolutely a \\&quot;must have.\\&quot;  Well I must say, he was right.  I immediately went online to Amazon.com and purchased this product and could not be more pleased.  It is much better than regular flossing and keeps your mouth very clean and fresh.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this product.  If you are having second thoughts- think no more.</li>
    <li> its really awesome i wish i would have used it sooner some adapting to it at the beginning but my teeth are so clean my higienist said it&#x27;s kept my teeth whiter and cleaner</li>
    <li> This device was made to clean your teeth without the hassle of regular flossing. It sends streams of pressurized water in ten different settings in between your teeth and flushes out all of the material regular flossing would have missed. I&#x27;ve even flossed after using the Waterpik and was surprised to see there was no residue left behind. This device is very tricky to use the first time around. If you&#x27;re not careful, you could end up hurting yourself. Just follow the directions and you will be safe. I&#x27;ve had this device for a month and I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems, yet. I recommend this product for anyone looking for an alternative to regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device comes with six different attachments: Plaque Seeker tip, Classic Jet tip, Toothbrush tip, Orthodontic tip for braces, Pik Pocket tip for medicaments, and a tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> quick delivery-will use seller again</li>
    <li> No complaints, cleans great</li>
    <li> It works well although I wish it had a little more pressure.  I live in NYC so we have a regular size bathroom this item is to clunky for our sink space so it&#x27;s kept on my nightstand and I don&#x27;t use it as often as I would like to, because of the chore to bring it in to the bathroom and take it back out.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid &#x27;flosser&#x27; for years, so after my old one quit working - I purchased this one 7 months ago. It worked great until about a month ago, when it started to leak out of its reservoir. I contacted the company hoping they would at least offer a replacement part...this was their response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for contacting Water Pik, Inc. customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not recommend leaving water in the reservoir between uses. Please drain the reservoir of any remaining water or solution after each use, which may be done by letting the flosser run for 7-10 seconds after using the product. This should prevent the unit from leaking while not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Katie M.&lt;br /&gt;Consumer Services&lt;br /&gt;Service@waterpik.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the reservoir does not leak if it&#x27;s empty, but the whole reason for a reservoir is to hold water &amp; I love the convenience of not having to fill it every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but this will be my last!!</li>
    <li> This water flosser is amazing. I have braces and it flosses in 90 seconds with no weird feeling of floss going down under the gum line. I can feel that my gums are really strong as if being flossed with the string. The only worry is that if one has hard water going through it, I do and nothing has happened yet, it might shorten its life but I would buy another with rush delivery in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars based on the shipping was fast but it would not turn on any outlet.so I wish I could have at least seen it in action.I just ordered the shower breeze and will not have to worry about pressure spillage or electrocutions. Will follow up</li>
    <li> My gums have been with problems ever since I had a surgery in 2007, flossing did not help so my dentist recommended a water floss and wish I had done it before.  I do the water treatment after flossing and I see some food particles that will be flushed out only with the machine, so I am very glad I bought it as there is a big difference.</li>
    <li> Great product, works just as everyone says it does.  You definitely have the \\&quot;clean mouth\\&quot; feel after you start using it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Much better then using floss</li>
    <li> Purchased with dentist&#x27;s recommendation and have liked it very much. Makes cleaning my teeth easier, rarely flossed, but use this and it takes the place of flossing for good gums and strong teeth.</li>
    <li> Part of the tool kit for those who plan to hang onto their teeth as long as possible. It is surprising that after all that brushing there are still nooks and crannies with STUFF in them, and this is the final step in obsessive tooth cleaning, after the Oral-B brushing. be careful, lean over the sink or you will wind up with water all over your shirt front when you use this.</li>
    <li> Well made. Great water pressure.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing, and honestly I don&#x27;t do it, except for when something is stuck in my teeth, or when I&#x27;m about to go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this after reading the positive reviews, and honestly, it is as good as everyone says. For background information, I have never owned a product like this before, so I have nothing to compare it to. I do however have a Philips Sonicare toothbrush that I use daily.&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with an assortment of tips, however I have only used one, the regular tip. I do like how the tips store in the top of the unit. The tank is plenty big enough for one session, just make sure you don&#x27;t use really cold water if you have somewhat sensitive teeth, or you will freeze your gums.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I started off with the lowest setting, after using it on 5. Yeah, that hurt. I used it on the low setting for a couple of days while I perfected my technique.&lt;br /&gt;After I get the hang of it, I moved up from the lowest setting to now 8. My teeth have never been cleaner. I have a fixed retainer on the inside of my lower teeth and I&#x27;m sure like everyone else, getting the back teeth for flossing is always hard. Not only does all this get all the plaque from between my teeth, and from behind my retainer, the front surface of my teeth are cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I had braces and my teeth are really tight together, but I have no problems using this at all. I use this everyday before I go to sleep  and when I wake up I have fresher breath, and it seems my teeth are cleaner all day long. I have also put mouthwash in the tank one time, and while it works well, I like to rinse after with mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> sorry i buy this product not for me, i buy for  my friend, but i think my friend is happy</li>
    <li> My Waterpik is so satisfying and easy to use and I do indeed use it so much more often than I would normally brush my teeth...It&#x27;s gratifying to have gums that no longer  bleed...I&#x27;ll use this little machine til I do wear it out and purchase it&#x27;s replacement when need be...</li>
    <li> I used to have inflamed gums, \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; around the back teeth and some bleeding when I visited the dentist.  Part of the problem is I wasn&#x27;t flossing - my teeth are quite tightly spaced and the floss kept breaking, so I gave up.    I&#x27;ve used this machine for a few months and just had a dental checkup - no bleeding, no inflammation, healthy gums.    In other words - this thing cleared up a problem I&#x27;ve had for years in just a few months.    All I do is blast away at the gums and gumline at the maximum power setting after brushing, twice daily.  Lots of  bits of food come out that the tooth brush doesn&#x27;t pick off, so I guess the bacteria that used to be feeding on that  stuff have been starved out.    Bottom line: a small investment in this thing yields excellent dental and gum health - very strongly recommended, especially for anyone with gum disease.</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail yesterday and so far so good! My teeth feel much cleaner using this than they do flossing.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises and one full tank allows me to use the toothbrush and tongue cleaning tip. Helps me get into the habit of brushing twice a day.</li>
    <li> If you look on the bottom of the unit, it has a little sticker which says \\&quot;do not use more than five minutes in any two hour period.\\&quot;  I came across this after trying the unit several times in a row only to find the motor was beginning to grind to a halt.    Fortunately, the unit recovered after I gave it some time to rest.  Note there is nothing in the written instructions regarding this product limitation.    Hence this is strictly a one person use unit, providing it is only used perhaps a maximum of three times a day.    Also noted the same issue as others with not having enough storage in the container provided to actually hold all of the utensils which come with the unit.    As for the pulsation intensity, it seems to be limited.  Probably both to protect the undersized motor and to minimize gum damage from too agressive use.     I really wonder if this unit is going to last the three year warranty provided.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Works better than floss</li>
    <li> I have not tried other models.  It cleans very well but the design could be improved.  The on off switch could be a toggle as the unit slides and the top comes of with the storage  extras that fly out.</li>
    <li> I used to have The Classic Waterpik for many years until the motor gave out. I was very happy with it.     I saw the Ultra Water Flosser here and was excited after reading the description. My opinion was it seemed to be designed better than the Classic. Then I read the reviews and saw some that mention it leaked and didn&#x27;t perform well. I almost decided not to buy it but I am glad I did. I have had it for over a month and absolutely love the operation and handling of this new waterpik. It works like a champion and is much easier to use than the Classic was. I am glad I took the chance and have no regrets.    One other thing, I ended up getting it for free! I used my Amazon Visa for free shipping and my reward points to purchase it. Fabulous deal!</li>
    <li> I love my new Waterpik. My dental hygienist recommended that I get one and that I use it every day. My mouth and gums feel rejuvenated after each water flossing. Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new Waterpik!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in perfect condition as predicted! Totaly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the first water flosser product I used and it really helps to remove food from hard to reach places , using it for couple of months no issues with flosser.</li>
    <li> Before this one I used a rechargable type which did not have the power or features of this one. I was not blessed with good teeth and this waterpik gets all the food particles out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  Great water pressure, small foot print.  The chord is a little constricting sometimes, and forces me to bend down (which you have to do anyway to not make a mess), and the plastic handle feels like it could break fairly easily.  The stop button at the handle just pinches the line, and anything above the first setting will still force its way out of the nozzle.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied, and amazon has the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen for it.</li>
    <li> I had one of the original Waterpiks and the tubing finally failed. This version is great: smaller, covered compartment, tip storage. I use it mostly for nasal irrigation and have a special rubber tip. This all works well.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik Ultra, and \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot; is doing its job. This thing is not like the first one I bought about 5 years ago. First thing that disappointed me is the water pressure. When I set it to the highest level, 10, it only feels like 5 in my old one when it was brand new. I guess it has a weaker motor. The over all build quality has gotten worse. The switch feels weak, it doesn&#x27;t snap on and off like the older one. The water picks up a bad plastic taste. Perhaps this product is being made with cheaper quality plastics. I hope I don&#x27;t get sick from a product that is supposed to keep my mouth healthy. I will say one good thing about it. It still does its job.</li>
    <li> Actually, I bought it for my friend as a gift. He asked for this. I did not open it, but he looked happy when he got it.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I read the postive reviews and purchased this Waterpik. I have never owned one before but I was always curious about them. I can say that using the Waterpik is much easier and more effective than floss. I use the regular attachment and pik pocket and both do a great job. I find one reservoir full of water is enough to get my teeth clean. Then, I brush as usual. I am wondering whether my dentist will notice anything different at my next cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week. All I can say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;! Buying two more for family members.</li>
    <li> I have been using the WaterPik Flosser for over a year now. Have not experienced any issues with breakage or leaks.  Occassionally a piece of food will lodge itself between gum and tooth, causing pain. The WaterPik Flosser has been successful in every case so far in flushing the offending item out.  For general use, I find the WaterPik to be much easier to use than string floss.</li>
    <li> I bought this water flosser hoping it would  help clean my teeth better.  Well, first it is no comparison to a professional water flosser the dentists use in their offices.  Second it broke down on me the second time I used it.  Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great return policy.  I was able to return it for a full refund.  Definitely will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> The product came very quickly and I&#x27;ve seen immediate results after using it for a week! I had to start out at low speeds at first but now my gums are getting used to the higher pressure which ensures that I&#x27;ve gotten a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for using if you have braces and find it impossible to floss your teeth. I like the ortho device and the other attachments.</li>
    <li> This is my third WaterPik and it is the best ever.  I was still enjoying the older model when I saw this newer design.  It is so compact and fits nicely on the counter. There is no excuse not to use it every day!</li>
    <li> So far this product seems to be everything I was looking for!  The price was much better ordering online than purchasing locally.</li>
    <li> Best water pik out there!</li>
    <li> This unit is awesome! Before i would labor through the process of flossing ....not as often as i should have,my gums would bleed and so on so on. Now i just dump a glass of warm water in, crank this puppy up and floss that plaque away. Threw the spool of floss in my hunting pack for sewing string and will not be going back!</li>
    <li> Had for two weeks and my dentist said it has helped my gums. Best buy for dental health. Would buy it again for the best dental health.</li>
    <li> This water pik is so much better than the older version.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get this.  The piks are easy to click in and out, and the coil has a much better way of returning to the base.  The pic also rotates easily to move around your teeth.  There is no comparison, the upgrade is wonderful!</li>
    <li> My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn&#x27;t think they would hold enough water and I couldn&#x27;t see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge variety of tips but I don&#x27;t think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips pop on and off easily and there is a &#x27;pause&#x27; button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We&#x27;ll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...</li>
    <li> I bought this product on January 2011. Shipping was fast and it came in it&#x27;s original package within the shipping box. This was recommended by my dentist after getting implants in my mouth. Ever since I&#x27;m using it, I feel my teeth cleaner and my mouth stays fresher than normal. Now I have fewer check-ups to the dentist and my teeth stays clean longer. I fully recommend this product 100%!</li>
    <li> After having a dental implant and bridge, it was difficult to clean my teeth.  Using floss, different types of picks and brushing, I could still tell there was food matter getting trapped under the bridge.  The gums started getting irritated with my attempts to clean properly. I developed the habit of sucking on the area to get the food out because I knew it could mean lost teeth in the future.  After using the Waterpik for just a week the irritation cleared up, and there was no trapped food taste in my mouth.  Now I don&#x27;t look like a geriatric mouth sucker!  With floss, threads would get stuck in tight spots between teeth.  No longer.  The Waterpik Flosser solved so many problems.  I only wish I had discovered this appliance earlier.  I like the ablilty to adjust the strength of the pulsing.  Yes, it is a little messy, but after a few tries it was easy to control.  Regular brushing and using the Water Flosser keep my mouth really clean.</li>
    <li> This item is easy to use and makes your mouth feel cleaner than ever. Directions say to use it before brushing. I hate using string floss, but use this daily. It has settings from 1-10 for strength of the water flow--I only have used 1-5 and it is strong enough to get remaining food bits out from between your teeth. I love it...and the price was much better on Amazon than in stores! It came with a set of tips for different uses for only one person--you have to order additional tips for family use.</li>
    <li> i rescently purchased the waterpik since then it has been easier to clean between my teeth. especially the hard to reach wisdom tooth. i also dont have the bad taste in my mouth when i get up on mornings. this a grate product and very easy to use</li>
    <li> This was delivered in a timely manner and is now my favorite item in dental care.  Good bye dental floss the waterpik is my new best friend.</li>
    <li> Works well, but the motor is too loud. I would use it more often if it was quieter.</li>
    <li> i bought this in august 2014.it&#x27;s already broken December 2014</li>
    <li> This waterpik has tons of different heads in that little compartment on the top and they are just what I needed for getting under a bridge and also through a lingual wire.  Perfect for people with dental appliances, braces etc.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift after weeks of complaining to my husband about small tonsil stones in my throat.  No matter how much I brushed, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of them.  This water pick has been amazing and after just a couple days of rinsing around my tonsils using the small pressure attachment, they&#x27;re gone.  I use it 2x daily, religiously.  Best thing about this is a) the pressure is amazing and it&#x27;s a great flosser and rinses places floss can&#x27;t, and b) the attachments which are included and the storage design above the water reservoir. Neat, simple, effective.</li>
    <li> I have used the Water Pik for several years and it is am amazing product.  I ordered this through Amazon and am very satisfied with their service.</li>
    <li> I love this machine!  The one downside is you have to refill it almost every (or every other) use with water.  However, I love the attachments and the different speeds.  My teeth really feel clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I bought it on amazon almost a year ago and it&#x27;s still working very good. I keep it in a bathroom all the time. Take some space but I&#x27;m happy with this water floss and use it every night before I go to sleep  Easy to use and very powerful</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is defective or just newer model. I have had this same exact machine for about 4 years till hose broke. The pressure  was super, never needed to go above 6. On this new model, 1 is non existent pressure and I go to 10 just to get what was close to 6 on the older model. I don&#x27;t know if they modified model or this is a dud.  May exchange to determine cause used to be great machine.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; price. Good looking unit and compact. Works as advertised. Shipped quickly and factory fresh by Amazon. Don&#x27;t need all the tips, but they are neatly stowed away in the top cover.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe how well it works. I was going to buy another brand but your customer reviews led me to this product. I am amazed at the particles that come out of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this item..it works great a little noisy but it gets the job done and my teeth and gums feel good my son also uses for his braces.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik 13 months ago and use it every night. I find this model works perfectly and has just the right bells and whistles. It&#x27;s not overly complicated and gets the job done. First off, the 20 oz reservoir holds the perfect amount of water. It comes with a number of tips/attachments but I only use the classic jet tip and keep the rest stored in the lid. It is still holding up nicely and is working the same as the day I purchased it. I would recommend washing the tips and water reservoir out every week or two just to keep it sanitary. When I want to do a thorough cleaning I will fill the reservoir with hot water and vinegar and point the tip into the sink just to ensure that it&#x27;s cleaned out every once in awhile. I wish it came with at least 2 of the classic jet tip attachments since I find that the most useful. Waterpik recommends that you replace the tips every 6 months but since I don&#x27;t see any wear on it and I clean it with dish soap and water I have not felt the need to purchase any replacements. I&#x27;m so used to using this that when I&#x27;m away on vacation I miss not having this with me! I have had 2 dental cleanings since using this Waterpik and it seems to be keeping my teeth and gums healthy. I feel that this Waterpik is definitely worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone who is dedicated to maintaining good oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This device is one of those purchases that makes you feel &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I buy one of these years ago&amp;#34; My oral hygiene has never been so good.  It cleans out debris that floss never touched.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik ultra water flosser is exactly what I hoped it would be.  I really appreciate receiving this product in a quick and timely manner.  The representative from Amazon was most helpful and patient as I was ordering. Overall a positive experience that I will probably repeat.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I discovered a long time ago that the best way to really deep clean the food debris from the mouth is to use a dental irrigator. I chose to get this model over the newer Aquarius due to one reviewer&#x27;s remark that the Aquarius was quite a bit lighter in weight than this one and maybe not as powerful.  I have been disappointed more than once purchasing &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; and decided to get the older model.  This unit provides plenty of water pressure with its multiple settings.  Another brand I have tried provided only meager water pressure even when set at the highest setting.  It is also nice to be able to press the button to interrupt water flow until you get the wand tip into your mouth.  There may be less expensive products like this out there but I think this one is worth the price.</li>
    <li> My first waterpik broke after 2 yrs. I ordered a new one because I really like this one. I have had 2 other types in the past but this is my favorite. It is quiet and easy to handle. One of the other ones that I had was loud and the water sprayed my whole bathroom. I also add mouth wash to the water for medicinal reasons.</li>
    <li> As a dental hygienist, I recommend Waterpik regularly. I&#x27;ve had the hand held model for ages, but it finally died. I purchased this sink-top model and wish I had stayed with the portable, which I used in the shower. They are messy, even when used by &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; users. When my kids use this model, the entire sink and mirror are sprayed with water. Great product if you don&#x27;t mind wiping the counters and entire mirror every time you use it.</li>
    <li> I got the waterpik because I got braces.  It&#x27;s been great.  I would recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have braces as well.  It is very pleasant to use, in addition to helping with teeth cleaning.    The product itself is very high quality.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 weeks now.</li>
    <li> After a month of owning the Water Pik Ultra, I have completely stopped using dental floss. It was difficult to learn how to use the Water Pik without getting water sprayed all over the place, but once I got the hang of it, I really like it. For one week, I used the Water Pik and then flossed to make sure that it was working, and it does work. It is nice not to get the floss stuck in between my teeth and I believe the Water Pik does a more thorough job of cleaning in between teeth. I have not used the extra tools much, just the tongue scraper, I like that one. There is also a tool for deep pocket cleaning, braces cleaning and a toothbrush. I found the toothbrush of little use, as the electric ones tonce can but these days, even disposable ones, do a much better job than the one that came with the Water Pik.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I hate to floss and I&#x27;m using this twice a day. Can&#x27;t wait to go back to the dentist to see results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bee awhile since I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik, but I must say that this is a vast improvement over my previous model.  It&#x27;s easy to use, clean, and store.  It works better than a toothbrush, and takes up a minimum of counter space.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  I was also very pleased with the service I received from Amazon. My product was shipped right out and I received it in less time than they had quoted. The next time I need something I will definitely check out Amazon.com first. I compared prices with a well know retail store and was able to get my waterpik at Amazon $20.00 cheaper. WOW, what a bargain!Thanks for the wonderful product and the great service.  Sincerely, LaDonna Cates, Charleston, Mo 63834</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist to combat gingivitis when the economy dictated my cutting back on visits to the hygienist..  It&#x27;s superlative ; several different wands, generous reservoir, handy shutdown button on the handle, and its compact and attractive..  Note..do not settle for those small devices..one needs plenty of water to do an adequate job...</li>
    <li> Both my parents have gum disease and major dental problems. My dad, at the age of 63, no longer has any of his teeth left. So you can imagine that I take my dental hygiene very seriously now as an adult. I used to be very lazy and negligent, resulting in some cavities, but when I turned 25, I got kicked off my dad&#x27;s insurance. That&#x27;s when I turned around and became a serious flosser. I know how much dental fees cost and I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t run up any debts for medical problems until I got a job that covered my teeth. For X-mas, I asked for this water flosser and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every day, because my dental hygienist warned me against using it too much. While it may feel amazing to crank up the pressure and blast your gums with the water, it could harm you more than not. So I use it every other day and on a lower setting. It really knocks all the stuff loose, like those popcorn shells that get stuck in your gums and can&#x27;t be reached even with normal floss. I definitely use it after eating certain annoying foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine does make a lot of noise, but you only use it for a little bit, so no big deal. The other tips are kind of useless. I only use the one standard tip and it&#x27;s enough for me. It does take up some space on the bathroom countertop, but that&#x27;s a fine trade off for a good cleaning. After flossing and gargling with more water, I then brush my teeth with the &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HX6731-02-Healthywhite-Rechargeable/dp/B00CUG26Z4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390608658&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;sonicare+toothbrush\\&quot;&gt;Sonicare Healthywhite&lt;/a&gt; toothbrush. I use normal toothpaste, but dip it in a bit of activated charcoal, which helps to whiten my teeth naturally. I hate the nasty whitening strips. My gums and teeth are so sensitive to that crap. I&#x27;d rather take longer with more natural stuff than the chemical crap. Also, people use activated charcoal for stomach problems, like gas. So it&#x27;s perfectly safe. Doesn&#x27;t even stain my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then be sure to finish off with a good tongue scraping with a cheap, recyclable tongue scraper. It not only helps with the bacterial that cause bad breath, but also can reduce your chances of heart problems from swallowing certain bacteria. It also keeps your mouth clean longer, because you really attack some of those bacterial colonies in your mouth. Be sure to swap out your tongue scraper and toothbrush tips every couple months!</li>
    <li> It seems like the jet spray of water is not much more powerful than swishing water in my mouth.  I guess it&#x27;s good as a massage for the gums but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s powerful enough to dislodge particles of food from between your teeth.  This is the first water pic that I&#x27;ve used so I really can&#x27;t compare it&#x27;s power to others.  I used customer reviews to try to find the one that was the most powerful and this was the one that seemed to be the best of what was available.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Waterpik Ultra Flosser after my Waterpik 60 tube disconnected from the unit.  I have been using Waterpik products for many years.  The WP Ultra works fine but the water reservoir does not hold as much water as WP60 and the cover is not user-friendly - really dislike having the additional tips located in the cover.  The cover tends to open and spill the contents if you are not really careful when removing it.  In all fairness, it does do a good job and I am, for the most part, satisfied with the performance.  It really is an asset to my dental hygiene practice and I would not want to be without it.  Also, I realize I could have replaced the tube for the WP60 but wanted to try the upgrade.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised but the I cannot use it past a 1 or 2 setting. The higher settings made my gums bleed - and they don&#x27;t bleed otherwise. The tank is the perfect size. I&#x27;m sure my hygienist will appreciate it!</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I get one of these. I have had it for a month and it works great and does the job. I still use floss, but I love the way my gums feel after using the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> This is at least my 3rd Waterpic and each lasts about 4-5 years before breaking.  I love using this device and if you really want a clean fresh mouth pour a little mouth wash in with the warm water and you will be happy.  My only complaint is a lack of real power.  I have my Waterpik set for the max and would like a little extra for power washing my teeth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik in June &#x27;07 and a couple of months later the handle malfunctioned inside so it would leak all the water and therefore it had no cleaning pressure. I contacted the manufacturer and after a couple of weeks they sent me a replacement handle. That worked well up until now (a year later). The handle broke again on the inside where it fits the attachment and can no longer hold it - a small spring came off along with a small plastic part that broke. Anyway, this model is a good concept but must be made of cheap materials so don&#x27;t expect yours to last too long, look for better options.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and effective. I still floss with string a couple times a week too (because my dentist recommended doing both water and string flossing), but feel this is more effective and much much easier to reach the teeth in the back. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now bought two of these Waterpiks, and each one broke within a month. The nozzle assembly seems of very poor quality. In both cases, as I was using the waterpik, the nozzle simply came apart. I can&#x27;t believe that more people haven&#x27;t had this problem, but in any case, I am now looking for a better quality product. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My second one to get as a present this time and I know they will really enjoy theirs as much as I enjoy mine!</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews here before I bought this and a few people complained of not enough power.  This thing even at the lower settings can induce pain.  With that said, my mouth felt much cleaner and was able to get to some spot that I would normally not be able to normally get to easily with a regular tooth brush and floss.  My only concern is that the lid for the water reservoir might not let enough air in to dry it out completely between uses.  Beyond that, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Much less power than my old WaterPik even at the highest power level.   The stream of water is very weak although the motor is much quieter than my old one.   I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love using this waterpik.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it leaves my gums feeling extremely clean.</li>
    <li> We had to replace our old Waterlpik when the hose broke. We love this one-very easy to use and has replaceable parts.</li>
    <li> For near-dental quality ‘water-flossing’ I would say the Water Flosser (from Waterpik) is as good as you can get in an ‘at-home’ model. While there are many things about it that could be better (the plastic has a cheap feeling to it, the product itself is very light-weight) the improvements would likely raise the cost of this product by hundreds of dollars. For the price, this is as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have been really working hard to ‘beautify’ my smile for an upcoming wedding, I use the Waterpik as part of a healthy regimen of cleaning my teeth. It has 8 different attachments, but you really only need to use the 3 standard jets and the 1 attachment for deep gum cleaning. I’ve been using [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC This teeth dental-strength whitening kit]] for the past few weeks in preparation for the wedding, and because of this, I was worried that my gums would be a bit sensitive if flossed too much. Luckily this unit has 7 different speeds, so regardless of whether or not you floss or if you’re trying to use different cosmetic whitening solutions this product will still work well. I’m happy to say that using this has helped me not only keep my mouth free of periodontal disease but has enabled me to floss with water while using the whitening product. My gums are still healthy as can be and my teeth are white as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one complaint I do have about this product is the hose is quite short. This means you have to have the product very close to the sink in order to use it. I would make sure to have an extension cord handy so this product doesn’t end up being a cumbersome task of plugging and un-plugging whenever you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asides from that, I really have no complaints about this. I’m giving it a 5 out of 5 stars. The people who give it a lower grade fail to remember the value they’re getting for their buck. I always look at the value for the product in comparison to the results, and am happy with this purchase decision.urchase decision.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised.  No longer need to floss and teeth feel incredibly clean after using it.  It takes a little getting used to so be prepared for a little mess at first, but well worth it.  Would recommend this to all my friends.  No problems with the unit at all after several months of useage.</li>
    <li> I used my unit for a while then I put aside, thinking my teeth is good enough. (Actually I never had a problem with my teeth before.)  Now I developed this swollen gum so I decided to give it a try. However, I found the unit refused to start...  Then I wrote them a email. Guess what, they told me a new unit is on its way. Consider it has be more than 2 years, it is the best service I have ever seen!    Cannot wait to use it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my husband who has new dental implants. It&#x27;s much easier than flossing &amp; I use it too. Gets the job done  quickly &amp; efficiently.</li>
    <li> I found the waterpik ultra too large compared to the apprearance in the internet. And it makes a lot of noise.</li>
    <li> We really like this product and got a better price through Amazon than at our local discount store</li>
    <li> Dental Hygienist recommended me to start using this for gum maintenance.  It&#x27;s a good product and does the job well.  I should use it everyday but use it every two to three days because it is a bit messy at the sink.  However, my last cleaning - no cavities - hip hip hurray!</li>
    <li> This is much improved from the old Waterpik I had. It takes up less space, looks very nice on the bathroom counter and stores the various implements conveniently under the lid. It took just a few minutes to set up and connect it. I found it easy to fill and use and recommend it for any individual looking for a simple, light weight device that does the job as advertised. I decided against the battery operated one after reading some reviews. When choosing a plug-in waterpik, consider the location of your outlet and sink so you won&#x27;t have to be concerned about the power cord.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Would highly recommend this specific product and not any rechargeable waterpik.  Price excellent.  Shipment was very fast.  This is the waterpik to choose.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I love it - it&#x27;s amazing how much food comes out even after brushing.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit from another source, and so far it is proven to&lt;br /&gt;be the best unit of its kind on the market. The variety of attachments&lt;br /&gt;is a wonderful selection, even a tongue cleaner for extra measure!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d had the unit, when many years ago, I was fitted with oral&lt;br /&gt;braces. Personally, I am engaged in an all-out clean-up of my gums,&lt;br /&gt;and below the gum-line. Anyway, it&#x27;s a real knock-out and well worth&lt;br /&gt;the few dollars invested to save on dental bills--a real mood booster!</li>
    <li> If you hate to floss, and you have bad gums or plaque, then this is for you. Jet spray between your teeth with warm water or mouth wash. It feels great, and is sort of addicting. Both hubby &amp; I have been using it for about a month now and won&#x27;t ever be without one again!</li>
    <li> This is really helpful to clean and improve the health in my mouth. I love this and use everyday. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and this item is a must have along with a tooth brush. Works wonderfully at helping to prevent cavities and gum disease. This is my second one, replaced the first with the EXACT replacement it was so good. Lasted three years with 2 to 3 times a day usage. I have a portable one too, not as much power put good for travel.</li>
    <li> Strong water pressure, plenty of water volume. Takes up less space. Seems well made. This replaced an older one and the new one is better (much to my surprise).  Update: I was wrong. The new one was NOT better, just a bit stronger flow. Broke down a short while later. Changed my rating. Sick of water piks, tried something called H20 Floss. (You can find it on Amazon, but the hyper-link isn&#x27;t working so I didn&#x27;t add it.) It isn&#x27;t perfect, the on-off button and the intensity buttons are reverse of what they are on water pik and this isn&#x27;t as effective, but the flow is better, stays strong, and it seems to be doing fine for a long time. Don&#x27;t like water piks anymore, won&#x27;t buy them unless they improve the quality.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would be better than one I had from years ago. Yes the new one  is quieter but  my old one had more forceful jets, and more water capacity. If you have the old cube type and it works keep it. This is not a functional improvement.   I&#x27;m very disappointed but will keep it as a back up.</li>
    <li> I use this thing every night and I love it. Everyone should use one of these. Spend less time at the dentist and get one.</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best water pick I have ever had.  I love the small round water pick brush it has.  This has made things so much simpler and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  I have used standard brushes for such a long time.  I just wish there could be an additive to put in the water for additional care.  I will sometimes add baking soda as well to the water. This works out quite well.</li>
    <li> removes all partials from teeth even after brushing</li>
    <li> My son uses this because of his braces. It does a good job cleaning in between those wires. I just wish that the pulse-strength selections were a little stronger but other than that, I am happy with the size and features ( lots of interchangeable devices to attach).</li>
    <li> I purchased this product due to lack of dental insurance. From the first use I was stunned to see how much food was trapped in-between my teeth. No wonder my gums bother me. I still Brush first, then floss, then waterpik.   Only cons are its hard to find certain replacement brushes. The other thing is the water container is kind of leaky.  I would recommend this product to any one with sensitive gums. Also for people that have had any dental work done that leaves gaps between teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this flosser - not to be gross, but it never ceases to amaze me what is left behind after using the Clarisonic and flossing. The waterpik really cleans everything out and this one is great. It was a replacement for the same model which I had been using for years and had finally died. Highly recommend it, as does my dentist.</li>
    <li> Ok, this thing is AWESOME when it works properly. The first time I used this my teeth felt incredibly clean. Yes, all the raves about it are true. The down side, I&#x27;ve had it for almost two weeks and the button on the side (which is used to stop the flow of water) constantly get&#x27;s STUCK! So, every time I go to use it, I push the button, it&#x27;s stuck, so I mess with it, and BAM water everywhere! So yes it&#x27;s awesome, but this button really sucks! I would recommend it, but beware of this crappy button!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is their best one ever!  It is neat looking on my bathroom counter, extremely effective to use, and has more attachments than I plan to use.  What more could I want?  Amazon never disappoints me.  Previously, I had purchased from another source one that attached to my shower.  Well, the only good thing about it was that it no longer took up space on my bathroom counter.  The water stream was very broad, and only tickled my gums, leaving my teeth still with food particles!</li>
    <li> is a real solution for cleaning teeth and oral cavity is higher than flossing, is really impressive, our family uses it together with tooth brushing.  we recommend</li>
    <li> It did help our gums, but the water pressure became funny then the machine completely stopped working after only 1.5 years of use.</li>
    <li> After multiple gum surgeries, I was lucky enough to come across a periodontist who recommended the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser to me. If you have gum issues (either receding gums, gum pockets, or gum disease/inflammation), this device can actually help heal them. And if you have never (yet) had gum issues, this device can help prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dental hygienist told me years ago that decay-producing bacteria start growing in the mouth within 20 minutes of eating, and even if you brush after every meal, if you don&#x27;t floss, food remains between your teeth, a fueling ground for future cavities. Worse, it can lead to inflammation at the gum line. Even a person with healthy teeth can be at risk of losing them if that person develops gum disease. And gum inflammation has been implicated in heart disease for some time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you don&#x27;t work from home, it is difficult to use this water flosser after every meal. But most of us have breakfast and dinner at home, and for those meals it&#x27;s quite convenient to use this device after eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill the basin of the water flosser with warm water when I use it. If you have sensitive teeth or gums, cold water straight from the tap can be a painful shock to them when sprayed by this water flosser directly on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend a special attachment you can get for this device that is a huge help for your gums, the [[ASIN:B000V2DN2O Water Pik Ultra Pik Pocket Tip]]. It has a very narrow point that is ideal for placing it in gum pockets. I did a review of it here on Amazon. I have had amazing experiences with it healing my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, this water flosser lasts a long time. I bought mine in 2006, and it is still going strong. I recently purchased another one so that my husband and I could each have one of our own, but that is not strictly necessary. The container that sits on the top of the water flosser can hold up to four different tips, so you don&#x27;t have to share a tip with another family member.ave to share a tip with another family member.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. Easy to use and it works well. It arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> waterpik can penetrate pocket great than 3mm that dental floss can only penetrate 2mm, it really helps if you experience food stuck between your teeth. Fresh and clean after use it. love it.</li>
    <li> After using it for about 6 weeks, the spring of hose popped and could not be used any more. Customer service refused to replace the horse because I was blamed for setting it to median level instead of low.</li>
    <li> Waterpik arrived safe and sound.  However it is not compatible with Australian volyage, so within minutes it was smokin&#x27;- ie strange acrid smell and billows of smoke from the unit.  Turned it off and now can&#x27;t use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Aussie customers beware!!!!!</li>
    <li> love this waterpik ultra water flosser ... easy to use and also at a great price .. would highly recommend this unit</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. I have been using a Waterpik for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product; makes my gums and teeth feel clean to the max. My gums used to bleed during brushing but now thanks to Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser I don&#x27;t have that problem any longer.</li>
    <li> This little contraption can really deliver! The water comes out with such force, there is no doubt it leaves nothing behind. And I love that all the little pieces store conveniently in the lid. It is so nice and tidy sitting on the bathroom sink. Works well, looks good. If you need it it is worth buying!</li>
    <li> this waterpik is the real deal....love it...great transaction...thanks to everyone at Amazon...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this a defect or a design flaw, but when you turn on the unit, the water lines shakes and it gets worse as you increase the pressure.  I&#x27;m afraid it is going to burst soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tip is free to rotate once you click it in place.  You can&#x27;t use a mirror while using the device because it will get wet.  You have to lean over the sink and move the tip along the teeth margins by feel, but the tip rotates freely so you don&#x27;t know its position.</li>
    <li> I only wish I had started using this years ago...now, it is a part of my dental hygiene protocol...I&#x27;ll have to see what the dentist says when I go back, but I feel like its doing a much better job cleaning between my teeth and under the gums than flossing did.</li>
    <li> much quieter, nice coiled-tube storage, smaller footprint, better pressure control, easier tip change, convenient tip storage in reservoir lid, comes with wide selection of tips</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I got off to a messy start, but that&#x27;s just because I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions to put the jet in my mouth before turning it on...duh.  I just got it this afternoon and have tried it with plain water in the reservoir, then Listerine, and finally water with a couple of drops of pure tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract. My teeth, gums, and mouth feel so fresh and clean. While plain water works just fine with this machine, I think I like the feel of the Listerine best; although if I continue to use Listerine with the machine I will have to dilute it, not because it&#x27;s too strong, but because it could get pretty expensive filling it with Listerine everyday.</li>
    <li> If you are a new user, watch out for the splash if you are not pressing the control properly, put some listerine on flushing.</li>
    <li> if you have not a power outlet in your bathroom first you have to install one and after take care about safety against voltage. In rest it&#x27;s good and very useful</li>
    <li> I was in need of a water pick as I have had some trouble with my teeth and needed something to do a deeper clean than just my normal brushing and flossing routine. My sister-in-law recently purchased this water pick from Amazon and she really liked it and after reading the reviews I decided to get my own.     This is a really great product, I am currently using it on the lowest setting as my gums are very sensitive and it is perfect, I get in all the area&#x27;s that I am not able to get to with my toothbrush and floss, my teeth and gums already feel better and look healthier which is amazing to me! The pressure and pulse of the water is great and I can really feel that it is cleaning in between all of my teeth and under the gum line.      My husband also uses it and loves it. He uses it on a higher setting (6 I think) and is satisfied with the pressure and pulse of the water.      It doesn&#x27;t leak, I don&#x27;t leave water in it between uses so this might be why, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it leaking.     I am really very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product works great, but was a lot louder than I expected when I first turned it on.  Been using it for about 1 month now and have had zero issues with it.  The only negative thing I can say is that its a bit loud, especially when you put it on pause/hold via the handle.</li>
    <li> I had an older water pik and it had seen better days.  After reviewing this product, I purchased it and it was all that was advertised.  The feature that impressed me the most was being able to \\&quot;spin\\&quot; the nozzle without moving my wrists - just my finger tip! The pressure gauge that allows the water to pressure the volume up or down is also a plus factor.  I know that my dental hygienist approves!</li>
    <li> very good product. purchased for my 10 yr old son&#x27;s new braces &amp; it does great job of keeping food, etc out of braces.</li>
    <li> waterpik is highly recommended by my dentist, and i&#x27;ve purchased an older version of waterpik before, but this one is so far the best i&#x27;ve ever had. occupied a small space on my countertop, easy to move in and out, and has met my expectation.</li>
    <li> Amazon price was excellent compared with in-store prices. Assembly was easy, but on-off switch didn&#x27;t operate. Apparently it was not seated properly, once we fixed that, the unit worked fine and has continued to do so.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement.  This is a great product.  It&#x27;s much more quiet than my first waterpic.  I&#x27;ve had this for about 1 year now and no complaints.  I love it.  This was recomended to my by a dental hygentist.</li>
    <li> My husband had me buy this for him after a less than fantastic trip to the dentist. I had used one regularly as a child/teen and was very happy he finally decided to humor me and get one. We both love it. It has also proven very useful to use one our son who goes though chemotherapy. Some side effects are very hard on the mucous membranes and lining of the mouth and sometimes a regular bristled brush is just too much and flossing is certainly out of the picture. Both the brush and the pik heads have really come in handy for those times. It is also very fun for a seven year old to have a very tiny water machine gun and makes it oral care the highlight of the evening.</li>
    <li> As with most people, my dentist badgers me about flossing. He will be very happy that I purchased the Waterpik, as I tend to use everyday, if not twice a day. It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and is more convenient than regular flossing, at least for me. I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth, which makes it difficult to floss properly, so I tend to avoid flossing altogether. The Waterpik has made it much easier for me to floss regularly PLUS it has proven to be more effective than regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable pressure settings and multiple attachments make it a very good product for both my wife and I to use. I am able to use higher pressure settings, while it has lower settings that will work well for her sensitive teeth. The water tank is easy to fill and empty and the attachments are easy to swap out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard attachments work very well, as does the \\&quot;pik pocket\\&quot; attachment designed to give your gums a deep cleaning. I have limited use for the orthodontic attachment, but I imagine it would have been nice when I had full braces. The tooth rinse attachment may have its uses for some people, but it seemed to just make a mess all of my counter and mirror. The toothbrush attachment might also be useful for some, but I have an Oral B electric toothbrush, so I won&#x27;t ever use that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among all the benefits to this product, there are few drawbacks. First, it has a fairly large footprint, so it may be difficult if you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space in your bathroom. We have a dual vanity, so we have room between the sinks, but not everyone has that luxury. Second, the instructions say to unplug the cord when not in use, but there is no mechanism to store or wrap up the cord, so it just sits there by the plug. This is not ideal, since your hands and/or the plug may be wet when you get ready to use the device. Finally, the handy storage tray that sits on top of the water tank doesn&#x27;t have enough slots to store all of the attachments that come with the device. Even if you keep one attachment installed on the handle, you are still one slot short. This is not a huge deal for me, as I&#x27;ve determined that there are few attachments that I have no use for, but it may be an issue for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are minor deficiencies that don&#x27;t really relate to the quality or effectiveness of the product, but I felt they were worth mentioning. None of these would impact my rating or my decision to buy this product again. They are just slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend buying this product, even if you are one of the few people that flosses regularly. It is very easy to use, and is very effective.device. Even if you keep one attachment installed on the handle, you are still one slot short.

    <li> Gets food out that floss can&#x27;t. MY Dentist suggested I get this for the health of  my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does such a great job cleaning the teeth and at the gum line. The reservoir is adequate for the job. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was tricked into getting a lookalike model which lacked the range and quality .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it both as a waterpic and with the grossan nasal irrigator which requires a low flow.  The imitation lacked the low pressure /flow settings required by the grossan irrigation system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note  after suffering from serious , recurring sinus problems that threatened to end my flying career I was referred to Dr Grossan .  After 5-6 years of problems my problems were slowly cured with daily use of the irrigator which allowed my sinuses to heal and perform normally .  Now I only use it on occasion but when needed it is priceless.  The water pic with low flow settings does a great job with the irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;both are recommended</li>
    <li> I just used the product for the first time tonight.  I have to say I&#x27;m most highly impressed with this product.  I bought this item because I&#x27;m going through a lot of leadership training, and of course you need to smile if you are going to be a great leader :).  Self-conscious of my not quite perfect smile, I decided to give the WaterPik a try.  I clumsily made a mess of water with the product being a first time user; but it&#x27;s just water.  I immediately noticed the clean feeling that you get after going to the dental hygienist (minus the pain).  I swiped my teeth with floss just to see how well it really worked, and to my amazement...nothing.  There was literally nothing on my floss-pick tool.  If you&#x27;re up in the air about this product, let me tell you, it&#x27;s completely worth it.  I even paid ten dollars because I purchased out in town.  I&#x27;m not the least bit upset.</li>
    <li> This was \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; by my dentist &amp; I can see why.  My teeth &amp; mouth feel great.  I use it at least twice a day.  I anticipate she will be pleased at my next 6 month checkup.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to set-up. Saves a lot of time over regular flossing. Great if you have braces. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use a water pik to help my gum health.  Found this online which was less expensive for the same unit that I could buy locally.  Fast delivery and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Nice way to clean my teeth. i use it after i brushed my teeth and its able to take off some extra residues. but i noticed some yellow plaques, i thing its because i over cleaned when i first got this machine.</li>
    <li> The waterpik arrived pretty quickly. After a few weeks of use I feel like I am getting better at using it and would even say I enjoy it. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I was hitting the right spots (instructions are provided but in practice I found it a bit hard to aim the stream while my mouth was partially closed). I normally have to fill the unit twice per cleaning which isn&#x27;t too bad. The only design flaw I see so far is that the cover tends to fly open if I don&#x27;t make a conscious effort to keep it closed during refilling...</li>
    <li> The only annoying part of the construction is that lid. It doesn&#x27;t snap into place, and there are more attachments than there are spaced in the attached compartment. Of course, I doubt anyone will be using all of them, so weed out the attachments that you use least, or not at all, and only place the top priority pieces in there. There&#x27;s no way this thing puts out 90psi, though I&#x27;m ok with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it really seems to be doing a good job. I suppose my dentist will tell me when I go for my semi-annual cleaning.</li>
    <li> This product helps keeps my gums clean and it gets leftover food out of the corners of my mouth. Sometimes you still need to use a toothpick or dental floss if you have something like meat or corn stuff between your teeth, seeing that even the most powerful setting still won&#x27;t get it out on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> I love this water pick. My teeth feel so clean. I use mouthwash once a week and its awesome. I wish I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the performance of the Waterpik Ultra Flosser. I anticipate a very good dental exam in the future (very healthy gums!)</li>
    <li> This waterpic is much better than the one I used for the last few years! The pressure control is much better and the wand easily rotates to reach all teeth, top and bottom. It is compact, fits easily in the corner of the vanity and stores extra tips nicely. I even bought one for my grand daughter to help with her braces and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The unit works great. No problems at all. It is the best way to clean food from your teeth which saves on dental bills. It is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the better of all the waterpik products. It does exactly what it is suppose to do. As I do not enjoy using tape floss this product is just what the dentist ordered. Having said that be prepared before using it. Read the instrutions fully. Choose the righ attachment for what your planning on doing and prepare to get wet. Use it in the morning and at night over the bathroom sink as it can be slightly messey. But again that is the nature of using water under pressure....speaking of pressure, the unit has several setting but from my standpoint anything less than max. setting is worthless.</li>
    <li> The waterpik ultra water flosser works very well ! As it come with different tools for different parts ( pocket cleaner for example ) you can clean very efficient !</li>
    <li> keeps my gums and teeth clean, a little noisy, but it works fine.  apparently I need to type more words to submit</li>
    <li> This Waterpik successfully removes food particles left behind by both flossing and brushing.  I bought it because I now have a bridge and they are particularly likely to have food particles left behind underneath them.  But now that I see how well it works, I would use it even if I didn&#x27;t have a bridge.  I use about a medium setting and use it every night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;One commenter complained there was no way to point the device.  If you hold it as illustrated in the picture, it will swivel independently and that is not what you want.  To maintain control and point it where you need it you hold the top rim (just above the thumb in the product photo) between your thumb and forefinger and it works quite well.</li>
    <li> I really hate flossing, but my teeth are crappy. They accumulate tartar under the gumline really quickly. As a result, I have to get scalar cleanings. At least, I used to require scalar cleanings until I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiring of flossing, I decided to purchase this. While I read of people whose gumline had improved, I wasn&#x27;t going to put my hopes into anecdotal evidence.&lt;br /&gt;Using the pik is a revelation. You get a good bit of gunk out of your teeth with flossing, but the pik seemed to even get more stuff out. Just for this, it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to my dentist for my scalar cleaning, the dental tech was taking measurements. Instead of hearing mainly fours, fives and sixes for my gums, I now had twos and threes. Since I was only using the wide plastic implement, my dental tech talked to me about using the gum insert for the areas where I had fours and fives. Because my gums were in much better shape, I only needed the usual tartar cleaning. I didn&#x27;t need to get the lidocaine injection for my usual deep clean. Win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priming it is easy. Since the water reservoir is on the counter, I hold the pik in a lowered position in the sink. Water flows out easily, then I can start using it.&lt;br /&gt;Warm water is recommended for a very good reason. Cold water flowing between your teeth is not fun.&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t used any other brand, I can&#x27;t speak as to whether the other ones work as well, better or worse.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is quieter than the older model that it replaced.  Very easy to operate and to maintain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at the Waterpik in stores and this one on Amazon is the best for your money.  It has six different attachments.  The pressure goes up to 10, but I use between 1 and 2.  Excellent for cleaning out the food particles in between your teeth. Use it about once a day in the evening.  Almost no need to use your floss and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Especially if you are afraid of periodontal disease, you should get this.  It is a pleasant massage for the gums and does help to improve pockets.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered, literally. String flossers just didn&#x27;t do it for me. The Waterpik  just works much better.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser  I had a waterpik years ago but didn&#x27;t like it much. I have a deep pocket in my gum next to a wisdom tooth that has never been pulled and it is still under the gum. I was told I would have to have the wisdom tooth removed with possible damage to the nerve it was resting on because food was getting in the pocket and I couldn&#x27;t get it out and it became inflamed. After the Dental surgen set up an appointment to have the tooth removed. I bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and had been using it for two or three weeks before I went in to have the surgery I told the Doctor I had bought it. He said I didn&#x27;t need to have the tooth removed. I asked him to check it which he did and said it was fine.I am very happy with how it is keeping my teeth clean. I bought it through Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I had an older model of the Waterpik and this one is much, much quieter and I suspect it pumps water quicker since the tank (same size) empties much quicker...which I like.  It also has a nice pik holder with a coiled hose that finds its way back into the holder w/o much of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also highly recommend a waterpik to anyone who hasn&#x27;t used one, because it is very effective at washing out any food particles between your teeth, even after you brush.  And it also invigorates your gums so they don&#x27;t bleed (as you get older).  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Seems well made and performs as advertised.  My wife uses it daily and likes it.  It is easy to clean and is a reasonable size.</li>
    <li> Works great!  We love it!  Easy to use too!</li>
    <li> Overall pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> works well, but as stated by another, it is not as powerful as the older model it is replacing</li>
    <li> I hate traditional flossing. It never seems to get everything out of my teeth and sometimes pushes meat even further into my gums causing bleeding and discomfort. I had a cheaper water flosser before and loved it so I decided to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Very efficient with many pressure settings.&lt;br /&gt;-More tips than you will know what to do with.&lt;br /&gt;-Small enough to fit on my bathroom sink and heavy enough not to be knocked off.&lt;br /&gt;-Hose reaches my mouth comfortably without moving unit.&lt;br /&gt;-Huge reservoir ensures you can clean your mouth without filling several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Very loud compared to other units I have seen and the cheaper one I owned.&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic feels cheap and the top could have been made better. When trying to take the top off sometimes the tips get wet (which is a breading ground for bacteria.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still believe this unit deserves the 5 star rating even with the bad points. I will update in the future if the unit does not last for a reasonable amount of time. If no update has been made I highly reccomend this to others looking for an affordable/efficient water flosser!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Water flosser is wonderful. It really gets food particles out of the teeth and is easy to use once you remember not to remove it while depressing the button, or you&#x27;ll floss your eyeball!  My gums get clean, my dentist noticed. I do have slight periodontal disease so I hadn&#x27;t told him I bought it, but when I went for a cleaning, he noticed and asked if I was flossing more than usual. (I always used to floss with string floss but still had problems). I told him I was using a Waterpik flosser and he told me to stick with it. I don&#x27;t use string floss anymore!  Easy to use, gets the job done, dentist will notice when doing a cleaning.  ******** Now, for the product...I don&#x27;t know how this happened but, it happened twice. I&#x27;m asking for a replacement ...a cordless version. Read below if interested in that.  Purchased my 1st one in November of 2014. A week after using it for a week, I went to plug it in and the plug sparked, smoked and my GFI turned power off to the outlet.  Contacted Waterpik with photos and serial #s, they quickly sent a replacement unit. That unit worked until today, when the same thing happened.  I&#x27;ve contacted Waterpik via email and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll replace it again.  See photos ....three taken from today&#x27;s incident...ones with green/white background are the first one that burned.</li>
    <li> This is as  good or better than the one had for years before. I use it every day and it gets more food out then regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Wayyyy easier than flossing with a permanent retainer. Works well</li>
    <li> After 4 years use, the water hose is broken at the connection to the handle. It&#x27;s good when it works. A replacement part can be purchased but it&#x27;s not easy (for me) to repair, will throw it away and try a new brand this time.</li>
    <li> I never knew that the secret to how the WaterPik functions is that a pulses. The pressure is adjustable. This does a great job getting food out of the in between spaces. I use it over dental floss and my hygienist is very satisfied with the results. I used to have dental pockets of 5 mm, and now I have none.</li>
    <li> This works amazing! So much better than flossing and the best price out there. Shipped so quick. So many attachments to use and so easy to work. Best product yet!!</li>
    <li> I believe this is the perfect pressure washer on your gum that reach more deeper than that of brush. Pressure around 8 to 9 works for me perfectly.  Really recommended to everybody. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good idea but you probably won&#x27;t use it for more than a week and it will sit under your sink forever.</li>
    <li> it was exactly what I needed and what the doctor said I should get. The price is just right, lower than Walmart</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Comes with more attachments than I needed but they all seem to have a purpose.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Plenty of water, quieter, good pressure, small footprint. One tip is all it is needed. Would recommend to all my friends and relatives</li>
    <li> I am a good brusher, and I usually use the Water Pik before brushing, but when I forget and use it after brushing, I am always amazed at what was missed.  I alo have some dental implants, and this is great for cleaning under the implants.</li>
    <li> I have wanted one of these for years. It really does a nice job of cleaning between the teeth etc.</li>
    <li> Was poorly advised re suitability of unit for Australian electrical voltage. Unit blew up when switched on.&lt;br /&gt;You provided a full credit for this and this was appreciated.</li>
    <li> I have braces and had to get this, but it is fun to use and great for cleaning your mouth, especially when you have braces.</li>
    <li> Great products! It help me to clear my teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;I love this products. I will buy the other one to my family.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Waterpik that had started leaking.  This one doesn&#x27;t have enough pressure even on the highest setting.  I might have just gotten a dud.  I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> Great item. Bought for my grandson who wears braces and he really likes the way he can clean his teeth.</li>
    <li> I have a new set of permanent denture/implants and are a challenge to clean to say the least.  the adjustable settings are great for during the healing process when you need lighter pressure.  It feels so good to be clean that I almost want a bigger tank to keep going!  The only improvement I can see is the cord is a little to tightly coiled to release to give a lengthy stretch-could be longer or less coiled and the snap in pik has a tendency to come out -that could be improved to not accidentally come out when you flossing.</li>
    <li> Seems Ok.  Tube connecting handle to unit is too short.  Also, water container top should not be place for storage of brushes. Top cover should be hinged to base!</li>
    <li> We got this Waterpik based on the reviews here on Amazon. I&#x27;m a fairly disciplined night time brusher and flosser but my husband - who would previously sneak off to bed without brushing or flossing now scoots to the bathroom after dinner every night to Water floss AND brush!!  He says he can actually feel how clean his gums and teeth are now. I love it too, especially when you see how all the gunk gets washed away so effectively. It is even kinda fun.  On a more serious note, it&#x27;s a well known fact that poor dental hygiene can lead to many more serious problems including possible heart disease and diabetes. So why risk all of that, just Water floss away!</li>
    <li> Good product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The Product is an awsome one I&#x27;ve had it for two month now and no complaining it&#x27;s powerful enogh for a deep clean with alot of attachment I love having it around and poring some mouthwash in it for that extra kick I would reccomd this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Convenient in use. Cleans teeth well, though does not replace routine cleaning by dentist. An important part of oral care.</li>
    <li> I literally just got this and used and now I&#x27;m writing the review. I am very impressed. It was simple to use right out of the box. I was skeptical on their claim that it was \\&quot;better than actually flossing\\&quot; however, I now believe it. I brushed my teeth first and then used it since that&#x27;s what I would do with real floss. I set it on 3 or 4 and that seemed about good for me. I made it all the way around my mouth and still had water so I just went until the reservoir was empty (about a minute and a half). It felt pretty good, almost like a gum massage. The best part is no cutting or bleeding or swollen gums from the floss! I then flossed with regular floss and there was nothing on my floss. Anywhere. I&#x27;ve always been one of those people who just flossed on occasion but now I will be flossing daily! Thanks for the Water Flosser!  Oh, if I did have one thing that wasn&#x27;t as described (and this is a stretch) the water still splashed everywhere, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal but hopefully in a few tries I can figure out how to make the water run out of my mouth like on the demo videos. Still love it though!</li>
    <li> Far better than my old version of Waterpik.  Smaller and fits better on my countertop, clever storage unit for extra tools, good pressure and a variety of settings</li>
    <li> This little machine is one of the best on the market and has worked faithfully for a couple of years.  The only problem I have with it is a dentist telling me they don&#x27;t really clean very well.  Some people tend to run their bodies towards the lower end of the ph scale, ie acidic, and this is really bad for the teeth, far worse than not brushing.  What you eat has a huge impact on this so it can be controlled.  Drinking a glass of water with a tea spoon of Potassium Bicarbonate helps to push you back towards neutral or an alkaline state.  Or a glass of water with lemon juice.  In spite of the dentist I enjoyed the oral stimulation and have added lemon juice and Potassium Bicarbonate to my diet.  As well as foods that promote a more alkaline state.  It turns out the chemistry in your mouth is by far the most important aspect of any oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> The power of the water just has been reduced so that it is barely useful.  The reservour is about half the size.  If there is a better one out there, please let me know.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny! I&#x27;ve used in three days now, and my teeth have never felt cleaner - not even after a professional cleaning!  I have a pocket where my molar is - it is impossible to clean with regular dental floss or with a toothpick or any other dental product I&#x27;ve tried until now! This water flosser cleaned it so well in no time! I&#x27;ve flossed with regular floss after using the water flosser just to test if there is more cleaning left to do, and everytime the regular floss is clean - nothing left on the teeth after using the water flosser.  I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> stop working after first use .. pump not working..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great concept but bad quality ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one star more than enough ..</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have owned it for only 6 weeks, so can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s durability, but it functions just as advertised and does a great job of cleaning between your teeth and stimulating the gums. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Works well, just didn&#x27;t expect so much spray all over my bathroom counter when doing my front teeth.</li>
    <li> It does not have near the quality of the original I bought several years ago - I am very disappointed in it - I think they cheapen the quality in order to keep the price down.</li>
    <li> BETTER TOOTH CLEANING THAT JUST TOOTH BRUSH, YOUR MOUSE FEEL CLEANER&lt;br /&gt;I THINK IS A GOOD INVESTMENT. HOWEVER AT LEAST MY UNIT NEED TO BE TAPPED&lt;br /&gt; AFTER TURNING IT ON FOR THE LIQUID TO START FLOWING TO THE CLEANING TIP&lt;br /&gt;HENCE 4 STARS</li>
    <li> This product works as described in the product review. It is a durable product that will have a long useful life.  The product useful value greatly exceeds its cost.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a WaterPik that was about 8-9 years old and I am very impressed with the improvements made over these years.  This is a smaller, but more powerful unit and it comes with an assortment of tips to fill every dental need.  I would highly recommend this to anyone seeking to improve their oral care needs.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use and has decreased the pain around my crown significantly! I recommend this product! Just be careful not to squirt your mirror in the process! It&#x27;ll become all spotty!</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Both my husband and I thought it really worked better than flossing.  My only gripe is that we have a very small vanity (one sink) and it takes up a good amount of space.  If I had master bath I would have no problem keeping it out next to the sink with the electric toothbrush, but as we only have the one bathroom, I try to keep it uncluttered as we have guests over frequently. At some point we ended up moving it under the sink and have slowly forgotten about it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Not only can you use it to clean your teeth but on the highest setting you can clean the gunk out of your sink! No joke. It&#x27;s like a power wash for your teeth (and sink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with different tools to use - I&#x27;ve only used the one for flossing the teeth so I can&#x27;t comment on those but they are easily stored in the top of the waterpik lid which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this particular waterpik for over a year with no problems and my teeth look white and healthy :) Win!</li>
    <li> The water pik flosser arrived in great  condition, and it works as advertised, perhaps even better. It has more options than I remembered. How about that? I can vary the water pressure and change the pik itself to vary the type of cleaning I want or need. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I like my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser because:  1. It has a foot valve so it keeps its prime.  (When the water got too low in my Conair WJ8R, it took about 20 seconds of a weak stream before you could waterfloss the next time.)  2. The tank is big enough to do a thorough job of waterflossing. (With the Conair, I had to switch to the second side of the split tank to have enough water.)  Tip: I fill the tank after each use.  The cold Maine water warms to room temperature. (We avoid using the hot water tap of the bathroom sink.)</li>
    <li> Have had a battery unit for several years and wanted to get this one to save the battery one for travel.  I am very happy, it is more powerful when needed, bugger tank and great design.  The hose does go back in very easily.  I have not tried all the tips but they look interesting.  As I learned from another pic user no matter what model you buy you need to run some vinegar water through it from time to time to keep the calcium from building up.</li>
    <li> It does a decent job flushing in between your teeth. It has a difficult time shutting off the water with the button on the wand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those folks whom has always had problems with hard and tiny food particles becoming lodged above/below my upper/lower gum-lines...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, WaterPik simply offers the best affordable \\&quot;hydro-floss\\&quot; appliance commercially available.  Not only does their adjustable water stream offer the strongest possible pressure, but their lower pulse rate (as compared to some others) seems to allow more time for ejected particles to escape the gums between water pulses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, (being a hardware man by nature) I can report after actual dis-assembly of several models over the last 30 years that the guts of most any WaterPik have changed very little during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint has been regarding their \\&quot;package\\&quot; design:  The WaterPik was originally of a clean-cut rectangular shape which fit upon a medicine cabinet shelf while still allowing the typical medicine cabinet&#x27;s mirrored door to close.  At some point (in the 1990&#x27;s?) the case was redesigned with rounder lines for what seem to serve absolutely no practical purpose whatsoever and actually prevent the appliance from fitting into a typical medicine cabinet.  ...Since the \\&quot;vanity\\&quot; cabinet has largely become the norm in American bathrooms these days, counter-top use of the WaterPik is ideal.  However, many of us are still graced only with a simple pedestal or wall-mounted bathroom sink and have no place but the medicine cabinet to place such an appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WaterPik&#x27;s latest model WP100 provides a more ergonomic hand-piece than the previous two models I have used; WP60 and WP70.  However, WP100 moves the pressure adjustment from the hand-piece to the base and reduces the water reservoir capacity from 1000 ml to 600 ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet despite these practical inconveniences, to date all WaterPik models still provide the same basic performance quality and are still the only oral irrigation appliance I would ever choose.  Without them I&#x27;d have been miserable onmany occasions...  Thank you WaterPik!!</li>
    <li> This product is only average because of 2 considerations.  First of the unit starts to run the moment you turn it on from the base.  The button on the jet handle is actually to shut the jet.  (Versus having the button turn on the jet)  This design is stupid in my opion because to turn it on or off you need to have one hand holding the handle button down and the other to switch the base.  Otherwise you better make sure the jet wasn&#x27;t pointing at some electrical outlet when you switch the base on. &lt;br /&gt;Second of all, the water reservoir is relatively small if you run the output at more than 50% power.  You may need a refill before you finish the entire mouth.  Coupled with the first problem of running all the time instead of on demand, one has to work through all areas very quickly.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR DENTAL WORK LIKE BRIDGES, ETC. BUT CONTRARY TO MY HOPES, I STILL FIND IT NECESSARY TO FLOSS. IT GIVES A REFRESHING FEELING THOUGH.</li>
    <li> Good power and has shut off switch built in the handle and a power setting which I did not see on any other models. &lt;br /&gt;Lot of tools, compact with small footprint!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad for his birthday and he LOVES it. He uses it everyday and says how grateful he is. It works as advertised and has a good, strong flow.</li>
    <li> This is my third unit.  Each one does not last as long as the prior units.  Yes, it does the job...but it seems it lacks the pressure the former units had.  I wish if it needed service/repair, some additional parts were available for the consumer to install such as the pump or motor, but it is not.  It more like planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think next time I will research and consider another brand.  However, I do like that this model has a reservoir lid to keeping the water clean.</li>
    <li> Careful your first time using this, you may be shooting water all over your bathroom. But when you use correctly everything works great. I have braces and it helps dramatically with the cleaning. I can&#x27;t wait to get the braces off and see how it feels normally.</li>
    <li> I use the waterpik daily it work&#x27;s great and fits in a small area  on my bathroom sink,I usually keep it set on 3 and that seems more than powerful enough for me.It comes with plenty of attachments and the pik pock tip is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great to use for deep cleaning</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist. I am more than pleased with the results. It is easy to use and makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed. Its compact design fits easily on my small bathroom vanity.</li>
    <li> nice unit for a reasonable price.  Arrived in good shape and works well.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do; time will tell if it holds up to regular use.</li>
    <li> Seems to do exactly what it claims.  It cleans between my teeth very well and is more pleasant than using floss.  I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was the best discovery ever! it totally replaced my floss... Its not so good for my GF since she has tighter teeth and sometimes she feels it is a bit difficult. but it works great! the construction is not as sturdy as I would want but cmon its cheap enough and its defnitely a bang for its price.</li>
    <li> Does a great  job in cleaning between your teeth. Had a water pick before and it wore out, so I ordered another one.</li>
    <li> If you have a periodontal pocket, this waterpik works wonders.  NOTHING I&#x27;ve tried in the past was effective at getting food particles out of my periodontal pocket until I gave this waterpik a try.  It&#x27;s been a lifesaver in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as flossing goes, it&#x27;s been a little disappointing.  It removes large food particles between the teeth, but not small stuff.  I&#x27;ve tested this by flossing with regular dental floss immediately after using the waterpik, and the dental floss still pulls out a lot of material that the waterpik did not remove.  It&#x27;s definitely a lot easier than flossing, and faster, and may reach under the gums more effectively than floss does, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to clean as well as dental floss, at least not in my experience.  Still, flossing is a pain, so I avoid doing it a lot of times, and this waterpik is easy, so I use it all the time, so I figure it&#x27;s better than not flossing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a periodontal pocket, I highly recommend this device.  For regular flossing though, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s more effective than string, but it does make flossing a lot easier and faster, so in that regard, it&#x27;s definitely better than not flossing at all.</li>
    <li> I had one a few years ago and I like this one way better, it is more compact. Thanks Mike</li>
    <li> The unit cleans very well. I have four different multi tooth bridges, and it is the answer for them.  It has several different sized tips that are nested in a storage container that sits on top of the tank when not in use.  It is attractive, and takes up little space on the vanity top.  There is a pause button on the handle that stops the flow while you turn off the machine with the other hand. I still have the original water pik, and it still works well.  It just is not as attractive as the new one.</li>
    <li> BEFORE THIS PRODUCT I DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW MUCH FLOSSING AND BRUSHING LEFT BEHIND. WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT AFTER BRUSHING AND FLOSSING AND MOUTH WASH,,, I SEE EVEN MORE SMALL PARTIALS OF FOODS RINSED FROM BETWEEN MY TEETH AND GUM. I US A SONIC CARE PLATINUM TOOTH BRUSH (WHICH IS THE BEST) AND THIS COMPLEMENTS THAT ITEM WELL</li>
    <li> excellent product. has been helpful so far.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dentist&#x27;s office.  Really love this waterpik.  First day and all other times using product was great.&lt;br /&gt;Second day (only)  looked like there was a water fight in the bathroom with mirror covered in water.  Still can&#x27;t figure&lt;br /&gt;out what I did wrong.  It was all me because this waterpik is exceptional.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this after getting my lower retainer bonded to my teeth and I cannot floss.  The product arrived as expected and it is so great. I am beyond happy at the cleanliness that I can maintain of my teeth. I have not used all the tips except the one recommended for braces and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my son in braces, he loves it! Super powerful! Almost, too powerful. It is like a mini pressure washer.</li>
    <li> I want to say \\&quot;I hate this\\&quot; product because it has a design flaw but I&#x27;ll leave it as \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\&quot; overall.&lt;br /&gt;Yes,  I&#x27;m currently using it but I can see this product slowly breaking until down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flaw:  the cord that transports water to the tip of the pik appears to be designed to wear out after a certain amount of time.  It will be the first part to go bad that can not be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is poorly designed, this is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve ordered because I need to keep my teeth &#x27;clean&#x27; until I find a workaround.&lt;br /&gt;This product needs to be made with better quality (its cheap plastic and poorly constructed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance when new: good&lt;br /&gt;Performance of parts over time: terrible&lt;br /&gt;Parts replaceable? No&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally unfriendly: Yes, because you have to throw the plastic trash in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Expect to make a mess if you can&#x27;t keep your mouth closed but it&#x27;s incredible at flossing without hurting your gums as you would do with a string. Definitely buy this. My dentist loved it enough to recommend it to me.</li>
    <li> Water shoots everywhere and makes a mess. Not satisfied with this product. Thank you very much! Writing all of these words is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Gets everything out of my teeth and is more comfortable than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; flossing.  I love this product.  My teeth/gums feel and look healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought the water pic based on a recommendation from my dental hygienist. The system works great for cleaning the gum areas. We have found it useful to add a small amount of mouthwash to the cleaning water. The sealing mechanism for the tip could be engineering a little better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it stores easily.  What more can I say?  Good price, too.  It has extra tips for whenever this one wears out.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist.  I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. It has made a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself, you will be surprised</li>
    <li> I  really like this my dental health has improved and I enjoy how easy it is to use and store</li>
    <li> Fresh breath to be had.  You would be amazed at the stuff left behind even after a thorough brushing.  Immediately after my first use, I noticed a difference in my breath.  One thing, be very careful on the higher settings, it was too powerful for my gums and I had some bleeding.  I keep the power setting at 8 and that seems to work great for me. It is a very powerful jet of water that does an excellent job at cleaning and removing left behind particles.  I use Luke warm water mixed with mouthwash and that combination works well for me.  I recommend the water flosser as a part of anyone&#x27;s daily oral hygiene. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had waterpik products in the past and was better able to rid the unit of water.  I don&#x27;t feel as confident about doing that with this unit.  I would like to find out ways to make sure that that there is no risk of bacterial infection.</li>
    <li> Great product i love it. It works good, it reduces inflammation and leaves my breath fresh, because i put listerine</li>
    <li> A wonderful device, my gums have been transformed  after 2 weeks!! AMAZING, a necessity for every house, and every mouth in the house</li>
    <li> My mouth truly never felt this clean, outside of a dental cleaning that is.  I thought I would lose interest after a couple of days, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months straight!  I can&#x27;t go back to using ordinary dental floss anymore.  The only negative is that it can be a bit messy.  After all, it&#x27;s water shooting out at a high rate.  If not for that, I&#x27;d buy another unit for my kids.  Maybe when they&#x27;re older.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly, exactly as described, arrived on time, totally recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would prefer different is that it included two tips, so it would not be necessary to change them so frequently</li>
    <li> This is a great addition for dental hygiene.  I like the size of it (smaller than others I&#x27;ve used), the different attachments, the attachment case, and it is quiet.</li>
    <li> It makes the mouth a lot healthier, and it is not a burden like the floss to use. The water runs out quickly, but it is as quick to refill it.</li>
    <li> This works well. I use it at least once daily. Sometimes I add a little Listerine to the water which leaves a very refreshing taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I have been using water pik for years this one is a great product would buy again if needed&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Believe this product to be good but had to return it as voltage is not suitable for Australia (240 Volts).</li>
    <li> I love this product! Everyone should have a water flosser, soo much better and easier than flossing. Easy transaction. Overall, a great experience.</li>
    <li> This item is a US product that does not work in Europe and has been a total waste of money. I have spent £20 on a transformer and it still doesn&#x27;t work and it should not be on the Amazon website for sale in the 220/24V AC areas.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Fun to use for children&lt;br /&gt;- Water pressure control setting&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Max pressure little low to do the excellent job&lt;br /&gt;- whole unti is bulky and take lot of space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I like the device, as it makes flossing fun.</li>
    <li> This is the new and improved model of Waterpik - just what I wanted.  I received the product in record time.</li>
    <li> This mighty machine is fantastic!  I purchased this unit over a yr. ago I used it a couple of times and stored it away.  I took it out of the box again, and have been utilizing it for almost a week. I must say it&#x27;s AWESOME my mouth, and teeth feel so clean as if I just came from the dentist from a cleaning...</li>
    <li> I have owned mine for 2 months now using it an average of twice a day.  It has great water pressure.  My concern is that it seems to leak from the spout handle like a faucet.  I am not sure if this is normal or not, but it hasn&#x27;t impeded the operation and I just make sure to use it over the bathroom sink.  I would recommend it, but I&#x27;m open to any suggestions on how to stop the mess.</li>
    <li> my friend recommended Waterpik products for me when we went shopping, so i got one for my parents and one for myself. and this Ultra water flosser really works great for me so far. you should try it as well!</li>
    <li> I love it, it has everything you need and so easy to use. I recommend it  as a toothbrush and flosser</li>
    <li> The best way to clen my teeth!! Totally recommended! I&#x27;ll never use dental floss again in my life! The other brushes complete your waterpik product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a new water pik for a long time, but they take up so much space on the counter in the bathroom. Not this one.  takes up a very small amount of space and still has all the features I like -- especially the \\&quot;eject\\&quot; button to release the tips plus on-off control from the handle.  10 pressure settings makes it perfect for all.</li>
    <li> It leaks at the place where the reservoir is attached to the unit and it pumps too much water so if you are planning to use Listerine, you will need about 1.5 - 2 cups per cleaning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, especially for one person.  My main criticism is that the tank isn&#x27;t as large as on the older model.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with Panasonic&#x27;s Portable WaterPik because after a couple months usage, the water power dwindles despite using a new set of batteries.  It&#x27;s also a pain to clean because the reservoir tends to get moldy.  Even WaterPik&#x27;s portable contraption, the lithium ion battery dwindles and you&#x27;ll have to constantly recharge it and the water power does not even compare to the WaterPik Ultra Water Flosser.      This is the best waterpik for the home use.  It&#x27;s powerful to clean your teeth of all the grime that&#x27;s left over from eating and has enough water storage to clean your whole mouth without refilling.  Even comes with a tongue cleaner for a fresher breath.  The cord attachment is self rolled so you don&#x27;t have to worry about trying to keep in wound tight in it&#x27;s pocket, which was a concern prior to purchase.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research here on Amazon for a good \\&quot;oral irrigator,\\&quot; and all had tradeoffs. I bought this one and it&#x27;s been great. Big improvement over the ancient one I had before (this runs counter to comments longing for the old units). Compact design, plenty of power, rotating head, \\&quot;hold\\&quot; button, and relatively quiet. Can&#x27;t speak to quality of manufacture - time will tell. But the 3 year warranty was a big factor.    Note: It wasn&#x27;t clear to me that \\&quot;Water Flosser\\&quot; mean the same as a plain old waterpik, i.e., that it would work for below-the-gumline cleaning. It does, so don&#x27;t worry.</li>
    <li> With this appliance you can send a narrow, pressurized stream of water at your teeth and to where your gums meet your teeth.  The size of the unit is right, not too large, not too small.</li>
    <li> Waterpik not so great now...&lt;br /&gt;After really loving it for a couple of weeks because it worked so well and was soooooo quiet...it started getting noisy and now I&#x27;m having some trouble getting the water to come out when I first turn it on. I use it twice a day...morning &amp; night. If I take out the cleaning attachment, the water flows much more quickly but with the attachment on...it&#x27;s not great getting started. I&#x27;m not sure what to do at this point since I&#x27;ve had a waterpik for over 20 years and can&#x27;t live without one.&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> It is very powerful and useful, especially when you are really tired, and wish to go to bed right away without washing the teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these a couple of weeks ago, it works fine and seems like it&#x27;s reasonably well made but when you use it the water goes everywhere, also you have to stop and refill it.    I imagine I&#x27;ll just throw mine away because I can&#x27;t see using it very often, hard to keep the bathroom sink neat if you are spraying water all over the place on a regular basis.    Also the power seemed weak to me, I turned it up to 10 the first time I used it and to me it doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough to be of much use.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Waterpik Water Flosser. It was delivered as promised and in new conditon as promised I buy frequently from Amazon.com and have always been very satisfied with their service and products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked! My dental hygienist recommended this to me after she found heavy tartar buildup in my teeth. It gets rid of everything stuck between your teeth with simple water pressure with many attachments for under$40. It is a no brainier! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I chose this one because of the great reviews I read concerning the product. They were very accurate. I find the product to be very good.I will always recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This product provides the best way to care for your teeth and gums. I love it. It works better than flossing alone. Helps keep breath fresher by removing food particles and bacteria from deep in the gum line. I would reccommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The design is compact and well though out.  Takes less space than the cheaper model (I had 2 or 3) and has better pressure.  I like the pressure control on the side of the unit and not on the hand wand which does not work that well.  I only use the main waterpic attachment, the others are useless.  The cover is actually functional and helps keep the counter clean.  Spend a few bucks more for this better model, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand new on Amazon.com. It was defective. The thing leaked water out of the bottom of the unit all over the place. I decided to contact Waterpik directly via email with an angry letter. A day later I received a response that they had shipped a new unit out to me (Amazon was also prepared to send me a new unit). Waterpik&#x27;s response was fast with no questions asked.     The new unit works great. The pressure is more than enough. I tried to use my new unit on 10 and my gums bled. I now use it on 6 or so and my mouth feels a lot cleaner. I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The item is not trackable because wheneven the tacking number was entered into the USPS tracking system, the result was : There is no record of this item.    Where is my order ( Amazon said that th item was shipped 09/24/10 and the estimated date of arrival was 09/28/10)?    Thanks,    One of your customers</li>
    <li> i use it everyday. it help clean and protect the teeth. my wife like it too</li>
    <li> It really works well. After using it I feel my teeth are so fresh. Better than using dental floss. There are six different nozzles come with the product and one is designed for braces. Now even my kids like to use it everyday. It takes a couple trials to get used to it and prevent water spills. Other than that this product is perfect. I have used it for one month only so I cannot comment on the reliability. In terms of performance, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this two months ago because I don&#x27;t like manual flossing and thought I would give it a try.  It took a bit of getting used to, but I&#x27;m past that now, and I think it does a better job than manual flossing and leaves your mouth feeling refreshed in a way manual flossing does not. I am pleased with water flossing, but  I don&#x27;t use all the attachments and features that come with the Ultra model, so I would probably get a simpler model, if there is one, next time.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older model. This is very quiet and easier to use. Glad I bought a new one instead of fixing the old one.</li>
    <li> I really like this waterpik a lot. I like to run diluted mouthwash through it, feels great. Definitely start at the lowest setting and work your way up, this thing packs a punch! It comes with lots of neat accessories too. If there was anything I didn&#x27;t like about this machine, it&#x27;d have to be the noise. It was considerably louder than I had expected. I frequently hold the coiled hose while using it, so as not to rattle against the body of the machine. Uses about half a tank per session, so keep a cup handy or something to refill it.</li>
    <li> I had previously used the rechargeable Waterpik that left a lot to be desired and &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; in less than 2 years. The fact that the Waterpik Ultra has an adjustment for the water-pulse pressure allows one to select the most comfortable and effective pressure is a real plus. I also like the ability to press a button and temporarily stop the water flow.</li>
    <li> I just had to write on this item. My dentist didn&#x27;t say much when amazed on how my gums had changed for better after being his patient for 10 years with gum disease. He saked what I had done, and I said I used this particular brand of waterpik. I just knew before going for the quarterly treatment that all gum pockets are gone and he confirmed in amazement. Pay $50 to buy this and you will save thousands from surgery. It&#x27;s the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve seen. And, from what I&#x27;ve heard this model is the best. I started with number 5 and am on 8 now which is more than enough for me. Use it at night before going to bed or in the morning or both. It&#x27;s so refreshing. You can add mouthwash or salt to the water. Just make sure to rinse and dry it after you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s worth the effort. I think no words can explain how I feel about this.</li>
    <li> With compared to its WP-70W, this new WP-100W has the following good features that I like:  1) It runs quieter.  2) It is easy to install and remove a tip.  3) It contains more different types of tip.    But it also has some features that I do not like:  1) The horizontal On-Off switch is hard to turn on and off the without holding the base.  2) The smaller water reservoir is not enough to clean all teeth.  3) The pressure control dial is not on the handle and hard to control.     Finally, the WP-100W does not have more pressure than the WP-70W.</li>
    <li> Great product. This is my 2nd one. However, the washer under the push button to release the nozzles broke on the 1st one after only about 6 or 7 months of use.</li>
    <li> The water pik I purchased is very easy to use and has all the tools for keeping a clean mouth, tongue and gums - if you use the pik.  It is a sturdy machine and has plenty of power and you will be shocked at all the particles it flushes out when you think your mouth is already clean and brushed.  Give it a try!  I LINE IT!</li>
    <li> I think that many take their gums for granted. Cleaning is beyond clean teeth, its also healthy gums. I realize that no matter how much I floss, my gums will never be as healthy as they are now thanks to this product... Don&#x27;t think twice, its definitely worth it. I guaranty you!</li>
    <li> Having used Waterpik for several years with very positive results, I had to replace the old one because of a cracked hose.  I bought the Waterpik Ultra based on the advertised 90 psi, a marked increase from the older Waterpik.  On the first use, I found the Ultra not to live up to previous standards.  Water pressure was definitely unsatisfactory, as was the fact that the reservoir itself was much reduced.  Pressure difference may be due to the number of coils in the hose delivering water to the pik - fewer twists in the Classic than the Ultra.  In response to my complaint, Waterpik stood by their name and sent me the Classic which shows a 60 psi - and double the reservoir size.  I am convinced the flossing pressure on the Classic is markedly stronger than that on the Ultra, despite claimed psi.  Even the newer Classic may be slightly lighter pressure than my old Waterpik, but the Classic is definitely a better pick than the Ultra.  For those who are replacing older Waterpiks, I strongly recommend the Classic; so too for those trying to control gum problems.  Waterpik has worked for me in the past; hopes are that this newer model will continue to provide satisfactory flossing and gum improvement.</li>
    <li> Teeth is not good&lt;br /&gt;Because use of these products&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;But&lt;br /&gt;The volume is too loud&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got drawbacks</li>
    <li> It really works so well&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised at its efficiency&lt;br /&gt;Takes a couple of try to get use to the water but its probably&lt;br /&gt;the best and most efficient way to clean teeth and the whole mouth&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> I got braces put in and this water pik has been a life savor. Gone are the days of struggling to get my braces clean and using those stupid plastic floss needles.</li>
    <li> The Product is excellent but the smell and taste of plastic is offensive to me. Is there a way to rid it of that odor?</li>
    <li> ..... is using this gizmo on a daily basis.  Dunno what took me so long to get one  (dentist&#x27;s suggestion).</li>
    <li> Great product, but leaks a little when placing water reservoir back onto body.  But, it does get my 9 year old to brush and floss better</li>
    <li> It is much more attractive than the old Waterpik and accomplishes the same job and more.    It is quicker to use.    It is easier to manipulate.    It is easier to keep clean.    The water reservoir is just the right size.</li>
    <li> Great dental reports for many years after purchase.  Original lasted about five years of daily use even travel on vacation.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I really really like this product, it is perfect for just cleaning your teeth and just giving it that extra clean feeling. I also have tonsil stones so I use this product for that and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> I use the standard water jet attachment, 1 capful of Listerine in the res, and in 90 seconds my teeth feel a LOT cleaner than with my good ol&#x27; dental floss.</li>
    <li> Good machine, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for many years.  The hose connecting the machine to the pick becomes brittle after a couple of years and snaps in half.  I guess you get your money&#x27;s worth though.  You probably could replace the hose, but it&#x27;s old anyway.</li>
    <li> This particular waterpik is great to use, &amp; user frtiendly with several flosser to go with it. You can see all of the food particles fallen out from between your teeth when flossing. I use hot water with adding a little peroxide, this help clean your teeth with a healing for the gums. My teeth looks and feels much better with the use of the Ultra Waterpik. Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have braces and I can tell you first hand that even brushing for two minutes with an electric Sonicare toothbrush does not knock the gook out of your teeth.  I have owned 2 waterpiks and this one is FAR better!!  The orthodontic tip is excellent for getting a REAL clean.  Even if you dont have braces, BUY THIS.  This would make an excellent flosser for anyone who just cant seem to be able to get into the habit of flossing.  I love this item.  It would make an excellent Christmas present.  I would definitely buy again, and I recommend that you get this.</li>
    <li> Once you use one of these, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever got by without it!  For anyone with the onset of/or actual gum disease, this is a must!</li>
    <li> Missed his old one when it finally bit the dust. Tried the smaller version and just didn&#x27;t have the time nor pressure factor. Different attachments and extra pics storage case is great, doesn&#x27;t get lost or cruddy</li>
    <li> For some reason I have never been able to floss. I am now paying the price at the dentist, both in terms of tooth health and money spent. This product does a fine job and I hope it will allow me to have good oral health for a change.</li>
    <li> This waterpk is just a supplement to regular dental floss. At first I thought I can use it as a regular floss to replace dental floss, but after using it, I still have to use dental floss to clean my teach. Good to have one.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing....HATE. So on the recommendation of my dentist, I purchased this Waterpik and now I&#x27;m an addict! It&#x27;s easy to use and works great! It is a little bit on the noisy side, but if you put a washcloth underneath it, it quiets down considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t bring this with me on a recent family vacation and I felt so gross! The Waterpik makes your mouth feel like the dentist just cleaned your teeth, so having grime on them is really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik. It is easy to use and I like the way it stores. It&#x27;s much neater than the old model.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this waterpik.  She says it is good and powerful.  She would give it a 5 star but because it is a little noisy, she downgraded it to a 4 star.  I am using a different waterpik so I can&#x27;t really comment on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult with braces and can&#x27;t say enough of this product. I have both the portable one, and the station-which I favour more. Perfect for irrigating wisdom teeth holes, quick clean up after you eat-my teeth haven&#x27;t felt better! Highly recommend it. One con I found is that the valve inside the container will leak if you don&#x27;t seat it properly. It was leaking for the first while, but I applied pressure, and now it&#x27;s fine. Just be careful you don&#x27;t take off the container back and forth, just refill it with a cup, or bottle and you will be elated you did. Again, other than that, can&#x27;t say enough for this product-5 stars!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this Waterpik, especially with the toothbrush attachment.  Unfortunately, after about 6 months of use, it appeared that the plastic tubing was getting kinked (where it met the handle).  Unkinking it seemed to work until this last week - now it no longer pumps water at all.  It&#x27;s 1 year and 2 weeks old.  To say I am disappointed that such a well respected company such as Waterpik would put out such a flimsy product is an understatement.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, works very well, I like it. I use it every day to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> good tool for your teeth and gums...buy it..this and a sonic care tooth brush...will save you from the old age wrath..  no teeth..</li>
    <li> The waterpik was recommended by my dentist and it seems to work very well. The water pressure is good, but not all the attachments fit as tightly as I would like and leak. It does clean well near the gum line and gets a better job done after brushing. I add mouthwash to the water and it leaves your mouth refreshing. The real proof will be at the next dental cleaning. This is really 3 stars not 4, but the system will not let you correct.</li>
    <li> After 4 days of spraying the walls and mirror, I finally got the hang of using this water flosser.  It is amazing how much stuff is left between the teeth after brushing.  Hoping my dentist and hygienist will notice a difference at my next visit. I have a disability that affects my hands prevents me from using regular floss now.  This device has been a god-send.</li>
    <li> I received the package after 2 days shipping and the flosser is really useful! The tips are easy to replace and I hope teeth health can be improved soon!</li>
    <li> I have invested in two of the recharageable waterpiks and they did not last that long. This is the best electric flosser for the money. It only takes a few minutes to set it up. I hope to enjoy using this product for many years and also save my teeth. Spend a few more dollars and get it!</li>
    <li> This product is FABULOUS if you hate using traditional floss. It works great! Add a little mouthwash to the water in the reservoir, and you&#x27;ve got a dental set-up in your bathroom. This makes &#x27;flossing&#x27; enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one of these.  You would save many $$$$$$$ at the dentist by using this product.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I was never a flosser, especially the traditional way of flossing.  The whole string-awkwardly-placed-in-the-mouth thing turned me off.  When I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this product, years ago, it was my answer.  This is my 3rd Waterpik and I still view it as the greatest thing since sliced bread.  It wears well; I had my previous two for years each.  My last one didn&#x27;t last as long as my first, but I have to admit that I used it harder.  I&#x27;ll be kinder and gentler with this one.  Buy it; it&#x27;s still the best.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does what a tooth brush and dental floss cannot. Great addition to anyones oral hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t floss... ever.... so i decided to give this a shot because of its glowing reviews.  This pik is so easy to use and fun (for me) that i pik twice a day now!!!  Other reviewers suggest to start at a low number like 2 if you weren&#x27;t used to piking but i found out that was way too low.  I use a 6 after a couple weeks of use and it is a very comfortable experience.  I really like watching the water flow out of my mouth and seeing the little bits of gunk on my sink.  I use the product right after brushing and it gets the toothpaste taste out of my mouth.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thing.  He said it was able to remove a lot of the food that floss couldn&#x27;t.  He uses 3 tanks everyday after flossing.  It made a huge difference for him because his teeth are all over the place (he didn&#x27;t have braces).  For me, I liked it but I didn&#x27;t notice as much food removal than flossing.  I guess my teeth are more orderly so flossing did the job already.  The only complaint we have is that the water tank runs out pretty quickly.  But it&#x27;s a compromise you need to take for the small footprint on your counter space.  I&#x27;m fine with it.  After trying other tips (except the Pik pocket) I still found that the classic does the job better, it delivers the most pressure (besides the pik pocket, which I haven&#x27;t tried).    Also, you need some time to get used to using it.  At first we splatter water all over the sink and mirror.  But soon enough we found that we needed to close our mouth and only leave it slightly open for water to seep out.  I&#x27;d recommend this product because it works for us.</li>
    <li> Best one I have purchased so far.  Easy to clean and powerful. Do not need all the extra pieces  unnecessary</li>
    <li> A bit noisy but cleans,cleans,cleans!  Much better experience than ancient string floss method.</li>
    <li> Excelente. Recomendado.</li>
    <li> I love the Waterpik!  It&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;sliced bread&amp;#34;!  It&#x27;s very easy to use. Looks nice on my bathroom counter.  It is very effective; works much better for me than dental floss.  I no longer use dental floss; this does such a complete job!  Also has a 3-year limited warranty.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik is easy to use and has several tools to pick from.  It&#x27;s so much better than flossing!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect water pick, plenty of storage and modern looking. Resivor is more than enough!</li>
    <li> This is a decent water pick. Bought it because I have big fingers and hate flossing. cumbersome to constantly refill water tank and the unit is loud. Wish I had just bought  the shower mount water pick.</li>
    <li> After about 3 months of using this, my teeth feel so much cleaner and healthier. I&#x27;ve also noticed I have less sensitivity when eating hot or cold things. And it feels so good flossing my teeth with the waterpik that now I floss 2-3 times a day. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had one for four years. From the git go, I had problems with the lid. It is not hinged and it easily falls into the water tank. The clamp that holds the water pik is plastic and it eventually broke but I always had problems with it holding the pik. Whenever the pik is laid flat which happens sometimes when it falls out of the clamp, it leaks water. Apparently, there is a gravity flow. If properly designed, water should eject only when it is pumped. This could also be alleviated if the switch on the pik had to be pressed in order to get the water to flow. As the pik functions, the button can be pressed on the pik to stop the flow but when it is released the flow commences. Personally I would prefer it if the water did not flow until I pressed the switch on the pik. However, what finished the pik off was that the hose began to leak where it comes out at the bottom. Poor design having the hose underneath the pik.    Lesson learned. Don&#x27;t buy the more expensive waterpiks. All of them break down within three years, usually it is the irreplaceable hose which often kinks and breaks.    And don&#x27;t stop flossing your teeth with floss because despite the claims of Waterpik, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of flossing. It doesn&#x27;t always get the food out between your teeth but it is helpful and if you value your teeth, the extra flossing can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I got this item yesterday, it only took two days with Amazon Prime two-day free shipping! About the product, it works great so far and it&#x27;s definitely strong! I got to admit that I don&#x27;t floss, but I recently made a habit to make sure I brush at night and mouthwash afterwards. I used this water flosser right after I brushed my teeth, so much food and crap came out of my mouth as I watched it fall into the sink. I brush really well--at least three minutes, and I always thought I got everything out of my mouth. Also this made my bottom gums bleed a little, which is good because I know its being clean and agitated. I can already tell that there will be an improvement in my gum health if I use this consistently for a long time. Really looking forward to using this tonight! Make sure you keep the pause button always pushed except when in your mouth, or you will make a big mess all over your bathroom! Its a little bit noisy, but really who cares. And you will need to refill it every use. I managed to clean my whole mouth without having to refill it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Great product so far!</li>
    <li> This is our 4th WaterPik in probably 6 years. The others lasted about 2 years each (WP-65 or WP-70). Hopefully this one lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WaterPik has a cleaner design, but is not necessarily easier to use. One has to remove the cover to fill the water reservoir, and one has to open the cover to get a tip. On the plus side, the handle is a better design: it has an eject button to eject the tip and the water line is straight and stronger near the handle, so it is not as easy to get cracked as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complain is the water pressure - it is bearly enough! I almost returned it. We finally decided to keep it. We use the max setting to get enough water pressure.</li>
    <li> Exploded inside from the first use&lt;br /&gt;And I wasted my time reading how to use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t last one day afterall</li>
    <li> What else can be said about the Waterpik?&lt;br /&gt;From the first day I removed it from its box, I&#x27;ve never regretted the purchase! Literally, every time I use the machine, it leaves me with the clean feeling I was only used to having after a professional cleaning! That said, the process can seem a little daunting compared to a regular brushing routine, but the results are just too good to pass up!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret the purchase and will understand why the Waterpik is rated #1!</li>
    <li> Just what my hubby wanted and her used it last night for the first time. Great product that comes with everything you need to last awhile.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik on and off most of my life.  Nothing makes my mouth cleaner and that includes my Sonicare toothbrush.  This reaches places toothbrushes just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I am dead serious about my oral health.  I want to keep my precious teeth forever.&lt;br /&gt;So I used my Sonicare [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] first, then this, then two oral rinses, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I just had my gum pockets measured and none were more than 2 millimeters.&lt;br /&gt;I also have not needed dental work in over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put my Closys Mouthwash [[ASIN:B001ET7L8K Closys Alcohol-Free Oral Rinse, With Flavor Control, 32 fl oz (946 ml) (Pack of 2)]] into the resevoir of this and spray it into all the spaces between my teeth to steralize them.  Closys has a form of bacteria killing chlorine in it. At night I finish up with Act Mouth Rinse to give my teeth a coating of flouride which stays on for the night.  I also use a flouride gel once a week that is prescription only from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with six attachments, including one for cleaning the tongue, and one for getting into gum pockets.  There probably isn&#x27;t anything better to use at home than this for the health of the gums.  It can get slightly under the edge of the gums with the tiny gum attachment to spray out the debris.  It gets things floss misses, but I still use floss also.  I like the pause button on the handle to pause the water jet if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrushes can&#x27;t get all the way between teeth like a Waterpik can.  I am obsessed with clean healthy white teeth and my Waterpik is an important decay fighting weapon in my&lt;br /&gt;arsenal.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Works Very Well.  Clean teeth easily and we use after flossing and brushing and it still finds small particles.</li>
    <li> We just replaced our inherited, older model WaterPik, which was a great machine. The new one is also just fine, and pulses a little more evenly. Among its innovations, it has a pause button on the handle, which can be useful. It would be good if they had more than one normal tip instead of all the specialized tips, such as those for periodontal issues and orthodonture. Color-coded regular tips would be useful as well. Overall, the Waterpik is an invaluable invention for maintaining oral health.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my waterpik!  As an experiment, I used the waterpik after flossing and was surprised to see how much I missed when flossing.  My dentist never believed me when I told him I flossed - guess I was never doing it right?  I don&#x27;t know, but I have much better checkup after using this regularly (2x/day) and flossing right after.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though, took me a while to get used to it - had water everywhere LOL!  All in all, very glad I purchased it and even more glad that I actually USE it!</li>
    <li> too loud.&lt;br /&gt;it sounds like the motor is going to explode.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s going to last.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended getting a Waterpik because I was having some problems with my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never used one before but have been generally satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:  It took me a while to get comfortable with it and initially it took me forever to go around both the inside and outside of my gums...but after I got the hang of it...it now takes a lot less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the pik tool for use along the gum line.  If that&#x27;s what you use if for too...make sure you have it set to the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negatives:  As others have noted in their reviews here...the coiled cord is VERY short.  Since I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot;, that&#x27;s meant having to move a chair in front of the sink....so I don&#x27;t have to stand bent in half while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have also indicated...the cut off switch on the handle hardly works at all...maybe about one out of ten times...so I just use the on-off button on the base instead...which is way less convenient...but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how much water ends up everywhere.  Waterpik says to shape your mouth in a way to allow water to drain out into the sink...but I find a good portion of it rolling down my arm and otherwise splashing all over the sink.  So I keep a folded up towel along the edge of the sink to catch it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than paying a dental tech to clean my teeth every night...negatives aside this seems to be doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3-star rating is due to the negatives I noted.</li>
    <li> I realy like it because it cleans deeply where the brush cant clean, the pressure is strong and i like that, highly recommended</li>
    <li> I just got this product in the mail not more than an hour ago, and on my first try I was dismayed to find that it does not work at all. I am extremely disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> Waterpicks by the same manufacturer are just another trap and another way to waste your money. They do work, the original model is an annoyance as far as handling the narrow hose (or tube)conducting the fluid tothe tips. Almost impossible to house it back to its place in the equipment body.After a wjile, the machine stops workinf and you have to throw it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model (the current one) attracted me because an supposedly way to house the hose&lt;br /&gt;+tip assembly. It worked for less than a month, them the machine went silent and stop working. Trash was the destination, just like the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more waterpicks from this manufacturer to me, no matter what my dentist or higyenist says.</li>
    <li> Great check ups after using this!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try and decrease the number of visits to my dental hygienist. I have my teeth cleaned at least four times a year but it has become so expensive that I wanted to try and stretch the time out a bit between cleanings. I take very good care of my teeth and the hygienist notes that there is hardly anything to clean when I go in, but the truth is I&#x27;m a bit over the top about having clean teeth and fresh breath. So I bought the Waterpik Water Flosser and I love this thing. Now I can&#x27;t brush without it. My mouth just feels so much cleaner and fresher after using it. I actually missed my water flosser when I couldn&#x27;t take it with me on vacation.    The Waterpik comes with several cleaning attachments included, but you will only need the basic one (the one with no brush). Also try putting a little bit of mouth wash in with the water for a really clean taste. I find that water flossing does a much better job than dental floss and is easier to do.</li>
    <li> Love this so much better than flossing. It makes my life so much easier with my permanent retainer in the bottom of my mouth.</li>
    <li> I loved this Waterpik Water Flosser Ultra the first day I used it and still do a month later. It does such an awesome job of water flossing, cleaning deeply between my teeth and below the gumline prior to brushing! The unit is compact, just the perfect size for my small vanity area. It&#x27;s amazingly quieter than the last 3 Waterpiks I&#x27;ve owned. The 10 pressure settings are easy to dial providing me optimum control. Priming is also a snap by pressing gently on the container&#x27;s rim. Plus there are 6 unique tips for various functions included in the storage lid. The cord on the hand piece is plenty long and it efficiently recoils right back into place when I replace it on the base. It only takes me about a minute to use; then I dry the ample-sized water container with a towel and replace for the next time. The price is reasonable (especially on Amazon) for all it does/what&#x27;s included and it comes with a 3 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these yesterday and returned it the same day. It just didn&#x27;t work. All it did was hum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Hydrofloss brand oral irrigator which I have used for several years. It&#x27;s loud, but never a problem. I needed a second unit for travel and couldn&#x27;t find the Hydrofloss locally, so I went to a large local department store in NYC and on the recommendation of the salesperson, I bought the Water Pik Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Water Pik never left the starting gate. I thought I might get help from customer service at Water Pik. That was an even bigger laugh. Called the number in the instructions mid-afternoon EST on a Friday, no answer in 100 rings. Called three different times, rang 100 times: no answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: no quality control, no customer service. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I have received it for about a month, and it is just good! The quality is good. When I just ordered this one, I saw it in Costco for around 60 bucks which include an extra travel size one! Well, anyway, I still like it.</li>
    <li> use it two times a day and my teeth feel squeeky clean....  It will be the \\&quot;true test\\&quot; when I head back to the dentist chair.  I like the cover over the water tank to keep particles from getting inside</li>
    <li> Not really an improvement in performance from older version. Seems like water capacity is actually less than my older model. Ergonomically its a little nicer but that&#x27;s really about it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the older version than stay with it, but its fine and I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t already have one.</li>
    <li> If you bought this and abandoned it, please give it another chance. It takes some time to develop a less-mess technique, but it&#x27;s well worth it. I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months now and was just waiting for my first dental visit for corroboration: this thing works! Verdict: \\&quot;These bridges look really good!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always before, the verdict was, \\&quot;Are you flossing under these bridges?,\\&quot; with a knowing look. Okay, I&#x27;m lazy. And I have a small mouth, hard to floss. But I&#x27;m not stupid, I knew I had to find a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first got the handheld unit. Unfortunate. I gave it a good try, but it was clumsy for me to hold, and kept running out of water (which had to be added through a small hole--can you say \\&quot;needle in a haystack\\&quot;?). Fortunately, Amazon has a very good return policy and I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the hygienist kept pushing, so I tried the Waterpik Ultra. Wow! Not my dad&#x27;s Waterpik. Well-designed (love the permanent coil in the hose), smaller footprint (but still not for a stand-alone sink), quieter, and even attractive. In fact, if it weren&#x27;t so messy I&#x27;d call it fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I DO call it fun to use, since I learned to be less messy with it. Mainly, hold it firmly but lightly and at a wrist angle so that water doesn&#x27;t run down your arm. If you need help, check out videos on YouTube. Yes, people do post videos of themselves flossing and brushing, and some of them are quite useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t give up on the Waterpik Ultra. Your bridges, braces, etc., will thank you.</li>
    <li> This unit is so much quieter and nicer than the one I have been using for about 5 years. Well worth the few extra dollars..</li>
    <li> My daughter just got braces and orthodontist recommended we get the Waterlpik to help keep braces and teeth clean. She uses twice a day and loves it so I started using it also. I love it because my teeth feel much cleaner than with regular flossing</li>
    <li> I would faithfully brush my teeth twice a day, but I was always bad about flossing. I never seemed to do it right, it seemed like I was always missing some part of my mouth when I did it, and besides it hurt and made my mouth bleed and so I basically just didn&#x27;t do it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my last teeth cleaning at the dentist I decided I needed to do something about this.  I really don&#x27;t have any desire to get dentures in 30 years and so instead I bought this thing.  I remember my parents having one of these 20 years ago.  My main memory was when you turned it on, that thing was loud enough to make the house shake.  It was also huge, like the size of a toaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one is largely an improvement.  It is quite a bit smaller now.  It is still not exactly quiet (you definitely could not run this with your spouse asleep in the next room) but it no longer sounds like a piece of heavy construction equipment has been let loose in your bathroom.  Just like many of you remember, it can make a bit of a mess until you get the hang of it, basically you lean over the sink with your mouth open and look straight down at the drain and work it around while the jet and spray never leaves your mouth and the water runs straight down into the sink.  With a little practice you will get the hang of it and no longer spray water everywhere, but the first couple of times have some spare towels handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pour a little bit of mouthwash into the water compartment with the warm water to improve the efficacy of it.  The water compartment is just adequate once you get proficient with it, but until you get experienced with it you will end up needing to refill it.  Basically, they expect you to work quickly and efficiently at it, with no real pauses or stops along the way.  Once you master it you will be able to do a good job with the water they give you, but it takes a while to get that good at it and they give you very little excess capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can actually see what is coming out of your mouth as you lean over and look down into the sink, and that makes it pretty clear that this thing is doing a good job.  Indeed, I tried flossing the regular way just to test it after I used the Waterpik and I really didn&#x27;t get a thing and my teeth were clean even under the gum line.  So at least as far as I can tell, it really doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind if you do it right.  I have the power set just above half way up, and that seems fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6 weeks.  My mouth is definitely healthier, my gums no longer bleed when I brush my teeth and just looking at my gums they look a lot healthier, and my teeth look cleaner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: Probably my biggest complaint is that I don&#x27;t like how the water compartment is designed.  It comes off to fill under the tap and then sits in a little bowl shaped thing when it is in use.  The problem with this design is that lets water into the little bowl shaped thing while it is operating, which then just sits there and never dries if the water compartment is left sitting on the machine after you use it.  Imagine putting one wet bowl down onto another one and you will understand the problem.  So you basically have to pull the reservoir off and leave it unattached to dry after you use it, or realize that mold and foulness will grow in the white bowl and will then have to be cleaned and scrubbed out regularly.  Also, I think the last thing I want to pump into my mouth when I am trying to clean it is a bit of brackish, foul water that has been sitting there since yesterday gathering germs and such.  I just take off the water reservoir and set it next to the machine to dry after I use it, but this is such an obvious design flaw I am amazed somebody didn&#x27;t catch it.  There are probably a million ways to design a removable reservoir that don&#x27;t create this problem so it mystifies me that it was made like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no purpose whatsoever in the top, it sits in the drawer untouched, but at least holds most of the spare nozzles and funky attachments I have never used.  For some strange reason it doesn&#x27;t have places for everything they give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other main downside is time - you need to run the water until it is warm, fill up the reservoir and then run the thing for a couple minutes.  So it adds maybe 5-7 minutes to your evening routine at night.  (You only need to do it once a day, but you should do it at night after you&#x27;ve eaten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me these little tradeoffs were all worth it.  I didn&#x27;t floss regularly before I had this and now I do.  Now my mouth is healthier and so I have to say it really ultimately excels at the the task I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already floss effectively and regularly, and your gums are healthy and never bleed, etc. then this is probably not worth the hassle.  But if you aren&#x27;t somebody who flosses dutifully and just really don&#x27;t really like to floss the traditional way, it does seem to do a good job.  I don&#x27;t expect it will last forever, it doesn&#x27;t strike you as something that is likely to be terribly durable, but it isn&#x27;t so expensive that when it inevitably dies you are going to be deeply upset about it.  Assuming it holds up to a few years of daily use, I figure I will have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.n the top, it sits in the drawer untouched, but at least holds most of the spare nozzles and funky attachments I have never used.

    <li> Works silent. Easy tu put and retire water pic. Good regulation for pressure of water pic. The best WaterPic I buy</li>
    <li> I have had waterpiks in the past but nothing like this one.  It has adjustable pressure and a pause button.  The head turns too.  There are several attachments to choose from.  I think it works for anyone and does a great job of stimulating the gums.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What a bargain!!! This work great and it help my gum heal. I use mouth wash with this unit. This is deafiently something to have if you want to prevent gum disease.</li>
    <li> Works just like my Dentist said. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! only thing is it is kinda loud. other than that I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I liked this model quite well for the first month, then it became harder to insert the tip into the handle and pretty soon, the tip would not seat in the handle at all and water leaked out of the handle. Argh! What a waste of $$. I would like to see a similar device that could be disassembled, cleaned and fixed.</li>
    <li> I FOUND MY TEETH FEELING MUCH CLEANER WHEN USING THE WATERPICK AND MY GUMS TOO. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a 90 year old who was used to the Conair Interplak. Because it did not work well, we decided to give this new model a try. The pluses include the compact size, see-through reservoir, quiet motor, and easy to turn adjustment control. The water irrigation works well. Two problems, though. Every time the water is used up and the unit is turned off, the reset switch at the outlet is tripped. This did not happen with the other brand and it has caused frustration, since someone (an aide) must then reset the bathroom switch. Also, the on/off switch seems to be difficult for an older person to use. The up/down switch on the older model Waterpiks is easier for shaky fingers.</li>
    <li> This is the best, most stable and efficient water pik I have ever used.  It has an ease of operation thst no other appliance had at even double the price,.      You can&#x27;t go wrong with this water pik.</li>
    <li> Nice little water pick, easy to use, great directions, easily removable refillable water tank, lots of attachments, many speeds, low is comfortable and high is definitely deep cleaning...</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;pic\\&quot; performs very good.  The water well is skimpy and runs out of water quickly.  The cover on the well stores additional items unnecessarily  and is sometimes difficult to put in place.</li>
    <li> This new Waterpik is a lovely, modern design and comes with all kinds of piks, for gums, tongue, gum pockets, etc.  I am delighted with the very fast delivery from the seller.    The only criticism is that the tank holding the water is much smaller than the old type, so that it seems the water goes down very quickly and unless you refill the tank, you get a shorter period of high powered stream.</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t say that my teeth are any cleaner or look better, it sure feels great to use this waterpik.  I bought it for my wife, who has a bridge that gives her problems and her dentist recommended getting one.  When I saw that it came with attachments for more than one person, I decided to try it. I LOVE IT!  My mouth feels fresh after using and feels clean like I just went to the dentist for a cleaning.  I use it on a 7 setting, my wife likes 4.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the head can pop off too easily if your thumb hits the button, shooting water all over.  Sometimes it comes out of my mouth when cleaning my front gums, again shooting water all over.</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with this product after a couple of months worth of use, and can definately see an improvement in my oral hygiene since I began using the Water Pik.</li>
    <li> Great!  Finally it does&#x27;t sound like a jumbo jet taking off in our house when he water piks</li>
    <li> I have purchased a portable water jet earlier, and was dissatisfied with the water pressure. The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet solved that. The water pressure is easily adjustable and quite adequate for the job. It is convenient to use and is very helpful in cleaning between the teeth.</li>
    <li> The product is everything that I expected and much more.  I have been having serious gum problems and this has served be a major factor in rectifying the condition.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I have had Waterpik products since 1980&#x27;s.  Great investment which enables healthy dental choices and promotes a healthy life style. I like all the new features and it is an improvement upon older models.  Do yourself a favor and buy this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpik after my last one bit the dust after less than a year of service.  The rechargeable battery just got weaker and weaker, which seems to be a problem with waterpik portables.  I read all the reviews and this one got the highest marks.  It&#x27;s not portable, but I need a waterpik that I can use daily and this one has the power for daily use.  The portable model didn&#x27;t hold as much water as this model.  I used to have to refill the portable, I only need to fill this one once for each cleaning.  Since I&#x27;ve been using a waterpik on my dental hygienist&#x27;s recommendation, I&#x27;ve had less plague buildup, less time having her chip away at my teeth.  I used to have to have my teeth cleaned by the hygienist every 3 months, now it&#x27;s every 6 months.  I&#x27;m saving money and my teeth are in better shape.</li>
    <li> So far so good on this unit.  Got this to replace an Interplak that died after six months.  I find the power far superior to the Interplak and the very generous solution tank is a refreshing change.  I recommend you consider this unit if you want to replace what you are using now!</li>
    <li> Purchased this Waterpik to replace a Grossan Nasal Hydropulse machine that went belly-up.  I have had this unit several weeks, and like it very much.  It has the ability to increase the pressure the water comes out to an effective rate for sinus flushing, and does a nice job of \\&quot;pulsing\\&quot; the water out.  I just put one of my nasal tip pieces from the Grossan unit onto the end of one of the waterpiks.      I mix up and sift 2 parts sea salt and 1 part baking soda for my solution.  I make up a tub big enough to last several weeks.  I add one level teaspoon to the basin before filling with comfortably warm tap water.  Baking soda moderates the salt, so it does not sting your nose.     The Waterpik has pressure settings from 2 - 10. I can use most of the basin full for nasal flushing with the pressure set on \\&quot;6\\&quot;, then switch tips on the machine, turn down the pressure to \\&quot;2\\&quot; and do my teeth. I fill the basin again with warm water, and flush the lines out to avoid any clogging or other problems.  I put it on full pressure for this, and it goes very quickly.     I have a bad cold right now. I have been using the Waterpik 3x/day after having blown my nose as well as possible (without blowing too hard).  Lots more comes out, and I can breathe well for a few hours.  Very effective.     I like it that I can do my sinuses and teeth with the same unit, and do it on one basin filling. I don&#x27;t use the white top piece that holds the assessories.  I stuffed it in a drawer. It is just one more thing to have to fuss with when I want to fill the basin. When I am done flushing the unit, I take a kleenex and dry out the base area of the unit, and put the basin resting upside down over the base of the unit.  (I have it leaning against the mirror to keep it there)  I think it does   better for drying the unit out between uses.</li>
    <li> (UPDATED REVIEW) Well... less than four months later, it broke.    After reading all the reviews, I was very careful with our water pik. I didn&#x27;t remove the tank, instead poured water into it, preventing leaking problems mentioned.  Unfortunately, there are two people sharing the unit, using his/her own tip. The changing of the tips wore out the seal in four months.    Contacted the company and they are sending replacement parts. NO APOLOGY ABOUT THE SHORT LIFE OF THE PRODUCT!    The only solution is to either buy a \\&quot;his and hers\\&quot; or don&#x27;t remove the tip and just share one.    Disappointing! No pride in workmanship; profit over quality.    (ORIGINAL REVIEW) Almost didn&#x27;t purchase this because of all the negative reviews, but the dentist told me to get one so I did.    Based on other reviewers&#x27; warnings about leaking, I don&#x27;t remove the top tank to refill, but use a little glass pitcher and turn the whole unit over to empty. So, no leaking problems (yet). Most of the tips besides the regular ones are pretty useless. Oh well.    Also, I fill the tank as full as it can get for one cleaning. I only use setting 4 (of 10) and barely get through my whole mouth with that amount of water. If someone uses more pressure, the water tank would have to be refilled halfway through one use.    In the end, my teeth are cleaner and my gums healthier, which is a lot cheaper than extra trips to the dentist or loosing teeth.</li>
    <li> Initial unit received but only worked once.  Contacted Waterpik who send a replacement within 3 days.  2nd unit works great.  Now using at least once per day, sometimes twice per day.</li>
    <li> the waterpik seems to be a very good product. it seems to do what it was made to do; it stimulate the gums, and removes debris that brushing and rinsing miss. the water container empties fairly quickly, but that&#x27;s a very small inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet    This was recommended by my Chiropractor and good friend, who said his gums where thankful. I have started using it after all meals I have at home just as a quick cleaning as it takes just a minute and my mouth feels refreshed. I recommend this to everyone.I have flossed after use and can say it is not even necessary after \\&quot;water picking\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The waterpik needs a much longer hose. It would be nice to have a hose long enough to reach from the vanity to the shower. I would also like a larger water reservoir. This is my first waterpik and I have only had it since Dec 2007. It seems to do a nice job so far. Mr Clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik for over twenty years. It&#x27;s a reliable product that does exactly what the manufacturer says. The Ultra Dental Water Jet is probably the best one yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for getting your back teeth clean and free of lodged food.  Just two small problems:  The reservoir empties quickly when using the std pick tip and the storage space in the reservoir cover doesn&#x27;t lend itself to securely holding the various tips as the manufacturer advertises.  Still, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> This product is simple to use and takes little space on my vanity.  Has different jet tips for different needs.  I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  Easy operating instructions, simple controls and tools.  The only change I would make is to suggest that the water control switch (valve) should be in a \\&quot;normally off\\&quot; position instead of \\&quot;ON\\&quot;.  If you neglect to press the water control switch \\&quot;in\\&quot; when you turn the power on, you have water shooting out of the pik!  There is more than sufficient pressure to clean gums and between teeth.</li>
    <li> We are most pleased with our Waterpick Water Jet.  An excellent product at a very good price.</li>
    <li> This is a great SMALL machine.  I bought my dad a larger Waterpick a couple of years ago.  This Waterpick Ultra has a much smaller footspace and is lightweight and easy to store under the sink when not in use.  It has a lot of attachments that store easily under the top of the water compartment and don&#x27;t fall out when filling the water container.  I think my teeth feel cleaner than ever before and my gums invigorated.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a child with new braces.  For a reason I can&#x27;t understand, you have to press the button on the handle to stop the flow of water.  Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to press the button to START the flow??  My whole family has tried it and each of us has sprayed the mirror and each other with this crazy thing.  It does work well in that it removes debris and gives the teeth and gums an excellent cleaning. We don&#x27;t have any of the leaking issues. Still, the design flaw is seriously annoying and messy.</li>
    <li> I start out giving this 5 stars for doing a great job: my gum health is much improved since I started using this. In fact, I saved myself from having gum surgery. But it has a couple things that really bug me. For one, the lid on the top uses some very small hinge pieces that can&#x27;t take much force. Dropping it even a short distance (as can happen with something you&#x27;re removing and replacing a lot) will probably break it, as happened to me. Another issue: the black rubber valve in the bottom of the reservoir has started to leak really bad, which gets water/mouthwash all over the sink and countertop when emptying the device. We have to push it down with our finger to get it to seat correctly, every time. Also, this is the second one of these I own, and it&#x27;s much lighter, and very much louder, than the previous one. I&#x27;m guessing they cheaped out on the pump mechanism on the newest version. It&#x27;s not just louder sound-wise, but also electrically: we have to be careful when we use it, because when it&#x27;s on it disrupts shows that are recording on our DVR! We were having segments of shows just go all blocky/digitally messed up. And it&#x27;s not even near the DVR, and we have no other electrical issues in our house. I&#x27;m probably going to try another brand when this one breaks.</li>
    <li> This waterpic cleans, messages, and keeps your teeth and gums  healthy and disease free. For sure, your teeth will stay attached  to your gums and in your mouth a lot longer with regular use. I  use mine after every meal. The pulsating action clears those nasty  food particles out from between your teeth and under gums right down  the drain. It takes a few practice runs to get skilled with this unit.  I can almost guarantee that the first few times you use it you&#x27;ll  be reaching for your favorite glass cleaner, as most of your last  meal will be on the bathroom mirror - but hey, at least you&#x27;ve got  clean teeth! No kidding aside, it&#x27;s a great product. Just wear a   wet suit until you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Works great and is simple and convenient. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I found that some of the extra piks are really not worth the extra cost. I think a good brushing works a lot better than the tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> Recently my husband and I have braces. We tried the dental floss bit with the device supplied by the orthodontist used to thread the floss through the braces was not only time consuming, but the floss got wrapped around the braces culminating in total ineffectiveness.     The Waterpik is a dream come true. I have been using the orange tip and the brush tip. I put the strength on 8. I read in a review that anything under 6 is worthless. This device makes my teeth sparkle and lifts out all kinds of food partials that I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought were there at all. It cleans deep into the gum line. I find it difficult but not impossible to do the inside teeth. Apparently, our sinuses are somehow beyond the roof of our mouth because if you spray too hard there you will feel it in the sinus area.     I read a review that complained about the pik because it leaked water all over the place. That problem is not possible because we are told in the directions to leave the pik empty. The water problem I have is spray from the force of the water. You have to make sure to keep that tip inside your mouth at all times or the spray will be all over where ever you point the tip. That is a very small price to pay for such a clean feeling in your teeth.     This product is a MUST HAVE for anyone with braces. If you don&#x27;t have braces you could do just as well with a sonic electric toothbrush and floss. We are going on a Caribbean cruise in three weeks and will bring the pik with us. It&#x27;s THAT good!  :)</li>
    <li> the works well. my kids have braces now and it helps keep the braces much cleaner.  before the water pick they always had something disgusting clinging to the braces somewhere even after flossing and brushing.  great product!     i do wish there were more attachments however.  there are 2 regular jets, one tongue cleaner and one ortho pick. it would be nice to have 2 of each.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is SUPER.  Very strong water flow.  I&#x27;m using at half power and it is more than enough to clean between your teeth.  This replaced a Braun that had lost water power after a year.  It was still under warranty, I had it repaired but it still wasn&#x27;t strong enough to clean.    I would recommend this product to anyone.  If you have never used a Waterpik you can&#x27;t believe how much it removes between your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used the Water Pik brand in the past and knew  I could rely on it&#x27;s performance once again...it does  a great job and did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I bought a WaterPik 2 weeks ago, and I am impressed beyond my expectations.    The dentist was unable to offer a cause to some mouth irritation I was feeling and had been feeling for close to 5 months.  He wanted to replace a new crown to help even out the bite pressure.  He was fishing for a solution, as xrays showed nothing and everything looked fine.  I vetoed the new crown suggestion immediatetly.  No Thanks!  And decided to try a WaterPik and purchased one the next day.    1 part mouth wash, 4 to 5 parts warm water, once or twice a day, and my gums and teeth feel incredible after 2 short weeks.  I hate flossing but still do from time to time.  Well, I did just floss, and the floss moved more smoothly between my teeth then ever before, and not even the slightest trace of bleeding.    Get a WaterPik!!!  Best $60 I ever spent.  :D</li>
    <li> I should have purchased the Waterpik a long time ago. It&#x27;s truly a very good appliance. It&#x27;s easier and more effective than flossing. Two weeks of using this product rejuvinated my gums and teeth.  The price was cheaper at Amazon. I highly recommend not only the product, but the purchase from Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit of practice for me to get the whole coordination-thing down with handling the water and all the attachments, but I never thought a mouth could get that clean.  I started out on the lower numbers just to get the hang of it and worked my way up.  On 5 I used it to brush my teeth only and they were gleeming!  On 10 I used it to brush my tongue and I had no idea a tongue could feel so clean!!  Toothpaste seems like overkill.  An absolute must-buy for anyone who doesn&#x27;t floss and brush regularly.  Bonus: it makes brushing gums and teeth fun!!</li>
    <li> the waterpic that I purchased from Amazon was fantastic price, shipped fast and I would not hesitate to buy from this company    Dottie Laurenzano</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a replacement for a older model that \\&quot;tanked\\&quot;, and it was the perfect choice.  Designed well; compact with multiple tools; easy to use, and the price was right.</li>
    <li> The product works as described.  Only used the regular water pik attachement. Never used the other ones before.  The water container is a bit small.</li>
    <li> This is my third Waterpik. The two previous failed shortly after the two year warranty ran out when the hand held part sprang massive leaks. They are not repairable, but this one is supposed to be.     My main gripe is that the highest pressure setting gives less pressure than the earlier models I used. I&#x27;ve got tough gums, I guess. Also, the water tank is smaller, but it&#x27;s adequate for my purposes. The top tray that holds the nozzles is nothing more than a nice touch that gets in my way when I fill the reservoir. It&#x27;s now in the cabinet under the sink.     On the whole, a good unit but I&#x27;d like more pressure.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, works great...Love it.........(Didn&#x27;t realize it had quite a few attachments) Great deal for the money..</li>
    <li> Very quiet.  Compact.  Not quite as powerful as my previous one, but it does the job fine.  The new nozzle is the best so far!.</li>
    <li> I felt disgusting when my old waterpik died, and I was waiting for this new one to arrive. You do become spoiled after you start using these things. Flossing alone just doesn&#x27;t do it. This new model is much better than my old one. It&#x27;s more powerful, the elements attach and detach easier, and the storage system on top lets things air out better. It&#x27;s also more compact.</li>
    <li> It does work very well but international travelers need to know it is 120 VOLT 60 HERTZ only.   I use it with a travel transformer, but because other countries use 50 Hz (transformers do not adjust frequency) it pulses slower than in the US, but it still gives satisfactory performance. The lower frequency will probably shorten the pump motors life, but because it works so well, I can live with that. The manufacturers website gave NO Information about the voltage and frequency for this unit and that is why I give only 4 stars.    My vendor was J&amp;R MUSIC AND COMPUTER WORLD and I give them my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION for fast responsive service to APO and FPO addresses.     I would have purchased directly from Amazon, but I live on a Forward Operating Camp in Iraq and Amazon does not ship most items to APO addresses.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Very good quality and quiet. Has several useful attachments. Much better that the last few I have had. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I found this water jet to be very satisfactory.  I like the way the handle for the jet stands and the cord recoils.  My only suggestion is that the lid should have a lip around all of it so that it cannot fall into the water container.  I have to make a point of hooking the little lip on the back before I release the lid but then it works all right. It is a good dental tool.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  My son had one and recommended it to me.  It really makes your mouth feel clean, it is easy to use, it is compact yet powerful.  Adding it to my routine of brushing and flossing makes for the cleanest teeth you can get.  I have had it about a month now, and have no problems with it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Waterpik!  My teeth have never looked better.  The results have convinced several of my friends to purchase one as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have never been a dedicated flosser and I needed something as I get bad buildup so my denstist suggested this and I went and picked it up. So what if it&#x27;s another machine/gadget that just sits there.  Well I can tell you so far I love it.  My mouth feels clean and I love that feeling. Very happy I picked it up.  Right now since its the first time I am really using and its only been a couple of weeks, I have it on two. I think the pressure is great and the water tank is enough for me. Hopefully, I will be able to crank it up once my gums get more use to the pressure.  The water does squirt around a little but that is expected since its flowing water. Flowing water is never neat but I don&#x27;t think this is a big problem at all, at least for me.</li>
    <li> I have had a few types of dental water jets and I have to say that this(Waterpik Ultra Dental Jet) seems to be the best yet. It works well, has a nice case for the attachments and the price was right as well. (I did get an extra $10.00 off).</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VXM7GQ Waterpik Ultra Water Jet - WP100]]The Ultra Waterpik is a mixed bag of utilities.  On the one hand it comes with more tips than there are slots in the hinge-covered reservoir lid, a handy place to store them, and it has a variable pressure feature, like its predecessors, making it arguably the best tool for gum hygiene.  One starts at a lower pressure and increases the pressure as the gums heal and toughen.  Its predecessor has reduced my gum pockets by over 50% with similar features.  That having been said, its covered reservoir is too small - good for only one quadrant if you&#x27;re serious about washing your gum problems away.  I&#x27;m also resigned to the fact that Waterpiks leak after some use, and their hoses rupture, but despite that, and even though the name and the price are somewhat overblown, it&#x27;s still an excellent oral hygiene tool.</li>
    <li> We purchased higher priced irrigators for many years, but the Water Pik model meets or surpasses those other brands!  Will buy this one again and again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a Waterpik that finally died after some years. Over all I have no complaints It works well, and does what is supposed to ( you don&#x27;t see that to often anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is of course almost always a but....and this is mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik attachment clicks into a rotating head. This allows you to reposition the angle as needed while in use. I feel that the detents (click stops)are to loose and should be more firm.&lt;br /&gt;All together I think it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> My dentist had suggested that I use a water pic in order to help restore the health of my gums. I found this model on Amazon, and I have to say I love it. It&#x27;s fun to use and really gets small particles out from between your teeth. The quality is great for the money, it works perfectly and comes with plenty of attachments. My husband, who is a regualar user of dental floss loves it too.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra dental Water Jet works very well.  I like the idea that the pik does not have to be removed after each use.  I have been a water pik user for 30 some years and recommend it to everybody</li>
    <li> This is about the quietest Waterpik there is in the market.  The previous versions that I had was so noisy, my neighbors knows when I am using it.  Control knobs are well-placed and the adjustable jet speed is very useful.</li>
    <li> After my new dentist badgered me to get a Waterpik, she obviously knew I just wasn&#x27;t the type to get my big hands in my small mouth with some dumb old string, I finally ordered one.  It really has been worth every penny.  Even convinced my wife to start using it and some gum problems she has had are starting to go away.  We can&#x27;t understand why her dentist hasn&#x27;t been bugging her like mine did.  About the only complaint I have is it works counterintuitively.  I would have thought when you push the button on the hand held head that it would pump but it is the opposite.  Turn the switch and you better have it in your mouth ready to go and only push the button when you need to remove the head from your mouth.  I&#x27;ve done my share of washing the mirror in our bathroom.  Otherwise works super.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik.  It is so quick and efficient.  Tend not to use all the accessories.  Would recommend to everyone.  My dentist has seen a positive improvement in oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I never thought Amazon is such a worst company.  Worst customer support, never buy either this item or other items from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Girlfriend, she just got braces. This thing works great, I now use this Waterpik every day also. I Can&#x27;t find one bad thing to say about this product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Bought originally to help remove tonsil stones, but that was too difficult. Use it daily instead of flossing instead and LOVE IT! Works really well for cleaning under bridges and around crowns and keeping gums healthy! A welcome addition if you want to keep your mouth healthy! A great complement to the Sonicaire toothbrush. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It appears to be working just fine and doing what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Best price and the extra tips for the device was a surprise.</li>
    <li> We ordered the Ultra Dental Water Jet and the product was delivered very quickly and in great condition. My wife and I have been using it now for over a month and we are both VERY PLEASED with the results. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT to all seeking a Water Pic. ALSO, as for the company AMAZON.COM I can&#x27;t be happier with there service and the quality of it. I have been purchasing online many times from many website companies and I FEEL THAT AMAZON.COM is BY FAR THE BEST internet business for purchasing most of your needed items. They sell almost everything and it&#x27;s ALWAYS HIGHEST QUALITY along with the GREATEST SERVICE.  I GIVE AMAZON.COM a 10 STAR RATING.</li>
    <li> I was having tender gums,  everytime I will floss, my gums will bleed.They improve some much, my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore, I highly recomended. This is my first water pik and the last one, I will stick with this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning debris under fixed bridges and between teeth and gumlines.    Your teeth will really feel clean after using.    When you go on vacation you will really miss the machine.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price. Takes a little getting used to: several decades of brushing alone make for habits that allow the overspray coming out of your mouth to hit a wide target. It takes a couple of uses to get your mouth retrained to allow the rinse to drain into the sink.</li>
    <li> Bought the Waterpik WP-100 7 days before my dental cleaning which was today, all I can say is wow. Have shrinking gums with some pockets  in other words periodontal disease. Hardly any pain with the cleaning,spit  only one spot of blood. Gums have tightened up, pockets have shrunk,there was not much to scrape. My normal procedure for cleaning is electric toothbrush with toothpaste, then use salt, and floss. That never produced  this type of easy session at the dentist.  So I don&#x27;t care if this does break in six months, I will buy another  with these amazing results after only 7 days.  Edit:About 14 months later, stopped pumping, pump runs but won&#x27;t pump much. Cleaned twice with vinegar for 24 hours, still no go. Called Waterpic and only asked for the pump unit, they sent me a whole new unit, got it in two days. My gums are still good, highly recommended company and product.  Old Mike</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpiks for over 30 years, but the Waterpik Ultra is much better than any of the previous ones I have used, and consequently, I use it more times per day. It is very well thought out. The adjustable pressure dial allows you to tailor it to your individual comfort level. The manual revolving tip helps me get the water stream into the spaces around the teeth. It&#x27;s much quieter than the previous Waterpiks I have used I had some mold problems on the handle of my previous Waterpik, but the Ultra is so easy to wipe off with a tissue after use, I don&#x27;t anticipate having that problem with it. I just use the regular jet tip and haven&#x27;t used the other included tips. It cost more than previous Waterpiks, but it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Another great product purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, sent one as a gift to my sister b/c it worked so well.</li>
    <li> Very nice little unit, smaller than it looks, good selection of attachments and a nicely functioning pressure adjustment. I do have to agree with the complaint that the hose is too short, though not extremely so. Also hoping that the hose continues to curl up enough to keep it stored as noted in the picture (so far, so good).</li>
    <li> This product works great and is much better and easier to deal with than the Hydrofloss it has replaced.  Great form factor as well.  Highly recommended for gum care.</li>
    <li> Thank you, Christmas gift</li>
    <li> Love it just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This was for my mother and so far she likes it....jr</li>
    <li> Purchased August 2012. Dysfunctional on March 2, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic case holding the wand broke in October 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the product would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use all the fancy attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I called Waterpik and a replacement is in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;The item comes with a three year warranty.</li>
    <li> I am terrible at flossing and it has started to show.  I started having bleeding gums, pain, bad breath.  I have never used a waterpik before so I have nothing to compare it to.  However, I read the reviews on all of the waterpik products and I chose this one.  Within two days my gums are no longer bleeding and the bad breath is gone.  I have been using it for a week now and I love it.  Takes no time at all and your mouth is free of old food that a tooth brush obviously cannot get.  With my job I am away from home three nights a week and there is no way I am leaving the house without my waterpik.  I am sure this is not something most people carry around with them, but I will be. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this after a recommendation from our dentist.  My daughter has braces, and this works well.  The power is much better than our older model that had a charging base.  This model plugs in and must sit on your bathroom counter.  It does take up a bit of space, which  is the only negative.  It is super easy use; just fill the reservoir with water (it comes off of the base for easy filling) and turn on.  Having different tips stored in the lid is also convenient.  The power is strong enough that you feel like you get a good cleaning almost like going to the dentist!</li>
    <li> I have had the waterpik flosser for 2 months now.  It really cleans well.  I like the different amount of pressure you can use on it. The negative on it is the pause button started sticking and now it&#x27;s stuck so I can&#x27;t get it unstuck.  I currently am contacting customer service over it. It&#x27;s very frustrating not to be able to use it when I want to.</li>
    <li> This is the third one we&#x27;ve had but this one is the best by far.  It pumps better and comes with and assortment of extra tools.</li>
    <li> I heard so many great things about water flossing so I bought one. I just seem to make a mess. I watched the video and still end up in a puddle of water. That might just be me. As far as the pick itself I can&#x27;t really see or feel a difference in my teeth. I use the string floss and it works just as well for me. The item does work like it says it should (as far as the water coming out and such) and it looks like it does on the box.  I just feel like I&#x27;ve just wasted money here.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item merely because I have found using standard string floss frustrating due to the fact that I happen to be one of those people with teeth which manage to &#x27;shred&#x27; the floss while using it. Anyone who has had string floss get stuck between teeth, or shred into microscopic little strands which stay stuck between teeth knows how irritating it is trying to remove them. This Waterpik flosser not only does a fantastic job of flossing, it&#x27;s also awesome in stimulating and massaging the gums, which my dentist has been telling me is necessary for someone my age to help prevent gum disease and all those other nasty gum problems older people tend to deal with. The only tricky thing about using the Waterpik flosser is getting used to adjusting your aim, and controlling how to expel the water that ends up filling your mouth without soaking yourself or spraying water all over the place...  But I love this thing.  Hope this helps ;)</li>
    <li> Tired of flossing your teeth with wax threads? Waterpik does a better and faster job and massages the gums at the same time.</li>
    <li> This Christmas present was used in January 2014 but did not know why it was so loud.  A lot of water also was coming out.  I thought I was not using it properly.  Bought another another one to compare.  Found out mine is damaged, but amazon will not take it back cause it is pasted it&#x27;s return date.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Well, my sister got this for me, for Christmas. It didn&#x27;t work; it didn&#x27;t even turn on. She sent it back and got another one. (Same model) I tried this one, and it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m convinced that they sent the same one that she originally sent back. Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I may have spoken too soon. apparently the problem was with the outlets in the bathroom. I tried using it in the kitchen and it seemed to work fine. however, it can be a bit messy as other people have mentioned. plus you get a bit of vibration. even at a low setting, it&#x27;ll still shake the crap out of you. as far as how well it works, I guess I&#x27;ll find out the next time I see my dentist</li>
    <li> No question about it, every one needs to floss. And this is the most efficient and hygienic way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy stock in this company because flossing is going to become more and more important with all this processed food which is being offered to our population these days.&lt;br /&gt;I am a vegetarian during the summer months when the extra calories are not needed but that darn Broccoli-Rabe loves to get stuck in between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those items which need to be purchased BEFORE the manufacturer lowers quality standards.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference already! I just hope my dentist does too! I love all the different tips that are included.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is much better than regular flossing, all be it can be messy if you aren&#x27;t paying attention.</li>
    <li> Love this water flosser made by Waterpik.  Works exactly as advertised.  Compact so take us very little room but powerful enough to give a super good flossing. Not sure what to do with all of the assorted tips but love the ones I using. So glad I selected this one.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is so much better than regular flossing, and the toothbrush attachment is great.&lt;br /&gt;When using the Waterpik make sure that you close your mouth when using any attachment, otherwise you will get water everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;For healthier teeth and gums the Waterpik  Ultra Water Flosser is excellent, and it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> As far as \\&quot;Water Piks\\&quot; go this model is pretty snazzy and seems to work quite well. It comes with 8 attachments:  &lt;br /&gt;* 3 standard jets * 3 tongue cleaners * 1 pik pocket (cute name) for deeper gum purging and * 1 orthodontic tip (with small brush on end) for cleaning braces.  &lt;br /&gt;- The &#x27;tongue cleaners&#x27; are worthless contrivances that simulate drowning.  &lt;br /&gt;You can clean your tongue much better with a standard tooth brush (although a coated tongue generally indicates the need for a dietary change, like more fruit, salad and less gunky foods).  &lt;br /&gt;- The orthodontic tip seems that it will work great for braces.  &lt;br /&gt;- The pik pocket (narrow tip) does not work as good as it should. Rather than increasing the water pressure the narrower tip actually slows it down. It may be convenient in some tight spots. It is good to have but seems to be of rather limited use compared with the standard jet tips.  &lt;br /&gt;The standard jet tips work quite excellently (4 stars) and will surprise you with how much junk is left behind by regular brushing and flossing.  &lt;br /&gt;- Most adult dental problems are caused by infrequent (below the gum line) professional cleaning and/or ignoring to floss. The Waterpik is designed to give you a significant &#x27;edge&#x27; in keeping your teeth and gums in good condition by getting between the teeth and below (somewhat) the gum line to remove the &#x27;left-behind gunk&#x27; before it turns into plaque, bleeding gums, and a myriad of problem$$$. Poor oral hygiene is the main cause of tooth-loss regardless of age.  &lt;br /&gt;- This \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; model is powerful (100 watts) and does the job of power-washing your teeth and gums quite well. The design is stylish, has a relatively small footprint, a lid that houses the attachments and which also keeps the water reservoir covered.  &lt;br /&gt;- It is only a bit quieter than earlier Waterpik models and the hose could be about 7 inches longer for an optimum length. However, these minor design issues are insignificant with what this device accomplishes. It cleans between your teeth and along the gum line to assist greatly in preserving your pearly whites!  &lt;br /&gt;- Amazon&#x27;s price of $49.00 (as of 9-06) is excellent and also includes free shipping. If the $49.00 seems a bit too steep then search Amazon for \\&quot;WaterPik WP-72 Professional Dental Water Jet\\&quot; priced at $33.26 with free shipping. The reviews are good for the WP-72 (some mechanical issues). However, both of these items carry a two year warranty.  &lt;br /&gt;- The attachments on this unit are different from those on many earlier units, so if you intend to get any additional accessories (e.g. nasal passage cleaner, etc.  - no kidding) then they must be made for this specific model or similar models.  &lt;br /&gt;- This model has 10 pressure settings (a dial), however, anything below setting 6 would seem rather weak and insufficient (irrigation only). The handle also has a stop/start button for water flow (only).  The power switch is safely on the side of the unit.  &lt;br /&gt;- Using a Waterpik is (can be) a bit quirky, splashy and squirty. It is, never-the-less, a most excellent tool to assist in promoting excellent oral hygiene and getting the bathroom all to yourself.  &lt;br /&gt;- I believe that the few dollars extra for this model is because this \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; model is a cut above. There are some Water Pik reviews stating that the recent models do not seem as durable as the earlier models.  This most recent model (Ultra) seems integral, gets the job done well and is smaller and more stylish than earlier models.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re really happy with this item. It is everything we hoped it would be and would refer it for a friend.</li>
    <li> I was advised by my dentist to buy a WaterPik. After researching the WaterPik I decided to give it a try.  It works great!! The only problem was after having it for 1 month, it began to leak.  I called WaterPik direct and they sent me out a \\&quot;BRAND NEW\\&quot; one.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!  Hats off to a great product and a great company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used WaterPik since a dentist recommended it 30 years ago. He said if  didn&#x27;t do something, I would soon need gum surgery. I started using it, and never had gum surgery. The WaterPik  has been through 3 different companies and several model changes. This newest model is a great improvement over the previous models -- much quieter, more convenient to use, more compact. Only minor complaint is that the reservoir is smaller so may require a partial refill, depending on how fast you use it and the force setting for the jet. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The new model IS quieter but at its most powerful setting it has less oomph.  Also, at times, one must push down a bit on the water container so that the water is released into the pump.</li>
    <li> The WP-100 is the best Waterpik yet.  The power level control is more stable (less shaking), the jets are stronger, the noise level is less, the tank is smaller (who really needs that much liquid), and the extra reservoirs are stored in a compartment that doubles as the cap.  WP-70W lasted 2 years,WP-72W lasted 1 year, and this one (WP-100) has lasted  4 months so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-27-17 update:&lt;br /&gt;A decade later and still no issues/problems!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good unit so far, more pressure than older unit that had a failed nozzle head, since replaced free by Waterpik Cust.Svc, very nice people to work with. Only complaint is a smaller reservoir, at times have to \\&quot;re-load\\&quot; to finish the job. Also, the storage compartment in the lid is not very useful.  UPDATE: After 9 months of use, the button control on the wand started to stick. Made unit unusable, finally called Cust.Svc. They sent out a new hose/wand, easily replaced with two &#x27;lil screws. Works fine now.  UPDATE: Soak the wand in a vinegar/baking soda solution for a day or so, flush with a few loads of clean water through the machine, works like new.</li>
    <li> My other one quit after several years... and I really missed it.  My mouth fees so much better after a good cleaning with my waterpik.</li>
    <li> It is the best way to floss,specially for me ,It cleans under my bridge and removes the food particle,I am so used to it,I love it ,</li>
    <li> I had high expectations to begin with, but even these were exceeded!  I am a skeptic at heart, and hoped for the impossible, to have the equipment work longer than the prior Waterpik portable product.  It has, and despite the lack of portability, works even better.    The water resevoir is quite large, the stationery unit with the attached \\&quot;pik\\&quot; isn&#x27;t an issue, and it cleans like a \\&quot;house afire\\&quot;.  In short, this is a home run.  With the multiple pressure settings and various attachment, it is a MUST HAVE item for every home.  The supplier met the delivery promise as well.  I can&#x27;t find fault anywhere.    ADDED LATER    After having used it for 1 1/2 years(no, really!)I can easily say my original views haven&#x27;t diminished.  It is sad that dental \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; do not recommend this item to more clients.  I can however, understand why.      It all but eliminates the need for dental work due to chronic gum issues. It also helps those of us who dislike/forget to floss regularly.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased. It has lots of power and hopefully the hose of the wand will not break like &lt;br /&gt;the old one I had, although it lasted about 6 years  &lt;br /&gt;before that happened. I love the feature of being &lt;br /&gt;able to adjust the pressure, I tried the maximum  &lt;br /&gt;pressure and could not tolerate it.</li>
    <li> This water pik does what it is supposed to do, but it isn&#x27;t any stronger or better than the cheaper versions I have owned in the past.  Perhaps someone with a very sensative mouth would appreciate the feature where you can turn down the force of the water jet, but if you are just looking for a full-strength pik you are wasting your money buying this deluxe version.</li>
    <li> This is the third Waterpik I&#x27;ve ordered. This one disappoints. The pressure is lower than my previous one. The water container is smaller and usually has to be refilled to finish the job. It is smaller overall and fits in the bathroom much easier, but if you want performance look for the previous model or wait until Waterpik fixes this one.</li>
    <li> the new design is very effective.  I hope the pump will last long enough--it is the leakage somewhere afterwards worries me.  Overall the new waterpick has a very good design and effective tool kits.  I like it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sunny</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product because it does a very good job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using braces and this product is a must for a good hygiene.</li>
    <li> The best water flosser made!  Easy to use, lots of extras (which we have yet to use) ...</li>
    <li> Not practical to refill with water and to clean.</li>
    <li> Too large for the bathroom counter to leave out.</li>
    <li> Really helps keep my teeth and gums clean and healthy.  Recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik. It leaves my teeth feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s dentist recommended she get a Waterpik device to help with food catcher spaces in her teeth. I researched a bit and this one seemed to be the best value and size. It was a good choice, pretty small, powerful (we keep it turned way down) and easy to use. There are several models but this seems to be the best value that I found. I even use it myself once in a while, surprising how much the toothbrush leaves. Wish I could use it to clean the car wheels.</li>
    <li> This product was fantastic, my dental hygenist says that it has already helped my plaque problem. My teeth, gums and mouth feel REALLY clean after using this product!</li>
    <li> Basically the W-100 does what it is supposed to do.  If the tank was a bit bigger and the hose a bit longer I would give it 5 stars.  It works great and I would recommend buying it if you are looking for an irrigator.</li>
    <li> I spent $150 for an emergency dental visit so he could &#x27;irrigate\\&quot; my gums as I had  a popcorn kernal stuck and the pain was unbelieveable.  However, all he basically did was waterpik my gums!  I am never going to have to spend that money again for something I can now do at home and save myself lots of pain and $$$$! The waterpik is awesome and keeps my gums clean and kernal free!  I highly recommend this for daily use!</li>
    <li> on my first day when i used it i felt great as i can feel this thing doing its work.   Cleans very effectively between the teeth and gums.   I wear braces and definetely recommend for those who have braces. I feel if reguraly used could save lot of time and money with professional cleaning.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well designed, great concept, but very messy.  Water squirts out from connections or runs down your arm when using.  Left unit filled with water on counter with jet spray unit not engaged in the holder but laying on countertop. By the time I returned to it sometime later, the water had leaked completely out of the unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the waterpik for about a month and I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet, but so far I do believe this is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day.  It may tear up next month or 6 months from now, but so far I really like it!</li>
    <li> I stopped using Waterpik products for 2 1/2 years as they were just poor quality (never lasted more than warranty period PLUS a few weeks). My last cleaner from Oral-B felt better, but also stopped working after 2 1/2 years. Bought this one for the good price. So far my major complaint is that even at the highest setting the pressure feels low. Well, if it at least would last more than 6-7 months that would be an improvement.    After 4 months use we see the same problem as many other buyers: The tips do not properly engage anymore and the water is leaking out of the handle instead of spraying your teeths/gums. I reduce my rating to ZERO. It is about time that Waterpik stops selling crap made in China. What about building them here in the quality of 15-20 years ago. I would be willing to pay the price.</li>
    <li> It is an improvement over my previous Waterpik unit which I had used for several years and was still working.  This unit is quieter and has a smoother water flow.  Easier to use.  I have now bought one for my daughter who lives out of town.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The pressure setting is a must have.  An easy way to improve gum health.      Update: I have been using this for mor than a year now and I still love it.  It is amazing how much food it can get out from between your teeth.  Ever since I started using it I have not heard any comments about my gums from my dentist.</li>
    <li> even my dentist saw the difference in my gums!! mouth feels so clean, i will bet its also excellent for the gums too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks for perhaps 20 years. This is my fifth, I think. &lt;br /&gt;It is very much better designed and easier to use than previous models. &lt;br /&gt;Note that it uses different jet tips; tips from older models are not compatible. However, if you have a Grossan tip for nasal irrigation, you can just pull off the rubber nostril plug and slide it onto one of the WP-100 tips.</li>
    <li> It took some getting use to it but my daughter loves the cleaning action of this technique. She does have an appliance to clean around and this is a good tool for that.</li>
    <li> This machine is an excellant addition to thorough teeth brushing.  Even after brushing with my new Sonicare brush this thing makes my mouth feel so much cleaner.  Amazing at the amount of food particles it still flushes away.  Takes a short time to get up to max pressure but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was just a bad one, but I&#x27;m out $50 and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  Beware, if you plan on long usage.</li>
    <li> I have had this waterpik for 2 weeks and the button on the handle is already sticking.  This is creating a problem, especially if you are irrigating your nose.  It is also hard using the grossan nose adapter.  The water surges out until in a certain position.  I have had 3 waterpiks prior to trying this new ULTRA.  I prefer the older model for my usage.</li>
    <li> The model I got is Waterpik WP-100 Ultra.  In the first weeks, it was a novelty to use it after flossing &amp; brushing.  Now, it is an addition effort for dental health.  I like all the attachments except the tongue scrapper which does little for its purpose.  Though it pains me to set up, i.e. filling the water well, switching attachments, putting it away and cleaning up on mirror splashes and counter, I feel it helps to maintain dental health.  I feel my mouth is cleaner and will find out on my next dentist visit in about 6 months.  What I don&#x27;t have are the research on water pressure effects on your gum line and if it would cause any dental erosion.  Imagining how continuous small water drippings create a depression or hole in a rock and how rocks turn to smooth pebbles after continuous water washing?  I haven&#x27;t taken time to do \\&quot;lit review\\&quot; (finding research articles to read).  If anyone has that info, please let me know.  Because of this, I&#x27;ve kept the pressure on the lowest.  All in all I think it is a good addition to tooth brush and floss.  Since I haven&#x27;t used other brands, I have no basis for comparison.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product since I had a Waterpik dental jet before.  The water container is way too small, and the pressure is so weak that you could use a toothpick and have better results.  I definitely would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> Love this new water pik - worth the money. Will see how long it lasts. It replaced an older version one that I had that didn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
    <li> great product, ive only used at setting 2-5, it gets pretty intense. I got this product since i got braces and the waterpik comes with 5 or 6 heads, one of them being a brush type thing that allows you to clean around the braces. Mixed 3/4 water with 1/4 mouth wash for awesome feeling. Only problem I&#x27;ve had with this machine is that when I start cleaning, I don&#x27;t know if its from the water spilling onto the handle or whatnot, but after 3 days use when I press the pause button to refill or adjust the nozzle it would stay stuck. The button wouldn&#x27;t release whatsoever, I&#x27;ve tried to pull the button out and lower or increasing the pressure to no avail. I would eventually have to turn it off and wait for it to release then turn it back on. Amazon.com was graceous enough to send me a replacement at no charge while keeping the original one for health reasons they wouldnt take it back. But Ive been using the old one still just without ever pausing, still going great!</li>
    <li> Expected more from the product as my current Waterpik is at least 20 years old.  Thought I&#x27;d be getting quite an upgrade after 20 years and $50. Not so. If you still have a working model, stick with it &amp; save your money. My only complaint with my old model was a slight leak between the tip and the hose.  The water compartment of the new unit does not have the same capacity (smaller!) and while it seemed neat at first to have the tips stored under the lid, I now worry about it being a breeding ground for germs and mold.  At least with the old unit the tips stood outside and the water drained away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit in November 2007. It is now December of the same year and the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; button will not release after it has been depressed until I turn the unit off. So now when my mouth fills with water, I have to turn the unit off to stop the stream of water, expel the water from my mouth, turn the unit back on and continue in this fashion until finished.   The other problem I&#x27;ve noticed is the pressure starts out very weak and usually doesn&#x27;t build until the water in the tank is about half gone.  I expected more from the Waterpik Ultra, but based on it&#x27;s performance thus far, I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased in December and now on May 5th, only five months later it&#x27;s in my bathroom trashcan.    Motor has always been weak compared to previous Waterpiks I have owned, but the real problem with this model is the water cord to the nozzle wraps up and kinks and once that happens there is no way to clear it.    Save yourself some time and money and look elsewhere than this model.</li>
    <li> This product works incredibly well, I&#x27;d say in most cases works better than floss... I would recommend starting off on the lowest setting with the brush head and then work your way up depending on how vigorously you want to use it.  I generally use it on the lowest setting and have noticed great results from it after just a week worth of use.  As was said from a previous review-- you&#x27;ll be amazed by the amount of plague that you can take off of your teeth and gums just from regular use, leaving your teeth with that fresh feeling that you usually only get after going to the dentist to have your teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing it can be used for is to clean out your ear canal IF needed.  I went through a lot of forums looking to make sure that it could be used as my doctor actually recommended using a waterpik at one point if you have excess buildup in your ears.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend aiming directly at your ear drum though, off to the side works quite well and will remove any wax that you might have built up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry everybody for the description on alternate use, I know a lot of people will at some point use this product for just that purpose.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife in September of 2009.  She&#x27;s used it daily since then and it still operates just as well as the day she unboxed it.  She does clean it regularly, so I am sure that helps the longevity of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She loves it. She doesn&#x27;t use all the founctions, but she loves it. What else can I say!</li>
    <li> Decent product for the low price I paid.  But the tube that runs from the tank to the water pick is very short.  I&#x27;m 6 feet tall and the first time I raised the pick to my mouth, the tank tipped over and spilled water everywhere.  The tank isn&#x27;t heavy enough to let you pull the coiled up tube into a straight tube -- it just tips over.  So I have to bend over a lot to use this.  In fact, it&#x27;s usually easier to just kneel in front of the sink.</li>
    <li> Nice little unit. Don&#x27;t need all the extra attachments but am sure that other users would find them useful. Priced right.</li>
    <li> I had the old waterpik and it was much better as far as water pressure and overall durability.  The new one has a much smaller water holder to waterpik. Kinda disappointed and the old water pik had a better setup.</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s working out fine for me now. I wish I would have gotten a choice of tips instead of what I was sent. Some I may use and others not.</li>
    <li> this was a great purchase, price, quality and convenience all rolled in one machine. Small enough to sit on my sink but big enough to floss clean my entire mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 1 month now.  It seems to work really well.  I still floss with regular floss, but not nearly as often as I used to.  It seems like the regular floss doesn&#x27;t make too much difference.  My next dental exam is still a couple of months off.  That will be the proof for me.</li>
    <li> The water basin fits perfectly over the base so you can travel with it. The pick works well and hasn&#x27;t lost pressure or clogged</li>
    <li> Item is very good at getting lose food after eating. Don&#x27;t expect results prior to an intial dental visit. This is an excellent flosser to maintain dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> I bought the first one for my son and now this is the second one I&#x27;ve purchaced which I gave to my daughter. It works great and it made a difference with teens that dont like to floss! They love this and it is easy to use. The last dentist check up the staff noticed the improvment in thier gums and teeth. They do wear braces and it keeps the ice braces whiter too. Even if they did not wear braces I would buy it now because it makes for healthier gums and less cavities between the teeth!! Thanks WaterPik!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser may not be perfect, but it is very good. It is probably the best water irrigator available.   I previously had used the Interplak irrigator (by Conair).  It&#x27;s price was only about $25 -$30.  The Interplak was extremely loud (much louder than the Waterpik).  The older round-reservoir version that I had purchased had trouble getting &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34;, so it would not pump water.  I called Conair customer service, and we worked with the unit (over the phone), and finally got it pumping.  Conair&#x27;s customer service was very good. No complaints.  After a few months&#x27; use, however, the Conair irrigator tip attachment I was using flew off the end of the flexi-tube.  The attached tip would no longer stay attached while under pressure. The tips stay in place with a simple pressure fit &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;. Apparently, there was fatigued plastic combined with perhaps a slightly too-small size of the attachment.  I called Conair for a set of replacement tips.  But, Conair (amazingly) said the tips were not available separately. They sent me an entirely new unit.  The new unit was the newer squared reservoir version.  The on/off knob on the new version was very small and difficult to turn without holding onto the unit with the other hand. The unit did not have rubber feet that would keep it from sliding away. So, to turn it on or off is a two-handed operation! This is very inconvenient, especially when you are holding the flosser wand in one hand. After a few months&#x27; use, the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button on the flosser handle burst off, and water would spray out of the resulting opening. The pause button&#x27;s little plastic ear had broken off under pressure.  I could see that it was not repairable. I thought I could maybe swap out the entire flexi-tube assembly with the one from my older version. But, this is not possible due to some small design changes internally.  The parts are not interchangeable.  Now, the Waterpik:  Rather than try another Conair, I decided to try the Waterpik after looking at reviews online.  Some others had complained that the Waterpik was loud.  Believe me: the Waterpik is quiet compared with the Conair. It has a &amp;#34;dampened&amp;#34; buzz sound  (vs. a &amp;#34;buzzy&amp;#34; buzz sound). The on/off button is an easy rocker style switch that allows one-handed operation without having the unit slide away. The lid serves as a closed storage unit for the accessory tips (a convenience).  The tips are held in place with a mechanical locking mechanism -- much stronger than the pressure-fit technique of the Conair. The flexitube coils conveniently for storage into a storage compartment, and the coiling storage is much easier than for the Conair. The best feature of this unit is the handle design. The tips are inserted into a handle that has a knurled rotatable end. (The Conair does not have this.) You can turn the knurled knob with your fingers (which is holding your tip) and aim the tip in any direction you want. You do not have to rotate or contort your wrist to reach different teeth  -- just turn the knob to aim the jet stream where you want.  This is a simple but very major convenience.  The water pressure produced by the Waterpik is much higher than for the Conair. I use the highest setting at all times. Many people will think that the highest setting is uncomfortable, though.  UPDATE 2017: I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Waterpick flosser. But, BEWARE: it does wear out over time. It has a 3-yr warranty. I found that my Waterpik had noticebly-reduced pressure after about 4 years, maybe 5-years&#x27; of use. I&#x27;m sure its pressure decreased gradually over time, but I only noticed it recently. So, I ordered another identical Waterpik (Feb. 2017) and the new one, as I suspected, has a much more powerful water stream vs.my old one. I estimate that my old Waterpik was providing a water stream at a Level 4 or 5 on the brand new Waterpik. So, there was a major deterioration over time, and it was so gradual that I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to it.  My only suggestions for improving the product:  A bit longer (8&amp;#34;?) flexi-tube, and quiet it  down (if possible). But, the sound level is NOT terrible. It is simply what you might expect from a small pump.  All in all, the Waterpik is a reliable, fairly quiet,well-designed product. It is heavy enough to not slide toward you while you are using it or when you push the on/off rocker switch. [The newer model by Waterpik is apparently much lighter, and has the problem of sliding during use. So, it seems that the older model, reviewed here, is the better model.] It works well at cleaning food and plaque from teeth. It probably should be replaced after every 4-years of use if you want the more powerful water stream to be in effect.</li>
    <li> not only the price is worth it. I have been using the waterpik for a few months now and it sure helps get all the food in between my mouth and teeth. I just had my cleaning check up a week ago and my dentist said keep doing what you have been doing. For i had a great Check up.</li>
    <li> New in package, just as described in the description. Love the 6 tips that are included. Would purchase again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik. I bought this second time even after my first product stopped working after one use, due to raving reviews from other customers. My second product stopped working on day 15. I am not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this. I am returning this and ordering a different product this time.</li>
    <li> Should have bought it a long time ago, my mouth (gum) feels so clean.  I have braces and it really helps to have a waterflosser!</li>
    <li> The Ultrapik Water Flosser is, hands down, my favorite purchase of 2011. Waterpiks always seemed gimmicky to me so I never thought to use one. But I stumbled across this product and its reviews here on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t resist. Boy am I glad I bought one. I feel that this not only works better than flossing but it can be addicting. One of the great things about picking is that you see and feel the results almost immediately. The fact is that within one month, my teeth are cleaner, my breath is fresher and my gums are much healthier. Already my pockets are smaller and there is no bleeding on probing. My teeth are also less sensitive, perhaps due to my gums re-adhering themselves to my teeth. I am so excited about this product and after using it, I am almost angered that water-flossing isn&#x27;t considered a mandatory part of oral care. It&#x27;s so easy, it&#x27;s quick, kind of fun and most of all, extremely effective.    As far as the supposed negatives that other reviewers have mentioned, I am able to overlook all of them. I&#x27;ll take re-filling the reservoir in order to have a smaller foot-print any day. I find the pressure is great, the cord length is fine, as well as the switch location. And, although the lid can be tricky with the way it stores the tips and not having a snap closure, I&#x27;m just careful with it.    Here is my breakdown of the tips: First, the great thing is that you can order replacements easily, right here on Amazon. Let me also state that, in my personal opinion, there are much better options than the toothbrush and tongue scraper attachments. If we&#x27;re going to take the time to waterpick, I imagine most of us have a superior toothbrush and tongue scraper as well. My favorites are the standard tip and the pik-pocket. I don&#x27;t have crowns or bridges, nor do I have braces. So I don&#x27;t need the pik for braces, although I use and like the plaque seeker.    The standards tip is like power-washing your teeth and gum line and the pressure alone removes the bacteria itself, before plaque turns into tartar. It even works great on back teeth. Your teeth feel like you just had a professional cleaning every day.     The pik-pocket tip irrigates below the gum line for a deep cleaning. The importance of this tip cannot be over-looked. It has literally changed the health of my gums very dramatically.    In summary, the quality of this machine, coupled with the low price for something that will literally, quickly and dramatically change the health of your teeth - it&#x27;s a no-brainer, buy one!</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m having some gum issues, this water flosser is wonderful to get at those pockets that regular flossing misses.  Also - regular floss shreds sometimes and gets stuck under the sides of crowns.</li>
    <li> My dentist has tried to get me to purchase a waterpik for years, but I wouldn&#x27;t listen. WOW! save time and have a healthier, cleaner mouth in just your first use. You&#x27;ll never go back to flossing again.</li>
    <li> I like this water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used water pik last 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;This one is more comfortable and smooth finishing..</li>
    <li> My Needs:&lt;br /&gt;I have a permanent lower retainer and food is constantly getting stuck between the retainer and my teeth.  The dentist always recommended flossing and has given me these plastic loops that I am supposed to put between the retainer and my teeth to help thread floss.  The process is a pain and I just never flossed.  I never really enjoyed flossing either, it was just a way of getting rid of stuck food that was bothering me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arsenal:&lt;br /&gt;When I setup the Waterpik I was in awe of the array of implements.  It was like a tooth arsenal there were so many tips.  There were micro tips, regular tip, brushing tip, tips that looked like spoons, and a rocket launching tip (not really a rocket launching tip).  I had a bit of tip paralyses through analysis and just ended up going with the regular shaped tip shown in the picture.  It is nice to know the backup troops are tucked away in the lid, but thus far the original tip has served my purposes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Device:&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is easy to setup, pop the tip in, fill up the blue canister and set it on the stand, plug in power, dial up the pressure and then flip the switch.  Out comes a pulsating water stream that doubles as a super soaker.  My first experience with the water pic resulted in a bit of a wet shirt, so be sure you are ready when you flip the switch.  Also beware when putting the pic handle back in place as it is easy to bump the handle.  NOTE : Glad no cameras are included in the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Results:&lt;br /&gt;The result is a nice stream of water that powers through your teeth and disloges food and other gunk.  I like using a bit of water and a bit of mouthwash in the device to add some minty freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to come away from using the device and have that clean teeth feeling you get from having your teeth professionally cleaned without having an empty wallet too.</li>
    <li> This unit is great for the gums. It helps make them more healthy. A dentist recommended this to me. They arent made like they were back in the day but all in all a good buy.</li>
    <li> He really likes the performance of this water pik.  they are hard to find now days comes with some nice attatchments</li>
    <li> I am completely happy and satisfied with every aspect of this product, including the price - and at the time I purchased it - the free shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Waterpik to replace another that I&#x27;ve used for almost 5 years. The unit&#x27;s water pressure had reduced over the years and I had to use the highest setting and felt it was not adequate. I feel I got plenty of use out of the old one and did not mind ordering a replacement. Unfortunately there was no improvement. I was still having to use the new one on its highest setting also. I thought perhaps I had just received a faulty unit. I contacted Waterpik customer service. They were very nice and sent me a new one with prepaid return postage. Well the new one is not any better. I primed both units as the directions stated but to no avail, I&#x27;m still using it at the highest setting and it&#x27;s not any better than my old one. I must conclude the water pumps they use now are not as good as previous years. Some would suspect my gums have just gotten used to the Waterpik and indeed they will over time, but if you ever want to really check the pressure, spray it under your tongue. That&#x27;s an area that does not get used to it and should hurt like hell on the highest setting. Not so with the new Waterpik. In conclusion I suggest if you have never used a water flosser before then give this one a shot but if you&#x27;re looking for a replacement/upgrade then try a different model.</li>
    <li> I have friends that have used Waterpik for years but I just got around to trying it. I don&#x27;t like to floss and fight with the various flosser products. The Waterpik is quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, easy to use.This product deserves the Water Pik brand name. I am fully satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Best implement ever for keeping your teeth and gums clean</li>
    <li> Update 1/17/2013:&lt;br /&gt;I am removing 2 stars (from 5 star to 3 Star) as though product is good with cleaning - the bottom part (handle) broke within a year and I had to order Waterpik WP-100 Handle Assembly Kit to get this working again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Old Feedback:&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and best way to clean your teeth. I have quite a few Crowns as I did not take care of my teeth when I was younger but now I used this every day and it takes out small items stuck between the crown. make sure you set the speed accordingly as if you set too high (like. aboe 5 or 6) then your Crown may come out because of the high water force. I also used normal flossing together with this waterpik and it removes all of the small items. Really great product and I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had this Waterpik for a few months now and am quite pleased. I was always curious what using a water flosser would be like and it is quick and very easy. I recommend continuing to floss regularly as well while using this waterpik, but it really does blast things out! This is my first water flosser and it is a very solid unit. I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but it is simple to use and comes with plenty of tips. I saw this same flosser at Target for almost $20 more, so I decided to buy here on Amazon. I have braces and an appliance in my mouth, so it&#x27;s amazing to see what this thing gets out of my braces and teeth. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Only my second day with this but the cord is so short that it has fallen over twice spilling water all over the bathroom.  This with it sitting on the counter right in front of me.  I&#x27;m surprised there are not more complaints of this in the reviews.  To use, you have to steady it with one hand and operate the wand with the other.  While doing that I still have to hunch over a bit and I&#x27;m not quite 6&#x27; tall.  You will also have to keep your lips sealed while using or you will douse your bathroom a different way.  Once you mitigate these problems it seems to work.  Makes my gums bleed just like my dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> This unit is nice because it breaks up the plaque.  I&#x27;ve found that I use it at an 8 or 9.  A lower setting is just too weak for me.  It sometimes doesn&#x27;t get all the plaque, so sometimes I will floss with regular picks first then use this to flush everything away.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The WP 100 works well!     It&#x27;d be nice if the cord was a little longer but I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I got this on the recommendation of my dental hygienist after being diagnosed with receding gums/periodontitis. I really like this product.  I have had it a for months now and have not experienced any leakage problems with the unit. I fill the reservoir to the top with warm water, and I get a thorough cleaning with one fill. I like being able to easily adjust the power selections and can report that it functions consistently strong. I am glad for the different pics that come with it, and will vary my pics from day to day. They all perform well. This is a great product and I am pleased to report that my hygienist has seen much improvement in  my gum health! I have already highly recommended this product to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: When I did comparison shopping with Walmart, Amazon not only beat the price, but sent it to me with no shipping costs! Awesome!</li>
    <li> I just got the package today and am very pleased with the quick delivery. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is so simple to set and ready to use. Using it for the first time will quite make a water mess but it takes practice! I was pretty impressed on how much small food debris it got out of my mouth and all around my gums after brushing my teeth. It really proves that brushing my teeth wasn&#x27;t enough! It&#x27;s no wonder that I have had periodontal disease for a pretty long time. I can&#x27;t get enough of this amazement. My periodontist recommended me to get this after I had my treatment. The scraping treatment wasn&#x27;t fun. To make my future dentist appointments much easier, I got this. My goal is to make a significant improvement in my gums and teeth. I&#x27;m getting another one for my mom! This is perfect for anyone who has periodontal disease or gingivitis problems. Also for kids too!</li>
    <li> I ordered my first one 3-1/2 years ago.  It&#x27;s generally used every day.  Yesterday, the tube between the reservoir and the flossing head got a leak from the stress where the tube enters the head/handle.  I feel I got my use out of it, and immediately placed an order for another one.  I may look into fixing the old one, since it&#x27;s just a hole in the tube.  Everything else was still working just fine (well, the button on the flossing head for temporarily stopping the flow was getting a little sticky as well, but it still worked).</li>
    <li> This is a very good way to improve dental health and prevent gum detereioration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and sure does give one&#x27;s mouth a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have started this type of dental care a long time ago.</li>
    <li> good buy, works great. fast delivery. Waterpik is a name you can trust.A must for good  oral care, very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this waterpik for about a year. Gum health is much, much better than ever before, when I just brushed and used dental floss. I used to have slight bleeding occasionally in one or two places, if I wasn&#x27;t careful. The water flossing knocks pieces of food out of the gum line that the toothbrush and dental floss can&#x27;t get. It also masssages the gums. One should not stop using dental floss, at least once a day. I suggest using an electric toothbrush, the Waterpik, and floss, if you can do all three.     As for the product benefits, it has about 6 tools you can attach, but I use the conventional one mostly, and sometimes a brush type.     The plastic components need improvement. The weakest aspect of this device is the top hinge, which opens the tool tray. If you accidentally drop the lid while taking it off, the hinge easily breaks.  For improvement, they should enlarge or re-design the hinge. They should add a grip for the reservoir so you can lift it easily without slipping. I gave it 4 stars because I use this thing every day, and it seems important to me. Otherwise, the product is good, and great value for the price offered.     Don&#x27;t delay. Start using a water flosser for better gum health.</li>
    <li> We purchases 6 at once for our whole family! Really helps patients with braces floss in a little less than five minutes tops! That is alot faster than the old way when you had to thread the floss through a threadder. I gave up after the first try, taking about 30 minutes. With this water flosser, it gets rid of everything in a fraction of the time. I recommend this product to everyone, braces or not, or those who are too lazy to floss regularly!</li>
    <li> I use this every evening before go to bed, love the feeling of clean teeth.  It&#x27;s easy and fun, I love it better then flossing.</li>
    <li> I had bought two of these water flosser machines.  I am very satisfied with the machine. My mouth is so clean and fresh after each use.  It is a little bit weak.  I have to adjust the dial to 8 or 9 in order to clear out the food  that is stuck between teeth.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this machine.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love the new size and shape it&#x27;s easier to store on the counter. The water settings are great, allows flexibility on how strong the water flow is. The highest setting can dislodge any debris, trust me, it is strong. Make sure you secure the pix in the holder or it will fly out. The pix selection is good, has pixs for many different  needs. I think this water pix holds less water, compared to my old one. I&#x27;ve adjusted to having less water, I think you will have no problems adjusting to it.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing and was really inconsistent about doing it.  A water flosser seemed like a good solution.  Its a little bit loud while its working, but it does work very well.  The put the pressure setting to its highest level which was more than comfortable for me.  I can reach my back teeth easier than I can with regular floss, and I use it much more consistently.  It&#x27;s also much gentler on my gums than regular flossing.  I just went to the dentist for the first time since getting this product, and was complemented on how well I took care of my teeth.  It is the first time ever I didn&#x27;t get a lecture about flossing.  That was proof enough for me that this actually works.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 rather than 5 stars is because it is a bit loud and I&#x27;d love it if there was a quieter version.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a pretty nice job of improving gum health - several suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;- increase the capacity of the water reservoir&lt;br /&gt;- lengthen the hose that attaches the handle to the main unit&lt;br /&gt;- make the handle &#x27;grippier&#x27;</li>
    <li> Get this product. I&#x27;ve own WaterPik for years, and when my last one wore out, I bought this one. Best one I&#x27;ve had yet. Six heads, that&#x27;s delivering some serious clean to my mouth. My teeth still feel clean later on in the day. I love how this device gets to where even dental floss can&#x27;t get. It just takes a minute before brushing to have your mouth feeling cleaner than it&#x27;s ever felt. Personally, I use it until the reservoir runs out. Ten different speed settings, so you can set it to the speed that is most comfortable for your mouth.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist and was everything she said it was.  Works easily, quickly and effectively.   Amazon provided the best price for the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.</li>
    <li> Great product,  I have ordered more than 4 for my sisters and other friends. I like it  a lot to since it keeps my teeth clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it once before bedtime.</li>
    <li> Needed a new Waterpik and this one suits me just fine.  I like the closed compartment to keep extra cleaners in and to cover the water.  I like the on/off button too.  This one has a lot of extras my previous Waterpik didn&#x27;t have, so I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to get one of these for a long time. When at the dentist office, they always use one and it feels good and makes flossing a nicer experience. Makes getting into some of the teeth spaces doable where as regular floss can&#x27;t. I love it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as brand new. Great price.  Product is well made. The various tips are quite handy and easy to use.  I recommend it especially if you are having gum issues. This product can help alleviate the symptoms. It has done this for me.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our son who recently got braces, and it works great for him.  Now everyone uses it!</li>
    <li> This is the best water pick tool ever.  I enjoy having the choice of several tips to choose from and regularly use it.  It has several water jet settings and I haven&#x27;t had to go higher than the 1 setting to clean between my teeth.  It&#x27;s best to close your mouth and lean forward allowing the water to run into the sink rather than opening your mouth wide while looking in the mirror which results in the water spraying all over the counter.  Once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll improve the health of your gums.  I also recommend getting a Sonicare or OralB/Braun toothbrush to go with it if you want to improve your dental checkups.  It made a drastic difference in our family&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is great--you can get your teeth/gums really clean with this, I still brush and floss too, but if I could only do one it would be the waterpik.  I add a little mouthwash to the water and it really makes your mouth feel fresh.  good for the gums too!  the only thing i would change is where the extra attachments are stored, its a little awkward having them in the compartment on the lid.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with the product and with the service Amazon provided.  It helps keep food particles from between my teeth and, hopefully, keep Dental visits to a minimum</li>
    <li> The item works as expected and very good qulaity, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> u cant beat that. this is the best product u can buy as a gift to somebody u love. it works perfect. cleans all food frm btween the teeth spontaneously.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of a Waterpik.  My Hygeinest suggested that I get one for my gum problems. It took a while to get used to.  I had water all over the place.  I have no prblems with this product at all.  It does a excellent job on my gums.  I am surprised to see how much is left to clean after you brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> I got this at the recommendation of my dentist and I am so glad I did.  I don&#x27;t like flossing very much and this is much easier and more effective.  So far I have not head any problems with the unit.  The waterpik is really easy to use, it comes with a nozzle that you use to direct water pressure to disloge particles embedded in your gums and between your teeth a lot more effectively than flossing.  I am pretty convinced that water can get through and wash away debris a lot better than a floss thread.    The water pressure can be adjusted from 1-10 but I use about a 4 which is about what I can tolerate in terms of force.  It is a bit uncomfortable at first because it feels like you are sandblasting your teeth but you get used to it.  I can&#x27;t speak towards it&#x27;s long term reliability because I have used it daily for about 3 weeks so far and upto now it has been trouble free.    I am very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend this unit!!</li>
    <li> Dental care if very important to me and should be to everyone. I use the dental pic twice a day and I am amazed what it can dislodge. At it most powerful setting it can damage your gums so be careful. I mix a little lystering in with the water also. The price was great and delivery was fast. The unit also came with plenty of attachments and replacement heads. The resevoire can leak a little from it&#x27;s supply valve. Great unit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since June and this is January.  It works great a couple times a day.  I only use the normal attachment and pretty much have ignored the others since trying them out on the first use.  I have increased the pressure starting around 5 or 6 when i first started to now at the max setting.  The stream is painful if it hits a soft part of your mouth, such as your tongue, at that pressure.  My gums are in excellent condition, per my recent cleaning visit.  I run warm water through the unit.  So i start the unit while pointing at the drain.  Then, I push the button to stop the stream while i bring it to my mouth.  Sometimes the button sticks and when it turns back on it is not at full pressure.  This is the only flaw i have witnessed.  To resolve it you can press the button several times until it clears or turn the unit off and on again.  This problem may be caused by hard water in my home.  I am not sure but it is not that big of a deal and only occurs one out of 10 uses.  I will likely buy the same unit again if this one lasts at least 2 years.</li>
    <li> One of my favourite purchase. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any more food stuck between my teeth or under my gums. A great necessity for oral hygiene !</li>
    <li> This is my first Waterpik and I am not disappointed. It does a great job of cleaning between my teeth and below my gum line. I have only been using it for a few weeks and have already seen a big difference in my gum health. My only complaint is that the button on the handpeice that stops waterflow tends to stick and you have to turn the machine off before it will free up. Minor annoyance considering the payoff when using it.</li>
    <li> Ive had my original WaterPik for more then twenty years and it has never failed. The plastic and rubber parts were seeming to show wear and it was time for an upgrade. I am not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The improvements made over time are sometimes subtle but effective.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, improvements in plastics used and the way the tank seats on to the&lt;br /&gt;system are major tweaks. You can prepare the contents of the tank prior to&lt;br /&gt;use and the contents within isn&#x27;t released until you are ready for it.&lt;br /&gt;There has been a change in the pressures available to the appliance for periodontal care that is considerably less traumatizing then previously accessible - a&lt;br /&gt;nice safety feature.&lt;br /&gt; The large control thumb button for releasing tank contents for use when YOU are ready - no more face spray- greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;The WaterPik pump runs quieter then earlier but still takes some getting&lt;br /&gt;used to if you are new to irrigation systems . . .&lt;br /&gt;The white, vented extra tips cover that fits over the tank also is a plus during storage. The memory tubing connecting the appliance to the applicator is for me is a really big deal. Just slip the&lt;br /&gt;applicator back to its holder and you are done.&lt;br /&gt; WaterPik remains a quality product and I expect long life from it.</li>
    <li> The concept of the Waterpik is simple, but the manufacturer did not try to make an excellent top quality product. They saved money by using a cheap water pick that can easily fall out of the handle. I am forced to hold the handle defensively hoping I won&#x27;t get sprayed. The \\&quot;On-Off\\&quot; button would be better located on the handle.</li>
    <li> After 6 weeks, the handle broke.  Contacted manufacturer by Email - they responded 10 days later.  Promised replacement handle in 10-15 days.  A month later, no handle.  No response to new Email.    I remember when these were better made and lasted years.</li>
    <li> I had the old green Waterpik and stopped using it because it was so noisy.  This model has so many more features.  Lots of attachment choices and much quieter.  Much more attractive on the bathroom counter top.</li>
    <li> Recomended by my dental hygienist. Works great! Bought two additional units for each of my children who are away from home in college. I&#x27;m certain that as as they age, they&#x27;ll both need far less dental work than I did.</li>
    <li> Well it was everything I expected - wish there was a bit more power but over all it has a good range. Multiple tips to change out with. The water tank I wish could hold more I usually need 2 fills make it all the way through my mouth. It can be messy but that&#x27;s to be expected. Between my sonic care toothbrush and my water jet I can have the just left the dentist from a cleaning feeling which I love. It&#x27;s great for getting food particles and such out from between your teeth and this is more fun and easier than flossing for me.</li>
    <li> I had used water pik&#x27;s travelers model after a much older version of a died.  The travelers version did not clean my mouth near as the old one did.  After two weeks of feeling like my teeth and gums were not clean, I bit the bullet and bought the nice one.  I LOVE IT!  If clean teeth and gums are important to you ... this is the product.  I just was at the dentist and all noticed how healthy my teeth and gums looked.  Spend the money!!</li>
    <li> First the button on the hand device, just stops the water  but it spills all over , it is not so quiet as it says</li>
    <li> I am 48 and just got braces. I was so frustrated trying to get the food out of my brackets and wires...no matter how well I brush and floss, the food just seems to want to work its way into all those metal nooks and crannies. Then I got the waterpik. I still brush and floss but the waterpik gets every little bit of food out. There is quite a bit of satisfaction to seeing food particles wash away into the sink...I mean this is stuff that would otherwise would still be on my teeth causing plaque and cavities!!!!  I love the waterpik ultra!  Don&#x27;t bother with the cordless unit though...that was my first purchase and I ended up returning it. You get much better and consistent water pressure with the plug in unit and it is way more dependable than the cordless, which pretty much died after about a week. I would highly recommend the Waterpik ultra to anyone, whether or not they have braces, but especially if they wear braces!!!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet is very effective. I have had no problems at all with the product. It is more comfortable to use if you fill it with lukewarm water. The spray is very strong on the highest setting. I find a mid-way setting more comfortable. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of these based on good reviews.  After just 1 month, all of the pause buttons on the handles began \\&quot;sticking\\&quot;.  To \\&quot;un-stick\\&quot; the button, you have to either turn the pressure all othe way down or turn it off and then back on.  The handles are definitely cheaply made.  The WP-100 is also quite loud.  There is definitely room for improvement.</li>
    <li> Got this right after finding out I had up to a 7 mm deep pocket(s)  at a dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;On my great hygienist&#x27;s advice, I got this appliance. After 5 weeks of using this, plus floss and brush once a day,&lt;br /&gt;All pockets are 2 - 3 mm deep!  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Good news and bad news. Good news: I used this thing twice a day for 3 months filled with mouthwash and it had a major impact on my gums. Bad news: the holder for the handle broke after three months. It&#x27;s not particularly well designed and not particularly durable. However it seems to be the best thing available.</li>
    <li> I received my water pik yesterday and have already used it 5 times!  I love the way it makes my mouth and gums feel,so clean and refreshing.  I hate to floss, so this is perfect for me. I wish I would have purchased this years ago!!</li>
    <li> The water pik works.  The attachments have an awkward set up, serve as a lid but doesn&#x27;t stay attached as a lid and there is no good place to store them.</li>
    <li> Hated it. Tried to return never received refund. The product is so messy just to use it fills your mouth with water you have to constantly be leaning over a sink and its loud. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Takes a little practice but works great. Excellant product especially if you have implants!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what some people are talking about this product is great.  It isn&#x27;t leaking I think it&#x27;s perfect!  I remember using one back in the late 80&#x27;s and we had it about 6 months to a year.  It broke and was a poor quality in comparison to this model.  I just got it but I love it already!</li>
    <li> I really like this flosser and it works well. I&#x27;ve read reviews where people seem to wash out an entire buffett&#x27;s worth of food when using these though I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case. Maybe they aren&#x27;t brushing before using it? Or maybe they don&#x27;t know how to brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does work, it will floss between your teeth. It does take a while to get used to using it and knowing how to find the gaps between your teeth with the flosser tip...yea, I know, seems like you&#x27;d know where your teeth gaps are but it&#x27;s harder than you might think at first as you can&#x27;t use a mirror since your mouth is closed (almost) while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You need to keep it close to a sink as the tube from the base to handle is short, but not enough to make that an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t hold a ton of water so I have to fill it with each (or every other at least) use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you don&#x27;t hang the handle back up where it goes and instead make the mistake of setting it on the counter and walk away it will pee itself dry all over your counter and the floor. That&#x27;s annoying, so put the handle back in the holder every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. There is a button on the handle which is a pause button. Meaning, you turn on power and it&#x27;s shooting water out instantly. If you need to stop the flow of water you can turn power off OR hit this pause button. It&#x27;s sort of counter intuitive, you&#x27;d think the button would be the okay-shoot-the-water-now button so that it only shoots water when you hold the button but it&#x27;s the exact opposite. I find this annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these are a deal breaker and if you are looking for a flossing alternative then give this a shot, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this but there is some quality issue where it leaked from the handle and made a mess on my sink top every time I used it. Just not happy with the quality in this.</li>
    <li> The best water pik yet</li>
    <li> This does a great job of removing food that remains trapped under the gum line, and plaque, even after extended brushing and flossing.  The variable pressure setting offers plenty of flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The too short cord attached to the handle is a big minus.  If not very careful, it&#x27;s easy to pull the entire unit into the sink!  It&#x27;s a little awkward rotating the pick to the right angle.  It&#x27;s easier for me to turn the entire handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it  5 stars if the cord had been long enough.  It does what it is supposed to do though, removes what brushing and flossing can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Waterpik is the best flosser on the market hands down. Great quality and very hygienic. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs to clean there teeth and gums</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better tool to make sure I get my teeth and gums as clean as possible. Of course, I follow up by brushing but sometimes the waterpik leaves my mouth feeling so clean I almost forget to brush. I don&#x27;t even have to use the higher speed settings to get everything clean so it has plenty of power and there are several attachments available for deep cleaning, etc.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, shipped in perfect condition.  Very useful.  It is easy to store. I would recommend it, can use it for travel also.</li>
    <li> Received product as described and expeditiously. A++++</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting this for some time... We love it, and use it daily, we can really tell the difference in how our teeth feel.... Definitely recommend....</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It works really well and makes my teeth feel &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34; every time.  I discussed this type of product with my dentist prior to purchasing it and we followed his recommendations to start out on a low level and work up to a stronger level.  If you use too high of level, you can cause damage to your gum by breaking attachments to the teeth.  We have owned this for several months now and are still at the level 6 (out of 10).  My last dentist cleaning went really well and there was considerably less plaque than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with multiple heads and two of the &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; heads, so two people can easily use it without having to purchase any more attachments.  The product is not super quiet, but not obnoxious either.  I would hesitate to use it if someone is sleeping nearby, but the noise is not bothersome to either of us with normal use.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this on the recommendation of her dentist.  She&#x27;s very happy with the product and would recommend it to one and all.</li>
    <li> I just love this machine as it does all that you could expect it to do and more. A real great product from Amazon as usual. Will give them both a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely frazierfly</li>
    <li> I love the water pik idea, but it is a bit loud. I definitly makes me &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; more often than I normally do.</li>
    <li> I like Water Pik, there is a water filter on my tap faucet. I&lt;br /&gt;feel better knowing that what I drink is better tasting without&lt;br /&gt;the impurities that come in well water from the parks supply.&lt;br /&gt;Spring water is good if you can find a good Artesian well.</li>
    <li> If you have a hard time using floss due to tightly grouped teeth, this solution will not help you much.  Even on the highest setting (which I like to call &amp;#34;gum eraser&amp;#34;), it still seemed to have trouble getting all the trapped food out of the gum line.</li>
    <li> Seems well built has nice strong water flow.  Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5th star is that I wonder about jet spray handle.  I think it will go faster than other parts.</li>
    <li> Overall my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works just as I expected and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I read some reviews about it leaking but I have not had any problems. I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for several months.  You have to be smart when you use it though.  It is easy to make a mess, so be smart and position yourself over the sink to  minimize the mess.  Make sure you push the pause button or turn the unit off before removing the nozzle from your mouth.  Just be smart about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that it comes with so many attachments. But I found that the standard attachment is all that I need and the only one that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I have braces and I really want to keep my mouth clean.  I rinse my mouth, floss, brush, rinse, then use the waterpik...and food STILL comes out of my mouth!  If you have braces this is a worth while investment.  It&#x27;s really great for getting little bits of food out of those places that you just can&#x27;t quite reach.</li>
    <li> I have had the Waterpik Ultra for awhile.  This one I bought for my son.  If used properly, it will really save on dental bills.  This one is much quieter than the previous model.  I usually have to fill the tank half way again after the first one,  but that&#x27;s OK. I love this product and would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Tongue cleaner is missing and did not get a response.  Works well and my tongue would have enjoyed being cleaned too.</li>
    <li> I want to write a review for this. We have this for years and still using this. It&#x27;s still useful.</li>
    <li> again not made in the USA , the product works well and cleans your teeth nice , it does what it was made for</li>
    <li> Quite pleased with the appearance and operation of the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  It functions well without being messy and is easily kept clean and stores all parts well.  A great tool for keeping your mouth and teeth fresh and clean after eating and morning and bedtime.</li>
    <li> not bad but you still need to floss,also you need to empty the water every time you use it otherwise it will leak</li>
    <li> Its light weighted equipment &amp; also easy to use. It cleans deep inside of teeth which regular floss can get into so feel much cleaner and healthier gum!</li>
    <li> We have used the waterpik products since they have been introduced and have found that they keep the gums healthy, reduce plack and are of great benefit for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I highly recommend this water jet.   It reaches places I thought I had brushed and finds food particles to remove.</li>
    <li> Pros:  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have noticed an improvement in my gums since using it.  Comes with a number of tips and settings.    Cons:  The plastic tube that connects the tip to the machine seems cheap, but it comes with a 2 year warranty so I&#x27;m not too worried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use this type of product and I love it!! There is no water leaking problem as long as you empty the water container after use. The water jet is strong and adjustable. The only drawback is that the machine is kinda noisy but I don&#x27;t know if you can find similar products without noises.</li>
    <li> Had this for less than two months when the motor/pump seemed to fail.  Still makes noise, but no water pumping out.  Until that point, the flosser was excellent, but failure after only 6 weeks of use is unacceptable at any cost.  Waiting for a replacement - hopefully this one will last a little longer.</li>
    <li> Works great, I enjoy it much more than flossing and it leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than ordinary flossing as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not as easy as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Water flashes everywhere and I have to wipe them off.</li>
    <li> I having been using this device since February after a visit from my dentist. Since then I have noticed a great change in my oral health. My gums and teeth look better than ever. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The only knock on this product is that the blue button to stop the flow sometimes sticks closed.  I have to pull it out with pliers.</li>
    <li> I have a different brand name oral water jet that after over five years, it died.  Not bad for an appliance that is used twice a day.  I read the adds for all the different brands and the waterpik stated that they had the best product.  That is not unusual for advertising but this time it held up, word for word.  Now if it will last over five years I will really be impressed.</li>
    <li> I love the water pik, but it leaks all over my counter intermitently.  I need to find a similar product of put it outside in the garden where it can water the flowers.</li>
    <li> No more traditional flossing since I got this marvelous waterpik. I am able to get into all the places that traditional flossing cannot reach. Highly recommend it for people with bridges. A wonderful addition to my daily dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Gets those hard to floss back spaces.  I can feel it down in a deep &#x27;pocket&#x27; - using tea tree mouthwash in the pik back there hoping for some healing.  My teeth feel nice and clean.  Wasn&#x27;t I supposed to get a tongue brush attachment?  I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought this product specifically because I have braces on my teeth.  It is great.  I do not know how anyone can properly clean teeth with braces without this product.  I bought the pik with the brace attachment.  It is not necessary.  The regular tip works great.  My gums feel so healthy and my teeth and braces are so clean.  After my braces are removed I will still use this product.</li>
    <li> Although flossing is good for between-the-teeth cleaning, nothing is better than a water-jet for cleaning at the gumline on both sides of the teeth.  It&#x27;s particularly good for those back molars where you can&#x27;t get your toothbrush close to the gumline.  Even with flossing, I had some minor bleeding on occasion.  The directions for this product indicates that you should start to see improvement within two weeks.  I saw it within five days.  I went in for an oral cleaning on the fifth day of use, and my oral hygenist commented that my mouth looked alot better.  After two and one-half weeks of use, the gum soreness I&#x27;ve always had where my partial attaches is gone.  Included are attachments[[ASIN:B000VVHD44 Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet]] for cleaning your tongue, rubber-tip for gum massage, tooth brush, and extra picks.  It has plenty of power.  I haven&#x27;t had to put the variable pressure above 4, and it goes up to 10. The only change I&#x27;d make to the product is to lengthen the water line from the unit to the applicator, as you must bend over the sink to use it.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Amazon was awesome in offering a discount on Waterpik items at the same time I wanted to purchase this item.  It cleans teeth and gums amazingly.  Everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd WaterPik in 40 years.  Yeah, they&#x27;ve been around THAT long!  My Orthodontist turned me on to the WaterPik when I got braces on my teeth at the tender age of 18.  After having those \\&quot;monorails\\&quot; on my teeth for over 3 years, aside from having a good cleaning to get the excess gook off, my teeth were in excellent condition with zero cavities.  I&#x27;ve used a WaterPik ever since, and my teeth are still in great shape.  About the only differences that are appearant from my first WaterPik and my newest, are the fact that the new one is FAR quieter than the other 2.  And it looks better sitting on the bathroom counter.  I highly recommend using a WaterPik as part of your oral hygene program.  They get out stuff that floss misses.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a great price after reading multiple reviews.   I have braces and this waterpik is exactly what I need since I skip floss sometimes. Its not a replacement for floss but a great stand in. I would recommend this product for anyone but especially those with braces.</li>
    <li> Recently bought the WaterPik Ultra and must say I am exceedingly pleased with the design, construction, and performance of the unit. From a design standpoint, Waterpik has chucked the outdated prevous models which were bulky, awkward, unattractive and underpowered. This unit has been trimed and refined like something from Apple -- attractive, functional, and with a healthy dose of visual appeal. Construction seems solid and well fitted, right down to a permanent coil in the hose to the handpiece that nestles nicely back into the body out of the way and with no tangles. As for performance, I am just short of amazed. With a mouthful of old fillings and repairs that have now outlived their useful life, I was skeptical that the WaterPik could deliver on its 14-day money back guarantee, especially since I had owned a unit many years ago that was not worth the money and time expended on it. But this little beauty delivers a strong water pulse that really cleans in hard to reach places. If this product saves the cost of just one filling, it will more than have paid for itself.</li>
    <li> What this is: a pulsing water-stream device which washes debris from along the gums and between the teeth.  What it also is: highly effective when used right    Aside from a very good toothbrush (one of the various makes of \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; style electric brush), the best thing you can do to keep your teeth is clean between them.  Flossing does a good job, but strong enough waterpick does an excellent job.  Use all three and your dentist will be amazed.    The waterpick device is a vibration style pump that pushes spurts of water through an small nozzle you hold.  The water is used to clean between the teeth, and between the teeth and gum line.  This removes debris, plaque, and bacteria, and helps keep your teeth and gums healthy.  Depending on the pressure, it can do a much more thorough job than flossing.    This particular device has enough pressure so as to be able to cause discomfort.  I highly suggest starting at a low pressure and turning it up, until you know where \\&quot;your\\&quot; pressure is.  It is not a device for everyone, children (etc) should not use it without supervision.  A good dentist will caution you that though it can remove debris, if misused, it can also cause debris to become wedged, and possibly damage the gums and other soft tissues.    I consider it to be essential, along with my electric tooth brush and floss.  ---  a couple years later:  I still have this device and use it frequently.  I also still have all my own teeth.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are extremely satisfied with our purchase of the Waterpik! The jet attachments are wonderful for our needs, the only complaint is the basin isn&#x27;t large enough to run it longer!</li>
    <li> Comes with lots of equipment but the water keeps spraying like crazy and instead of the button being for delivering the water, it stops it. Hence, if you don&#x27;t press the button, the water keeps coming full force. Should be the other way around. I think I underestimated how messy this would be, I had to change my shirt after the first try lol....and unfortunately I still had to floss after. The deep pocket addition is great but I think a manual device is better.</li>
    <li> I bought mine June 27, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It died today, April 7, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, it has a 3-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I&#x27;ll post whether the warranty was honored.</li>
    <li> Had a waterbik over 20 years ago and loved it - but it was large and in the way. This flosser is compact and easily fits on the sink top in my small bathroom.</li>
    <li> Leaks and did not last more than six months</li>
    <li> Works very well, has plenty of attachments. It is really loud, so use it before people go to sleep! The noise is a small price to pay for the cleanliness. The first couple uses will make your gums bleed like going a long time without flossing. Not to be vile, but this device will blast a lot of disgusting crap out from your gums and teeth that flossing just won&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, I replaced my old Waterpick which I&#x27;ve had for years, with  this one, and the new one works great.&lt;br /&gt;I like the combination cover and storage compartment. Geed idea. .&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the reservoir is too small and doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for  me.&lt;br /&gt;Tom .</li>
    <li> WOW! Cleaned the teeth to the end. Teeth were white and clean. Of course still used tooth brush. Thank you</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product don&amp;#34;t hesitate if you are looking for a waterpik this is it. Price is unbeatable here too.</li>
    <li> The array of tools, or tips is a bit bewildering, but they&#x27;re all good.  I use the one with the toothbrush, but will transfer to one of the other tips if I feel my gums need more stimulation.  I am 63, and cannot afford to neglect my teeth and gums.  Remember the old joke.. &amp;#34;If I&#x27;d known I was going to live this long, I&#x27;d have taken better care of myself.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> believed flosser would produce a higher pressure stream  also body shakes when dialing up pressure past 5  does an adequate job of flossing</li>
    <li> These went through a period many years ago where they were no longer powerful enough to do the job, but that is past now, and this one works quite well. I would prefer the water line to be replaceable, and the length is a bit restrictive, but, again, it does the job well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who has braces and it&#x27;s difficult to keep his mouth properly cleaned. This has been a great help, and it&#x27;s very easy to use!!!</li>
    <li> I got this water floss because my dentist keeps telling me that I need to floss and ti works well and is very fast but I still prefer the old thread method.</li>
    <li> Have used waterpiks for years and would not want to be without one. Easy to use and faster than flossing.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that I waited so long to purchase one of these. I have had this several weeks now and am very pleased. I use it twice a day. I am amazed at the detritus that it dislodges. This Waterpik has worked to perfection so far. This particular model comes with a storage top that has many different attachments. I have only used a single attachment, so I am not sure how valuable the extra different tips are. The pressure can be set at different levels, and I use  &amp;#34;8&amp;#34; most of the time although a 10 is not painful at all to me. If your gums are sensitive the pressure can be dialed back. I also like the way the head swivels. That allows me to control the direction of the flow with my thumb and forefinger. The attachments come out easily for storage or cleaning. There is also a button to interrupt the flow of water. I have a bathroom that is on the smaller side, but this Waterpik does not take up much counter space. I can highly recommend this model with the caveat that, I have limited experience with these.</li>
    <li> I had one previous to this one and liked it.  This one is an improvement to that one.  I am enjoying using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, has smart gadgets and various picks.  It&#x27;s sturdy.  It does the job so well.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My dentist has recommended getting a waterpik so I finally did. This model outperforms the models I previously used. It is easy to care for and use and has 6 different tips to select from.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been recommending this for years and I didn&#x27;t listen.  Finally broke down and ordered.  It&#x27;s well worth the time and money to keep your teeth extra clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> I honestly did not know how much I would depend on a water pick until I got one! My teeth have never felt better! Using this is now a twice daily addiction!</li>
    <li> works well I also use normal string floss along with this made my teeth feel healthier</li>
    <li> I used to need dental cleaning every 3 months for gum disease, after using this along with a sonicare tooth brush, I now go to the dentist for cleaning every 6 months. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described.  I have been using it now for about a week and it has exceeded my expectations.  Great machine at a great price with quick and well packaged delivery.  This vendor easily earned five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now owned and used this Watepik for about 3 months and still consider it to be a great product and want to expound on their customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after writing the original review, the pause button on my Waterpik started to stick and made the machine difficult and awkward to use.  I called customer service and spoke to a very pleasant representative who checked the warranty status very quickly and without hesitation indicated the hose and handle would be replaced.  Within several days I received the replacement along with installation instructions.  It took about 3 minutes with a screwdriver and the machine now works perfectly.  They still get 5 stars for their pleasant and quick response to my problem.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet&amp;#62; Just assume that it will be as good as it&#x27;s advertized to be. I got my fingers crossed</li>
    <li> This is an awesome waterpik system.  I am amazed after brushing my teeth how much more food particles remain on your teeth and under you gums.  Would recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; lives up to its name.  I used it, then flossed with regular dental floss for comparison.  The floss barely found anything!  In addition, teeth were noticeably cleaner than when brushing and flossing alone and this was also faster overall because I didn&#x27;t have to re-brush and re-floss.  I thought packaging it with 6 tips might be excessive, however, I tried out all the tips and found them to be effective and helpful.  I am glad I got this one instead of a scaled-down version.</li>
    <li> TWO of these both broke the exact same way.  I was fooled by the phony good reviews, so I thought that the first was a fluke.  So I bought another, and the exact same thing happed after about six weeks.  The hose cracks at the base.</li>
    <li> While awaiting an appointment with a peridontist I wished to try a water pik. It works well and my gums feel healthier. I will be surprised if the peridontist thinks I need treatment.</li>
    <li> Very cute, very useful, strongly suggest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so mess at all after you are habit to it. You can feel the difference after using it.</li>
    <li> I spent a good week researching and reading reviews of all the water flossers available on amazon at the time. I recieved this some months back and have been waiting to see if anything would go wrong before I wrote a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I found a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have gingivitis, no doubt about it. Flossing and brushing makes my gums bleed in a couple places, especially where my teeth are tightly crowded together where the jaw bends since I never had any of my wisdom teeth  removed. As such, flossing has been a strenuous task for me and I loath, absolutely -loath- doing it, more than I did as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally going to get the compact one because I hate taking up counter space and I hate the idea of having to drag something out of the cabinets to use every day, but I was convinced to buy this one based on the amount of tools it comes with, as well as how functional the design seemed. Yes, It&#x27;s a bit bulky and takes up a bit of counter place, but I use it every day, with a cap-full of antiseptic mouthwash or a some food grade hydrogen peroxide. I keep the pump level at around medium. Anything more makes my eyes water from the sensation. I have noticed my gums in the front are not so red anymore, and they do not bleed as often, though sometimes I brush a little too rigorously and they bleed near the crowded teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find much use with the other heads, admittedly, and I would have been fine with the normal one. I don&#x27;t ever use the brush one. I&#x27;ve tried the tongue cleaner, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem as effective as my tongue scraper, or even a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank is the perfect size to fill and get all your teeth, front and back, inside and outside, with a little left over to concentrate on areas that need a good rinsing. That&#x27;s with the pressure on to medium high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this piece of equipment. I haven&#x27;t any functioning problems yet. I don&#x27;t know if one should trust the warning of other comments about it leaking. Maybe it&#x27;s their first water flosser and they don&#x27;t know the nature of the tool, which is that it&#x27;s kind of messy in that water gets everywhere despite keeping your mouth mostly closed.</li>
    <li> I use water flosser daily and prefer it more then regular floss. Massage and short cleaning time make this process more valuable for me</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Water Flosser works great.  Pros: cleans your teeth better than brushing or flossing &amp; is easy to use.  Cons: Too many attachments (which I never use) &amp; the cord on mine broke after 2 years (repairs don&#x27;t work)</li>
    <li> I have used it only for about a week now, and I sense that it doesn&#x27;t have the strongest motor. I would recommend another model, folks.</li>
    <li> Having used a Waterpik for years, i was amazed at the variety of \\&quot;heads\\&quot; included with this model, including my favorite -- a toothbrush!  The deep cleaning head really stimulates the gums.  The newer design includes a shut off in the handle so changing heads may be accomplished while leaning over the sink.</li>
    <li> It is a compact and affordable version of Waterpik, but works perfectly to perform a deep cleaning between teeth. Much better than flossing! I use it only before sleeping and my breath improved a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s working well for me. I&#x27;m suffering from gingivitis and infections seem to have been reduced.</li>
    <li> The waterpik ultra purpose to clean gum and between your teeth is great,but the unit makes a lot of noise and vibrates across the vanity.</li>
    <li> This model is considerably quieter than our previous Waterpik which is still being sold for about $30.00 We also had leakage problems with that one.  This unit is being used not as a Waterpik for teeth but with a special attachment which was Doctor furnished to irrigate the nose passages.  It is perfect for that but for some reason they never advertise this useage.</li>
    <li> Feels better. Like the adjustments available and is compact enough to fit on the sink side. Easy to fill. Haven&#x27;t tried the extra wants yet - not sure if I will. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is our 4th Waterpik over the last 20 years.  The Ultra is by far the best designed and easiest to use.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the third waterpik I have owned and the best.  Substantially quieter and has strong jet cleaning.  Compact design is easy to store with a variety of attachments.</li>
    <li> Had an old water Pic which was much more powerful. This unit lacks power and has to be filled up twice to do all your teeth...  I am not totally happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for nearly a year and a half and it still has had not one problem. I have braces with springs and I can literally brush all day and still have massive amounts of food in my teeth/gums, this thing is a godsend, its also really fun to see all the junk get taken out of your gums!</li>
    <li> What has two thumbs and a clean set of gums according to the dentist? This guy.</li>
    <li> Once I learned how not to drown myself, I found this (at last!) gets more debris out of my teeth than any other method.</li>
    <li> I am well pleased with this water pik.</li>
    <li> My dentist commented that she saw improvement in my gums and teeth during my last visit. When I told her I was using this she said she wasn&#x27;t surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment is that this unit vibrates a little loud for an early morning routine. One may disturb a sleeping partner if too close. Overall I will recommend this for the following people: 1. People that have had dental work in the past and want to maintain their smile. 2. People that need to floss more but have trouble getting all the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Well, my initial reaction was a No and I had decided to return it. I was not happy with the length if the water pipe, i believe it is a bit short for a tall man. Secondly the water starts flowing as soon as you turn it on. In order to stop water you need to press the button on the handle. It took me a while to adjust to the control. I tried it for two weeks and then realized that it is doing an amazing job in cleaning the teeth.  Now I am totally hooked to it. Cleans very well and you can tell the difference. So if you buy it, give it a chance and soon you will start liking it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good little product but needs a little more pressure. It takes some getting used to but I think it works well. Would have been 5 stars with more pressure.</li>
    <li> I have to say Waterpik&#x27;s are pretty awesome!  My girlfriend was always a flosser, and I&#x27;m personally too lazy to do that.  The waterpik was my answer as it&#x27;s easy to fill up and use, and now my girlfriend even uses it on a daily basis rather than flossing.</li>
    <li> I have now purchased three Water Pik products.  The Ultra and two different portables. The Ultra lasted about a year.  The first original smaller portable lasted only about 6 mos.  I bought the newer portable last August and it is about to die on me as well!  I am looking for another brand, but in reading some of the other reviews I see the same thing.  Doesn&#x27;t anyone make a water flosser that lasts?</li>
    <li> WaterPic what can I say the last one lasted 10 years wish all products were built this well</li>
    <li> I purchased this flosser on December 7, 2012. I tried to use it on April 2, 2014 and the motor runs but no water comes out. I&#x27;m very technical so I made sure the hose, reservoir &amp; unit weren&#x27;t obstructed. To my surprised there is a label underneath the unit that reads, &amp;#34;DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE THAN 5 MINUTES IN EACH 2 HOUR PERIOD.&amp;#34; Based on this revelation I OVERUSED my waterpik...The poor thing held on for 15 months! **Great product though**</li>
    <li> This little gadget works great. The waterpik has been around since the 1970&#x27;s, but the manufacturer has made many improvements over the years. The current model is both easy and quick to use. It&#x27;s great for busy folks who haven&#x27;t the time to brush and floss as often as recommended by dentists.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a very bad checkup with my dentist and found out I had 16 cavities all forming down around the gum line, because I don&#x27;t do a good enough job brushing I guess. They recommended I get a waterpik to clean around my gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since owning this within the first month I noticed a difference in the plaque that was going away in places even the dentists said they were unable to remove in a cleaning. This is definitely a high quality unit and all the attachable heads really add a lot of options and value to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use 1 cap of Listerine to my water each time I use the machine for some added freshness and cleaning between my teeth and gums. It should be noted that even though this machine can go up to level 10 you will never use it. It quite literrally feels like a high pressure washer at that level and can be damaging. Early on the first month or so I used this machine at around level 2-3. Now after my gums have adjusted to this machine I tent to enjoy being around 4-1/2 setting. This give just enough pressure to really give me deep cleaning without so much that it is injurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this model and brand of water flosser.</li>
    <li> This seems to clean my gums quite well.  When I add a little white vinegar, it cleans the tarter off even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now on my third Water-Pik in 2 years. They do a wonderful job of flossing, once you get the hang of maneuvering the wand without squirting water up your nose. I have done routine periodontal and cleaning visits for 20 years, to maintain gum health, using floss and Proxident brushes to prevent tartar buildup. I maintained, but did not improve my pocket depths, until I began using the water-pik. The most recent assessment showed the first improvement in 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the dang thing keeps breaking. In both previous units, the button which temporarily halts the water flow gets stuck in the off position. Without water coming out the end, it&#x27;s just not useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated, I pried apart the wand of my second broken unit. It is a clever and delicate assembly of plastic valves and regulators, with a spring to re-open the shutoff valve when the button is released. In my case, the spring stopped supplying enough force to re-open the valve, Weak spring? Dirty O-rings on the valve? I dunno. But without a temporary shutoff valve, these things can be positively dangerous to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my latest unit, I am using filtered water, in the hope of preventing any deposits from building up in the shutoff valve. It&#x27;s a pain, but I just hate having to buy a new one every few months. Or maybe I just need a constant supply of new springs? I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Everything is fine on this product. Capacity could be a little bigger through.  We recommend the \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; model better than the portable one as they have to be refilled sometimes  during each usage.</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik, but oh man, I enjoy it a lot. It is an interesting sensation, but one that I think feels great. At first I was worried about the pressure being too high, but from day 1 I used this on a medium or medium-high setting with no pain.   If you have never used one of these before, it is a little awkward. I&#x27;m sure everyone has their technique, but mine involves sealing my mouth and letting the water fill it up, then using the handy \\&quot;pause\\&quot; feature on the wand to allow myself to spit. I&#x27;m not totally convinced this could replace flossing, but it does get all of the hard to reach places.   My personal favorite thing to do is to mix some mouthwash in with the water and blast along my gumline, making sure to get it into every crevice. My gums have never looked better and I credit this to the waterpik and an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Be sure the reservoir is TIGHTLY placed on the base - any wiggle room just causes the pic to not put our the stream of water necessary to use.  Other than that, it seems to be working as described.</li>
    <li> Look, I&#x27;m like most people. I freaking HATE flossing, but after getting tired of being nagged by my dentist to floss more I looked into one of these, and after my ravings almost my entire extended family went out and bought one. These make flossing a breeze, and do a much better job of it than I ever did. It&#x27;s like a minute of your time per day, pretty quiet, and very effective. Buy it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s marvelous and great to use teeth. Most dental recommend to have that for your teeth care. I&#x27;m very happy to be useful.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my waterpik purchase.  It performs exactly as I expected based upon the description I read.  It is easy to use and after using it, my mouth feels really clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My dentist kept telling me to floss, which I absolutely hate, so I finally decided to try a water flosser.  It works great.  Plenty of power and attachments.  My only complaint is that I wish the cord from the flosser to the base was longer.</li>
    <li> Everybody should use one.  My dentist asked me what I did to get my teeth so much cleaner than I was before I started using it. It soes not eliminate the need for flossing, but it&#x27;s not necessary to floss nearly as often.</li>
    <li> I really love it, wonderful perfect to clean tooth. I highly recommend to you. it must be the first choice for people want to buy a perfect water flosser.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser as a replacement for a prior identical item.  After many years, the orginal item broke.  So, we purchased a second identical item and then replaced the part on the older product which then functioned perfectly again.  Both flossers are being used be members of our family.</li>
    <li> water pik works as promised, but there is only one basic cleaning tool, so two people cant use it,and some of the other tools included in the package are not needed. For more than single use, you have to purchase additional piks, this is only available at Bed and Bath, and they dont stock, so an order is needed, very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> It makes less noise than I thought. I just wish they sells extra jet tips at markets too. Its hassle to order with online market &gt;_&lt;</li>
    <li> Purchased this name brand product for less than I could purchase it at any store. It was easy, shipment was fast and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Spray is powerful enough to get under the gums slightly. Gives you a great clean feeling.  I recommend adding a little Hydrogen Peroxide to the water when you use it.</li>
    <li> Our daughter just got braces and we considered a Waterpik to make it easier for her to clean her teeth. We liked it so much we bought a second one for our bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use. Comes with multiple accesory &#x27;tips&#x27; for various jobs: toungle cleaning, help with gum disease, general tooth cleaning, braces, etc. You can boy additional or replacement tips as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all use ultrasonic brushes (sonicare) which are great, but there is something about a waterpik a traditional brush cannot meet. Using both (one in the morning, one at night) is probably the best option. The water jets massage your gums, water cleans where brushes cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is well made, and includes a dial to control the water pressure. It is easy to fill the water container. The unit is somewhat bulky: naturally, it uses a lot more space than a toothbrush. Yet, it does not look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a recommended tool for a healthy mouth</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, I bought this about a month ago upon recommendation from my dentist.  So far, seems to cleaning well, and I feel my teeth are clean after using it.  Will see the results with my next visit to the dentist.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me that the front of my teeth look good, but for the back I need to floss more. I&#x27;m actually excited to go my next appointment to see if there is the hygienist can tell the difference since using this product. I&#x27;ve only had this for about a month, but I am currently loving it. I get this odd joy of seeing everything come out into the sink that I would normally not get with your typical floss. When I first used it, there were more things hiding back there. However, now that I&#x27;ve consistently used it morning and night, I&#x27;m seeing less and less. As much as I get disappointed that I don&#x27;t see as much come out (weird, I know) - my teeth feel much cleaner. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s working! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have not experienced any issues with it linking.</li>
    <li> the product works great at removing the particles left between your teeth.  i purchased this for my 11 year old to clean out her braces since flossing isn&#x27;t realistic since its sooo time consuming with braces.  other than the fact that when she&#x27;s finished using the water flosser there is water EVERYWHERE!... it serves the purpose well. ;)</li>
    <li> Whoa!  My teeth are much cleaner, and the pockets I have in my gums have benefitted, but make sure you test it out before you use it on the highest setting.  I about took my head off the spray was so strong.  I use it after flossing and brushing with a little mouthwash in it, and stuff still comes out of my teeth.</li>
    <li> We had one of these when I was a little kid and we used it all the time. It works very good and has enough tips for everyone in my family.  My daughters are both getting to the age where they need braces and I thought this would be great for keeping their teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Okay, I just got my water flosser today, and I had to try it out.  Worked well, and has good pressure on the number 10 setting.  I flossed twice with it to get the hang of it.  Made my gums bleed a little, but this is my own fault, because I don&#x27;t floss regularly enough.  Now my teeth have that \\&quot;just been to the dentist\\&quot; clean feeling.  I am excited about this purchase - and I think I will floss my teeth a little more often.  It is a little messy.. but not too bad once you get the hang of it.  I can&#x27;t say anything for durability, because I just got it today - but I&#x27;ll post again if it breaks real quick.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase...not so happy about having to come up with a limit of words that I have to use.</li>
    <li> I like this version of the product. Plenty of individual piks for every job, reasonably compact, easy to exchange piks, etc. I think it could use a little more capacity in the tank, but that&#x27;s just me talking.   The real test will be if the water delivery tube lasts a reasonable period of time--I&#x27;ve felt let down by purchases of previous models. Absent that trepidation, I would have awarded it 5-stars.</li>
    <li> The rubber gasket came off and is now lost, poor craftsman ship!  Unit works but disappointed in craftsmanship.  Just use caution when taking off water well.</li>
    <li> Excellent water flosser,quick and easy to set-up and does a superb job with cleaning the teeth and gum line. Provides a more pleasant experience than traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> Great product. The top setting is stronger than I would typically expect -which is nice. It&#x27;s a bit messy, but that&#x27;s the nature of water picks I guess. Filling the tank is a little awkward, as the drain is in the bottom. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! my teeth and gums are so much healthier. My hygienist is very pleased. Even after flossing this machine will get so much food particles out of your teeth you could feed an ant colony.&lt;br /&gt;My whole mouth feels just great!</li>
    <li> basic model recommended by periodontist.  Read a lot of negative reviews about that model as well as all of the models.  This model available on amazon for a few bucks more so went with it and love it.  Forget the negative reviews. Seems a bit delicate in construction so just hope it lasts a while.  Will order another for my other location.</li>
    <li> I received my waterpik but no tips. The description says 6 tips but the tip holder has none. So, I was not able to evaluate this product.</li>
    <li> I use this twice daily after using  an ultrasonic brush. It&#x27;s very durable, from a respected manufacturer. This one is three(3) years old and going strong.</li>
    <li> Very noisy... sounds like a motorcycle coming down the road. But it does not leak like my old one so I can live with it 4 now..</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this or not, but I do really love it. It does a great job (my hygentist loves me) and it is much easier to use than I thought it would be. My dentist recommended it to me as I was having some minor issues that could turn to major if not corrected and this really is helping.</li>
    <li> Actually bought this for my daughter and have wanted one for myself ever since!  She said her mouth and teeth feel cleaner and her breath is better and her slight gingivitis might be getting better.  So far so good.  Planning on getting one for the rest of us, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks for years and have always been rewarded with great checkups.  Coupled with a Sonicare brush and a good mouthwash, this is the best way to have healthy teeth and gums.  Yes, I know ... nothing works better than flossing ... except this Waterpik!  You should, of course, listen to your dentist, but as for me, I don&#x27;t need to floss when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically regarding the Waterpik, I have had three previous models and all worked well but technology does move forward.  The previous ones were noisy and also it was difficult not to splash a bit of water on the countertop.  This new model eliminates those problems with a very quiet motor and a thumb switch on the wand that temporarily stops the water flow so you don&#x27;t splash when putting it in your mouth and taking it out.  It comes with six different tips, but I just use the classic one for a healthy gum massage with debris removal.  I tried the tongue scraper tip and it worked OK, but a simple Oolit scraper is faster and more effective.  An additional benefit is the large water tank, meaning you can get a nice, refreshing cleaning without having to fill it up twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with anything else, when all else fails, read the directions!  If you are not use to a water jet striking your gums and you start using this appliance on full pressure, you&#x27;ll have some sore gums.  Start out gently and gradually work up to a comfortable setting.</li>
    <li> Amazing teeth saver. Just watch the particles flush out, even right after flossing. Wish I had known about this years ago!</li>
    <li> As an Amazon prime addict, I was looking to purchase regular floss and came across this. After reading all the numerous good reviews, I decided to buy one. It&#x27;s a great machine, easy to use, effective, and well built. The rubber on the bottom keeps it sturdy as it stands on my toilet top since I do not have counter space in my bathroom. I can imagine this product is an absolute must if you are wearing braces. So far I&#x27;ve only used the regular water pick, but there different kinds for different uses. It&#x27;s rewarding to see pieces of food come out between your teeth without the hassle of using floss which can be painful. I&#x27;m currently on power level \\&quot;4\\&quot;, anything higher stings my front gums. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking to keep their mouth, teeth, gums healthy! It&#x27;s also really fun to use!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I get a waterpik to help clean around my new bridge.  I does the job very well.  I like having the choice of various attachments.</li>
    <li> I had to try this after reading all the reveiws and it is exacly what i expected. Its a very good alternative to string flossing and the product just works. You can buy many different attachements and it has enough power to clean between your gums. I am too lazy to use it every day but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised... It is very convenient and easy to use, my dentist recommends it too. So far it has meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Works very well, is easy to use, and definitely improved the health of my gums (BTW, it&#x27;s not a replacement for flossing, but a complement).  I find the big reservoir just right, the adjustable power settings a must, and the rotating tip easy to maneuver. Incomparably better than portable ones.</li>
    <li> The main reason I purchased this item was because I have a broken tooth that I cannot fix at the moment.  It works great for cleaning out food particles left behind but I am unimpressed with it otherwise.  I fully accept that I may be using this incorrectly but my gums seem a little stressed since I started using it and my \\&quot;trouble\\&quot; plaque areas seem unaffected by it.  I think it is truly one of those things that it works better for some than others.</li>
    <li> I hate to floss, I hate to go to the dentist, I am very squeamish about my teeth.  Accordingly, I rarely flossed, and my gums paid the price.  After using this for about 6 weeks, my gums no longer bleed when I use regular floss or when I brush a little harder than normal.  The plaque reduction is amazing, and I am not always concerned about my teeth when I smile.  I will be going to the dentist this week and hopefully will hear good things from him.  Buy it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed, especially if you are averse to regular flossing like me!</li>
    <li> I received my second Water Flosser today. I had returned the first one as it had tripped the GFCI in all of our bathrooms. The second one did exactly the same thing. I contacted Waterpik and they informed me that this was a known issue and that I should purchase a single outlet GFCI, which I could purchase in Best Buy or Radio Shack for $5.00 -- the local Radio Shack charged $20.00 for the item. Also see [[ASIN:B0046Q1R9W TRC® ShockShield® Single-Outlet GFCI Adapter]] They also said that they would be making a production change later this year to eliminate the problem. In other words, they are shipping defective product and know it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s shipping and return processing were excellent.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik had very well written instructions for its use, and works very well for me.  I am very pleased with  it.</li>
    <li> I have often considered a Water Pik but never got around to actually buying one.  Then a friend told me that his dentist was very concerned about the state of his teeth and gums and recommended the Water Pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of months his whole mouth was transformed and that convinced me to get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what an amazing effect it has had. My teeth certainly feel cleaner and the plaque build up on the lower front is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;Most surprising is that the yellow staining which did not respond to a professional whitening session has, within a month virtually gone.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every time I brush and still can&#x27;t believe how much debris it flushes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without it again!</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended using it and I like it. Leaves a clean, fresh feeling. Gets areas that flossing may miss. Use every time I brush.</li>
    <li> Effective at removing food debris from between teeth! Low pressure setting is gentle on gums. Can put xylitol rinse in water container.</li>
    <li> As a dentist I have used it myself and recommended it to my patients for many years. It should be used along with a toothbrush and with floss.</li>
    <li> She just loves it.  Even after flossing with floss and brushing, she says it&lt;br /&gt;flushes out more debris.  Her gums are much better.  Now I want to buy one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Probably not good for younger children.</li>
    <li> Well the flow anyway.  Been using for a few months. Definitely feels better than standard flossing.  Don&#x27;t know how someone could use it past level 6 though.  4 stars because it seems to be that it would be easier to use if the button was for starting the flow vs stopping it.  If your thumb slips off the button you&#x27;ll shoot water everywhere, and the process itself is messy.  Would still recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good water flossser works great value. Very simple to use and does a very good deep cleaning. this product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpiks for many years.  The first couple of units worked very  well and lasted approximately5 years each.  In the past 2 years I have gone through 3 of these which have failed for various reasons.  The quality of the new units is not even close to what they once were.  They still clean very well , but they are only built to last the warranty period.  Shame to see such a good product go down so far.  I&#x27;m going with another product.</li>
    <li> was exactly what i anticpated it is like getting teeth cleaned at the dentist only alot more comfortable def recomend</li>
    <li> very bulky, need a lot of space in bathroom. how do you spit if water comes continuously in your mouth</li>
    <li> I like it but I should have bought the one a step up. You can purchase the additional attachment. I got the models mixed up so, it is what it is!</li>
    <li> THE VERY FIRST DAY THE WAND HOLDER BROKE AND IS NOT REPAIRABLE!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS POOR DESIGN. WE OWN 2 OTHERS OF AN OLDER DESIGN AND THEY ARE FAR SUPERIOR.</li>
    <li> It performs beyond my expections.  Easy to use and care for and leaves my mouth feeling super fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend especially if you&#x27;re like me and hate flossing.</li>
    <li> This item was suggested  from the DDS. It stays clean easy to use and does not take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> I got my hopes up reading all these reviews and bought this expecting a hassle-free experience. Oh boy, how wrong was I.  First of all, this waterpik has tons of water leaking through the base. Upon closer examination I found out the hose attachment near the bottom of the waterpik has a crack already- and I haven&#x27;t even used it once! OMFG  Then there&#x27;s the non-functional on/off switch. It&#x27;s forever stuck at the on position and I cannot get it to rest at the off position. *facepalm* Defective product is defective. Seller won&#x27;t refund or exchange any opened merchandise, so good fight to me. Looks like I lost $60 for this POS.</li>
    <li> Works great. Our old one lasted over a decade, so no complaints there. The only minor negative with the new one is that it is quite a bit louder than the old one.</li>
    <li> exceeded my expectation</li>
    <li> It makes your teeth feel so clean!</li>
    <li> Great pick. Works great and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a present for my wife, she loves it and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have several bridges in my mouth.  I use a floss threader to remove foods etc, but NOTHING gets all the little pieces out like this Waterpik!  I have deliberately tried to floss and rinse multiple times to see if I am doing a good job cleaning and then using the Waterpik and still a LOT more is cleaned out.  I have been using a Waterpik for 4 years now and this unit was a replacement for my old one.  It not only cleans under my bridges, but I can still get a lot out from the gumline.  It&#x27;s amazing how much is left behind.  I have not had a cold or flu since I started using a Waterpik and I firmly believe it is due to the twice daily use of the Waterpik cleaning residue and bacteria.</li>
    <li> We have had three or four of the Waterpiks and the cheap plastic hose has broken on each of them in approx 1-2 years! Waterpik knows about this problem and hasn&#x27;t done anything to fix it! Would gladly spend $20 more for a quality product that doesn&#x27;t break down after 1-2 years. Maybe somebody else will make one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist, and I have recommended this product to many of my patients. It is proven to be more effective than flossing, and it is especially a good product for those with periodontal disease to use. It comes with a variety of different inserts, and you can adjust the pressure of the water. It can be quite messy while you&#x27;re still getting used to it, but overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Product performs as described.  I was having deep pockets along my gum lines.  My dentist recommended this to help.  Have been using it for a few months.  follow up visit showed improvement.&lt;br /&gt;the only recommendation I have for folks starting out with one of these is to start on a low setting.  I think the highest setting could clean the siding on my house.&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> We replaced our original Waterpik (over 10 years old) with this new model when the motor gave out.  Our purchase was made after reading reviews on several models of Waterpik.  We were also influenced by the size of this model, as there is limited space on our countertop near an accessible electrical outlet.  Though taller than the original model, it is compact and has a smaller &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34;.  The &amp;#34;pik head&amp;#34; now removes with the press of a button - a real plus.  The removable white container atop the water reservoir is a convenient storage spot for the spare &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34;.  Hopefully, the water tubing holds up after repeated usage since it has to be pulled out from its coiled position each time. Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase.</li>
    <li> First water flosser I bought. Works as expected although it is a bit noisy. Hope the attachments will last for a while.</li>
    <li> Never like using dental floss and when I have it&#x27;s never been as quick or as effective as this thing. Never knew I could get so much **** stuck in between my teeth until this started getting it out.... and my teeth are pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, the pump is a little noisy, not a problem to me though.</li>
    <li> I grew up with a waterpik.  Had not used one in many years.  It is a good tool for cleaning your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> This product is great !  I feel much better after using it. I Strongly recommend it to those who feel sore in the morning.</li>
    <li> This waterpik looks attractive on my bathroom counter.  It holds a large amount of water so that I can use it for a long time.  I like the control where you can set it for varying degrees of power.</li>
    <li> I had one of these previously and knew it was a good product.  The price was great!  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I always wonder how I lived without this all my life?? I love this product and I use it daily. You don&#x27;t ever have to floss again with dental floss. This pik works wonders!! Your mouth feels so clean after using it.  I have already recommended it to friend.</li>
    <li> Ordered this unit and loved it for about two weeks.  Worked great, then the pressure dropped significantly.  Amazon sent another one.  Same thing happened a week later.  Even called WaterPik, and they were not able to remedy.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I probably should have had braces but didn&#x27;t want to mess with retainers when I was in school.  Now, my teeth are crowded and difficult to floss.  I use this product and add a splash of mouthwash to the holder.  My teeth are smooth and feel clean.  It has helped to some degree to remove plaque build-up on the inside of my lower teeth (I smoke).  I feel like the stream is strong enough to access in between my teeth.</li>
    <li> My orthodontist recommended this kind of device to clear my newly-installed braces of food particles. Well, not particles actually but major hunks. It takes a bit of time to get the hang of using the Waterpik, for example, you need to hunch over a sink and allow water to spurt from your mouth from time to time, and the effluvia isn&#x27;t exactly pretty. It looks a lot like what you had for your last meal. Also, pulling the trigger on the spray should be done only when the pick device is safely in your mouth otherwise you will hose down your sink, mirror, spouse, etc. The Ultra Flosser comes with a half-dozen nozzles, each with a different purpose allegedly. I suspect they all do basically the same thing: blast the flotsam from your choppers. Run your own personal experiment and see if you agree.</li>
    <li> I have been using it every day--my teeth actually look whiter.  I am hoping for less tortuous poking and jabbing at my next teeth cleaning session with the dentist.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! My mouth has never felt so clean. Fins myself using it after every meal.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband,it works really well with different tips. Help clean better.i would recommend this to you.</li>
    <li> This product was a disappointment, it is not practical, very dirty with the impact of water, and moreover, it is a little difficult to handle it because of the small pipe through which the water passes. The feeling is that the product is very delicate and can break anytime. Worse, this product is not dual voltage, care. It is a good product design, but in this current stage of advancement does not recommend the purchase. Not 3 stars because it is a lot of Money for something you will avoid to use...</li>
    <li> Bought it for Myself as well as for my son. Received within a few days. Great product. User-friendly. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I like this thing and the pressure seems pretty good. My only complaint is that the picks break easily if dropped.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I cannot believe how much cleaner my teeth look and feel after using this product.  One word of warning - make sure everything around you is waterproof when you first use it and don&#x27;t wear clothes you don&#x27;t mind getting wet - it sprayed the mirror, the sink, and me until I figured out what the pause button was for!  (Oops!)  I have some perio pockets around my gums and this seems to do a great job on them some and is also helpful for delivering medicated mouthwash (with the perio tip).  Best $ spent in awhile --- just wish insurance covered it :)</li>
    <li> If you are too lazy to floss, this is the machine for you. I had for over 2 years now and just bough this one for a friend who just got braces.</li>
    <li> Once you get used to working with it is very good. Even after brushing &amp; string flossing still gets more food from between teeth.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! So much better than regular floss and improves the condition of your teeth and gums. I am addicted!</li>
    <li> Got this on dentist recommendation after having spent $5,000 on dental work and periodontal scraping. I have poor teeth and diabetes (both genetic). Even though I brush and floss several times a day, I still have problems. Also problems with my gums retreating. This has been great for added cleaning and for stimulating my gums. Use it nightly and have seen improvements. Did not find it excessively loud, as some have complained. I add mouthwash to the water and find it very refreshing. Would recommend to all. Oral health is tremendously important to one&#x27;s overall health.</li>
    <li> This water pick is better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has plenty of cleaning power. The pressure coming from the stream is strong enough to hurt your tongue. My primary worry when I bought this was it would be too weak. I&#x27;m surprised some reviews state the older models were more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tank is the right size to get all of my teeth. I only need to use 1 tank each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth tastes cleaner and smells better when I wake in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the tip container doesn&#x27;t have enough slots for everything included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still makes sense to floss before using this. Once I tested it by flossing after using the WaterPik and found a small piece of an orange.</li>
    <li> At every dentist visit the Dr. always tells you to floss more, floss more, floss more. I&#x27;ve always hated flossing, but I wanted to do something more for my teeth besides brushing so I tried this. It is very easy and fast, and I like it better than regular flossing. And it gets me to actually use it, which is a good thing. I try to use it a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> Super product Excellent service.</li>
    <li> Works very well, I saw a difference (no more bleeding gums) in just a few days. It&#x27;s only disadvantage so far is that it is VERY loud, like have a small jackhammer in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Water pressure even on highest setting is still poor. After 2 min of using waterloo I still used regular floss. Disappointed</li>
    <li> A wee bit messy, but effective, tool against bad dentist visits.  A co-worker has the travel size but has to refill the water chamber after every use -- so this is the size to get.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fun to find something that is more than a gimmick. Usually, any device that encourages more home-care is fine by me. It&#x27;s clear that some products are toys that are successful only because they are a novelty, and you play with the novel toy, and your teeth and gums thank you for the attention. This Water Flosser is a real unit that pulses water through an assortment of tips to blast debris away from your gums and teeth. And it even feels good! I can see this really helping anyone with braces, or bridgework, or implants, or maybe even perio patients. Take some time to adjust the force, start low and turn it up a day at a time. It should feel clean, not hurtful, and also take time to learn how not to spray the mirror or yourself! Ha ha. I will offer these to my patients.</li>
    <li> Works great so far.  Really helps clean!</li>
    <li> this unit works very well- it reaches areas which a toothbrush can&#x27;t, and does it quickly. I would recommend this device to anyone&lt;br /&gt;wishing to take better care of their teeth!! it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Although my dentist strongly urges me to manual flossing besides using this one, I still love it. -- To start with, it helps me establish the habit of flossing. It takes 2~3 times to get used to, but then it&#x27;s easy to use and my teeth feels clean afterwards. I&#x27;d ever tried to put mouth-wash+water instead of pure water into the tank -- there&#x27;re huge amount of foams! So that is not advised:)</li>
    <li> Love love my water pik and flosser !!</li>
    <li> When I was buying this item I did so on a recommendation of a relative that owned one. I read the Amazon reviews and took note that some people had problems with leaking handles and sticking buttons. Others loved the product. Based on those reviews and my relative&#x27;s comments I went ahead and bought the wp-100. After receiving and using it, I absoultely loved it. Flossing became enjoyable and my teeth and gums felt much cleaner. The fun lasted for about 4 months. 1st  signs of failure were the button on the handle that stops the water flow began sticking. Then it became increasingly difficult to  to switch the tips. Finally, the unit began leaking on the seam of the handle just above the tip release button. All pressure to the tip itself was lost. The unit comes with a 1 year warranty but getting in touch with waterpik isn&#x27;t easy. I am awaiting an email reply from them. I read another review from someone who said this problem occurs because an o ring becomes dislodge. Evidently, the handle can not be opened and the whole handle assembly requires replacement. Since this problem has happened to others I would be cautious about purchasing one. If I can get waterpik to replace or repair this unit I will use it again. If it fail with the same problem again I would not buy another. Its too bad because I really did like the product. I would however give them a second chance but only at their expense.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels cleaner and fresher than ever before and now I have difficulty having a meal out without benefit of the after meal clean-up with my water pik.  I gave all three of my grown up children water jets for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Its a well designed, attractive unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the entire water chamber each time, it really doesn&#x27;t leak.  If you don&#x27;t use it all, then dump it out after your done.  For me, I enjoy using it so much, I always use the entire water chamber ... and it&#x27;s enough to do the job, but none too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the hydrabrush and then this, my teeth really do feel nearly dental hygienist clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem with food getting stuck in your teeth, this is really excellent.  Especially after eating meat, fruit or veggies that may get stuck in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might even have to turn down the pressure if you have sensitive gums as this thing has a lot of water blasting power.  My kids find it very fun and it comes with a wide range of attachments for almost anyone and the tounge cleaner is even cool.  I love the tray on top that holds the attachements ... its functional and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only a 4.5 because of the occasional problems starting it up ... but this is fixed by having a damp intake ... which I find isn&#x27;t an issue if you use a FULL water chamber each time and just leave it seated in the unit till the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really isn&#x27;t a complete substitute for flossing, but consider a nice supplemental and sometimes use it instead of flossing.  But really both would be better.  Sometimes I substitute this for flossing if I don&#x27;t have time for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth like me, use warm water instead of cold and it feels a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be messy to use, so I recommend keeping your mouth shut during use, or lean over the counter close to the sink and it&#x27;ll just spash the sink and not the mirror.  Some splash is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the button to pause the water flow.  If your halfway coordinated, you can pause it and reduce the mess considerably.  For me, I&#x27;m not very coordinated, so I just lean into the sink and let it overspray a bit (into the sink).  I think of it as \\&quot;controlled drooling\\&quot; ... but its fun to look down in the sink and see how much stuff this actually removes ... even after brushing and flossing.a bit (into the sink).

    <li> I really am trying not to throw good money after bad, but I can&#x27;t find an oral irrigation product to use. I had blown out two of the less-expensive WaterPik models (differing by only by the color of their water holder--one was clear and one was opaque cream color) in a period of only 3 months so I was very wary of anything carrying the the WaterPik name. But then I saw the \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;. \\&quot;That&#x27;s got to be better,\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;or they wouldn&#x27;t have used the word &#x27;Ultra&#x27; to describe it. To me, the word &#x27;Ultra&#x27; means something that goes beyond others in whatever property you&#x27;re considering. For example, if I said that the Waterpik WP-100 is the ultra dental water cleaner in terms of length of service, then I would think that meant that the Waterpik WP-100 outlasts the others. Not for me. I got the same flaw as the others: the head piece broke where the spring retainer clip is, and the tip broke off where it plugs in. Identical problem as the other two, cheaper WaterPik&#x27;s  I have bought. If anyone knows of another brand I would LOVE to hear about it!!!!!!    If I could have put a negative number in the rating scale, I would have. This one is no better than the cheaper WaterPics, that do not carry the \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; adjective as part of their name.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use and a real improvement over previous waterpiks.  It&#x27;s quiet and effecient and has an ample water supply cup.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it leaked at the connection of the tip to the handle. I returned it and got another one. It leaked from the same place. It appears o me that this product ( or a least the batch from the two I received) are defective</li>
    <li> This is my fourth or fifth water pik.  I use it every night.  They last about 4 years tops and then it&#x27;s time to get another one.  The size of this one is a nice feature, a little taller and narrower.  Looks nicer out on the sink.  The top part that holds all the accessories is terrific because it&#x27;s a nice top on the reservoir and you always know where all the accessories and extras are.  I read that someone keeps the reservoir filled and liked the top part so as to cover up the water.  HELLO????  Why is anyone keeping water in there all day?  Use it at night, empty it by using the water pik, and then cover it with the nice white top and go to bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pik works great.  The on-off switch is nice.  The pressure control dial is accurate and responsive.  It is a littler quieter than my last waterpik.  It starts as soon as you turn it on.  I keep the pressure control in the middle.  After all my years of waterpikking &amp; flossing, midrange is good for me.  You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be higher but no, midrange is a very strong pulse and good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is too small for me but NO PROBLEM.  I keep a plastic wine glass in the bathroom and fill it up along with the reservoir.  Midway through waterpikking, I dump the glass of water in the reservoir.  No stopping and taking the reservoir off the base.  I dump the water in while water-pik&#x27;ing and with the machine still on.  In fact, I never take the reservoir off the base.  I fill the aforementioned plastic wine glass with warm water and dump it into the reservoir.  With my particular dollar store plastic wine glass, it takes 2 1/2 filled glasses of warm water and the other 1/2 is left for the end when I need just a little more water in the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this waterpik looks and functions.  Having to replenish the water in the reservoir is not an issue for me at all.  If I had to stop the pik, take the reservoir off the base, turn on the water to fill it, secure the reservoir tightly back on the base, that would get old quickly.  Remember my tip about replenishing the water and you will love this waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED ON 2-14-08:  I still love this WaterPik.  Everything I said above continues to be true.  I just ordered this yesterday as a gift for someone and today I&#x27;m ordering it for someone else.  A really really good WaterPik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED ON 5-19-12: This water pik continues to go strong.

    <li> Waterpik is a great product, and my dental hygienist agrees that using one has made all the difference in the health of my teeth and gums.  I had to scrap my old one after my cat chewed through the little tube leading to the jet, and was very pleasantly surprised to discover that the design has been improved in several ways: (1) it has a smaller \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; which takes much less space on my bathroom counter; (2) it is significantly quieter, so I can now use it late at night without fear of disturbing the neighbors; (3) the little tube to the jet is now designed in such a manner that when you replace the jet in the bracket after use, the tube coils neatly and disappears into the body of the device (safe from little cat teeth); and (4) the whole device is more streamlined and attractive-looking.  Others have correctly noted that the well for holding water is not as large as in the older models, however I have not found this to be a problem, and it only takes a second to add more water if you need it.  Nice to see a product that has been intelligently redesigned!</li>
    <li> The overall appearance is a big improvement over previous waterpiks.  The water tank is more secure.  The handle is well designed.  The controls are easy to use.  Unfortunately, the most important feature of all is the water pressure, which is terrible.  You can get a stronger water jet from the waterpik hand held unit.  Why bother to have a pressure control if the top pressure isn&#x27;t very strong to start with?  Why under-power the most expensive model you sell?</li>
    <li> This water pick is great. It has attachements to clean the tounge even!  You can adjust the pressure from practiclly nothing to strong. Strongly reccomend</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to but on mine, the  button that stops the waterflow sticks when it goes over 4.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the complaints.  This waterpik works well for me and is very similar to the first one I had many years ago.  I&#x27;m pleased with it.  It great for cleaning diamond rings, too (on low).</li>
    <li> I recently replaced an older WaterPix with this new one. I like the new model much better.&lt;br /&gt;* It is much, much quieter than my old model.&lt;br /&gt;* The pressure control is more precise.&lt;br /&gt;* The device has an overall quality feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve had no problems with leaking, which some other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nit--the hose could be longer.</li>
    <li> When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I&#x27;d rate it 5 &#x3D; I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 &#x3D; I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating &#x3D; It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I feel that it has really helped me keep my teeth and gums clean and healthy. My dentist has stated that since I&#x27;ve started using my waterpic me gums are healthier and that it will help keep the teeth from getting cavities. If you struggle with your teeth get this product to help save your smile!</li>
    <li> Works Great, i have never never experienced such clean teeth.  I am going to get more for my family.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does a great job and is aesthetically  pleasing. Great investment in my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months now and it works great. It removes all particles left behind after brushing. Very east to use.  Also you can add mouthwash to this.  I recommend this product to everyone interested.</li>
    <li> I have used the previous version Waterpik 65W, eversince I bought it on March 2006, it quit working on Nov 28.  Immediately I ordered the Waterpik Ultra the same night.  I am so used to doing this jet thing every night, I couldnot be without.  I recieved Amazon packet(free standard shipping) arrived Nov 30 by 2pm.  Oh!, what a relief, I water jetted with this new thing just a few minutes ago - Vola..........They finally made it better.    Pros: Better overall features, right from fixing the jet piece, water tank, softer switches, speed control..  Hey they listened to previous blogs and this is a great improvement.  Also the cord and holder is much better.  overall the equipment is well rounded. Wait - the greatest thing is that this model is lot QUIETER than the previous one(now I wont wake my family up when I am doing waterpik late at night).    Cons:  Tank is small - had to fill it twice before having done ( i liked it so much, I did 5 tank fulls of jetting tonight).      Nice NIce Nice.... overall 4.5 out of 5.  Still room for improvement.  They have to find a way for the water tank to sit better without that little rubberized link under the tank.  That will be the Waterpik folks next challenge.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing, and I don&#x27;t do it regularly.  I tried everything from special soft, wide floss to those little disposable floss/pic combos.  I&#x27;d fall off the wagon after a couple of days and maybe floss three times a year.  I&#x27;ve recently been diagnosed as diabetic, so issues of dental hygeine and bleeding gums now take on a new importance.    This Waterpik is amazing.  I accidentally set it on \\&quot;10\\&quot; the first time I used it and learned the hard way (ouch!) that I probably should have followed the directions, which clearly suggest starting on a low setting and building up tolerance.  I reset it to \\&quot;5\\&quot;--it didn&#x27;t hurt and actually felt good. After the first use I could see a reduction in the plaque along my gum lines.  By the third use it didn&#x27;t hurt my gums anymore, and two weeks later my gums have stopped bleeding as much when I brush or use the Waterpik.  I&#x27;m guessing that in a couple of more weeks they&#x27;ll stop bleeding all together.      It&#x27;s a little messy to use, and I think it&#x27;s a design mistake to include 6 attachments but only have storage for 5 of them (1 in the handle and 4 spots in the resevoir lid).  These aren&#x27;t enough to cause me to drop it to four stars, however, because the ease of use and the results I&#x27;m already seeing have made this a very worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this item recently in hopes that I would no longer need to floss.  I was happy to find that the water pressure is so forceful that it felt like the water was scraping my teeth.  It made a few of my gums bleed and I only turned it to 4.  I promptly bought one for my father.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, Lowest price on the net, Thank You J&amp;R Music World. Would not hesitate to do business with them again !!!</li>
    <li> Great Product , I should of bought this 10 yrs ago. Ask yourself do I want healthier gums and less cavities? I wish I could afford to buy every family one of these. Just think of all the money you would save on dentist bills.</li>
    <li> My parents always have had a Waterpik and I thought I could just do with dental floss in my tiny apt.   Turns out that a Waterpik works so much better !! I am HAPPY with this product and use it EVERY DAY !</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It is a powerful little device that gets under my gums.  It has a dial on it that can be adjusted for comfort.  My son is 2 and has a mouth full of teeth and we have to hold him down to brush his teeth properly but he loves to let me water pick his teeth. I guess it tickles. I then let him use an electric toothbrush to finish up.  That is about all the needs for his little teeth</li>
    <li> We have used the water pic products for many years and this is the third model I&#x27;ve purchased---and it is by far the best one yet---I would highly recommend it to anyone who cares about dental hygene.   In fact I purchased two of them so we don&#x27;t have to share-----</li>
    <li> This Waterpik has attachments for everything - brushing, tongue cleaning, getting between the gumline and does a great job.  A must for dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> arrived before expected delivery date. this was a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased</li>
    <li> Bought it because my daughter just got braces.  This helps a lot.  Makes the nightly chore of brushing and flossing go a lot quicker - and she loves using it.  So do I.</li>
    <li> Great looking, excellent pressure controls, reasonable price, assortment of tips, just perfect water reservoir. Excellent system to complement your oral hygiene. Dislodges food particles that regular brushing leaves behind.  But, what good is it if all of these good features are opaqued by repeated leakage from a bad engineered handle? In the 6 months I have owned the waterpik it has become necessary to replace the handle 3 times.   This last time I was determined to figure out once and for all what the exact source of the problem is, so I dissected the failed handle and sure enough immediately becomes apparent the design flow and why is bound to leak and fail. There is an O ring loosely encased in a small plastic chamber in the hose assembly the O ring with not much to keep it in place soon becomes misaligned and disengages the water tip causing a major leak. Since that part is sealed there is no way to service it therefore the entire hose assembly must be replaced. The question is why the company has not come up with a new engineered handle that takes care of this and rather keeps supplying the failed units with handles that they know will fail too. Bottom line I do not recommend buying the Waterpik Ultra unless the handle assembly problem is corrected once and for all to prevent leakage, for me replacing handles every two months however free is not worth the frustration.</li>
    <li> Recieved this waterpik 3 weeks ago and now we can&#x27;t live without it! Its made a huge difference in the condition of my gums and the price was the lowest I&#x27;ve found. Highly recomended!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd water pik.  The first one i bought from my dentist for $98. and it took up half my vanity space and lasted 2 years.  I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;THis one is great, takes up less space, fits neatly in the corner of my vanity.  I love the curly cord that retracts.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the way it looks, it also is as good as my old one, or even better.  I don&#x27;t use all the attachements, but they are there if i want do.  Overall, i love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat...&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
    <li> good fur gums...fights blood pockets...should be used regularly tough, night&#x27;s hassle for lazyboys like me...</li>
    <li> I thought my original water pik was more powerful.  This one, although more compact, does not clean as well.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype.  Flossing is still required.  It does help with getting out food under the gum line, but you still need to floss between your teeth.  When you use the Waterpik for the first time your gums will bleed, but after a few days you get accustomed to the pressure.  The only other thing I dislike is the horrible noise of the pump.  I would have gladly paid twice the cost for something that doesn&#x27;t sound like a beat up dodge.  All in all, this is a nice additional tool in your arsenal of oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other dental irrigators and this is the best yet.  Great price and very compact.  Lots of accessories (not really needed though).  This is the best for the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to see fragments washed out of my mouth.  But I am also worrying how frequently it should be used.  Everyday? Every week?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the result. When possible, I use it after each meal. At my most recent dental appointment, the hygienist said she saw a great improvement in the condition of my gums. The Pik comes with an assortment of tools, but I use only the water pick tool. I&#x27;m not sure what the others are for.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist was very surprised with the great result after just two weeks of me using it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the new Waterpik.  My only complaint is that the reservoir is not big enough.  I end up filling it twice to get a good cleaning in my mouth.  Otherwise, it is so nice, quiet and easy to handle.  I like all the atachments that come with it also. Definitely recommend it for good oral hygeine.</li>
    <li> It is a nice way to floss if you have the counter space available in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is my third model Waterpik over the many years I&#x27;ve been a user. My last, old workhorse finally got a tiny crack in the water hose. Impossible to fix, and I was ready for a newer model anyway. The ultra has many improvements, easier shutoff button, nice variable force dial, curly hose that stores itself instantly. Not to mention the new attachments -- just choose the ones you need and put the rest away. You can&#x27;t beat the Waterpik for quick and thorough cleaning after eating, plus at bedtime before brushing. And Amazon saved me $9 compared to my local store&#x27;s full $59.99 price.</li>
    <li> It is great. On-time delivery.</li>
    <li> The only reason for the four and not five star is the first unit broke two days out of the box. The replacement worked fine. The product does what it says it does, and does it well. However using it as described in the instructions is a bit painful. Following the different instructions from my dentist make it much more comfortable. While it&#x27;s water hose is a bit thin making me ponder it&#x27;s life expectancy the unit seems durable. I would feel better if the dentist&#x27;s and the products manuals indicated the same manner of use. While using this product, teeth cleaning is a bit more messy, time consuming and scares the Kats, my teeth are in better condition.</li>
    <li> The water pik will definitely save you money the next time you visit your dentist.  After being told I had gum disease I bought this and I love it.  There is plenty of water in the tank for a good cleaning and it works great.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is a good one, pretty design and convenient handle with pause button. The only problem is my husband&#x27;s complaining about the water tank is too small for him. Overall, I like it!</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing!  quick and easy to use.  i had gone to the dentist prior to purchasing this and my gums had bled around every tooth (not terribly uncommon for a pregnant woman)  Four months later, after using the water pik i did not have a drop of blood from the gums (exceptionally rare for a pregnant woman).  The dentist was so impressed.      Even my husband who is too stubborn to floss loves using the waterpik. I have limited counter space and was worried about the footprint on the vanity - but this is really quite small.   cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This machine is significantly different from past machines.  The pump is much quieter and the water reservoir is protected by the nozzle holder.</li>
    <li> Everytime I&#x27;d go to the dentist my Hygienist would scold me for not flossing.  I was feeling so guilty about not flossing that I&#x27;d do it once in awhile, just so I could say \\&quot;yes I do!\\&quot; without lying to her.    One day she suggested a Waterpik Ultra system to try and so I googled it and decided to get one.  OMG!  Flossing isn&#x27;t fun, but using this Waterpik is!  I ate lunch, then brushed my teeth and then used the Waterpik and couldn&#x27;t believe how much food particles the toothbrush had left behind!  Flossing just removes food particles between the teeth but a Waterpik system removes the food inside, outside and inbetween. My teeth actually feel cleaner and my gums are in great shape as I use the jet spray to stimulate my gums and remove all particles that might be trapped under the gums as well.  The system is relatively quiet and it&#x27;s easy to use. I&#x27;ve told many friends and family members that they MUST get a Waterpik Ultra system. There&#x27;s nothing not to like about the Waterpik!  Sometimes I put a little Listerine into the water and I&#x27;m good to go!  I try to use my Waterpik in the morning and then again before I go to sleep.  I&#x27;m probably using it more than I need to but I honestly  like using it.</li>
    <li> This product is better than the vibrating \\&quot;dry\\&quot; units.  It does a really good job; we have used a couple of other models but we prefer this slighty larger model. Note: this model is intended to be used for a fixed location, which is fine for us.    So far the gums are returning to a very healthy state after all the dental work.      Mwb</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet is a tremendous product.  It fits in small places, yet handles several people with several different needs.  The various attachments make it so simple to go to specialty cleaning or another person in seconds.  The variable speed was a gum saver as I gradually work up to increased pressures.  I have NEVER been a consistant flosser, but this is both enjoyable and works better than floss ever could.</li>
    <li> I used to use toothpicks after meals to dislodge food stuck between my teeth.  But now this not only works for that purpose but also strengthens my gums.    I can actually feel a difference after a couple of months of usage as my gums don&#x27;t bleed while flossing.    My only gripe is that the water tank is really small.  I would have preferred if it was at least double the capacity.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product. It does a good job of dislodging trapped particles. A good supplement to an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We are very disappointed with this device. We bought it only a few months ago and have been using it regularly, two adults, once a day, but recently the top bit of the handle started to leak big time and the waterpik has since become unusable. This is very disappointing. We are going to have to trash it and find an alternative product. Personally I find it simply scandalous to market such rubbish products. Yet another consequence of nonsensical outsourcing and frenetic globalization. I&#x27;d much rather spend twice the price for a reliable product, rather than one that lasts four months and will end up polluting the planet a bit more.</li>
    <li> for those of us who have dental work like a brige this unit is a must!  it will clean and help eliminate bad breath!  It works just like everyone claims.</li>
    <li> I had an older model 15 years ago and more recently a portable version and this WaterPik is the best of them all.  I almost didn&#x27;t purchase it because of some of the reviews here, but I am glad I took a chance.    The product itself is a great way to get a clean feeling and I find it much easier than flossing.  Add a splash of mouthwash periodically to clean the hoses and give an extra clean washing.      Some of the complaints I read were that the on/off button is not able to be used one handed, which I did not find to be the case.  The variable pressure setting was also easy to use.  The piks rotate easily to control the location and I&#x27;ve never onced pressed the release buttom for the tip inadvertently.  I also find the changes with a smaller footprint, quieter opperation, and cover to all be improvements.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works as advertised. I&#x27;ve been using it a month and love it. Take your time increasing the settings as this thing can produce some pretty large pressures. Even directly after brushing my teeth I&#x27;m amazed to see lit food bits this thing finds and removes.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Like this product alot. Water Pik has improved the product over the previous versions.   This is what I like about the new one:  Easy removal/replacement of the reservoir  Easy removal/replacement of the cleaning attachments  Quieter than previous units.  Smaller footprint than previous units.  Convenient storage cover for attachments.  What I dont like:  Same flimsy hose, appears difficult to replace if/when needed.</li>
    <li> this is a replacement for my very old water pik.  This one has a smaller water reservoir, but just big enough to do the job.  It takes up a smaller foot print on the counter.  I am very pleased and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and like it very much except I think the water line should be longer so you wouldn&#x27;t have to set it so close to the sink. Other than that it is a great working little quiet machine.I had a Interplak before and it was very loud but did have a longer water line.</li>
    <li> It truly is an excellent product.  I haven&#x27;t owned a Water Pik for a few years.  This one is quiet, very powerful, doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter and the hose is plenty long enough.  Storage tray on top of the reservoir is another great idea.  I&#x27;ve only used 2 of the attachments and they both worked fine.  If you are considering buying one, this is the one to buy!</li>
    <li> Just went to the dentist today for a cleaning and all I can say is that this flosser was well worth my money. I don&#x27;t have time to ever floss (especially with braces)and this helps a lot. Plus a good tip from my hygienist that said that it couldn&#x27;t hurt to add mouthwash along with water to floss also.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. It&#x27;s a little loud, but that&#x27;s a minor menace compared to having clean gums...and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Have used the simple waterpik for over 40 years.  Last one lasted 14 years.  The new ultra has a cord that pinches and cuts off the water supply, replaced with new one.  Power has gone down considerably after 2 years.  Not the same quality.</li>
    <li> Really great product. I bought this for my dad, who had some gum problems because he couldn&#x27;t keep his back teeth clean with flossing and brushing. The high pressure irrigation really helped him clean out the deep pockets that he had around his molars. Highly recommend this product for those that wear braces or have gum disease.</li>
    <li> Its nice. I like it to use it. Its messy on the beginning but once you figure it out its not as bad. After 2 weeks of using it I notice its loosing its power. I will see if it will go much more less I will get it replaced and see will it work better</li>
    <li> I had a old water pic for over 30 years. Liked it then, love it now! It works great. I had some bleeding, but with floss and the water pic my denist said my teeth look great and I am 60 years old! It also looks nice in my blue bathroom.</li>
    <li> a little bit noisy but very powerful and the large reservoir of water allows me to clean all of my teeth with a single fill. I still recomend flossing, though this is very effective at removing debrsi, especially for those who have braces or permanent retainers. adding a splash of mouthwash  in is another great way to ensure a clean healthy mouth.</li>
    <li> Works! I had an old one, but I like this one better. I use it, everyday, to protect against perodontal diesease, anything to save your teeth! You won&#x27;t miss them, until their gone!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this and its great to get a deep cleanse in your teeth, i went back to geta cleaning and the dentist said i didn&#x27;t event need one :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Water pressure.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one of these when I wore braces, in 2011.  It lasted four years before springing a leak in the tubing and needing to be replaced.  So this is the 2nd time I bought this particular Waterpik model, even though I&#x27;ve had my braces off for years.  I just like the way it cleans those hard-to-reach spots.  Note that the plastic water tank is tinted blue.  The first one I bought was tinted grayish-brown, but everything else on the model is the same.</li>
    <li> Would of given it 5 if it had more pressure.</li>
    <li> Unit lost pressure after minimal use, very disappointed in quality . Have had other waterpik products and never had a problem .</li>
    <li> Works great fast delivery</li>
    <li> The product exceeded my expectations. It has extra attachments that I hadn&#x27;t had on previous Waterpik products. It works very well.</li>
    <li> Water Pik is well known for developing breaks in the white tubing. The unit only lasts 2 years until the tubing breaks, making it unusable. Replacing the tubing is too difficult. When new, it is fine and I love it, but it is costly to replace every 2 years. I think the short tubing life is their gimmick to sell more.</li>
    <li> I have replaced my old one with this new one and it works great.  Looks good and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;pik\\&quot; works great.  No problems; neat, clean and easy to use.  I just wish they would have included 2 basic attachments instead of one only, with all the extra wierd attachments that never get used.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says and does it fairly well.  I would have no problem recommending this product to someone.  It should last a long time provided you take care of it and handle it wisely.  No regrets on this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use it once a day and it has done wonders for my gums because it cleans out very successfully between the teeth and also stimulates the gums.</li>
    <li> Small, nice holding case, got it for my daughter, who has braces, she loves it. Easy to use. The pump is a bit louder than expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at the recommendation of my son&#x27;s orthodontist.  Boy and I glad I did!  My son, like many other children, hates to brush his teeth, and floss?!?  What is that right?  Well my son got his braces on and has used this product for a while now; it is so evident that it works by the particles that spill out of his mouth after using it.  It did take a while for him to get used to spraying water in his mouth without it spraying all over the place, but the learning curve was short lived.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone, but especially for individuals with braces.</li>
    <li> My husband and I bought this for ourselves so we would not need wax floss.  Our teeth feel great after cleaning them with this flosser.</li>
    <li> Tubing too short and too rigid could cause waterpik tubing to break or the waterpik to fall and break. Otherwise OK</li>
    <li> I love the Waterpik Flosser. It is very easy to use.  I use it everyday and it really works.  I wish I could have it long time ago.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra was everything I expected it to be. Very easy to set up, use then clean and put away.</li>
    <li> For a long time, I had been hesitant to add a Waterpik to my daily regimen for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I am a neat freak, and I don&#x27;t like clutter on my bathroom counter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I feared a watery mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first removed this from the box, my fears were not at all quelled.  In fact, I was disheartened upon finding many tiny loose attachments.  I was further dismayed at what seemed to be an appliance with three ill-fitting parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally assembled and placed the unit on my counter, I felt much better.  It is a neat, compact unit, and the cord is not too long that it gets in the way. The unit can easily be lifted from the base when cleaning the counter.  The nozzle fits nicely into its holster.  The attachments are all hidden within a clamshell that sits on top of the unit.  This is a good thing, because most people would ever use only two or three of the included attachments.  Incidentally, if I have a complaint, it is that there are not enough slots within the clamshell to fit all of the attachments, although all can fit inside if one sits loosely on top of the others and one is being used.  (Any reasonable person would keep at least one attachment locked into the nozzle at all times.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I had a bit of a mess, but I quickly learned that the water-flow could be easily stopped temporarily by depressing a button on the nozzle.  The water pressure can also be adjusted via a dial on the unit itself, so, for example, you can use the highest setting for flossing and a lower setting for cleaning the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how well does it work?  Honestly, my mouth feels amazing.  I have not eliminated regular flossing from my regimen, but this gets my mouth cleaner than brushing and flossing alone.  It removes food particles, plaque, and even toothpaste residue from between my teeth and along the gumline, leaving my mouth feeling clean and fresh.  It is really surprising how much is missed by simple brushing, flossing and rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is a neat and compact little unit that has become an important part of my oral care regimen.  It was well worth the money, and it is well worth the few extra minutes every day.rushing, flossing and rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is a neat and compact little unit that has become an important part of my oral care regimen.  It was well worth the money, and it is well worth the few extra minutes every day.</li>
    <li> The dentist said to buy it. People plagued by plaque will find this an easy way to remove it and save their teeth.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best Flosser you can buy, IT really does the trick If you eat some thing like Bran Flakes or Raisin Bran any thing that wants to stay between your teeth this will get rid of all traces of food. I highly Recommend this Flosser...</li>
    <li> This Water Flosser is operated under electrical voltage of 110V ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;This piece of important information can hardly be found at the bottow of the flosser, and can only be visible by using a magnifying glass.  This appliance is not suitable to be used outside USA.  Hazardous results like causing electric shock, short-circuit or even fire may happen.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik does an amazing job of cleaning/refreshing your mouth. I put a capful of my mouthwash in the water tank as well (use warm water). Easy to clean, the top caddy hold 5 different cleaning picks for your teeth and massaging your gums. Had this unit for 4 years, still works great. Even my dental hygienist mentioned how much better I could get the plaque off my teeth.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, as recommended by our dentist, is every bit as good as they claim. It works exactly as published and the water pressure is consistent and does the job well. Internet pricing was a little better than discount chain drug stores, but some offer coupons. Vendor processed the order and sent it on time and delivery was as promised.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean. It&#x27;s like going to the dentist and having your teeth cleaned every day. Now, I can&#x27;t even imagine JUST brushing. We now have 5 of these - one for each in the family. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> GREAT product. It is helping me to keep my teeth! Heal my gum disease. I had a problem with the holder breaking. I phoned the company and they send another one with no charges at all. How can you do better than that?!</li>
    <li> The reviews I read on this site encouraged me to upgrade and new units are quieter, water tank makes sense unless you leave it in there too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand-by button is great for getting the flow and temp of water right cause the units always hold some water in the pipes before it clears out and you can ease the tips into ur mouth much easier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snap in tips are a great feature.</li>
    <li> It does the job and it convenient to use. I also like the different heads for different uses. Timely delivery and price.</li>
    <li> This flosser is very messy.  Water runs all over when using it.  Be sure to be over a sink and place a towel around the edge, for water runs down your arm and side of your face.  Otherwise, it does a good job.</li>
    <li> The pressure is perfect on this. If it were any stronger, I imagine you&#x27;d quickly wear out your crowns and such. As it is, I like mixing a little Listerine or other mouthwash in there to help clean. The tongue cleaner should be classified as torture though.</li>
    <li> I was a bit cautious at first, but the product is better than expected! There are many different extensions and power settings to get your preferred level of satisfaction. It works great to remove the debris between your teeth, and there will be NO need to use traditional floss anymore!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd waterpik I&#x27;ve had and there is something wrong with it.  The water jet dosen&#x27;t have the force of the previous 2 that I&#x27;ve owned.  The dial to adjust the force of the water goes from 1-10. In the first two I would set the dial around 5-6 and that gave plenty of water pressure.  On this one I set it at the highest level, i.e., 10 and it feels as if I have it on 3. I called the 800 number of waterpik and told them of the above.  The gal that I talked to was rude, nonresponsive to my concerns as if I were an idiot.  She instructed me to perform a certain task, which I had already done per the instructions that came with the waterpik, and when I repeated the instructions the waterpik still didn&#x27;t perform up to the standards of the first two.</li>
    <li> Had a for a little over a year.  Got with the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 to address husband&#x27;s gum issues.  Worked great and gave noticeable improvement in just a couple of months.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s started to have problems with clogging.  Hoping it will last a while longer because it is an expensive item.</li>
    <li> First up, this is available for international shipping to India, and it was delivered in 4 days even though I had selected the cheaper 8 day delivery option. So great work Amazon. Downside I had to pay $23 shipping and another $19 for custom for a $46 product, how unfair and I don&#x27;t have a customs clearance receipt that tells me what did Amazon pay to the customs.&lt;br /&gt;For people in India you have to use it with a step down 220 to 110V adaptor which is easily available, might want to plug the adapter to a voltage stabilizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works well, I do wish at 10 setting it could be a more but more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at 4 right from day one and it was comfortable as I have a few crowns, between those I use it at 10 to remove lodge food particle.&lt;br /&gt;The waterpick faces a challenge with cucumber or chicken bit, so first I floss that take the major bits out then use the waterpik to clean out the gaps. Unlike the instruction that recommend using the waterpik prior to floss and brush, I would suggest floss first then use the waterpik and finally brush.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, clean up.  It is quiet.  There is an attachment for about every possible use.  I recommend this particular waterpick.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel clean after using.  I don&#x27;t have room on my counter otherwise I would use it more.  Was delivered in the time promised.</li>
    <li> This is the fifth Waterpik I purchased. I think the quality getting worse. The noise is so loud, my ears cannot stand.</li>
    <li> Compare this with Philips&#x27; Air Floss, I found the Waterpik gave more thorough cleaning but a little bite messier. I like Waterpik better.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my husband and he loves it.  It makes a huge difference in cleaning his teeth and better than flossing..</li>
    <li> Works great, wish I bought one years ago&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be sturdy, nice to have other attachments&lt;br /&gt;No negatives yet</li>
    <li> I might have like it to be in the off position and holding the button turns it on, but instead it is in the on position and pushing the button on the handheld turns it off.  But it&#x27;s still a great product, and I like how the cord twists itself neatly while being stored.</li>
    <li> Does a great job but loud and messy. I guess it takes some practice to use effectively but boy should you have seen the additional food particles that were dislodged by the Waterpik that my brushing missed.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I start using a water pik due to the fact that I have some crooked teeth and they tend to catch plaque that is hard to get at. I used it the first time and then brushed and I could not believe hoe much better my mouth felt! I have had serious gum surgery and it just made my gums and teeth feel so much cleaner and healthier!!</li>
    <li> FEELS ALOT CLEANER, REALLY LIKE IT, THE WHOLE FAMILY AGREES, FEELS LIKE A DENTAL CLEANING, TEETH WILL STAY CLEANER LONGER</li>
    <li> At first,I did hesitated and wonder if this Waterpik will work.&lt;br /&gt;But I made dicision to buy it because almost reviews said it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;And when I got it and try,your can feel at the moment that your mouth is cleaner as it ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should try too^_^&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i received my waterpik promptly, and use it every day . it really does the job. cleans very well and the pressure is awesome, however you can adjust it if it is too strong for you.</li>
    <li> I love these things, until they leak. The hose cracked on the first three. On the fourth, water poured out of the unit itself, which is not very comforting for an electrical device. I&#x27;m going to give Waterpiks a last (5th!) try.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and working great since it arrived about a month ago.  Used daily by both my husband and I.  Very good puchase</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works great.  I was very satisfied with the first one purchased through Amazon about three years ago.  The tube going from the tank to the handle eventually developed a crack and leak.  This tube is somewhat ridged to facilitate the coil for storage.  However, the constant motion and this lack of flexibility caused the leak.  Still a very good product for the price. I recently bought the same product as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I picked up one of these recently and this thign blew my socks off! I&#x27;m accustomed to hte normal dental floss routine as most of us, but this trumps it in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use max setting on mine and it shoots a strong steady stream of water. I took a minute or two to pik my entire mouth and then broke out the old dental floss. Not a single piece of debris was to be found. The other attachments are equally as impressive, especially the tongue cleaner and the gum pocket cleaner. The gum pocket cleaner worked my gums over good. They actually bled the first time but after that, just a nice deep clean and massage. I could feel the water getting under my gums and washing them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll keep this short and say, YES, it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s weight in Gold. I&#x27;ll never go back to dental floss again. This does a much more thorough job in the same amount of time.</li>
    <li> Works great cleans your gums . It&#x27;s not pretty but it&#x27;s what u need to keep your gums clean and stay away from your dentist.:)</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I use a waterpik. This model works very good, the various speeds allow you to start out using lower speeds and gradually increase as your gums start to heal. This model is easy to use and fill. The assortment of tips is very good and you can store them in the top of the unit. Also has a great 3 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  And including it in my morning routine actually made it easier and more efficient; takes less time and effort than traditional flossing and feels so much better.  If this saves me a trip to the dentist even once, it is worth it 10x over!</li>
    <li> I have been using it every night since purchasing it - the water pressure is still very good - no complaints!</li>
    <li> Order the product but didn&#x27;t work due to power supply difference (was not stated when buying product) sent back for refund which cost more the the product was better off not sending the product back.</li>
    <li> I recomend this item. It works perfectly!!&lt;br /&gt;It cleans your teeth deeply and is very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of options for different types of purpurar surprised me!</li>
    <li> I am happy with Water Pik Ultra Flosser - it comes with more attachments than I have used but those I have used are good. You definitely need the reservoir to complete cleaning of your whole mouth so I am glad I did not settle for the reservoir on the brush itself. You really do need to warm the water, and to run it a little to clear out the hose before you use it. Getting cold water on your gums is horrible.  I was concerned that it would take up space on the vanity but it does tuck away into a corner and so has not been a problem. So overall very happy with my choice and the price via Amazon was excellent compared to retail.</li>
    <li> Just what the dental hygienist ordered.  Brushing and normal flossing still leaves a lot of debris in the gums and teeth.  This product gets that stuff out.</li>
    <li> I do not know what some of the other reviewers are talking about.  My Waterpik  has a strong pump and gets all material around teeth out!  I had to turn mine down it is so strong,  Far as running out of water before the job is done...  What Water  flosser  are they comparing it to and how many ounces of water does that machine hold..  I don&#x27;t need to spend the entire  morning water flossing.  This machine has ample water storage to get the job completely done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had more than one water flosser in my life and this is as good as the original one I bought 25 years ago.  You may remember it as the teledyne waterpik.  I have also bought the bargain brands such as the ones at Wally World, They do not compare.... As far as the accessories goes you get quite a few, I personally do not use them...  A tongue cleaner??? etc....  but if you like it go for it!  They have quite a curious assortment....  Build quality is good.  Functionality is very good.  You can probably pay more for one of these but I doubt you will get one to do the job at hand better.  Buy it you will like it!</li>
    <li> My wife uses every day she loves it</li>
    <li> try a lot of other product and this one work the best, my teeth never been more cleaner, lover it</li>
    <li> maybe i wasn&#x27;t using this properly but it was getting water all over my counter top.  worst of all, i wasn&#x27;t really seeing a benefit in using the floss, my teeth did not feel any cleaner.  i&#x27;ll just stick to conventional flossing and an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Really helps keep food from sticking between teeth and is very easy to use.  My sister recommended it and I was very happy that she did.</li>
    <li> We all LOVE it. Our little one has a hard time brushing (2 years old) even with us brushing for our little one its hard to get a good clean because holding still is hard at 2 and we don&#x27;t want to push to hard and hurt the gums. Using the Waterpik is so much fun. On the lowest setting with the toothbrush head works amazing! Our oldest loathes flossing, but with this it&#x27;s not a a chore. Make sure you try this out before handing it to your kids. The highest setting can be intense and their little gums are to sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;the only warning I would have is make sure you&#x27;re over the sink and don&#x27;t let the water accumulate in your mouth until its spewing out.</li>
    <li> After using this flosser for approximately three months, I had my semi-annual dental check up and the dental technicians were amazed at the health on my gums, which is the &amp;#34;proof in the pudding&amp;#34; that the flosser is doing its job in reducing/preventing future dental problems.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the larger well as I had been using the travel size and had to fill it twice.  I haven&#x27;t tried to use all the head bits yet, but they look interesting with brushes.  The top of the well is a little hard to get off; I guess it will loosen up eventually.  I like the coiled cord so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way.  I use 1/2 hydrogen peroxide and 1/2 water per my dentist.  I found peroxide for $1 a bottle at Kroger which makes it not too expensive to use.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like this water flosser.  It works well and hope it will for a long time. The size is small enough that it does not occupy much space on my bathroom sink countertop. So far I have only been using the general purpose tip at the lowest setting. The pump is kind of noisy when turned on but you will be using it only for just 5 minutes or less so it is not a major issue. The instructions stated not to use it for more than 5 minutes during a 2 hour interval. I like using the pause button to stop the jet stream of warm water whenever I need to adjust to which specific site or tooth I would like to aim at.</li>
    <li> I love this product, It is something that I would recommend to anyone. You would not regret after trying this.</li>
    <li> This is a great compact water pik.  Has many heads , functions well. serves its purpose.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product - its easy to use and feels really good while cleaning. Most importantly, makes your teeth actually FEEL clean</li>
    <li> Everything I was hoping for, and then some. Plenty of pressure and a great selection of accessaries. If you are in the market, this is the one.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning out the food that gets stuck between my braces. Plenty of pressure and volume. I really only use the one tip.</li>
    <li> Love it. Absolutely does what it says. More tips tben expected, neat look on countertop and easy to use. Definitely reccomend.</li>
    <li> Not as much pressure as the older units which this one replaced.  The reservoir is also a bit smaller then the older ones, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik in a row, and I&#x27;m back because it does a home/professional job at keeping your teeth and gums healthy between dental visits. Easy to use. Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it. Have used it often with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;My kid likes it too. Bonus.</li>
    <li> Took the stains off my teeth, excellent for in between cleanings, my hygenist has noticed a great improvement in my plaque build up</li>
    <li> My teeth never felt so great....good buy....it makes my teeth feel so clean....I would buy one for everyone in your family</li>
    <li> My son has had great difficulty keeping his teeth free of &amp;#34;hard to manage&amp;#34; food particles while wearing braces. I was told to get him a water pick. This thing has been AMAZING for his teeth/gums. He actually likes cleaning his teeth now. Of course, you still have to brush after using this, but his gums no longer bleed while brushing! I highly recommend this pik for anyone with braces!</li>
    <li> Because of big gaps between my teeth, the&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser cleaned the food pieces out better than string floss.</li>
    <li> I never used a water flosser before, so I cant really compare the quality of the product with any other. However, I do know that as soon as you use Waterpik, you feel like it opens your senses to realize what the words ORAL HYGIENE really mean, as opposed to just brushing and flossing. From the very first time you use it, you feel a wonderful difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the tips are great and easy to use, and the water pressure regulator its perfect, the lowest setting is really soft (it helped me when I got my four wisdom teeth taken out), and the highest setting is REALLY REALLY strong, Im talking makes-your-gums-bleed strong---I usually use it on the #5 setting (it goes up to 10). That just goes to show how powerful the machine really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this product regularly for about a year now, and its been holding up wonderfully. Now I am planning on getting braces, so It will be even more vital for me and my oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the cleanliness and the versatility you get is beyond words---I absolutely love my waterpik!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star. Bought to replace a previous Waterpik, used it 2 days then it died. Called customer service where I was told to plug it in either a bedroom or living room, and it worked there. The rep informed me that it doesn&#x27;t work well with GFCI outlets!?  That the noise is too much, but I could buy a &#x27;single outlet surge protector&#x27;, which she said they&#x27;d just rec&#x27;d training on, and only cost $2.68 I didn&#x27;t (still don&#x27;t) understand why a surge protector would help, but I did go to lowes and ask if they had them. Nope. Tried online, they aren&#x27;t $2.68, much more, and I&#x27;m not sure that even that would help. The rep also said I would be stuck with it and not able to use their products!  Well I returned it to Amazon since I can&#x27;t use it in my bedroom!  I bought a Quick Breeze Oral Irrigator for $29.99. Made much better, works flawlessly, and no messy, bulky junk on my vanity top!  Customer service is a joke with this company, the product is flawed if it won&#x27;t work with a GFCI, and I do not have to be &#x27;stuck with it&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I did not expect such efficiency&lt;br /&gt;I and my wife are loving use the Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;is ideal for cleaning our tooth implants</li>
    <li> I began using a water pik when I had braces. I was 40...ish...&lt;br /&gt;and felt an obligation to safe guard the investment of care&lt;br /&gt;from dentists who worked to amend years of neglect and&lt;br /&gt;compromise. Anything that was recommended... I adopted.&lt;br /&gt;This was one of those items. How effective? At cleanings...&lt;br /&gt;there isn&#x27;t anything to do... and this generation of &amp;#34;power&lt;br /&gt;washer&amp;#34; has heads adapted to specific needs. Braces,&lt;br /&gt;veneers, implants, crowns... no popcorn shell stands a&lt;br /&gt;chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would that I had known about it sooner rather than later.&lt;br /&gt;It is never too late....</li>
    <li> This one was recommended by my dentist and I am glad I listened.  Works great, sometimes too great.  Start out with force low until your gums get used to it.</li>
    <li> A major upgrade from the battery operated model.</li>
    <li> I am a total waterpik convert.  It has really improved my gums.  The only thing I have against it, is it is hard to clean out the line going to the water pik, which can get a moldy taste in it.</li>
    <li> This appliance works well to floss your teeth and is easy to use.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easier way to floss.</li>
    <li> pro: easy to set up and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: tank is too small. the lower settings are too weak to really \\&quot;floss\\&quot; your teeth, they only flood your teeth with water. but at the higher settings, where the spray actually does the job of \\&quot;flossing,\\&quot; the tank runs out of water too quickly and you have to stop and take out the tank again and fill it up. i&#x27;ve used it only a few days and there&#x27;s already a strange noise developing. we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. also, it is cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected - good quality with various attachments...highly recommend this.  Easy to operate and works well.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very efficient and arrived on time. Lots of power.</li>
    <li> I received this Waterpik in December 2012 and I&#x27;ve been nothing short of amazed since I started using it. It&#x27;s been 15 months and it&#x27;s still running perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use hot tap water.&lt;br /&gt;The steps I follow are: Brush, rinse (water), floss, rinse (water), waterpik, rinse (mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;I drain all the water every time I use it: Remove the tank and dump it; while the tank is off I put the tip below the height of the unit to allow all the water to drip out. It only takes 20 seconds and keeps the unit from having a science experiment growing in it. I have not run anything through it to clean it but I detect no smells or other signs of any growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I used it to now: I shudder thinking how much food is left in my teeth after brushing, flossing and rinsing. I joke that I could feed a small third world country with the food particles waterpik&#x27;ed out of my teeth. It&#x27;s disgusting yet sobering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing a review now because I had a tooth removed three days ago. Hesitant to use a brush yet on the socket I decided to use this waterpik on the lowest setting from the opposite side of my mouth. Sure enough: the socket was starting to become a collection pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool has been beneficial in the prevention of who knows how many potential problems. I highly recommend this item to EVERYONE. I have reaped the benefits of the cleanest possible teeth, yet have experienced zero side effects from it&#x27;s use. This one is darn near a required purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based upon it being a best seller and it does not disappoint. The ease of usage is excellent and the pressure really does the job. Great buy at $45.</li>
    <li> Or you can floss your teeth, I suppose. Not sure if it&#x27;s the best. But it&#x27;s easier and quicker than flossing, and gets out the stuff in between. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I bought it on 2/5/2012 and today it died. It has been working very well, but it died so early.&lt;br /&gt;updated on 6/23.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I made a mistake. The machine is OK. The fact is that the protective function of my wall socket worked when I turned off the machine</li>
    <li> This is the best Waterpik our family have owned.  We have been using Waterpiks for many years and this is about the 6th one we have purchased.  The new design is more compact, much quieter and has several different heads included.  This one is much improved over the older model!!!</li>
    <li> When I first tried a Waterpik, I had no idea what I was doing and got water everywhere. I convinced myself that they were worthless and ineffective. Months later, after reading about how great the Waterpik was, I decided to try it again. Best decision I ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing braces has always been a pain when it comes to flossing. The Waterpik claims to be more effective, and I&#x27;m not really sure if it is. But one thing I do know is that it&#x27;s much faster and easier than spending a half hour in front of the mirror flossing my upper teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure options are numerous and anyone will find their perfect number. I started out at 2.5 a couple months ago, and now I&#x27;m at 4. Piece of advice: don&#x27;t set the pressure too high or you will &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; your gums up too high and damage them. If you&#x27;re not sure about what number you should be using, always go lower and slowly work your way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine comes six different tips you can use. I&#x27;ve only tried out two of them, the standard tip and the one for if you have braces. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference using the tip for braces. The recommended use for most of the tips is 3 months, but I&#x27;m sure you could go 6 or even 12 if you clean it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets about this purchase. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just tried out my new Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  It is wonderful.  It is more compact than the last model I had.  There is such a large variation of water speeds.  It also can be stopped in mid-stream (doesn&#x27;t everyone with they could do that, too).  There are six tip types. The tongue scraper does not come with the machine but can be purchased separately if so desired.  I have turned gum disease completely around with the use of a Waterpik product.  Even if I floss after eating, I use the Waterpik and remove even more lodged food.  Feels great after use.  Just remember to follow the directions.  Too much pressure is not good for your teeth or mouth.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I really like the cleaning my teeth, gums &amp; mouth receive every time I use the Waterpik. My only complaints is that it feels like it is cheaply made &amp; the waterpik hose could be a bit longer. It rocks to use a waterpik. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because, it&#x60;s a great product, that I use at least once a day, and I&#x60;m very happy with it! I wonder why I didn&#x60;t get one before.</li>
    <li> I had been using an older model of the Waterpik Dental Water Jet for many years, so I anticipated liking the newer model.  The new model met my expectations.  It is practical and looks nice.  This model has much power and a full range of water pressure so the whole family can find settings that work for them.</li>
    <li> Bought this 2 years ago and still working good. I use it this with regular flossing twice daily. It has really helped my gums and keep my teeth cleaner. I was so happy with it I bought another one also, the portable version which is good too.</li>
    <li> Had it for 2 months and loved it while it lasted. After about 2 months of daily use, the handle-bar started leaking dropping the tip-pressure by a significant amount. It was basically useless after the leak. I never used any additives in the water while usig waterpik. So the leak is not caused by mouthwash as was suggested in another review. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyways I took it back to the store as it was within the return period. Not sure if I will get another one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It seems a little messy as water runs from the hose down your arms. My biggest complaint tho, is that the on /off switch need to be on the handle, not on the side of the appliance.  The tank isn&#x27;t very large, sometimes have to fill it twice but it does do an excellent job of cleaning my bridge,which is why I got it in the first place. It cleans out stuff that even the needle like appliance with floss the dentist gave me doesn&#x27;t touch.</li>
    <li> Great price, great delivery, and works much better than my old water pic.</li>
    <li> I have used a Water Pik intermittently for decades; in fact, I used the same one over the years. At one point, it was on the shelf in storage for some years and I literally nearly lost my teeth in the dentist&#x27;s chair due to gum disease.  I took out the Water Pik, bought new Pik Pockets (gingival attachments), and went to work.  Adding a few drops of tea tree oil to the water each time, along with appropriate rinses, I was able to reverse the gum disease and save my teeth.  My dentist was absolutely amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated to upgrade to the new model because it seems to get mixed reviews, but eventually I broke the handle on my old one.  I ordered this model through Amazon and it has been fantastic.  It runs quietly, takes up less counter space and weighs less than the older model.  It has a tip release feature that helps protect against breakage.  You must take care to insert the tip properly with each use, or it will leak, but I&#x27;ve had no malfunctions with mine.  It also has a pause button under your thumb, which is a huge improvement functionally.  I love mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -- I was initially disappointed in 2008 when my Water Pik began to leak from the connect point between Pik Pocket and machine.  Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the Pik Pocket was cracked on its connector part, so I threw it away and inserted a new one.  Works just fine now!  Simple solution.</li>
    <li> This works really well if you have crowns or orthodontic devices on your teeth to clean out the gunk.  The dentist has been recommending this for years, and we are glad we finally purchased it.  Got to keep those teeth healthy!</li>
    <li> Replaced a 15-year old Viajet irrigator with this - same performance, vastly improved design and features. This (and the sonicare) turn brushing from a chore into a visit to the spa. My teeth love me, my gums love me, my dentist is losing business. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DO NOT try cheaper brands. You&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> One gripe is that the water tank is a little smaller than I would have preferred and runs out before I am totally done. However, this is the price to pay for the applicance being on the smaller side and attractive looking in the bathroom.  Basically, it&#x27;s enough to get the job done and you can refill if you need another round. I generally put a touch a Listerine into the tank to give the water that refreshing tingle. My second gripe is that the water pick head comes loose because of the huge release button where you hold it. This is weired when you you in the middle of a session. The pressure adjustments are great because you will need to start on the light settings and build up so you gums don&#x27;t bleed to much. This thing is powerful and works as described. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one for the weekend house because I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> For some time I had discomfort in my lower gums. Visits to the dentist showed that food was lodged between my teeth. He suggested an electric toothbrush but I resisted that. Finally I decided I would try a Waterpic and bought this WP-100. From the start, my discomfort ceased. I noted the food particles that came loose as I was using the pic. For three weeks now I have had no discomfort. I use it after brushing my teeth before bed-time and occasionally during the day.  &lt;br /&gt;         It took me a few days to learn how to use it without squirting water away from the sink, but it was worth the effort. It has ten pressure settings, and I used the first a few days and find that I don&#x27;t need more than the second setting. Furthermore, the unit is compact and attractive. The price was right, especially since I bought it at a store with a 20% discount coupon.</li>
    <li> ....but I love this Waterpik!  I cant begin to explain how much I hated flossing, it was just so painful and hard, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, lucky for me, I was on amazon one night and I checked out my GoldBox and I saw the Waterpik WP-100 on sale for $39.99.  I couldn&#x27;t pass up this great offer, and honestly, I never heard of a Waterpik until that night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is amazing, it gets a lot done in my mouth and leaves a refreshing feeling.  Im so glad I made this purchase and hope that if you are considering this item, please don&#x27;t hesitate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder its on the Top Ten Best Sellers list!</li>
    <li> This unit is compact with a handy accessory containing top.  The down side is that it holds less water than a full size but has a water flow control on the handle that stops water flow to the pik until needed.  This saves water and makes up for the units smaller volume.  Comes with a number of accessories some of which I do not use such as tongue cleaning tips.  If you use them your ahead of the game if not, there is only so much room in the storage top and not all the tips will fit.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This is at least our fifth waterpik water flosser over a period of about thirty years so we obviously like them.  This &amp;#34;newest&amp;#34; version is, however, a big improvement in all its &amp;#34;mechanicals&amp;#34; - the on-off switch, the tool-insertion and release method, the &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; gauge and the tool storage methods are all improved over our previous (five year old) one.  Our only caveat is that the water container has been slightly reduced in size, and (for us) needs refilling for a complete flossing - others, however, may not use as much water as we do.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot vouch for its&#x27; longevity as we have only had this for a month.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended by us.</li>
    <li> It seems a little cheap, and is smaller than the one my parents had years ago, but it works great so far. I am happy with it. Shipping was fast also.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik WP-100 that I received was defective.  The watertank only went down to one-half and the remaining water was not able to be used.  Also, the lightest setting, for caps, braces, etc., was still too strong.  I really would like to find an oral irrigator that has a very mild setting.</li>
    <li> Works great. The size is good as well -- fits perfectly on my small sink top. Design and craftsmanship is overall good. Love the tip storage tray which doubles as a cover. The only thing that preplexes me is that it comes with an extravagant number of tongue scrapers (do you really need so many?) and no place in the tray to keep them. Another small design flow, however minor, is that the gudget is fairly light when the tank is half empty and sometimes tips over if you you pull on a coil too much. The coil could be a little longer too. I am 6&#x27; tall and have to bend too much down in order not to pull too much.</li>
    <li> Just a great product. It is my 3rd Waterpik water jet and by far the best. Can&#x27;t think of any feature(s) I would change or add.</li>
    <li> After using my Water Pik for one week, there is a major noticeable improvement in the health of my gums. I used this product twice a day for one week and I no longer have any bleeding of my gums. I use 1 capfull of mouth wash in the water reservoir and my teeth and gums feel refreshed and healthier. I strongly recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Pick of the piks. Full variety of tips, handy swivel nozzle, tongue cleaner, brush, great pressure/power, convenient \\&quot;pause\\&quot; switch to change tips.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I get this for I was getting food trapped down below the gum line and would get cavaties there. I figure it would be cheaper getting the Water Pik then having crowns put on so I bought one. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the way it works and it does what I want it to. Kudo&#x27;s to Water Pik and Amazon for being the cheapest guys who had one to sell.    Chris Male</li>
    <li> This is my first Waterpik and I&#x27;m loving it . I never forget to spray with waterpik every morning and night. It was an awkward feeling when I used  it for the first time, but after several months, I got addicted .  A great device and plus it&#x27;s practical. I still confuse why some people complaint on how fragile this device is; from leaking bowl until broken tip. To be honest, I use it regularly and clean it every time after I&#x27;m done, and so far everything works just fine. Quick tips, don&#x27;t leave the water on the container. Keep it empty and most important don&#x27;t over use it. Just remember that not only do your teeth need cleaning, but your Waterpik also. Be gentle and don&#x27;t crush the tip with your teeth. It&#x27;s not lollipop!</li>
    <li> My dentist reccommended this to me and I think it does the trick keeping plaque away....</li>
    <li> My husband had to have one and now he uses it every day. He just loves it! Item came quick, no hassle, right price!</li>
    <li> This Water pik does not perform as well as older models.  It takes a minute or so for the water jet to reach the desired speed.  The water container up the top must be emptied after each use, otherwise the remaining water leaks out to the sink into the floor.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Waterpiks. My only complaint has been how soon the waterhose cracks and leaks. This one appears to be very well designed, with several improvements, including directions about replacing the hose. The head can be swiveled which lessens twisting the line also.  It is less bulky than previous models. I am impressed with this new model.</li>
    <li> My first Water Pik was over 14 years old and it was difficult to find replacement piks. I upgraded to the new model and am delighted with the product. The new features such as the special piks designed for those of us who have had gum problems and the very handy control on the device that lets you easily interrupt the water supply while inserting or removing the pik from your mouth are significant improvements. At times, I wish the reservoir held more water but it is not a big deal to refill it, if needed. Those who wrote negative reviews will find that, over time, it gets easier to use.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with this waterpik!  I was having real problems with swollen, bleeding gums when I would brush my teeth.  Within ONE WEEK of using this my gums are completely back to normal and I do not have any bleeding at all!  I am very surprised at how well these really do work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has braces and loves using this rather than trying to floss around all of that metal and wires.  This unit is surpassing both of our expectations.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This replaced an older model. The 100 has a better design and useful features.  It is lighter, more compact, easier to handle, and quieter.  It has more comfortable wand with a pause button.  The tips are easier to change by pressing an eject button rather than pushing and twisting.  The hose retains it&#x27;s shape and does not kink.  The Pik Pocket tip delivers RX under gum flaps. Do I sound pleased?  I am.</li>
    <li> I had to get a water jet per my dentist and this product had everything I was looking for.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and does not take up too much counter space.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Waterpik for years. Generally we were happy, but not everything was perfect, so when the last one quit we decided to try another brand. What a disaster! LOUD! Too small reservoir. We could hardly wait for it to give up, which it did in an amazingly short time. We went back to Waterpik but not with a lot of enthusiasm. What a surprise. This Waterpik soars above the old models. Much quieter. Plenty of water. Very smooth operating. Just buy it and don&#x27;t even look at anything else.</li>
    <li> This is the third Waterpik I&#x27;ve had over the years and it&#x27;s the best.  The first was a predecessor to the W-100; it was good but noisy, and I had to retire it after the hose cracked for the second time.  The second was the first battery-powered China-built unit that my dentist sold as a &#x27;convenience&#x27; to her patients.  It had too small a water reservoir, not close to the pressure output of the AC-powered versions, and the battery capacity was limited from the start.  NOT recommended!  The W-100 has the right size reservoir (for me, anyway), a nice compartment for storing extra &#x27;piks&#x27;, and it is quiet during operation.  It also takes up less space on the counter than the original version.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 Teledyne Waterpiks over the years. I suppose I should be content that they each lasted several years, but I don&#x27;t understand why they always end up leaking, either internally (all over the counter) or in the handle (rendering the water pressure too low to be of any value).    The W-60 in particular was poorly constructed. The handle started to leak after 2 years and got so bad, I had to look for a replacement. (After I bought the W-100, I found out [and ordered] a replacement handle. Others may prefer this route [~$12] than replacing the entire unit.)    Against my better judgment, I purchased a W-100. I&#x27;m quite surprised at how much better it is than the previous products. The reservoir is a trifle small and the pressure (now controlled by a dial on the base) should be greater. Unlike earlier units, the hose coils up very easily into a depression in the base. The hose enters the handle from below, not the side and the handle rests in a saddle instead of a hole in the base. All-in-all, it is a much better designed unit than its predecessors and doesn&#x27;t cost much more. Only time will tell whether it is sturdy enough to last 5 years or more.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have gone through a few Waterpiks and this is the first one that seems to have really been thought out.  It fits easily on the counter, the coil line coils back easily after use and the attachment storage keeps things nice and neat.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how much more this removes than brushing and rinsing. It helps promote healthy gums and teeth; dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of this appliance which was highly recommended by my new dentist.  It took a few sessions to get the hang of it. Prior to using the WaterPik, I had been using the Sonicaire electric toothbrush. Yet, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of some chronic, but minor, gum problems.  Within 2 weeks of using both the Sonicaire and the WaterPik-- my problem has been eradicated.  Results are augmented when I rinse with mouthwash after using the WaterPik.  (Note--the \\&quot;stop button\\&quot; on the handle of my WaterPik stopped working after about 4 weeks.  WaterPik customer service quickly sent me a replacement handle.  However, within a few months, the \\&quot;stop button\\&quot; on the replacement handle stopped working.  This means that to stop and start the flow of water--which one needs to do to in order to adjust the postion of the wand--I have to turn the whole apparatus off and on.  Not very convenient and a pain in the butt.  Hence my revised opinion (from a 5-Star \\&quot;So far So Good\\&quot; to a One-Star \\&quot;Revised Opinion\\&quot;)</li>
    <li> Even after using floss and using a Sonicare Toothbrush, it is still very difficult to get between teeth when wearing braces. Now the problem is solved!</li>
    <li> I would have rated this 5, however, I think the button control works the oposite that it should.  Once you turn it on, water shoots out immediately.  You have to push the blue button on the hand part to stop the water flow.  Otherwise, it works FANTASTIC!!! I never imagined it would do such a good job!</li>
    <li> I really like the &#x27;just from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling you get when using this product, my only complaint is it is really messy!!  Keep your mouth closed or water splashes everywhere!  But I suppose that is the nature of the beast with this one!</li>
    <li> The lid isn&#x27;t made to snap into place or snap close. It&#x27;s not a big deal just an annoyance. I love how easy it is to operate and that it comes with a variety of tips. Feel like it was a good price.</li>
    <li> This product glently cleans and massages the gums.  It cleans out food particles along the gum line that a toothbrush misses.  You can adjust the power of the water pulses from gentle to strong.  It is simple to operate.  You put in the water in the top plastic container and push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button and put the wand in your mouth.  It does not take up much space on the bathroom vanity countertop.  It has a clean, pleasing appearance.  The $45 price was fair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpick for my mom and she loved it!!!!!  It works great, super cleans your teeth and also it is great for the gums.  It is very light weighted and fits everwhere in the bathroom.  I totally recommend it.  We also love that it comes with 6 diferent \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; and other features so, noone has to share... Also, it looks really nice because of the compartment on the top so you don&#x27;t have all those sticks flying around :)</li>
    <li> This product has a bit of a learning curve, and can be messy, but  having used many piks as they have evolved over the years, this one is superior. (and I prefer the mess to additional dental trips  so it is a worthwhile trade-off). Beware to keep the handle upright or in its holder, when  affixing or changing tips; the handle will leak water if there is no tip and there is any water in the reservoir.        After using this just once, my teeth felt cleaner and looked brighter. The many tools included allow each member of the family to use whatever suits their individual needs.  I also appreciate the storage compartment. I wish I had one of those for each family member so I will be looking for them.  I also find it quite convenient  to be able to use it for anti-bacterial products with the pocket-pik.      The unit is much quieter, and vibrates less than predecessor models.   In the few short weeks since we have had the unit, it has  removed discoloration that our high-end electric toothbrush has been leaving behind. Oddly, this impressed our  11 yr old to such a degree after he tried it only once and  noticed his pearly yellows had become whiter, that he now asks to use it regularly, as he finds it easier than flossing. Up to now, he has not been entirely cooperative concerning flossing. Things are totally different now. It has been a great all-around oral health aid.</li>
    <li> This was the only thing my husband asked for for Christmas.  He never asks for anything and it&#x27;s always a guess what he&#x27;d like, so telling me was a huge step.  Since brand and style weren&#x27;t mentioned, I did some research, including reviews.  This seemed to have the most power to it and do the best job.  My husband really likes it, even though the first time he used it he wasn&#x27;t expecting the spray and got a bath in the process.  He rapidly became accostomed to it and is using it faithfully.  This model is powerful enough for cleaning and he can clean under his bridge.  Though some reviews mentioned that the reservoir is small, he prefers that because it&#x27;s always fresh water.  Good buy and definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> i own it from about a month and am very happy with it.  ioo hate flossing a lot so i dont do it everyu day. With this i look fwd to clean my teeth every night.</li>
    <li> For me the best use of this is to deal with food traps.  If you have that problem in your teeth, you can flush them out quickly and easily.  It works well for other problem areas that are not easy to floss or brush.  I think this should be standard equipment right along with a tooth brush especially for people who have gum problems or bad breath issues.  It could be argued that this is not as good as flossing in some ways but if you have a tendency to skip the flossing as I do, it is a good substitute.</li>
    <li> It was everything stated on the website. I thought there was a problem with the addition savings so I sent an email in to ask and a reply was sent to  me within 3 hrs. There was no problem and the dis out was used as advertised.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works great.  Very powerful.  My setting is 6, my wife&#x27;s 5.  No need for higher.  Cleans teeth very well.  My wife uses tap water, then I use distilled, to keep the unit clean of any potential buildup from tap water contaminants.  Although, our tap water here is some of the cleanest in the country.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my gums within a few days. This is a wonderful adjunct to home dental care.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these units in the past 5 years, the last one less than two years. Each time the hose has broken right in half. I was shocked to see that this had happened a second time.  I cannot imagine I am the only one this has happened to. Now I have to buy another for I cannot do without.</li>
    <li> I have been using My Waterpik twice a day and my mouth has never been cleaner.  Love it, recommend it to anyone who wants clean teeth and healthy gums. I was amazed with the amount of debris my tooth brush missed. By far my best purchase of 2012.</li>
    <li> This is not the water pik your granddaddy used.  The handle is flimsy and it&#x27;s clearly not as powerful. The basin doesn&#x27;t hold that much water. It works alright. I would not buy it again if it were to break soon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would get used to using a Water Pik,  but it&#x27;s very easy to use, and efficient!</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is so much nicer to use than traditional \\&quot;string\\&quot; floss.  It does not make a mess, takes just a few minutes a day, and it&#x27;s compact size fits well on the sink.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone who cares about taking care of their teeth!</li>
    <li> I use this with my braces, and cannot live without it.  It gets food out from in between the wires and brackets that brushing and flossing misses.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Dental care can certainly add up and brushing does not always get at everything. My dentist recommended a water pic and frankly I wish I did so long ago.  Every day it now feels like I come out of the dentist office (granted with no bill).  The different heads are interesting but I stay with the main one. I have read about some putting in mouthwash into the system but I think that might be a tad costly. It is easier to use than dental floss and might actually be faster considering the reach of it.  Given everything it is a pretty good investment. I am pretty surprised that there is not as much for commercials for these given how effective they work.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my last dentist appointment. My dentist said that I needed to floss regularly and I was doing so, but apparently that wasn&#x27;t enough. I saw the reviews on Amazon for  this product and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for about a month now and am still uncertain about how well it works. I floss after using this machine and I see that the machine doesn&#x27;t take out everything. I am going to keep using this machine until my next dentist appointment to see whether it has made any difference...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Waterpik before, so had no idea if I&#x27;d like it or not. But I love it! I have dry mouth, so my gums are sensitive to floss, which I do at least 3 times a day. I actually look forward to using the Pik. If you want to know how effective it is, see what it gets out after brushing and flossing with string floss. I bought the Panasonic portable one for travel. Highly recommend both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I found there&#x27;s a problem if you go away for two weeks and the water inside is not emptied out. You can develop a musty smell and probably mold.</li>
    <li> My Dad has been telling me about the benefits of using a Waterpik for years, but I kept ignoring him. Until Amazon put it on sale recently. I can&#x27;t believe how well the Waterpik cleans between your teeth and gums. Not knowing what to expect, and never have used one before, I started off on the \\&quot;1\\&quot; setting. I gradually increased this with every use (and once I stopped spraying everything in my bathroom...including the mirror on several occasions lol). I&#x27;m now using it at the \\&quot;6\\&quot; setting, and very pleased with the results. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!!!</li>
    <li> Does everything it promises and then some.  It&#x27;s convenient, compact, and easy enough to use daily. This is my second water flosser, my first was a different brand.  I definitely prefer the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I love this water flossed.  It works great my husband hates to floss and would never do it but he will use this.</li>
    <li> Beats string flossing and does a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;The lid storage is a convenient place to store variety of tips.&lt;br /&gt;You will be convinced at first use after a meal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday present (his request). He loves it! He uses filtered water and uses it twice a day. He generally refills it once every 2 or 3 days. No problems to report; it does what it says :)</li>
    <li> I hope to buy this product, but I&#x27;d like to know the applied voltage of it. because our current electric voltage is applied to 220v.</li>
    <li> This is the third Waterpik I have owned.  Many years ago my then dentist recommended that I purchase one and use it daily because of spacing between my teeth.  This latest model Waterpik is the best yet.  I can use it for brushing as well as cleaning between my teeth.  I am thoroughly pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> My dentist requested that I purchase the Waterpik Ultra because it has a special tip that is especially good at reaching the crevices between bone and gum and removing the plaque each evening before it has a chance to accumulate and cause damage. I&#x27;m to use the waterpik at the end of my usual 7 minute dental procedure, and sometimes brush with the attachment for that purpose. It works and it leaves my mouth fresher and cleaner than I have known before.</li>
    <li> The unit was for my wife and she says it does a good job and she is VERY satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who has a problem with her gums. She has been using this and feels that it is helping her heal.I have one that I purchased years ago. I use it every day and would buy another in a minute if this one were to break down.</li>
    <li> This water pic is wonderful!  It has helped my husband with his gingivitis problem immensely!  Very easy to use, and not bulky, so takes up just a little space on the bathroom sink.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Equipment reliable, beautiful, small, economical. To my surprise I received 6 pieces when I thought I only receive 2: toothbrush and general use. Recommend and will buy another for my daughter</li>
    <li> Waterpik is without a doubt a leading brand on this product. If you want the most powerful spray this is your items, see the stats. Gets stuff out of your teeth that brushing certainly misses and even better than flossing. Use it and you might even find the keys to that car you drove in college! If I had bought one earlier I wouldn&#x27;t now have this problem with the ill-fitting crown and related gum problems.</li>
    <li> After substantial on-line research and discussions with my oral hygienist and dentist, I settled on using this as a complement to standard flossing -- i.e. I still floss with string every night, but I use this after flossing at night and after brushing in the morning. Consequently I settled on a power setting of 6-7, and always making sure I point the tip away from the root (to avoid pushing food particles under the gum line). It&#x27;s still too early to judge long-term effects, but:&lt;br /&gt;- I feel my mouth cleaner,&lt;br /&gt;- it also massages the gums, and&lt;br /&gt;- probably reduces the glycerin residue on the teeth (which some maintain reduces the teeth&#x27;s ability to re-mineralize)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: good pressure; not unpleasant to use - so it&#x27;s easier to incorporate in daily routine&lt;br /&gt;cons: standard tip too short to reach wisdom teeth easily; angle of flow on standard tip should be more acute to facilitate aiming away from root (or at least add a new tip with these two properties); would prefer 1-2 additional standard tips rather than some of the included more \\&quot;specific\\&quot; varieties</li>
    <li> I have had water piks before but this one doesnt seem as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I would not re buy....although it stores nicely on bathroom counter&lt;br /&gt;and  plug in cord plenty long and many additional piks but  just&lt;br /&gt;wish  motor was more powerful....jet stream hardly does the job..</li>
    <li> This Waterpik has a smaller footprint than the other/older models I have had.  The motor is much quieter. It seems to be easier to use the handle.  The button on the side that pauses the stream while I get it to my mouth works very well. I only use the original tips so don&#x27;t need to have the other tips that came with this Waterpik. I would still buy this model just for the smaller footprint and quieter motor~even though the tips are not useful to me.  If you have braces or other dental work this would be an awesome choice!</li>
    <li> this waterpik is amazing ,i don&#x27;t know why i waited so long to get one, its great. i love them</li>
    <li> So quick and easy to remove food particles, does an excellent job! Very pleased with this gift! Should have purchased it myself earlier.</li>
    <li> Product works great better than uncomfortable flossing. Be careful if you have bleeding or sensitive gums on any setting above 3 or 4, start with 1 and work your way up to effective comfort level. This product definitely works as advertised, you can also add mouthwash to the reservoir mixed with water for a fresh &amp;#34;just walked out of the dentist office&amp;#34; feeling</li>
    <li> For the fourth time now the holder for the pik has broken which leads me to believe it is a design flaw.  Have loved my water piks since 1969 but doubt I&#x27;ll ever own&lt;br /&gt;Another unless this is replaced</li>
    <li> First off I would like to say I ordered this product on September 20th and recieved it on September 21st, Amazon Prime is awesome!I read a ton of reviews here on Amazon and some said they leaked and were real noisy/messy and this and that. Well this is when my worries began, I did things backwards on this particular purchase. I ordered and then read reviews. So when this arrived, I opened the box, read the instructions and followed them. I dont find this unit to be real noisy,the tip spays water, so its says to keep you mouth closed but open enough so water can exit. I dont see this unit as messy as an electric toothbrush, but truth be told I have nothing to compare it to. I have not had any waterleaks yet and have used it after everymeal and then some (5 times today). This little machine is powerful, I started on setting 6 and mixed in a couple of lid fulls of listerine with warm water and WOW!I dont remember my mouth every feeling this good.You will me amazed how much junk comes out of your mouth with this little tool. Not real messy either. All in all I give it 5 stars for now, but I will update if I have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do a lot of purchasing on e-bay, at the time of my purchase, e-bay had this unit for $35 (used) &amp; $65 (new) didnt see shipping cost if any but didnt look around to much longer either because amazons price was $45 with free 2 day shipping for prime members. I&#x27;d say that a pretty good deal! Shop around maybe you might find something but over all Amazons service and super quick shipping is hard to beat!</li>
    <li> This little device comes with a lot for the price. I was very pleased with what all came with it. Works very well and does a great job of cleaning in between your teeth. If you hate flossing (like I do) this is a great and way easier alternative.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser to replace one that I had for many years.  The new one was a pleasant surprise.  First, it was smaller so took up less from on the counter.  Second, it&#x27;s much easier to fill and use.  The pick part snaps into the front of the machine and the cord winds up on it&#x27;s own.  It does not have the power that the old one had but that is probably a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;My gums don&#x27;t bleed every time like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get an excellent report from my hygenist every time so it must be working.</li>
    <li> Works great. Highly recommend for problematic gums. Product arrived quickly and in great shape. Pressure can be regulated with precision as needed.</li>
    <li> Product preforms as advertised. Good price, good service. I enjoy using it everyday. I look forward to my next dentist visit to see if there is an improvement.</li>
    <li> I have this unit, a WP-65C that just broke and a WP-65W and I prefer the 65 series for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Pressure is greater. Even though it is listed as lower, it is higher on both of my W65 units and allows me to really get into gum pockets where my wisdom teeth used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The tips stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The water reservoir is larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Replacement heads are still available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Slide switch can move too easily (I fixed this with a rubber band and may super glue the next handle on high).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hose broke. This was after years and replacement head with hose is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Larger footprint on counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Noisier than Ultra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took my 65C unit apart after the hose broke and it is a very simple design.&lt;br /&gt;Could have been fixed parts I had if I hadn&#x27;t broken the fitting on the head by using too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These devices are much better at cleaning the gum line plaque than floss by a long shot. I can even get stuff out from between my teeth after flossing so it seems like a no-brainer as far as dental hygiene (thank God for spell checker on that one...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link for the model here: [[ASIN:B00009OL68 Waterpik Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Flosser was my first time purchasing this product.  Used along with regular dental visits makes this a great product for oral care.  This Waterpik really pushes food particles from between your teeth and gums.  So far I have had no problems with this product.  I love how easy it was to use and I will purchase the product again.  Another good thing was receiving all six tips with the product although only four can be stored in the compact on top of the product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE REVIEW:  Another week, and I can&#x27;t believe how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I had oral thrush because I had such a bad taste in my mouth.  My doctor said, no, gingivitis.  My front, bottom gums were grayish-brown.  After two weeks of using the Waterpik, It is gone!!!  I also use peroxide with it rather than mouthwash.  I did a small test.  First, I did a peroxide rinse on my teeth after using a toothbrush.  There was fizzy stuff on my gums and between my teeth.  Then, I did a peroxide rinse after using the Waterpik.  Only small areas of fizzing.  This is the best thing since sliced rye bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had ZERO problems with this, and I finally learned how not to get water all over me, the floor, the wall, the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I cannot believe the difference between oral irrigation and flossing.  When I flossed previously, I&#x27;d get out occasional small bits of food.  When I use the Waterpik, e-gods, the amount of tiny pieces of food that aren&#x27;t removed with a toothbrush or flossing.  I don&#x27;t mean to be crass, but I could not believe the stuff that I was spitting out.  Ha!  Bet no one else has made that comment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I got water everywhere.  I didn&#x27;t have the pik in my mouth when I turned it on, and a couple of times, when I had to spit, I pulled the pik out of my mouth, still on.  I&#x27;m getting much better at it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve read where other people use an anti-bacterial mouthwash with water in the reservoir.  I use peroxide, a natural anti-bacterial, and it costs much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying, don&#x27;t hesitate.  It really will make a difference in your dental care.</li>
    <li> The attachments for the waterpik wp-70 do not fit this model.  If you have a nasal attachment for the wp-70, it won&#x27;t work with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this model to be slightly less noisy than the wp-70.  Unlike with the wp-70, the power settings change the power to the motor.  So a lower power setting will result in quieter operation.  (The wp-70 did not regulate power but output.  So a lower setting resulted only in less water coming out of the pick but no less power to the motor.  The end result of a lower setting was actually loader operation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with leaking.  However, I do not leave any water in the basin when I&#x27;m not using the pick.  In other words, anytime there is water in the basin I am either using the pick or have the pick in hand elevated above the basin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to swivel the direction of the pick with the cog wheel at the end of the hose, which I find helpful.  (I saw a review where the person was not able to do so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;m glad I purchased this model instead of another wp-70.  By the way, the wp-70 only lasted three years before its output became too little to be of value.  (I had used it every night, using up about 1,500 ml.)  Based on other reviews I have read, it appears that that is about the life span of these waterpiks.  Prior to the wp-70, I had used waterpik&#x27;s cheaper competitor.  It lasted only about 18 months and was extremely loud.</li>
    <li> I have owned this water pik for a year now after replacing their cordless model which is weak compared to this one and limited time on rechargable battery.  This product is the best one I found on the home grade market.  The only flaw I found is that the hose cracks and the entire handle will need to be replaced after a year of normal use.  Luckily the handle can be purchased separately for $15.00</li>
    <li> This cleans very well! It holds just enough water to do a good cleaning. I like that the water also pulses. This gives it a greater chance to knock off any debris. I add peroxide to the water to help with killing germs in the mouth as well as keeping my machine clean. After use, simply wipe down with a paper towel. I also wipe it dry inside the water reservour.</li>
    <li> I received my Waterpik very fast. It was a great buy and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it I was anxious to receive it and was delivered quickly. My teeth and I are very happy!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool, especially for getting food out from between my teeth after a meal. Having also been recommended by my dentist, it aids gum health, and thus tooth health as well. These are easy to use and last for years before a new one is required.</li>
    <li> Had to replace the old Waterpik because the connecting tube broke, the new one is designed better and may prevent this kind of break. This gets a four because the water pressure is less even at the highest setting, the water tank is much smaller 600ml vs 1000ml, I have to fill it twice to get all my teeth cleaned and the new cord is shorter 51\\&quot; vs 55\\&quot;. So does it do what its supposed to? Basically just with less beef than the old one. Delivered a couple days sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> No problems, lots of accessories. I just hope my hygenist sees the difference. delivered fast and packaged well. Would recommend to anyone looking to maintain a healthy mouth.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. My gums get irritated and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually getting anything accomplished. My dentist recommended Waterpik. After procrastinating forever, I got this one and wish I had got it years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use. My gums are not as irritated using the Waterpik as they are after using a dental floss. And it reaches all my teeth without pain.</li>
    <li> Wow... Very easy to use compared to traditional flossing.  Leaves teeth as clean as the dentist office.  Should have bought earlier.</li>
    <li> Brushing my teeth: boring.&lt;br /&gt;Flossing: awkward and, let&#x27;s face it, disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Water Pik: rewarding!  The gentle pulse is almost soothing.  Yes, messy, as you lean over the sink letting the water dribble out of your mouth but also rewarding.  It&#x27;s amazing the tiny bits of food debris that is hiding under your gums.  I promise you will be amazed.  And perhaps be cheered as each bit appears; I&#x27;m cleaner, cleaner, cleanest!  Green?  Must be the spinach salad.  White, might be the chicken.  Red?  Holy cow, that&#x27;s the breakfast burrito I had 12 hours ago.</li>
    <li> This replaced a rechargeable unit that gave up the ghost after a year, didn&#x27;t hold enough water, and was impossible to orient properly to get behind the teeth of the lower jaw.  I must say, they&#x27;ve improved this item dramatically from the one I had years ago. It has a nice variety of tips - I especially love the toothbrush, and the soft tip designed to gently clean under the gums where they meet the tooth.  My unit lacked the tongue scrubber they advertise; it came instead with a second primary jet, for the use of my insignificant other (was that out loud?)  The 1-10 variable power provides a nice range of water flow for different tips, and lets you clean gently if your gums are sensitive like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two design problems, and my solutions:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s hard to drain the hose completely after use, and if water sits in there continually it&#x27;s going to eventually develop a smell that can only come from the growth of micro-organisms, and no one wants to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; their teeth with that crud. So I pour a couple ounces of hydrogen peroxide in the water when I fill the rerservoir, which helps prevent the build-up of the dreaded plaque that leads to most dental problems, and also keeps the gross stuff from growing inside the hose and reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;2) Noise.  It&#x27;s not the most objectionable level of sound, but I discovered that if I lifted the unit slightly off the counter when it&#x27;s running, the noise drops noticeably.  But who wants to stand there holding the hose in one hand and the heavy unit in the other while you clean your teeth?  So I got some of that cork-like shelf protector material like you can find at the hardware store near the shelf paper, and cut a piece to fit under the unit.  This greatly reduces the vibration of the machine against the hard surface of the counter.  It&#x27;s not silent by any means, but it&#x27;s a lot quieter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked flossing with string and this is a wonderful solution to that problem.  It&#x27;s dead simple to use and leaves my mouth so clean.  Highly recommended!  As a bonus you won&#x27;t be wasting all of the plastic involved in string flossing with this product!</li>
    <li> i had a really bad visit to the dentist, im 42 and although i brush me teeth, i have that&lt;br /&gt;fancy toothbrush that vibrates, i dont really like to floss, maybe because im lazy.. not to&lt;br /&gt;sound stupid but maybe because i didnt really know how to do it correctly.. anyway, my dentist&lt;br /&gt;said my gums had pull back so many degrees and i couldnt do a normal cleaning. well i was totally freaked out&lt;br /&gt;then the nurse wispered to me to get one of these, she said it was the same as flossing..&lt;br /&gt;i went directly to buy one of these, seriously within 1 week, or really 2 days, i could tell&lt;br /&gt;a difference, when i used it, little bits of food came out of my mouth into the sink.. my gums&lt;br /&gt;dont bleed anymore when i brush or floss.. my breath is better. i can just tell my mouth&lt;br /&gt;is better- gums.. i cant wait to go back and show the dentist.. i have no one to blame but myself,&lt;br /&gt;but i can tell you that ive pretty much gone to the dentist every year for 20 years and ive seen&lt;br /&gt;my gums gets worse, and it took this long for someone to tell me about this.. ok, that makes me mad&lt;br /&gt;at the dental industry.. again, its all my fault, im not a liberal, but someone should have&lt;br /&gt;told me, this product is a game changer for gum health.. i highly highly highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;it has changed my life, seriously..</li>
    <li> I bought this Waterpik after my most recent cleaning.  I deal with excessive plaque and tartar build up on my teeth and to fight it I have cleanings every 3 months.  I have difficulty flossing as my back teeth are very very tight together and getting the floss between them and out is hard and often painful.  After being frustrated for a long time I came across one of these in the store and decided it would be worth trying.  I waited and checked Amazon&#x27;s prices and found them to be $10 cheaper than the retail store I saw it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and after using it and then brushing my teeth feel so much cleaner than they even did with flossing.  I don&#x27;t feel the build ups forming on my teeth but will have to wait until my next scheduled cleaning to see what the hygienist says and ask her about the effectiveness vs. flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is easy to use and has a lot of attachments but I find myself using the same one for the most part.  The tank is pretty large and often times I run it down until it is empty.  I have it set on the highest pressure level and it stings a little but I find it tolerable.  It is nice that it is adjustable in settings and I started off lower and worked my way up.  I will follow up after my next cleaning and see how well it is working for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik. My first one lasted about 20 years hopefully this one will last as long. This model has plenty of power and lots of extras that I will probably never use. I keep it at the maximum setting as that seems to be similar to my old machines output. Use this and save on expensive visits to have your teeth and gums cleaned at the Dentist office. The Dentist and his hygienist keep telling me I&#x27;m doing a great job with flossing my teeth and my gums look healthy. I didn&#x27;t tell them I hate flossing but use a Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. It slowed down after about 10 years, and I replaced it. The new one is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works well.  However, the very first time I used it, water was pouring out of the bottom of the handle.  I called their customer service and they send me a new handle and cord.  I attached it and it worked well.</li>
    <li> My husband actually bought this and absolutely loves it. I just bought extra piks because he wants the whole family to start using this. He said now after trying this he couldn&#x27;t go without having it. He raves about this water pik.</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE. INEXPENSIVE INVESTMENT TOWARD IMPROVED ORAL HEALTH. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this item elsewhere simply for ease. I have tight contact between my teeth, so traditional flossing can be a bit of a chore and awkward in general. Ive been using it fairly consistently for about a month or so. It recommends using it twice a day for 90 seconds. Sometimes I use it twice a day, more often once a day, and sometimes I miss a day here and there. I went to my first dental appointment after using the Pik. My hygienist was quiet pleased with the effects of the WaterPik and said &amp;#34;keep using it!&amp;#34; Since I don&#x27;t floss, I often have excessive bleeding from my gums during a cleaning. This visit was quiet pleasant, and with a confirmation that the WaterPik was money well spent. Hooray!</li>
    <li> We purchased this for our 10-year old daughter, who just had an expander placed to widen her jaw.  It&#x27;s been a lifesaver for clearing out food which gets stuck in the metal.  She&#x27;s able to use it without difficulty, and hasn&#x27;t needed to go any higher than level 2 to remove the food particles.  The machine does seem to run through water pretty quickly, so I&#x27;d recommend buying gallon jugs of distilled water to refill...the water from our faucet is so full of minerals, I was scared it would crud up the machine.  I suspect this water flosser will be getting a great deal of use over the next few years, as my son and daughter both advance to braces...well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Really great, have used one for a long time. From Jo</li>
    <li> I just love my Water Pik! The onboard tools make cleaning thorough and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing not included in this well priced model offer is the tongue cleaner but it&#x27;s easily ordered from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is very simple to use and you can easily adjust pressure with a dial knob. One of piks should always be used on the lowest setting according to the enclosed directions. As with any machine like this, read the directions, that&#x27;s why they give them to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, be like me and exercise control with the pik and never use cold water for irrigating - you&#x27;ll jump out of your skin. I fill my tank with room temp to warm water and 1/4 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide for a thorough clean.</li>
    <li> I needed something to care for a bridge and the super floss they give you is a joke...so I bought this and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> it works really well at cleaning between the teeth, it is  safer than flossing too, no cutting of the gum. It is quite powerful, go carefully</li>
    <li> It works. No problems. Have had it for about a month. I use it every other day or so. I won&#x27;t know for a while if it truly works (when I got to the dentist next).</li>
    <li> It Was what I was what I was looking for, and it was user friendly. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great ways to clean your teeth and your gum. It really helps me clean the area between my teeth and prevent gum diseases.</li>
    <li> This was the best investment for my oral health.  After using this for a month I had a dental checkup and my dentist was quite impressed w/what she had seen.  Since then I have had great checkups and the &amp;#34;thumbs up&amp;#34;.  Do I dare say that she has even said to keep up doing whatever it is as it is working.  This is very easy to use.  No need to use that horrible dental floss anymore!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing like it, but inevitably messy and unsanitary. It&#x27;s the nature of the beast. The water WILL drip down the hose connecting the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34;. Bu then, this is the way to squirt water between your teeth. Everyone in the family should have their own and not share, even using their own &amp;#34;piks&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This has great power, with adjustable settings--Works quickly and efficiently--I like it better than the cordless hand-held model I used previously.</li>
    <li> Works great, better than expected. Keeps teeth and orthodontics free of food deposits and is much faster than stringing floss.</li>
    <li> I love it! The waterpik doesn&#x27;t make my gums bleed and it&#x27;s so nice not to spit wax out of my mouth. The pressure is just right for me. 10 would peel the paint off a car. lol I have mine set on 4.</li>
    <li> I love this water pik!! It works great!! Im actually going to get my husband and brother one! Definitely recommend...</li>
    <li> This item works exactly as promised. There are lots of attachments and no explanation of what they are for, but a quick google search solves that problem.</li>
    <li> I have never used a waterpik before at age 50 and I love it! I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Wow! Teethe never got so clean. Can see what it is washing out as stream of water with all this food debris flows out.I got it after having a new Dental bridge installed but now I wish I had had one all my life</li>
    <li> First I tried floss. I found I was often shoving my fists in my mouth with a small thread of fabric trying to reach the tough-to-reach locations of the back molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried floss sticks. Easier than flossing, but still didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read a reddit article that mentioned this was a lesser known purchase that would give you a whole new view of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve had this thing for a week and I have to say, I love it. I&#x27;ve done pre/post tests (flossing before waterpikking and vice versa) and each time with flossing it would leave something behind that the waterpik would get. I don&#x27;t have braces anymore, but I really wish I had known about this thing when I did wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Cleans out junk I could never have gotten with floss. Also, seems far less medieval (to me) than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;• Easy peasy. Point and fire. Load it with warm water and get your pressure set and you&#x27;re good to go. That being said, it can spray a little bit so probably not the best thing to try doing if you just got dressed up in a suit or something.&lt;br /&gt;• Relatively small footprint. Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, isn&#x27;t too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Better hold down that button when you turn it on. It&#x27;s set to spray upon being turned on.&lt;br /&gt;• The lid for holding all the tips doesn&#x27;t actually accommodate all the tips. Silly oversight, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Pending my next visit to the dentist.</li>
    <li> This is a particularly wonderful tool for use in cleaning your teeth if you have braces.  It does a much better job of cleaning than other flossing methods. As good a job as it does with braces, it has to be better than other methods for regular flossing needs.</li>
    <li> I bought the waterpik primarily because our dentist recommended it for our daughter who was getting braces.  It arrived promptly and is super easy to use and does a fabulous job getting teeth clean around the braces and in between teeth.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect but had heard great things about water flossing. This machine really does it well. Easy to use. Different settings. No excuse to not floss anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product that clean your gumline and between teeth.I think, it great product for people who has deep pockets on their gumline. It a bit messy when using it but better to keep your teeth healthy. I use waterpik, manual floss and sonicare toothbrush (haven&#x27;t use waterpik toothbrush). I would recomment to others.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived safely and intact as expected.  I set it up immediately, and it works as promised.  I am awkward using it and I get water all over the bathroom, but that is because of my clumsiness, not because of the equipment, I am sure.  I got it because my dentist suggested I do so because my flossing wasn&#x27;t good enough.  Hope he sees an improvement next visit!  Thanks for a good product and great service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before and I remember the older one being much louder.  I wish the cord were a little longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this flosser every day for about 3 months now and I have had no issues. My machine did not leak like other reviews said. It has great pressure and definitely removes anything between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Love it  Good value.  Had no trouble with it.  Price was right.  Worked good right out of the box.  Happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am using it to clean through braces. it is so effective in removing food particles that i have replaced the traditional flossing with this. It really works. And the best part it that it is just water, no other chemicals, additives, or active agents. Completely natural.</li>
    <li> The waterpik just works. I&#x27;m always amazed how much it is able to cleanse even after flossing and brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> This flosser is easy to use and store.  It seems to do the job well and has a generous supply of tips.</li>
    <li> Lots of accessories which one would need a PHD to figure out how to use.&lt;br /&gt;However, the picks and construction of the device is top quality. Needs a auto off switch if left on by mistake with no water in tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick to use use, but my dentist says use it in conjunction with floss and brush to get optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs a battery model, since not all older bathrooms has electric sockets.</li>
    <li> This works well and really helps dislodge food particles from braces.  Also soothes along the gum line and feels like circulation is increased</li>
    <li> through cleaning around gum line and between teeth, great for use by tooth implant patients, extra attachments a plus for special cleaning requirements</li>
    <li> I have some irregular crevices in my teeth that floss has a hard time cleaning properly.  The proof that the Waterpik works is in the form of the visibility of particles of food that were removed from my gum line after brushing and flossing.  These are visible in the water outflow into the sink.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing, I was a little disappointed that the reservoir does not hold as much water as I would like.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the cleansing in tight places this device achieves. According to my dentist you Still need to floss though. Bummer!</li>
    <li> This product does not hold enough water to do a good job of flossing.  It is empty before the job is 1/2 completed.</li>
    <li> This is my first water pick and I love it! I just got braces on my teeth and didn&#x27;t want to fool around with trying to floss. This waterpik makes it easy, and I love the way it feels on my teeth and gums. I got home yesterday at 5pm and by 10pm, I had used it 3 times. I just like the way it feels. So does it do a good job? It&#x27;s hard to tell with my new braces on but so far it seems like it works. I add a cap full of Listerine to the water and it refreshes my mouth making it feel clean.</li>
    <li> This is the waterpik that is close to the original.  It is easy and simple to use.  does a great job!</li>
    <li> I bought this product just to try a different way of flossing. I love the outcome after using it for a week. No need to do the tradional flossing and no need to spend extra bucks for mouthwash. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Just what the dentist ordered. Perfect for tooth implants.  When I&#x27;m done flossing, I can wash the car with it. ;-)</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it was not as well-made as expected based on the price. It leaked all over the counter. While the reservoir should be emptied each time (according to the manual), this should not be necessary.</li>
    <li> I have braces n it makes it so much easier to keep my teeth clean ;)  I absolutely love this</li>
    <li> The waterpik makes it so easy to floss, if I had to floss the conventional way I would have never done it. The dentist suggested to floss as my gums were becoming softer at last check up. He suggested either flossing or consider a waterpik. I&#x27;m so glad I got the water flossser. It has made a difference. My teeth feel as if I came from the dentist. It takes a bit to get use to. It does require one to get the feel of it to use it. However it is really easy operate. I would most definitely recommend this unit. If you want or need to start taking better care of your dental health this is the unit for you. It will make &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in other reviews it states the water holder leaks I founds this as well. I found if I leave the water holder on unit and use a glass to fill it up then use as normal, when finished or empty I pour the excess water out. This works great, as there is little water to run out. I don&#x27;t find this as a major issue as I work around the problem. However paying for something that has an issue leaking is a bit disturbing it shouldn&#x27;t be leaking at all.  This is the only problem I&#x27;ve had and since I found a way around the issue I don&#x27;t get bothered with it. I still would highly recommend this unit. It makes flossing so easy. My dental health is more important than a small leaky issue. I would ask the company to correct the issue. The only problem as I see it is the little rubber stopper in water tank isn&#x27;t tension or pressure sensitive if this could be corrected the problem would be fixed.</li>
    <li> I used to have one, it broke ...I didn&#x27;t replace this for years n my mouth paid the price 800 dollars later for a deep scaling but now my check ups are great n I cant wait till my next teeth cleaning in nov&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a cavity just bad gums. I am a happy customer now..water get up under my gums to release any food the tooth brush didn&#x27;t get..highly recommend getting on of these.</li>
    <li> Always had a problem with bleeding gums until I started using this product.  Amazing!  Problem solved. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> It seems to output a good amount of power, at max settings I felt like it could really jar loose all the stuff in between my teeth as good as normal flossing but only if I took my sweet ole time and went along each slit between my teeth. I wanted to get this water flosser to save time, and it doesn&#x27;t. I live in an apartment and I go to bed a little later than most, so when I turn this thing on I feel a bit embarrassed and rushed a bit because it&#x27;s so noisy, not so much the motor (although it&#x27;s pretty noisy) but more-so the plastic hitting against my counter-top as this thing vibrates a lot. All in all this saves me no time, is a hassle to refill and listen to, just another device you have to keep plugged in (got too many) and makes a bit of a mess if you aren&#x27;t careful. Traditional flossing is the better way to go.</li>
    <li> love product works very well receive item in short period of time.did not know item worked as well as it does thank you</li>
    <li> Coincidentally or not, I have had no cavaties after using it for over a year. Before I got, my dentist found something every half year. I also use a fluoride mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I flossed, it might&#x27;ve been years. I recently went to a dentist/surgeon to get my wisdom teeth removed and he informed me that if I did not floss daily I would end up with moderate-severe case of periodontal disease. He told me that I might begin to lose teeth in my 40s (currently 20). I was very shocked to hear that, so after I left the office with half of my face swollen I decided to look into flossing. Through this research I discovered the Waterpik. I may start using regular floss along with this, but I tried to stay away from regular floss because it was such a tedious chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 5 days after my surgery and I was tired of the terrible smell coming out of my mouth so I decided to do a full mouth cleaning today. I started with the flossing; the pressure and warmness of the water flowing around my teeth felt aaammmaazing. I could see bits of fruit from my yogurt diet falling into the sink. This stuff isn&#x27;t even as bad as normal food and I could see particles. I can&#x27;t even imagine how much other gunk stayed in my teeth for days when I didn&#x27;t Waterpikd (orally irrigate according to Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that caught me offguard about the product was the noise. I was expecting noise, about as much as my electric shaver (Norelco 1280X)but this was not the case, it is much louder than that. It is almost comparable to placing a cellphone with a loud vibration on a counter. The noise definitely escapes through the bathroom door. If the sound that an average dishwasher makes is rated at a 10, a phone vibrating on a counter is a 3, and the shaver is a 3.5 then this product at max power is at ~7, on low power it dips down to a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why get it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using the product and so far so good, my mouth feels completely clean. I never thought my mouth could feel this clean. If you already floss daily I don&#x27;t really see how you will benefit as much, but I did notice that this sprays around thetooth into places regular floss can&#x27;t go and places that a toothbrush may not make enough contact with. After reading plenty of reviews online I learned that if you take the time to master the Waterpik and its 10 pressure settings this MAY replace floss from your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... and because it&#x27;s fun to use.</li>
    <li> Very helpful.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed it</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this water pic so much more than flossing with floss!  However, my dentist says that it is necessary to use the floss rather that a water pic for the best results.  Darn!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! My son uses it all the time because he has a retainer and he loves it too! this is an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Plug it in and go.  Variable power is a big plus and switching pics is easy.  Not big and bulky and very well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the water flosser a few times right after flossing and gotten more bits of food out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit of a pain to fill the water and keep it clean but it definitely cleans out stuff that nothing else gets.</li>
    <li> not impressed with item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had gum issues for quite a while. My dentist recommended that I get a water pik. Bought this model at target for $47.99 because i wanted it that day.  It works great. I don&#x27;t really understand the people that say it needs more pressure. It has plenty of pressure. My teeth and gums have never felt better.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my wife when she had orthodontic treatment and another one for my brother in law to help clean his under his bridges.  The machine does a pretty good job removing most of the build up and it makes actual flossing a lot easier.  But the tube connecting the handle to the base is made from bad quality material.  Both machine have the tube broken after only 2 years of usage.  Will try the remote Waterpik and see how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I started using this when my hygenist recomended it. I love it and cannot go to sleep without using it. It cleans everything from everywhere in your teeth. I mix listerine in water once a week for a great antibacterial wash. Peroxide works too (diluted) the pocket measurements in my teeth have gotten smaller , you know 2-2-2 4-3-2 i have no more 4s only 2s and 3s. You will love this thing , many different tips but you will find your favorite.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement item -- our first Waterpic was given to our daughter when she had braces -- this newer version is well received as it has a smaller footprint on an already crowded bathroom counter and seems to be a very good purchase. One negative point would be there should be at least two sets of tips rather than having to purchase them as extras.</li>
    <li> This was my first water pik ever. I purchased it as what I thought would be a special use product and didn&#x27;t expect it to become a daily thing, but it exceeded my expectations and made me wish I gotten one years ago.  I initially got this because I wanted to irrigate gums and teeth during a bleaching process I was having done at the dentist.  My hope was that using this after bleaching would help limit the sensativity I was experiencing from the bleach residue from the home maint part of the process - just rinsing after was not doing a good enough job, and my gums were becoming irritated. This product did the trick and solved all the issues I had with the bleaching process.  In addition, I noticed an overall improvement in comfort when brushing and I didn&#x27;t even know my gums could feel this great. I thought they already were fine, but this product just really improves overall dental health.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this model because of the additional piks that come with the unit and the storage case for those small parts, as well as the smaller foot print - it just seemed better designed then the more basic unit. To me it has been worth the price.  Since this was my first water pik, I did go through the initial introductory process of drenching myself and the bathroom mirror on the first use, but after I got the hang of it found it very easy to use.  I use the regular pik and tongue cleaner the most and do use the product daily. The chord storage is great - the coil chord holds up and stays neat after use (could be a tad longer though).  I love the multi-speed adjustment but haven&#x27;t had to go pass 4 yet for anything.  For me, this was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik. It works well, and shows that just brushing is not enough. I can see why they&#x27;re not more popular though. You have to develop a technique for using it. If you&#x27;re not careful you can get sprayed in the face, or all around the bathroom. My only complaint is that it is somewhat noisy.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS THING! It&#x27;s awesome. Exactly as described. Just lean over the sink to avoid a mess. Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> My dentist has been hassling me to floss for years and I hate doing it.  I refuse to.  I keep getting told that my teeth will fall out of my head in the near future and that scares me, but not enough to floss.  I use a Philips Ultrasonic and that has helped a bit, but my gums were still sensitive during exams.      So, I decided to try the Waterpik.  The first few days it hurt a bit but every day I was able to push the power up a bit and it has gotten a lot better.  I have seen food come out that the ultrasonic missed and I can actually see more space between my teeth when I look in the mirror.  I have yet to go to an exam since purchasing this device but I have no doubt that it will be an improvement.     What I like:    It works  It&#x27;s cheap  It&#x27;s quiet  It looks professional  The water tube automatically retracts    What I don&#x27;t like:    The reservoir is too small (it barely lasts through my cleaning)  Pressing the hold button makes the device sound like it is being severely stressed    Frankly, if they doubled the size of the reservoir I would give this product 5 stars.  The hold button issue is very minor.    Overall, if your dentist is bugging you to floss and you hate doing it, give this a shot.  The price of the Waterpik is far less than one visit to the dentist (and less than any gum or below gumline work) so this is kind of a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> It seems to work quite well. Some other reviews mentioned a lack of power: it seems to have quite a bit of power, assuming you don&#x27;t need to sand-blast. I personally use the \\&quot;Pik-Pocket\\&quot; tool and it seems to get into the pockets next to the gums caused by minor periodontal disease. Another review mentioned that the stream from this tip is weak, but I think that&#x27;s intentional. You&#x27;re not trying to blast stuff out of there, and it probably needs to be a bit more gentle. If think you have major periodontal disease, however, best get thee to a dentist: I think it&#x27;s most effective on minor cases (4-5 mm).    One thing that seems quirky is the angle of the heads they include. Presumably the angle is based on scientific research, but it seems to me that a sharper angle would do a better job, at least for the \\&quot;Pik-Pocket\\&quot; attachment. The other little negative is that it seems to get water everywhere - not only because of poor technique in using, but taking the reservoir in and out gets everything wet. I agree with other reviewers that you should never leave water in the reservoir between uses, lest stuff grows in there. There&#x27;s a reason why they say don&#x27;t drink stagnant water!    One more good thing about it is that you might finally be able to get your kids to floss! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it only instead of flossing, but if you&#x27;re among the 90% of people who don&#x27;t floss, you&#x27;ll be better off with the WaterPik than nothing.    Overall, I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have been totally pleased with my purchase.  It amazes me how much stuff this thing cleans out.  On my last dentist appointment, the hygienist commented on how much better my gums looked so very pleased.</li>
    <li> Well, I must say as an adult who finally got braces to correct a bite problem, I could not do it without my new Waterpik Ultra. I was always a fanatic about keeping my teeth clean and flossing, so when I thought about how difficult it would be to floss properly with my braces, I decided to order this Waterpik from Amazon.com before my braces appointment. It arrived in just a few days and boy am I glad it did! The amount of stuff that can find its way under these braces is incredible, but the Waterpik flushes everything out in a hurry.  When I&#x27;m at home, I find I&#x27;m doing it every time I snack. (It&#x27;s actually kind of interesting to see what comes out...)    As a test, I decided to floss and carefully clean my around my braces and teeth. Then I did a thorough brushing and rinsing. Certain I was completely clean, I used the Waterpik. Yikes! It flushed more stuff out. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Now, I use the Waterpik first and brush after. I use Warm water in the tank and do two tanks full for good measure. I definitely, highly recommend if you have braces - or just spaces between your teeth. Frankly, I doubt I will stop using this after my braces are removed as I feel it gets small particles out that I couldn&#x27;t get otherwise, plus I think it is therapeutic for the gums.    **Update 1/8/11  My dentist and his hygienist were surprised at how clean my teeth were at every appointment during my wearing of braces. The hygienist said I had virtually nothing to clean! I truly think using the Waterpik several times a day kept me from building any plaque on my teeth and kept my gums from having any issues.     Note: Just wanted to add that this comes with a 2-year warranty, which luckily I kept. The plastic hose sprung a leak at the 23rd month of my ownership and one phone call later, the company agreed to send me a replacement part, which I got and am now back in business.     My braces are off now and I still use it, but generally just at night. I still highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best looking water pik and works well.  Plenty of power, will do a good job cleaning things out from between the cracks.  Comes with different attachments that may prove to be useful.  More than worth the money if you think about what it costs in time and fees to visit your local dentist.  This and a good quality sonic toothbrush will keep you looking and feeling good.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Really gives a deep clean to keep those teeth and gums healthy!!!!  It&#x27;s well made and easy to operate...... Highly recommend over an electric toothbrush!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my husband, who has braces.  I tried it once and have been hooked on it ever since.  It is truly amazing how clean my mouth feels once I&#x27;ve used it.  For an added benefit, I sometimes add mouthwash to the warm water.     I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> if you want to have a clean niece teeth you cannot miss that product. highly recomendation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month now, usually use it twice a day. I love the way my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done, feel just like I&#x27;ve had them cleaned. I had a deep cleaning done, so I&#x27;m trying to avoid that again;) I&#x27;m anxious to see what my dental hyg. thinks when I go back. I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with it and would highly recommend. I got a great price, the local drug store was $60 and I got it for $40 here. The dentist had also given me a $10 off coupon, so I did good!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  The Ultra was received in perfect condition within the estimeted date.  It is a wonderful way to floss and if used properly does a great job.  I recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t floss regularly and the price is right. Just use it as the instructins suggest and you will have great results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I hate flossing, and this helps me compensate.  My old Waterpik lasted 10 years.  I loved my old one, but this is a HUGE improvement in several ways.  The cord to the pik is manufactured to auto-coil.  It&#x27;s extremely quiet.  Very powerful.  Lots of extras.  Well worth the money, especially if it lasts 10 years like my old one.</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik in 6 years and this brand is superior in all ways.  Pretty by site.  Convenient, easily for storage, looks great on the counter and most of all cleans, really cleans the teeth.</li>
    <li> I have not had a cavity nor a lecture on flossing from my dentist in the 18 months that I&#x27;ve been using this. I think it&#x27;s better than flossing! I wish I&#x27;d been using something like this all my life.</li>
    <li> I had a portable/rechargable Waterpik and it was good but the battery died. This thing is great!!!The settings, the tips, and the feeling of cleanliness after using this waterpik are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> My dentist tells me that my teeth have wide spaces and therefore collect food. Lacking the flossing gene, (no matter how many times they show me, my fingers still won&#x27;t fit into my mouth), I chose what I assumed would be the next best thing which is the Waterpik. After using the Waterpik for about a year, and being very happy with the results, I read an article in Science News saying that those who Waterpik and brush have better oral hygiene than those who floss and brush.     Regarding the reviews about water leaks, that is probably water running down the outside of the handle and tube during use that continues after it is put back on the shelf. At least that&#x27;s what happens with my machine. Regarding the comments about the unit not putting out water after a few uses, that is also probably from water running down the handle and causing the button to stick in the off position. Again, that&#x27;s what happened to me. Remember that water isn&#x27;t clean, it will gum up the button. Solution, don&#x27;t use the button. Put the wand in your mouth first and then turn on the machine. Use all the water in the tank and only take the wand out of your mouth after the water pressure drops to zero. Sorry to make this sound like I&#x27;m talking to third graders, but I can&#x27;t believe how some people will take the time to bad mouth a product instead of figuring things out for themselves. This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Had the older water pic, had to throw it away after many, many good years of service.  Read all the reviews on the Ultra Dental Water Jet, bought it, this is the best.  Plenty of water pressure,(I have mine at #5).  Yes it makes noise, and yes you&#x27;re dealing with water, so it leaks a little when you remove the reservoir.  I will say, with all the added new  features, this is much better than the older models.</li>
    <li> I find the unit to be excellent in operation. I find that the water resevoir is a little small. I always seem to run out of water before finishing so I keep a large glass of water nearby and pour that in. This problem did not exist with my older Water Pik. Other than that it is a great unit.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik we have owned. Its easy to use and well worth the price,but it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Waterpik.  It amazingly removes food particles that brushing and flossing miss.  It also blasts away the odor causing bacteria between teeth and under the gum line like nothing else can.  My only disappointment is that it should come with enough standard tips for an entire family.  This model comes with only two standard tips, but has four other speciality tips. I gave the Waterpik five stars because I knew it only had two standard tips when I purchased it.  I just couldn&#x27;t find a model with more.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to perform but I am very happy with the purchase.  Recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> We have used a Waterpic for years. This products is better than the others we have had,</li>
    <li> Waterpick is the best thing I ever bought for teeth health care.  My mouth and teeth feel so clean, and my gums feel great.  I would advise everyone to use this product.  Bernadette Rossi</li>
    <li> Price, availability, and product were all the best.  I would recommend this online purchase for any one who would like healthy gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> Got this after a visit to the dentist in which everyone in my family were told we had cavities.  Leaves them ultra clean, quickly and is great to get young family members used to so they develop a hygenic lifestyle.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job of cleaning, as long as it&#x27;s working!  Mine was about 2 months old when the thumb button--which, when depressed, stops the flow of the water to keep messes to a minimum--became stuck, so no water would flow.  It had been an intermittent problem prior to that, but now it is permanently stuck.  In trying to get it to release, the entire handle split open--and still the button was stuck down.  I had an older Water Pik model before this one, which also quit working after a few months&#x27; time.  I am looking for a new brand......</li>
    <li> I came back from the dentist with news that I needed to be flossing more. Since I don&#x27;t find flossing to my liking I asked if I could use a waterpik and the hygienist gave me the OK. I purchased it and to my surprise it arrived within the week. I have begun to use it and I&#x27;m pleased with its ease of use.</li>
    <li> I guess it works ok,  my dentist has noticed some improvement in gum condition</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Waterpick Ultra and am immensely pleased with it.  It is a vast improvement over older models.  I&#x27;ve used waterpicks for over a decade and found that the older models had flaws.  In particular, the adjustments for the strength of the water flow was too imprecise allowing for vast differences in the force of the jet from one level to another.  The result was that if was impossible to get the strength of the jet just right.  That problem has been corrected in the Waterpick Ultra as the settings are much more sensitive.  Also, I like the design change of putting the waterpick heads in a compartment that is part of the top cover.  Finally, the design is much more compact and aesthetically pleasing.    Some reviewers have stated they prefer the old design--not me.  This one is much better than older models.</li>
    <li> I am an adult wearing braces. Now, think about trying to floss your teeth while wearing braces -- not an easy thing to do. My oral hygenist suggested that I try a Waterpik instead of trying to thread floss between my braces. She also suggested the cordless Waterpik for travel and taking to work. I bought them both at the same time, and my life is so much easier now. What a time saver this is! I highly recommend this and the cordless Waterpik. My teeth have never felt so clean. Why didn&#x27;t someone tell me about this years ago? Don&#x27;t wait to get braces to try it!</li>
    <li> Ever since I started to use this waterpik, I have noticed a change in my oral hygiene. It comes with different tips that help get the job done.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is that I&#x27;ve been able to add mouthwash to the reservoir (mixed with water). I followed the instructions and make sure that I add warm water afterwards to flush it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it back in May or June 08 and it is still working with the leaking I&#x27;ve come to expect from these type of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its 2013 and the product is still working even though I don&#x27;t always clean it out after each use. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Wow! who knew waterpik would be such an amazing and fabulous product.      My dentist recommended this product (I know this part sounds like an ad but its true).  Prior to her recommendation I never thought of using a waterpik because I figured good ole&#x27; fashion flossing was enough...\\&quot;NOT\\&quot;!!  OMG... the amount of food particles that are flushed from between my teeth after flossing is UNBELIEVABLE.  This is a MUST HAVE!!    On another note... I could only withstand starting with the first power level when I began using this tool.  2 weeks later I was able to move to level 2 and I&#x27;m hoping to increase my levels gradually.  However I can&#x27;t imagine using the highest level 10... I&#x27;m assuming one must have gums of steel to accommodate this level... a goal I don&#x27;t mind trying to reach.    This should be a required product for everyone.  This is the best dental product I&#x27;ve ever been introduced to.    After using this I want to go to the dentist!!</li>
    <li> I choose four stars because it is good for my orthodontal appliances, but things happen.&lt;br /&gt;When you spit the water out;because you have to after a few minutes, the pause button isn&#x27;t always as quick as you.&lt;br /&gt;It has splattered on my mirror many a time. Quite annoying if you ask me, but other than this, the quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;You can buy this amazing appliance, but beware of the squirting hose if you do! :)</li>
    <li> The waterpik performs as advertised, and does a much better job of removing food particles from between my gums than floss...with a lot less hassle.  Particularly from the hard to reach places between the rear molars.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik Ultra Dental jet we have bought.  My son has had braces for 18 months and needs to use this product constantly.  It works great and was recommended by his Orthodontist&#x27;s office staff.  The price is reasonable.  They don&#x27;t last forever with the constant use, but we just bought another one after the firstr 18 months.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this waterpik.   It is easy to use, so easy that my 10 year old has been using it too.  My mouth feels cleaner.  I would recommend it.  I have only tried a couple of the attachments so far, but even with just those it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik it is not loud like my old one was I love all the attachments that came with it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month now and am very satisfied with it. I used to floss twice a day and the dentist recommended I try a waterpik instead. I find it easier than flossing and my teeth feel cleaner afterward. Will know for sure after my next checkup.    It does take some getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I tried the cordless type twice before and both quit after about 3 months use. Waterpik did send a free replacement after the first one quit, but I decided to go with the cord type this time and have been very pleased. Get the same or better results. My dentist is pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this after returning Conair Interplak Water Jet which stopped working after one week.  Prior to that, my old ViaJet Pro oral irrigator got a broken hose because of  poor design that presses the hose against the base of the unit.  This flosser is much more quiet than the ViaJet and does not have the same design problem.  This Waterpik has continued working for a month with a good amount of pressure.  I wish that it had a slight longer hose, but all-in-all, I am favorable impressed thus far.</li>
    <li> It helps to floss your teeth, and give your gums a wonderful massage. I have already recommended this product to couple friends. 3 of them ordered it at Amazon, and all of them love it.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be ok.  It is a little large for the top of the vanity, but I purchased it for my 12 year old daughter with braces on a recommendation from my sister, the dental hygenist. It is suppose to be great for kids with braces.  It has an orthodontic tip and she figured out how to use it all by herself, so easy to use.  Wish it was a little smaller, however. Nice thing to have in the house when you are too busy to floss!</li>
    <li> I got the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for my grandpa for Christmas. He opened it and said he&#x27;d never use it, he can be a grump. I told him to just try it cause I took the time to buy it. The next time I saw him, he thanked me over and over and said he doesn&#x27;t know how he got by without it. He&#x27;s thanked me every time I see him. He loves it! Best present I ever got him.</li>
    <li> This little appliance beats flossing by a mile. Really cleans and leaves your mouth feeling really fresh and healthy. So easy to use with an assortment of attachments that make oral maintenance a breeze. I&#x27;ve used other ones but nothing comes close to this device. I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and flossing is not your favorite past time - get the waterpik.  Already have good feedback from my dentist and this makes the process much faster and easier!  It&#x27;s also beneficial if you have the stupid permanent retainer on your bottom teeth - totally worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I got this because I was advised to get a deep cleaning (ouch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this, I always thought that bleeding gums were just something I simply got whenever I flossed.  But after using the Waterpik, the bleeding gums went away FAST.  I still use real floss daily, but now I also Waterpik at least 3 or 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums no longer bleed - something I had never experienced before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks for about forty years and have gone through most of the models that the company put out. They do a good job at what they&#x27;re designed to do, but they don&#x27;t last long. This is the second Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser I&#x27;ve bought. The previous one lasted about four years. At some point I replaced the handle assembly (including the flexible tube), but eventually the motor gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I thought it was the best Waterpik the company had ever made. All the things I didn&#x27;t like about previous models had been fixed (except for the problem of the short life). The footprint was smaller, the flexible tube stored easily and neatly in its designated place, and it was more attractive (or at least less unattractive) to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order a new one. But my new Waterpik -- even though it has the same name and model number (WP-100W), and even though they were both made in China -- is not the same as the one it replaces. For one thing, it&#x27;s 37% lighter in weight: 1.275 lb, versus 2.025 lb for the previous edition. It&#x27;s light enough that when you try to push the on-off button, the whole device tends to slide backward, making it difficult to turn it off. (Turning it on is easier, because the full water container provides some extra weight.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also considerably noisier, though the manufacturer states on the Amazon website that the &amp;#34;Improved Design is Quieter and Ergonomic.&amp;#34; My previous Ultra Water Flosser was not excessively noisy, but this one sounds like a jackhammer -- I&#x27;ve seriously considered using ear protection when I clean my teeth. Perhaps, when they reduced its weight, they eliminated the aspect of the Improved Design that made it Quieter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third complaint -- admittedly a minor one -- is that this Ultra Water Flosser is less attractive than my previous one. The water container of the previous one was a nice, conservative dark blue -- a modest color that didn&#x27;t cry outfor attention. But the new one is a neon greenish-blue that jumps out and stabs you in the eye. Of course, this is just a matter of taste -- neon greenish-blue might work very well with the color scheme in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this Ultra Water Flosser had been as satisfactory as my previous Ultra Water Flosser, I would have given it a 5-star rating. But it&#x27;s not, and I won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have a permanent lower retainer which I&#x27;ve had in my mouth for 10 years now.  For the longest time, I was considering getting it removed because I hate how difficult it is to floss around it using the threaders and such.  I looked around online long enough to realize that the risk of removing my retainer was that my teeth would revert back to their overcrowded, shark-like jaggedness.  Anyway, I heard a lot of good things about this Waterpik as an easy and effective solution for flossing between and around permanent retainers, not to mention that it is very healthy for the gums so I gave it a shot.    Let me tell you, I LOVE MY WATERPIK!  I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is, as I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months, but it makes cleaning my gums an easy part of my daily routine instead of a chore (which is how I used to feel about it).  The Waterpik seems like it is decent quality, and I would guess that it should last a little more than a year before it breaks.  Time will tell, but if it lasts 10-12 months, I would still be satisfied.  This product works very well and it was a savior for me as a solution to threading/flossing the frustrating permanent retainer in the bottom of my mouth.    The water blasts/pulses are very powerful and you&#x27;ll be amazed at the kind of gunk/food you&#x27;ll see fall out of your mouth and into the sink.  It is important to keep your lips semi-closed to prevent water from splashing all over the place.  If you&#x27;re not careful, this machine can be messy.    Also, be careful not to move up to full power (level 10) too quickly because you might get a little bleeding as my girlfriend quickly found out, but for those of you who floss quite regularly, I had no problem moving to level 10 right away.  One complaint that I have is that the water tank runs out too quickly, but it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal to turn it off, remove the tank, and fill it back up with water.  Takes about 10 seconds... no sweat.    I have already convinced another friend of mineto buy this and he said that he loves his Waterpik too.    In closing, I can honestly say that if I didn&#x27;t have my lower retainer, I would have never bought this.  I don&#x27;t mind flossing one bit on my teeth that do not have the permanent retainer, but I could imagine that if you don&#x27;t like flossing at all in the first place, this would be a great alternative to not flossing at all.    So I recommend this product to two types of people in particular:  1. People with permanent retainers/other devices in their mouth that are difficult to floss around and through.  2. People who do not like to floss in the first place and are having a difficult time making it a regular part of their hygiene routine.    *****UPDATE***** 05/13/2010:    For a long time now, I&#x27;ve actually been using my Waterpik to blast the hairs out of the three, four, and five-blade shavers when hair gets stuck in them and the running water from my faucet doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  I haven&#x27;t checked through other reviews to see if other people are doing this, but the Waterpik is worth it for this function alone.  If you&#x27;re tired of having hairs stuck in between the blades of your Mach 3, Quattro, or Fusion razors (or other manual razors), get this Waterpik and blast those hairs out (in addition to getting yourself an excellent device for keeping your mouth/gums clean).    Please be aware that you&#x27;ll get a little bit of splashing, but it&#x27;s great because you can use those blade cartridges longer and get better results from them by having the hair cleared out of them.  I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t include this in my original review.  Perhaps, I&#x27;ll find another use for my Waterpik over time, but this is one of my favorite purchases EVER.  I&#x27;ll buy another when this one breaks.    *****UPDATE***** 6/8/2011  About a month ago, I plugged this Waterpik in and it finally broke after 2.5 years.  I already miss it (mostly for blasting water from between the blades of my Gillete Mach3, Fusion, and Schick Quattro razors.I plan to buy another Waterpik soon, and I still give it 5-stars despite breaking after a solid 2.5 years of regular usage.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought the Waterpik. My gums were getting in pretty bad shape. Bleeding and gingivitis were almost a daily constant... and it was getting worse. I decided to buy a Waterpik ultra to see if it would help. Within 3 days my gums looked better and stopped bleeding. After 3 weeks I have no traces of gingivitis and my gums are now pink instead of red. They are also regenerating and filling in the spaces between my teeth as when I was younger. I give this gadget a 2 thumbs up. Incidentally, this device is very very similar to what my dentist uses during cleanings. Makes you wonder why they never recommend Waterpiks..... They Work!</li>
    <li> Bought the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet on September 27, 2008 and it no longer works as of today December 27, 2008.  To only work for 3 months is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!  Just like that there is no water pressure anymore.  When the Waterpik works, there is nothing that beats it for oral hygiene but this product or any other should not be allowed to be sold if it can not work MINIMUM one year...  Amazon&#x27;s return policy is only good for 30 days so now I have to deal with Waterpik directly.  There is a 2-year warranty through Waterpik...</li>
    <li> This newer model (compared to the 5 year old one it is replacing) is much smaller, lighter, quieter and easier to use than it&#x27;s predecessor.  It has the usual interchangeable jets, and delivers plenty of pressure when used with the correct nozzle and setting.  Well worth it to include in your daily arsenal against tooth and gum decay.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!!!  I bought this after reading a few reviews, and let me tell you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.      I don&#x27;t like to floss, never have.  I&#x27;ve also had problems with bleeding gums, and never really cared for the dentist.  The next day after I used the Waterpik, my gums bled less, and now that I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now, my gums no longer bleed.    The only grip I have with the product is the optional tongue cleaner.  It doesn&#x27;t work well, but thats not why I bought the Waterpik</li>
    <li> MY DOCTOR SAID IT WOULD HELP PRESERVE MY KIDS TEETH, WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND IT AT SUCH A GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> Works like the Waterpiks I used some 30 years ago as a child.  A little quieter and smaller than the ones I used and probably not as well made.  The water tank could be about 1/3 bigger to give you adequate time to really clean your teeth/gums.  The storage bin on top of the tank is a bad design I think because it has limited air flow (piks may stay too moist and things may grow) and the piks tend to fall out of their slots too easily when you remove the top to add water.  Give how well consumer appliances are typically built I&#x27;m giving this four stars (if I wasn&#x27;t grading on a curve, I&#x27;d probably give it three).</li>
    <li> The product is meeting my expectations in the first weeks I&#x27;ve used it.  It&#x27;s easy to fill and seems to have the right size of container for a single use if you fill it all the way up.</li>
    <li> bought this to replace a much older and much used waterpik. they have really improved! i love the way the tips are kept out of site in the lid. the water pressure is super, too. it is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> I have had waterpiks for years and the one I just purchased from Amazon is the very best.  The design is excellent and much improved over the older models.  I like the smaller water container and the lid for it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this, and at first I thought I would never use it. I thought the last thing I needed was another time-consuming daily ritual.  But once you use the Waterpik it becomes a bit addictive.  I love the clean healthy feeling, often adding in a bit of mouthwash for a real tingly feeling.  The product is well designed and works great.  It takes up a bit of counter space, but is worth it.</li>
    <li> The waterpik ultra dental is a great product. It doesn´t require batteries and has different water presures, so you can adjust it for your need. Also, it comes with 6 different pieces for different levels of teeth clean.  Great product and it has helped me a lot with my gingivitis problem for the last 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than the portable version that Water Pik makes.  This has great water pressure and a large tank.  I am very happy with how well it works.  I have braces and this is perfect to get food left between the teeth and braces.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a waterpik since they first came out. This one is working perfectly so far.  I haven&#x27;t tried all the attachments yet.  It&#x27;s easy to use and is very effective.</li>
    <li> My gum recession measurements got into the 5&#x27;s.  I got the pik and 4 months later I was in the 3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s.  Except for one hard to reach spot. It was a 6.  I empty two tanks with each use.  Right after I do a sesame oil pull.</li>
    <li> This my second one. The side plastic clamp broke after a year and I had to secure the handle with Velcro. But it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought another one for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After using the Waterpik for a month I decided to take it apart and clean it. I was letting it dry out well but thought about the hose and wondered how it completely emptied. Well I got my answer-it doesn&#x27;t. After rinsing it out with vinegar, large black speckS of dried up mold spewed out. It was very upsetting. After 3 filled container attempts I could not get the hose to run with clear water. I threw it out. BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Well in a quest to take better care of my teeth I wanted to get away from \\&quot;string\\&quot; flossing and use a better tool. I got this around $54 out the door via a third-party and based on the reviews I look forward to its arrival. Upon delivery and unboxing, I was a bit put off by its appearance. Cheap plastic-like look and feel. The security of the lid is fair at best. I would have liked it to be a bit of a stronger material so if it were to tip over (unfilled) the unit would not fall apart. It would be nice if the unit were heavier too.     I did a test run to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; the unit. I used warm warm and hydrogen peroxide. This let me get a feel of how the system work, the pressure and so forth. After the trail run, it was late, so I decided to give it a try. WOW!!! Even at the lowest speed, I could feel it working. Then I rinsed, brushed and used the WP again. It still got out some hard to reach junk between my teeth. It will take me a few chances to get good at using the tools effectively.     I would like this to last the long haul. I am unsure how long a system as such would last.     This is a good product with a few quality issues that keeps it from being excellent. In reality, as long as its cleaning ability is top notch, proper care and use should help it function well over a normal span. I am glad to have made the purchase and hope to have extremely healthy gums via daily usage.</li>
    <li> Still advised to floss with a regular toothpick to get everything off, but this definitely can help clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> I loved this and used it everyday.  This week, very minimal power and it is turned up all the way.  I suspect maybe it could be clogged but it no longer has power to do any good.  I don&#x27;t want to have to purchase this every year.  Good deal for them.  Will try and take it apart and see if there is any blockage, but for now, it is not useful.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made and a must for anyone slightly interested in having easier dental visits.  What could make more sense than a high pressured water spout ejecting left over food and debris from between your teeth, the same tool essentially that your dentist uses.  All those years of flossing and my teeth have never been as clean, nor mouth as fresh, as since I started using this product.  It seems little by the little the secrets of the dental profession and proper teeth care are released to the public, or perhaps &amp;#34;slowly leaked&amp;#34; is better way to put it, out of fear we will all stop going to the dentist at some point.  Well with this product your halfway there.</li>
    <li> It gets little messy because the whole time the floss is done with water..you have to keep ur mouth open to let go the water out..so I find it a difficult job to an extent and most of the time I prefer using normal floss because it takes time and effort.</li>
    <li> GREAT flosser, can make it hard or soft.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Great feature that I could adjust water strength as my gums got stronger. Really seems to be making a difference than flossing.</li>
    <li> This waterpik ultra is the bomb it&#x27;s a bit messy with the water splashing about the place but it really washes between the teeth beautifully👍</li>
    <li> The dental exam that use to be a torture was a breeze. No bleeding  or pain at all during the probing and measuring. No more pockets!</li>
    <li> Wished I would have bought a waterpik years ago.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the water flosser stopped working after the first use. I had really high hopes for this to work reading all the different review. Total waste of money I wish I can return it.</li>
    <li> Be careful with your orders to Ukraine. I forgot about Watt issues and  flosser was burnt.... but  it&#x27;s a good and nice product. I am repaired it at use normally.</li>
    <li> This is noisy and you hae to make sure attachments are perfectly locked in.  It feels cheap and not sure how long it lasts.  It is working for now and does the job and I love having a flosser.  Really helps to keep gum line clear and get things out of my teeth the brush leaves behind.  Just not sure how long it will last - but will update if lasts a year and change rating.  Just feels cheap and noisy.</li>
    <li> Have only had this product for 2 days but so far am somewhat pleased with it.  It does what it says, it does clean between your teeth very well, after 2 days use on lower settings I have already noticed a difference in the amount of plaque on my teeth.  My teeth are very close together and getting floss between them is nearly impossible, this water flosser seems to work just as good if not better than flossing the old fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it 5 stars because of these drawbacks: it is very loud, it vibrates quite a bit against the counter, I had to place it on a towel to help dampen the sound.  Do not fill the water tank until you are ready to use it, as soon as you put the water tank on water begins to fill up the tube and begins flowing out of the spout, same thing happens if you finish before the tank is empty.  It takes some practice in to how to operate it without spraying water everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great tool to use after eating. I have small gaps in my teeth that capture pieces of food and meat after eating.  I use this water pick after and see all the small pieces of food that come out in the sink.  I gets a lot of the food out, but it does not replace flossing. When the meat and food get stuck in tight spots, you will still need to floss to get them out and scrape off the plaque. However does a great job on the go.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!  I bought 2 waterpiks within a 3 year period. The first one&#x27;s valve broke down within a month. I bought another one a  month later and the valve broke down again.  Not wanting to bother with customer service, I realized I could use my finger to push down the valve to make it work. 2 years later, the machine completely broke down.  I saw on the box it had a 3 year warranty. Rep said only parts and since motor was running and wanted to send me parts, not a new one. I told him I have receipts for both orders. I asked for a new waterpik and he refused.  Both broke in less than 3 years. Rep also told me that I could get a free valve and that people call in all the time for that. Then I told him, that the valve must break down frequently for a company to offer to give to customers.Plus, my valve broke down twice after 1-2 months of usage. Nothing was explained to me to the contrary, as my experience was a common customer complaint.  Be careful.</li>
    <li> Great tool for healthy teeth and gums. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great water flosser. Found a cheaper one at target. Great attachments.</li>
    <li> Generally I can say I like Waterpik for flossing and gum health and will probably continue to buy these. However after a recent move when I couldn&#x27;t find my Waterpik I went ahead and bought a new one. The plastic clip that you return the wand to broke almost immediately. So now I have to prop the wand against the wall as it wont stay clipped in place. It makes me use it less because its more of a hassle. I don&#x27;t know if I had a defective one or if this is poor construction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing for years, but this is my first water jet product. I wish I had bought something like this a decade ago because my teeth and gums would be a lot healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- jet current is very strong on 10. If you&#x27;re getting a weak jet, you are probably using the wrong nozzle. (That&#x27;s what I did to break it! See notes at bottom)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- angled jet nozzle sprays water behind and between teeth, where a brush can&#x27;t reach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- water jet is gentler on gums and teeth than brushing, massages gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- leaves my gums tingly w/ the clean feeling of having been freshly sandblasted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- very fast warranty response and parts replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I really hate the flip top storage compartment. It gets in the way when trying to lift off the lid to fill water. Also, there are 4 slots, but 5 nozzles (not counting the one inserted into the handle), so one of them has to sit loose inside the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- flimsy feeling handle and coiled hose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no real difference between 6 on the dial and 10 while using turquoise nozzle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- very noisy and creates a lot of rumbling during use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- takes up quite a bit of space on my limited sink countertop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product for the price and a good investment in your dental health. When I first got this unit, I was using it wrong. I chose the narrowest head (yellow) and cranked it up to 10, thinking I&#x27;d get the maximum blast force for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jet felt very weak, but I continued to use this configuration without trying the other nozzles, until 2 months later when the spring fell out of the operating handle and broke apart. I found out from customer service that yellow should be set to 3 maximum. They promptly sent me a new hose/handle (arrived in 3 days from CT). Replacement was very easy and took 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in those 2 months of sporadic use before breaking, I noticed an improvement in my dental health. In conjunction with the Waterpik, I have also been using an Oral B electric toothbrush and floss. My gums stopped bleeding after 2 wks of initial use, a problem I&#x27;ve had for years with manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I use the turquoise head on 10. Very powerful and leaves me feeling fresh, although still noisy with the rattling.s. My gums stopped bleeding after 2 wks of initial use, a problem I&#x27;ve had for years with manual brushing.

    <li> Love the waterpik! My dentist recommended I get one and I find it to be doing a great job on my teeth. I have already recommended it to my son.</li>
    <li> For the most part, like this product, but having problems with the knob on the pik holder sticking.  Other than that, pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This item comes with several pieces that can be switched out depending on what kind of clean you&#x27;re looking for or where you&#x27;re trying to clean. Unfortunately, it does not come with the tongue cleaner  which is a real shame. You have to be careful with this and start slow and work your way up in terms of power. You also need to make sure not to accidentally shoot it down your throat; the BF did that and now refuses to use it. It&#x27;s important that you keep the water holder clean and empty it after every use.</li>
    <li> Very good and worth five stars. It&#x27;s more than wonderful Thanks .will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;My friends and I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I love how this has a lot of settings. Great quality. I have had this for a while now and it is still running strong.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this and I bought it right away. You can brush carefully for 5 minutes and your mouth will feel all nice and clean. Then just let the flosser go to work and I can almost promise you that more food particles will appear. Healthy gums are vital for healthy teeth. The flosser is not a gimmick. Buy one and use it 2-3 times a day. You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> My whole family just started using the waterpick for about a week now and really like it a lot. We bought extra jet tips for each of us even though the system also has a variety of tip types. Mouth feels fresh and clean after brushing and using the waterpick.</li>
    <li> I have several places around crowns where food collects with every bite and I had trouble even flossing them clean.  My dentist recommended the Water Pik Ultra and I love it.  I have sensitive teeth so I use warm water and find it very soothing.</li>
    <li> The product came super fast! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and would recommend to anyone. Works better then I expected. Totally life changing!! Everybody needs one!</li>
    <li> My husband swears by these waterpik flossers.  His old one finally broke and until I ordered this one and it arrived, I heard how much he missed having one.  He says you get used to that extra clean feeling and floss just isn&#x27;t good enough. Thank you, now we can move on to other topics.</li>
    <li> My son got braces and was having trouble flossing, even with orthodontic floss picks. His dentist noted his gums were suffering and recommended a waterpik. This model comes with an orthodontic tip. I also like the closed water tank. My son has used it only a few times but he likes it and he says he can feel the difference it makes in helping clear out debris from his braces and teeth. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> My hygienist suggested I buy this and this the first time I&#x27;ve used one. So far it really cleans well and is pretty easy to use. Even after flossing when you think your teeth are clean, the water still finds more. I cannot compare it to any other similar products, but I think it was worth the cost. Also, I compared cost in local stores and this was by far the best deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 8 months and my dentist just said my gums look much healthier than the last visit. My gums are more pink color then red and less bleeding during cleaning.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Had the old version for over a decade. It was ok, but then I lost the tips. It was a few dollars more to get a whole new unit than to buy replacement heads. New model has more features, and more power. Also it makes less noise. Has a nice lid so dust doesn&#x27;t get in while not in use or in storage. Looks much better and has clear reservoir. Nice power setting old unit didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> Using a Waterpik is new experience. Through the use of tiny tapered tubes, water is pump at high pressure so that can flush out debris that gets in between your teeth. There is a pressure adjustment to prevent you from damaging your gums.&lt;br /&gt;The feel is amazing. I love to use it after eating popcorn. It gets all those tiny pieces of cornel that always get lodged beneath your gums.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with multiple attachment tips for massaging, brushing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine about every other day. I suggest you use warm water in the reservoir. It feels much better than cold tap water.&lt;br /&gt;I say buy one and have fun...it&#x27;s a different experience.</li>
    <li> Such a great product! My dentist recommended it to me, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It helped a lot with the changes I experienced in my gums postpartum (swelling, sensitivity). Leaves my mouth feeling fresh, teeth feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these in the past year, and both of them have become (apparently) clogged within six months. That is despite following their instructions on flushing out the Water Pik with clean warm water after using it. My advice? If you use a solution of water and something like Listerine, be prepared to see this piece of junk clog up within a few months. The instruction booklet even alludes to the fact this might happen. Same if you have hard water.</li>
    <li> As with many other reviewers, I have used this same model for years.  The results in terms of gum health when I first bought it were nothing short of astounding.  However, with this new unit when I pick up the reservoir to fill it, the rubber gasket leaks.  It will hold up just fine for about 3 weeks, then it will start leaking every time.  I&#x27;ve learned to quickly get it over the sink, then press down on the gasket, helping to minimize the mess.  When I emailed Waterpik to ask them to send me a new reservoir, Waterpik&#x27;s response was to simply send more rubber gaskets to me.  Hmmm...I hope they continue to do that after the warranty is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This NEVER happened on my last model, which lasted 4 years and was still working (just getting kinda scummy) when I replaced it.  I should have kept the last reservoir!  I will investigate other companies before buying another Waterpik.</li>
    <li> waterpik makes your mouth feels so fresh, and clean</li>
    <li> Even used at the lowest power level, it made my gums bleed. It also was very messy.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to my dental health routine.  Nice size too, not obstructive or oversized.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t possibly imagine how I survived without my water flosser. What prompted me to buy it was the fact that sinus trouble had settled in my teeth and flossing hurt. No More! This is one terrific product.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a few days and I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance to date.  The previous reviews seem to be very accurate and they did help me to make this particular choice in water flossers.  I guess the true test will be when I return to my dentist and they check my teeth and gums for plaque buildup or lack of same.</li>
    <li> Gums are healthier and my teeth cleaner since I started using the waterpik. I&#x27;m not a big flossier, but this works better anyway. My hygienist is always impressed with my how good my teeth and gums look.</li>
    <li> I have braces and the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works wonderfully to clean between my braces and teeth.  It is small and compact and is very easy to use.  It comes with additional tips which I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> Cleaned and maintained regularly for six months, using it about twice a day.  It no longer jets water with any force.  Sounds like the motor is struggling.  So for about $10/month I had a great product, but I&#x27;m going to try my luck with another company.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This is the only one I tried so I can&#x27;t compare, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and it&#x27;s working great.  Got many attachments, half of which I haven&#x27;t used at all.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended this product and it does everything as promised.  And it is great fun to use ... really.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had gotten into the habit of using a water pic decades ago.</li>
    <li> Noisy  and attachments are not as well made as might be. Does a fairly good job. Attachments clog easily and are difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> The water pick really cleans between the teeth.  Since I have been using it my checkups are better than ever and the gaps between my teeth and gums have decreased.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband upon dentist&#x27;s recommendation. It works well and his mouth is healthier for using it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Have used this for over a year now and it has always performed perfectly!  No quality problems whatsoever!  My dentist approves!</li>
    <li> this device works as advertised and has made a noticeable improvement to my dental health.  I was never a fan of the old style flossing but i am a huge fan of water flossing</li>
    <li> This is actually a pretty good waterpik. It remove all the crap that&#x27;s stuck between/on your teeth. I have the setting at 8 to really go at it. So far, I have been a bit lazy to use it. Only downside is that it does make a lot of noise and the splash damage (I don&#x27;t think this can be helped). I would recommend to you if you are looking for one.</li>
    <li> Water reservoir does not completely empty and needs to be wiped out after each use.  Other than that a good device to assist with oral health.</li>
    <li> Please hold up for years to come!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this....  It was pretty messy the first time I used this.... I hit the ceiling, the window...  What a laugh I had,....  But I am very happy now.  I was shocked after brushing, &amp; flossing, on how much &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; was till under my gums.. or somewhere else hiding?? ...  I had a roll with poppy seeds....  The seeds were coming out after I brushed (with sonic care) and flossed.  I just hope this unit can hold up for 5 years or so.  After reading about the motor in some other revies... I am nervous.</li>
    <li> I used to work as a dental assistant and always recommended a waterpik to all of the patients.  As I have gotten older, I find that my gums now need to be tended to on a daily basis and this waterflosser fits the bill.  Easy to use and very thorough.</li>
    <li> Works great-when I use it.</li>
    <li> Prodact the same as described. Love to use it</li>
    <li> Hubby and I are very impressed with this product.  Wished I had bought a waterpik years ago as my teeth might be in better shape</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING! If you have braces, YOU MUST GET THIS!! haha flossing would take me forever and I would often just give up. This thing is amazing. It feels like I went to the dentist and got my teeth cleaned after I use this. You can see all the stuff just come out of your teeth as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have braces I can not stress how much this was a life saver for me!</li>
    <li> My dentist is always telling me to floss more. I have tried several other things and just don&#x27;t like them.&lt;br /&gt;It is a mess, I have it mounted near the shower and just use it there, that way the water streaming out my head does not make a mess in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;works good, more attachments than I will use...</li>
    <li> Works but it&#x27;s built very lightly indeed. the hose coils but is difficult to coil correctly so the wand can be clipped back on the unit.</li>
    <li> I love it, it really easy to use and get all the food out. Myouth feel so.much cleaner using it.</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted user of the Waterpik systems for years.  Normally, I get several years use out of the Classic model.  I needed one for the vacation home and purchased this model WP-100 at a local drugstore.  It performed reasonably well until it refused to pump water.  One year of service is not a good deal at these prices.  Now, I am looking to purchase another Classic model Waterpik.  Hopefully it will last several years.</li>
    <li> It massages the gums, and flushes between the teeth. Several heads for different effects. Fill the reservoir with warm water.</li>
    <li> I really like this flosser. My hygienist recommend I get one, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s truly amazing how much I was missing with simple floss. My teeth and gums feel so much better using this. You cannot go wrong with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I had an older Waterpik, which I had for probably close to 10 years.  The new one is quieter and the water container is a perfect size for what I need.  A perfect replacement for my old unit.</li>
    <li> I expected better results.  At least as good as dental floss. So far I am disappointed with the results. bnot as good as expected.</li>
    <li> My family and I are so pleased with the results of using our Waterpik water flosser.  My husband had such a hard time flossing his back teeth and now uses the water flosser.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is easy to use and does everything one would expect from this product. It is compact and quiet.</li>
    <li> I have had no issues with my Waterpik and have had it for at least 6 months.  I use it 3 times a week and have had a great dentist check up.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement of an older model.  Works great.  Lots of pressure.  More compact than prior models.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> does a great job gets into all the spots in between teeth, it  is does get the sink area a little messy though from the spray</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this healthy addition to my routine of flossing and brushing my teeth.  Very happy with the product.  I use this everyday. The price was great compared to local stores like Walmart, Target, and Costco.</li>
    <li> i have been on the phone 3 times with waterpik to figure out why it has no pressure and keep getting the run around</li>
    <li> All of my Waterpiks die when the water hose cracks and breaks. Trying to fix it has been unsuccessful for me. So... I buy a new one every couple years. So far, I&#x27;m really happy with some of the changes in the newer model. The tips are easier to insert and remove, the water reservoir does not leak between when moving it from filling in the sink to the unit. That&#x27;s always been a problem for me. The dial on the unit makes adjusting the pressure easier. I&#x27;ve never had a brush head before, but it&#x27;s a nice addition and I find I use it every time to finish. I wish Waterpik made a softer hose that was less likely to crack and gave the user more usable length with less resistance. I&#x27;m not happy tossing an otherwise perfectly fine unit into the garbage because the hose broke. And yes, you can buy replacement hose... but good luck with that.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my interplak &#x27;water jet&#x27; after I accidentally pushed it off the counter.  When my new Waterpik arrived I noticed it was a little heavier and sturdier, also the on &amp; off switch was much easer to use than the difficult one on the &#x27;Water Jet&#x27;, also the motor was a lot quieter and the feel of the wand was sturdier and more professional. Some &#x27;reviewers&#x27; have commented that this &#x27;unit&#x27; is not powerful enough... You would have to have &#x27;Terminator&#x27; teeth and gums to say that.  I have it around half and it still makes my gums bleed a little !  I had a water pick a few decades ago and this is the best one yet at a very reasonable price and arrived ahead of time through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered three and everybody loves them including me.  I tried the different attachments and they all work very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use on a regular basis.  It is super easy for him to use. The price was great</li>
    <li> Much better than expected. After reading many reviews I  didn&#x27;t expect much but after using it for a week I just love it! My teeth look and feel as if I had a professional cleaning!</li>
    <li> Extra Clean teeth and gums... this is important.  Get this so you don&#x27;t have to use floss as much.  It doesn&#x27;t replace floss but it does one hell of a job.</li>
    <li> The Water Flosser works miracles on problems spots in the mouth where food collects or gums tend to swell. You will notice a difference for the better if you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does the job, it is very mediocre in its design. My original Water Pik was a squarishly-shaped unit and the reservoir turned upside down over the base for storage. The base was heavily weighted for stability. A very sensible and clever design. For example, the power button and pressure adjustment wheel were positioned so that using them did not tend to tip the unit over. This top-heavy unit must be braced against a wall or otherwise supported while pushing the power switch or adjusting the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit has a cover over the reservoir which also serves to hold extra utensils. It&#x27;s hard to grip to remove it. More than once I&#x27;ve tried to remove this cover to fill the tank and dropped it into the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is water in the reservoir when you pull it off the base the valve does not stop the water from pouring out the bottom. My very old original Water Pik never leaked a drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the unit being quiet, as touted by many reviewers, I respectfully disagree. This unit is as noisy as the original Water Piks. Why after all these years they are still so noisy is a mystery to me. It is loud and if anyone is trying to sleep nearby it will probably wake them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most annoying is the push button on the handle to stop the flow of water temporarily. Often when I press it the button does not return and I have to turn off the unit and pry on the button to get it to pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does the manufacturer still insist on making the wheel on the wand which adjusts the angle of the tip a featureless wheel? You can&#x27;t tell which way you need to turn that thing while flossing. Why can&#x27;t they make a protrusion on that wheel which is aligned with the tip so you can tell which way the tip is facing by feel? It is no fun to be flossing at the higher pressures and inadvertently turn that wheel the wrong way and direct the stream under the tongue or the inside of the cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have said, this device will perform the function for which it is sold. It is just amazing to me that after all these years the thing is prettier but not really improved in any way at all. In fact, it is worse than it has been. If my old harvest gold vintage unit had not sprung a leak I would have thrown this in the trash. Having said that, it is usable and does the job so I&#x27;m stuck with it.he higher pressures and inadvertently turn that wheel the wrong way and direct the stream under the tongue or the inside of the cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have said, this device will perform the function for which it is sold.

    <li> Water pin does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Even so, still have to to FLOSS, according to my dentist.</li>
    <li> My wife has adult braces and wanted to try one of these out based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  She said it has made it a lot easier to wash all the crud out from around her braces and between her teeth, so she doesn&#x27;t have to spend as much time using the flosser things.  I&#x27;ve started using the Waterpik Ultra in addition to my normal flossing because I think the two are complementary.  Each one does a better job in some respects, but is not as good as the other in some other respects. For example, flossing goes a great job wiping the scum off the surfaces of your teeth that the toothbrush can&#x27;t reach, and the Waterpik rinses away gunk from all the nooks and crannies where you cannot floss. I always use a full tank of water--first I make a pass around my entire mouth cleaning around my teeth, then I increase the power and make another pass just hitting my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching a video review comparing the new WP-660 with this older WP-100 model, we decided to go with the older model which seems to be built and designed better. The only features this older model lacks compared to the WP-660 are the timer and intermittent &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; setting, but I don&#x27;t see that feature as very useful, and you could mimic it yourself by using the thumb &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; button on the wand. We like the larger storage compartment, longer coiled tube, heavier construction, and better wand holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about the Waterpik Ultra is that the pump controls are on the base unit rather than the wand, but I understand this is a simpler and more reliable design.</li>
    <li> It feels really good and clean just after using it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably never use floss again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIghly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User-friendly.</li>
    <li> I bought Waterpik Water Flosser eight months ago, and I used it twice a week with no problems at all.Before buying the product, I checked customer reviews on Amazon and people had written positive things about it. I also read a few reviews where customers wrote about the problems they faced with this product, little did I know that I would also face the same problem one day. Anyways the machine stopped working altogether. I am able to turn on the switch, there is a sound which shows that machine is on but the water is unable to flow through the system of flossing. I feel I did not buy this product expecting it to work for a short period of time.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik was very easy to set up and use.  I like the way it makes my gums feel clean and refreshed.  I think this is a great product for anyone, especially those with bridges or braces.  I highly recommend this Waterpik, and I wil order this again.  My only complaint is how quickly the Reservoir emptied.</li>
    <li> The product worked well for about 4 months, but lately it has no pressure in the floss pic.  I wouls not reccomend the product to anyone, perhaps it is nbot as good as another model that is higher priced.</li>
    <li> easier to use too. love the design, the case for attachments and the water tank. only downside is the stream can&#x27;t be adjusted to a less intense spray.</li>
    <li> I feel my tooth clean and comfort after using it. But a little inconvenience is that it can only be used five minutes whin 2 hours.</li>
    <li> It worked great. Kind of hard to get used to it at first, but once you get the hang of it, cleans teeth well.</li>
    <li> pressure is not as strong as my old one. Believe the seal is not tight because water leaks from reservoir . Would have returned it but it seemed like too much trouble.</li>
    <li> It cuts my flossing in half and keeps my teeth cleaner for far longer after my dentist visits. Especially good if you have a permanent retainer or braces.</li>
    <li> It takes a little practice to learn how to use it.  I find myself pressing the pause button when I shouldn&#x27;t and not pushing it when I should.  Just takes a little getting used to.  Seems to work good, though and makes my teeth feel clean!</li>
    <li> This product stopped working after about 10 uses! Will not turn on at all. Nothing. I really wanted, needed this to help with a crown. Dissapointed beyond belief.</li>
    <li> If you hate to floss but your dentist told you that you need to, then I would get a waterpik. While it is messier than flossing, to me it gets more stuff out around your gums and helps to break up bacteria that can be deep down around the tooth. It is like putting a power washer in your mouth. You can control the force of the water and the different tips help with different applications. Also good for people with braces and can&#x27;t floss really well. This will help clean between your braces and get food out.</li>
    <li> Really works for under my bridge</li>
    <li> Easier to use than I expected.  I would recommend it in place of flossing. My dentist is the one who told me about it.</li>
    <li> Has really helped with kids who have problems getting hard to reach places.  Helps cure gingivitis.  Great unit.  Many different tips to help all kinds of teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have used a Waterpik for a number of years.  We wouldn&#x27;t be without it, it&#x27;s part of our daily routine.</li>
    <li> i love using this. it has improved my oral hygiene so much. i brush my teeth, floss, and use mouth wash and this has still helped me greatly. has many different tips to use on it and has the perfect water reservoir that lasts for about a minute. it offers a wide range of pressure also and is easy to clean. only con is the base is not heavy enough and it fell over the first time i used it so now im just more careful not to pull it to hard when using it. also i use warm water as cold water hurts my teeth. lol .i do not regret buying it and also its been 6 months and it still works perfect</li>
    <li> It cleans between my teeth and under my gums really well.  I am very pleased.  I highly suggest people use this for their own good health.</li>
    <li> Ok so heres to anyone who is looking into buying this. This is a great product, and im not just saying that, I got it initially because I have a permanent bridge right in the front of my mouth and anyone with a bridge knows that overtime it gets harder and harder to clean it and you dont want food to get stuck there thats for sure. Now i got this and once i started using it , my mouth feels so much cleaner, I dont even put it on more than the low setting because thats enough for me, my wife started using it as well and it really gets a lot out. I floss and brush and use this and it still manages to get some food out, and that over a period of time means a lot of money saved and a lot of trouble from teeth getting cavities or any other problems, really simple to use , i just add some mouth wash with the water and that makes my mouth feel even cleaner.</li>
    <li> good thing to use for bridges and braces.My boyfriend and my kids love it&lt;br /&gt;Pressure is good and enough tips provided</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist as a preventive measure to ward off periodontal disease. Works great and my mouth feels so clean after use.</li>
    <li> This is a great water pick, easy to use, does not take up a lot of room &amp; works great.  Even though I still floss this also helps with getting food out from between your teeth. My teeth feel cleaner &amp; I would buy again.  Plus it helps with making your gums stronger.  Plus I like the fact that is does have 10 different speeds to work up to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time &amp; have nothing bad to say about the company or the product.  Great Job!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Not sure how Aquarius is better than Ultra but for a first time water flosser, this is just fine. Really a much more fun way to floss!</li>
    <li> very good cleaner and i ill buy more for friends if u love to clean ur moth buy it now</li>
    <li> I never used another type of water pin so have nothing to compare it with.  However, I do love this one.  No matter how well I brush, the pin gets a tiny piece of something out into the sink.  I bought this brand since i had one for several years but the tubing broke.  I missed it so reviewed other types hoping to find one without a tube but the reviews said this one was still the best.  My dentist said he can see an improvement since I started using the pin.</li>
    <li> I have used either the Waterpik or similar products ever since they first became available.  I cannot imagine performing daily oral hygiene without such a device.  Some oral debris simply cannot be removed with just a tooth brush.  This product is particularly helpful to those who have non-regular, close or overlapping teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and let my wife use it.  She liked it so much that she had to have one of her own.  We both are extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had water flossers before - I like using them to start my mouth cleaning routine to get rid of all the big stuff before I grab the brush + toothpaste to scrub them down (similar concept to spraying your car down with pressure washer + water before going with soap by hand -- it allows the soap to get in to the tougher stuff instead of worrying about the obvious things). . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, opening the kit I was very impressed, the case, the storage, the compactness. it&#x27;s nice.  The power has a very broad range (I never go above 8 -- usually am at 7, my wife uses &amp;#60;7) ...  All is well, I thought I would love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I went to fill up the tank last night and I noticed the bottom of the water reservoir was leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a bummer. Usually top rated products on Amazon (which is mostly what I buy) are really high quality and last a lot longer. . .  No this :(</li>
    <li> Bought one of these last year,it supposedly has a three year warranty,good luck with that.This thing flat quit working for no reason,tried to warranty and never got a response,so will NEVER buy another water pik product again.</li>
    <li> seriously, no help at all.&lt;br /&gt;i got my braces and if you want to clean it like you do it as dental floss, your gum will be blown away. seiously, NO HELP AT ALL!! dont waste your time nor money $$$$</li>
    <li> Much quieter than the previous waterpik  we had. It still does the the same job. Not crazy about the storage for the tips, however, I like the variety of tips they give you. Also this machine takes up less counter space which is a real plus in our bathroom.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to others.  It is a very good product</li>
    <li> Brush your teeth for a long time then floss. Perfect! But, wait a minute, I just used my waterpik and guess what, there was a crumb between my back teeth and it was just flushed right out.....</li>
    <li> I see reviews from time to time where users complain that certain parts are prone to breaking, like the plastic tube that delivers water to the handheld device. I have not had any problems with this or any other movable parts. No leakage around the handle or any other things that are sometimes mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This water pic is my second of this model. The first one lasted 4 years before the plastic holder cracked. I was surprised that this happened because it&#x27;s not an especially vulnerable part. I kept the waterpik since it still works fine. In fact I have around 3 or 4 in my closet. So I&#x27;ve got enough older ones to fall back on if the current one breaks in an important way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price point of this unit it was easy assigning it 5-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading ... Sam</li>
    <li> Initially I was impressed that this Waterpik worked so well at removing the food bits between my teeth that floss could not; however, I purchased it in August 2015 and it no longer works in May 2017. I am very upset that the entire unit just won&#x27;t turn on. Clearly a defective motor or electrical parts. I am owed a new one since this is supposed to be under warranty for three years. I cannot recommend a product that breaks completely in less than two years.</li>
    <li> Does an awesome job on my sons teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the orthodontist recommend it when my son started to have braces and using regular flossing just takes too much time between teeth. After we bought this, he enjoys flossing and when we visit dentist, the dentist was impressed about how clean his teeth are.</li>
    <li> Huge problem as I live in Australia and the voltage is not correct, even with a converter - just sits in the cupboard taking up space</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been debating buying one of these for some time.  My Mother had one and we used it a lot.  Really does help with gum health as advertised.</li>
    <li> My last dental check up was great.  Teeth and gums in great shape.  Next appointment in 6 months.  Enuf said!  Buy this, you will not regret it for a second.  Use it once a day (before bedtime for me) and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> For as pricey as this thing is, it is  very cheaply made. The actual flossing is great. I have braces and it does a very efficient job and has several attachments that come in handy. However, after just a few weeks of use, the button that controls the water flow on the handle sticks each time I use it. It&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You&#x27;ll be so glad you did:-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I could survive braces without the Waterpik. Easy to use and very effective. I probably will continue to use it after I am done with my braces.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to replace 10 year old one we could no longer buy new tips for.  What a difference!  Very quite,  grip is much more ergonomic also has brush and tongue tips included.  What I was most impressed with it now has a lid so the reservoir is not sitting open and the lid is a storage piece for the tips, now everything stay nice, neat and clean in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on square trade offer as WaterPik is not one of the brands when you attempt to register.  Besides the manufacturer replacement warranty is a full year.</li>
    <li> very good and met my expectations...&lt;br /&gt;i have a big pocket and it helps immensely especially as i don&#x27;t like the normal flossing .&lt;br /&gt;great price too</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t understand how to use this device, despite being relatively technically inclined, and not a total imbecile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this was about a 15 to 20 minute ordeal.  I followed the provided instructions (mostly) and got it to a point where I was ready to use it.  (You do need to make sure to use body-temperature water, otherwise it will make your teeth cold.)  I set it to the lower setting as the instructions recommended, and used it a bit.  It really didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing much of anything effectively, other than splashing water out of my mouth.  So, I thought I would be adventurous and try a higher setting.  I did maybe 3-4 gaps in my teeth and still didn&#x27;t get the impression it was doing much of anything.  I could still tell there was gunk inbetween my teeth, like I still need to floss.  And, the water was more than half gone in the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I put the wand down and went on to do something else for awhile.  A little later on, I came over to the sink for some water or something, and stepped in a completely drenched mat in front of the sink.  I learned a lesson in physics about gravity, the hard way, that if you don&#x27;t keep the wand tip higher than the water level in the reservoir, you&#x27;ll get a wet floor.  Rookie mistake; sure.  But the whole experience just pretty much put me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if you don&#x27;t do the stupid things I did, and think it cleans your teeth well, you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  But I&#x27;m going back to the \\&quot;Plackers\\&quot; flossers.</li>
    <li> I have a bridge and this is necessary to keep particles from building up under your gum line. I had an older one and it recently broke. I bought this as a replacement and I love it. The pressure is adjustable but I use it on high when rinsing under my bridgework. It&#x27;s not cheap but Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I bought two units.  It worked well for one month then lost its water pressure significantly.  You will noticed that when it&#x27;s new, you can&#x27;t keep the dial at 10 because it would hurt your gum.  About a month of daily use, it won&#x27;t be able to floss certain food caught between teeth because of its lack of water pressure.  So I opened a new unit.  It worked well for about one month.  Then it lost its water pressure again.  I called the customer service for warranty repair.  The CS rep was kept giving me a run around that I need to descale the unit with vinegar.</li>
    <li> This flosser is so much better than regular flossing.  You would be amazed at what is really stuck between your teeth after eating.  I was just amazed.  Now I floss after eating and even snacking  since I want to avoid periodontal cleanings again.  Just love it and it comes with many attachments that can be used if you have crowns and/or bridges.  It&#x27;s just GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 15 years and on my third one--this latest model is better built than the previous two which lasted only a few years and I had to repair and replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave two of them as gifts to others.  This was one of my gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be surprised how much \\&quot;junk\\&quot; comes out when you \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with this device after meals (and using regular tooth brush and paste afterwards).  I had some tooth aches and gum swellings with which this device helped as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  1/30/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second person I gave this as a gift to liked it so much she asked me to order another one for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this with Gly-Oxide to solve most problems, along with a Gum brand toothbrush and the best value toothpaste--AIM.</li>
    <li> I bought this one, because my old one stopped working, right after the warranty lapsed. It does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have had a Waterpik for about 6 years before it gave out after daily use. I also use a Sonicare but found that the waterpik really gets in between the teeth and gums and gets the food particles out. Since having wisdom teeth removed, it seems everything collects between the teeth. I love adding saltwater and hydrogen peroxide to my waterpik for an ultimate clean. The saltwater kills bacteria and the hydrogen peroxide kills any infections. Regular floss doesn&#x27;t clean as well as this. I would recommend for anyone who want to really clean between the gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the single best investment I ever made in gum health, and my teeth directly benefit.  You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. Whenever she turns it on, this little box roars like a jet engine. Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> Now that I have gotten older my teeth have more space between them.  This works great.  I wish they had a mini version I could fit in my purse and take with me.  Can&#x27;t thing of anything negative about it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the older model that leaked after 2 years of use. This one is easier to alight the water tank. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I like that it is small to take up minimal counter space, yet it holds enough water to floss thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Cleans out almost all the gunk inbetween your teeth&lt;br /&gt;Has adjustable pressure levels if your gums are feeling sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Comes with different jet tips (thought I&#x27;ve only ever used the standard one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Water will inevitably collect on your sink top. I&#x27;ve tried using this in many different ways, but sometimes you just can&#x27;t avoid water dripping around.&lt;br /&gt;Pause button gets stuck. After about 2 months of use, the pause button started to get stuck. It&#x27;s very difficult to get it unstuck, so I&#x27;ve stopped using the pause button entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the cons aside, I think this is a great tool. It removes debris MUCH more effectively than flossing, and also saves a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, works well and feels good. Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;Click the stars to rate it. yes</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever purchased.  I hate flossing and this is so much more enjoyable!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, very simple to use, and a million times better than the hassle of flossing. I especially love all the attachments</li>
    <li> I had a toothache and I used this with a cap of listerine added to the water and by the end of the day the swelling of the gums went down, by the next morning my issue was over. I use it for  cleaning in between visits to the dentist this is first time I used it for an issue with my gums.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing!  I used to do it a few times a week. I have small teeth and big hands. Flossing is a pain!  So I tried this. Amazing results!  Cleans very well and it&#x27;s so easy!  Dentist saw improvements in my teeth and gums right away!&lt;br /&gt;Mix a little mouth was hot hydrogen peroxide in with the water sometimes for great results!  Make sure to clear it out with pure water after. Don&#x27;t start at a high pressure setting. Work up to 10. It will bast everything out from your teeth and if angled properly with get between gum and teeth. Floss is obsolete now, thank God because I hated flossing!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband, and he loves it! It came with lots of attachments and does a very good job!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately after the receipt of the device and when you want to use the device for a period of seconds his count and burn out, never used it and did not take advantage of it already bad industry</li>
    <li> I have had this for years and it still works like new. This is a great buy! Much better than the cheaper ones. It gets out so much junk out of your gums. I love it.</li>
    <li> Our second one - dentist loves that we use it - keeps hygienist down to once a year&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I know the value of flossing, but it always seemed like such a chore. I now look forward to doing it. My teeth and gums feel great and it only takes about 10 minutes of my time.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;Flossing with thread was very difficult for me. So purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;It solved my problem very well. I am NOT using much rest of the tools that are provided with product. I am NOT sure how the remaining tools works</li>
    <li> The only problem I see with the Flosser is that the pik seems to rotate rather freely when it&#x27;s in use.  This makes it a bit more difficult to direct the flow correctly.  Otherwise, a fine product!</li>
    <li> This little machine lives up to its promise.  I love it!  By the way, I had an older Waterpik years ago and tossed it as useless - too weak and took up lots of counter space.  This new one is really powerful and compact, and I love the lid, which keeps the tank clean.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of this it is a great tool if you already floss but I think even better for someone who does not.</li>
    <li> Waterpik is a great way to improve gum health, it is fairly idiot proof.  Just use it.  The dental assistant will notice a big improvement in gums at the next visit.  Problem is that after 3 years the hose broke and it is unrepairable.</li>
    <li> I have to only eat creamed corn now :(&lt;br /&gt;No more cavities though.  I don&#x27;t miss chewing gum much.&lt;br /&gt;YOLO!</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically because I keep getting white things lodged in the pockets of my tonsils, and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works well to dislodge and remove those smelly things.  I&#x27;m sure it also works for flossing, especially with all the attachments and multiple power settings, but I actually don&#x27;t use it for that.</li>
    <li> I use a few times daily. I especially like how quick it is at clearing &amp;#34;debris&amp;#34; away. Am also fond of how easy it is to use, especially when I&#x27;m too tired to brush. Brushing now is more about polishing, so I think there&#x27;s probably a bit of cost saving when considering toothpaste.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 8/2014: No leaking or loss of power.  Still working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of replacing Grossan Hydro Pulse machines every year and bought this.  This machine is not marketed as an oral irrigator and does not directly use the Grossan attachments, but with some modifications to the \\&quot;Pik-Pocket\\&quot; attachment, it works very well.  Here&#x27;s what I did:&lt;br /&gt;1. Removed the tiny rubber end&lt;br /&gt;2. Sanded the tip back until the hole was full width (i.e. not restricted at the output)&lt;br /&gt;3. Took an x-acto knife and reamed out the entrance restriction&lt;br /&gt;4. Shoved the rubber nasal tip from my Grossan machine onto it&lt;br /&gt;These modifications allow me to use my new Water Pik in place of the Hydro Pulse.  I can then switch tips and use it as an oral irrigator.  Either way this machine has a lot more power than the Grossan.</li>
    <li> i have noticed it seems to help my gums a bit but i still need to regular floss, which is dissapointing</li>
    <li> product is good..It does what it promises... no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again..... Only thing is the water container is a little bit small</li>
    <li> I like the variety of tips/brushes and have even put mouthwash in the water receptacle per the instructions. It gave my mouth a very fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Purchased this in September 2012. Within nine months the plastic &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; disintegrated. Waterpik replaced it, asking if I used hand lotion. Well, yeah. So what? If their inferior plastic doesn&#x27;t hold up to a small residue of hand lotion, why don&#x27;t they fix it? In less than six months the handle snapped off again. We plan to replace it with a magnet, something Waterpik should&#x27;ve done long ago since they apparently know about this defect. I haven&#x27;t experienced the other problems noted with leaking or the motor burning out but my husband did have to replace the hose on his, however, only after quite a few years. Great idea and excellent for gum care but lousy material renders the product inferior. Tired of paying for junk so manufacturers can increase profits at my expense. But what can you do? That&#x27;s the country/marketplace we live in.</li>
    <li> The waterpik works very good. I would like a long hose, as my bathroom is cramped for space an I had to mount it close to the sink.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice water pick.  It&#x27;s quite versatile, with many different heads and variable water pressure.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the bathroom counter and the cord is long enough to run from the sink to the side wall (I didn&#x27;t want to have to use an extension cord).  I would purchase this unit again.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Has lots of picks to choose from. Holds a ton of water to get the job done right. Easy to clean. Easy to use. The dial for different strength of pulsation is perfect.</li>
    <li> I used it 3 or 4 times, and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on any more.  Tried it in a different outlet, still nothing. Update: I am upgrading my rating because I complained to Water Pik and they sent me another even though I wasn&#x27;t within their 30-day window. Meanwhile, for kicks, I tried it in a THIRD outlet and it worked (though I do have to reset the GFCI sometimes). I don&#x27;t retract my earlier complaint, because needing to try THREE outlets is bad electrical engineering on their part. After about 10 uses, the pause button is starting to stick. So the workmanship is still crappy.  (And no, I don&#x27;t have excessively hard water.)</li>
    <li> The flosser is well made.  Since I have a shoulder injury, I need to be able to floss my teeth using one hand.  This is as advertised and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product works well -- the only thing is it comes with a lot of other attachments that I dont really need.  I would have preferred if the price was less and the manufacture keep all the other teeth cleaning modules or give us an option to add more picks to the unit for the same price.  The unit works great ...</li>
    <li> I bought this device several weeks ago...It works mostly as advertised, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m really happy with it. Using it is a MESS! The water supply tube that goes from the reservoir to the pik itself, is WAAAAY too short. I&#x27;m six foot one, so the only way I can use it is to get down on my knees over the sink. Maybe it&#x27;s me, but getting it to work on the same side of my mouth that I&#x27;m holding the pik is virtually impossible. You must change hands which is nearly impossible with the supply tube being so short. My general opinion is that I&#x27;d encourage potential buyers to exhaust ALL other options first. Sorry to be so negative!</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 of these in the past 40 years, so they seem to last about ten years each.  This one, like the others, does an excellent job of getting the small bits out from around my teeth that brushing and rinsing with mouth wash leave behind.  I have read other reviews complaining about it not working right and all the things they had to do to fix it.  This is stupid.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, send it back to Amazon.  They have the best return policy in the business.  Overall, an excellent product that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This will work for anyone.  It has setting for the most gentle of mouths and one hard enough to clean the paint off of the wall.  LOL</li>
    <li> I liked the setup with the different tools (i.e. attachments).  However, I was very disappointed with the water presure.  Even at the highest setting (i.e. 10).  It didn&#x27;t feel like the Waterpik I had before it.  It felt very weak.  I have periodontal disease and therefore need the pressure to force the food beneath my gums out. If I can&#x27;t get the food beneath my gums out I can lose my teeth.  So water pressure is very, very important to me!  The bottom line: I&#x27;ll start searching for another water flosser. Thanks for this survey.  God Bless!</li>
    <li> 12 yr old version went kaput. This is nearly as loud as that one was, would think they could have improved this by now?  Don&#x27;t try using this after others have gone to bed!  Otherwise works fine.</li>
    <li> Useful before brushing to dislodge soft food particle caught near the gums. Used with a mouth wash added it is refreshing. Easy to fill and charge.</li>
    <li> Update: Just discovered a safe way to quickly remove hardened or stubborn ear wax after experiencing a plugged ear. Simply adjust waterpik to the absolute lowest setting to avoid damaging/harming your inner ears. I used really warm water to help dissolve the wax. You may be shocked what comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my Waterpik on October 13, 2013, however It just stopped working this Saturday. When I turned it on, it sounded like it was straining. No water pressure &amp;/or it was very low. Furthermore reading the manual was of no help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, here&#x27;s what I discovered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start by removing the tip- by ejecting the Tip button (the thin horizontal button below control knob) Then aim or put handle in sink to avoid spraying water. Note: You may need to replace tip as debris gets lodged inside of the tip which is virtually impossible to remove. &amp; it&#x27;s recommended by Waterpik customer service to replace used tips every 3-6 months, especially if you experience low or no water pressure like I did. I do it once every 4 weeks &amp; mark on calendar for prevention to avoid dealing with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next pour one ounce or two tablespoons of White or Apple Cider Vinegar into reservoir along with a cup of hot water. This solution will remove hard water deposits &amp; other residues which is typically the cause of Low or No Water Pressure thus causing your Waterpik to No longer work. Repeat if necessary. I repeated this procedure 3X, before it suddenly started working again. Then fill your reservoir again with warm or hot water to remove any Vinegar residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to call Waterpik customer service 1-800-525-2774 &amp; request two black rubber valves. It&#x27;s inside of your reservoir, they leak or wear out eventually which would also cause of Low or No Water Pressure . It&#x27;s covered under your warranty at no charge to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click yes, if this review  helped you. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. My gums no longer bleed since using the waterpik started out at recommended setting then within 3 weeks at the maximum pressure setting!</li>
    <li> I thought this water flosser was great when we got it, it was strong and worked well. Probably around the 3 month mark, we noticed the stream of water was getting weaker. And the &amp;#34;engine&amp;#34; started sputtering inside the base piece. We&#x27;re literally at the 6 month mark and its practically useless at this point. Everyone knows a water pick needs to have a strong flow of water to push gunk out from in between your teeth. No strong water flow &#x3D; ineffective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t purchase something with the intention of only having it work for 3 months, so I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Better if used with warm water.</li>
    <li> There is nothing I can think of that has made a more remarkable difference in personal hygiene in my lifetime. In the last few years, I have seen a noticeable build-up on my front teeth when looking in the mirror. I have impeccable dental care, but this build up still appears even a few days after a hygienist cleaning. I overheard my dentist recommending the water pic to another patient, so I read the Amazon reviews and decided on this one. It IS necessary that I use it almost daily, which is not an inconvenience, but it has made a comforting difference. Yes, my mirror is 10X, but I am horrified to think that I was out in public with that build–up on my teeth! And if it&#x27;s on the front teeth, just imagine what damage it is doing to my molars where I can&#x27;t see!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth. This appliance DOES get all the yucky build-up from in and around it, too! Very,very pleased! Wish I&#x27;d gotten one years ago!</li>
    <li> Lost some of its force after about 2 months and off on switch doesn&#x27;t work. With the old ones the force was too strong beyond a 3 or 4. setting,</li>
    <li> The water flosser includes several attachments providing the user extensive cleaning ability.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it deep cleans under the gums removing food particles you never knew were&lt;br /&gt;there. Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for some time now and it has worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great, used every day.  You can brush your teeth after every meal but you will be surprised how much is still in your teeth.</li>
    <li> But I do like this flosser and use it all the time. Delivery was speedy too. It&#x27;s easy to use, the cord from the water to the pik coils up neatly.</li>
    <li> I should have gone with this Waterpik product from the \\&quot;get-go\\&quot;.  It works, its easy, my teeth are cleaner, I love it!  I wasted money, time and energy on something that was not as beneficial to the health of my teeth. I love Amazon, I always find the item I need and with Prime, I&#x27;m not grossed out over shipping cost!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Worked well for several months then began producing only tiny amounts of water - no pressure.  I sent it in for warranty repair -  they replaced some parts and it worked like new again for about 2 weeks.  I had the previous generation Water Pik for many years until it just died.  This one seems very cheaply made - not made to last.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it. does a good job cleaning my gums ! would recommend to all. wish we could choose the tips they send in the pack... but oh well will order the ones I need more separately... want my whole family to use it ! wish I had found it earlier !</li>
    <li> Does everything it said it would do. My only gripe is that I can never get all the different piks to fit into the case.</li>
    <li> Still have this item and wife and I use it every day.  Still works great.  We have had to purchase some addition brushes for it along the way but still use it..  Works great and does a nice job...........................</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Absolutely amazing!  I tell everyone I can about this product.  My mouth feels so much cleaner after using this than after using string floss.  It is NOT just for people with braces!  I got mine for when I had braces, but I still use it a year later!</li>
    <li> The instructions are not clear nor do all the heads fit in the box.  It has also cut my gums in spots.</li>
    <li> I bought my Waterpik about 8 months ago when I had my adult braces installed. Believe me it&#x27;s tough to clean your teeth when you have braces. The device came promptly and was easy to set up. For awhile it worked fine. Now, though, after a few months of use I barely use it. Why? The button on the handheld part controls the water flow. It sticks and often will not release. That means no water flow. In fact, the thing is so annoying I barely use it anymore. The idea is good when it works, but it doesn&#x27;t really work. It helped me get used to my braces, but I&#x27;m sorry I bought the stupid thing.</li>
    <li> We received the waterpik quickly and it works great.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just love this flosser.  It works great and my mouth feels so good after I use it. I wish I had it years ago.</li>
    <li> We are so pleased with our Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser that my husband has requested one of his own for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Just to have the convenience of a unit in each bathroom.  Thank you for making an easy to use dental hygiene product that we can rely on.</li>
    <li> we have 2 in our household...very good unit....recommended heavily by my dentist/ you can&#x27;t go wrong with that. I think this is the way to go.My teeth gets flossed easily and quickly.I love it!</li>
    <li> seems to work well, my dentist wanted me to get one so I did.  seems to work well and small amount of space</li>
    <li> Finally purchased one although this type of product has been on the market for years. I was surprised on how noticeably effective this was. This particular model is compact in size and has a small footprint on my counter top.  Many different tips to use but I only need to use one. It was louder than I expected although its not too loud and even if its considered too loud for some, it will only be on for about a minute per person and the results are far worth it. First time use left  water all over the counter top and mirror. After a couple uses you learn how to use it efficiently and without the mess. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Feels like a dental cleaning twice a day!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this thing (my teeth and gums do, too!).  Kinda noisy but really effective flosser.  Would definitely recommend it w/out hesitation.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and use with just a small learning or adjustment curve. If you&#x27;ve never used one it will take a little time to adjust to how this works and how to get the best results. Read the pamphlet that cones with it. We have VERY hard water so I pour distiller water into it instead of tap water.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using it, my teeth and gums feel so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is more expensive than the other simple model but worth the money. Several jet tips come with it, which is not all useful.  I only use two of them.&lt;br /&gt;What is good about this product is its huge water reservoir.  It can contain at least 2 cups of water.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you do not have to worry about battery because it is wired, not charged battery.  I have used a portable which lasted only 1 year because its battery cannot be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this for 3 months already and it works great.</li>
    <li> Sounds like a great idea and my dental assistant highly recommended.  BUT the truth is its sort of an aggravation.  For one thing, its really messy --don&#x27;t really recommend using it with your shirt on :), you have to spit out about every 3 or 4 seconds, and at my house I have to run the hot water for several minutes because you don&#x27;t want to use this thing with cold water.  I guess it works but if you think flossing is a nagging chore this ratchets the annoyance up a level.  Won&#x27;t know til my next visit if it really works.</li>
    <li> How did I survive all these years without the waterpik?  I hate, repeat hate to floss and find it an annoying chore.  This waterpik is fantastic and I actually look forward to using it.  Takes a time or two to learn how to regulate the positioning around the mouth but the worst that happens is a bit of spray now and then.  No biggie, it&#x27;s only water.</li>
    <li> I love this device and recommend to anyone wanting a great oral cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know about recommendations for the Waterpik, but I sometimes use a mixture of 1/2 hydrogen pyroxide to warm water, to keep my gums extra healthy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Waterpiks that I have ever used.  It holds a lot or little bit of water.  Great for good hygiene for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this flosser- has all kinds of attachments to ensure good oral care. Much nicer than the waterpiks of long ago, being much quieter. Really does a nice job- teeth are clean!</li>
    <li> Excellent buy, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Its cool and operates just like you would think. Good pressure and a decent price. I just don&#x27;t use it anymore. If you are serious about taking care of your teeth then it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Started using this right after my 6 month dentist checkup. After 6 months, dentist said I had virtually no buildup. I told her I started using this and she said &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care if you use shoelaces to floss, if it&#x27;s doing the job then keep on using it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of device itself is a bit hokey. The whole process of filling up the reservoir, dumping out the leftover, and the coiled hose - you can&#x27;t help thinking they could have designed this to be a less involved process, but for what it does, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this from &amp;#34;sunny boutique&amp;#34; on Amazon. the item was never delivered and I had to buy it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this Waterpik is AMAZING. I love it. it&#x27;s so addicting. I have a large pocket at the base between my molars due to my wisdom teeth and it collects food whenever I eat. I used to floss and use a proxy brush in there after I eat. Now I use this and it&#x27;s so much better. it gets more food out of my teeth faster and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;my gums have never been this healthy. I haven&#x27;t had a spot of blood from my gums since using this. I can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist and show off my healthy new gums. I&#x27;ve recommended this to at least five people already and I&#x27;m planning to buy the handheld model for when I&#x27;m at work. buy this thing now. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait for my next dental appointment so the dentist can see the difference!  Just recommended to an acquaintance so they can get the benefit too.</li>
    <li> I am amazed how much more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; this product takes care of even after brushing and flossing. Would recommend to any one who wants to improve their oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my gums and my dentist recommend I try a water pike. This seems to be working well makes your gums feel good and cleans in between them. The only thing I feel is messy is the water overflow in your mouth.</li>
    <li> My family loves this product. At first they had a hard time when they turned it on it started squirting all over the place. You need to make sure you push down on the button to stop the flow of water before you turn it on. I like having all the different tips though. It helped a lot when my son got his wisdom teeth in and they were hurting a lot around the gum line.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me the option of trying this or periodontics.  I owned one of these many years ago.  This one is small and very efficient.  It can be messy if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions.  I have used most of the tips and especially like the varied pressure options.</li>
    <li> A recent visit to my dentist recommended the Waterpik instead of flossing. I hate flossing but love this waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;It has ample power settings and plenty of accessories for every need. I use mine with warm water and hydrogen peroxide (50/50) for a complete clean. I am amazed at how much just brushing misses.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that this is healthy for my teeth and gums (prevent gingivitis), I also bought one for my son and daughter.&lt;br /&gt;The product works great and so far, the quality seems great as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I think this has plenty of power, a huge reservoir, and the hose is plenty long.  I really like the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button on the handle so you can get it into and out of your mouth without making a mess.</li>
    <li> All this does is squirt water in between your teeth. It did not come with the tongue scraper, which is what I wanted in the first place. It really doesn&#x27;t add anything to my oral hygiene or my breath</li>
    <li> My gum was in weakened condition from teeth-grinding.  Although a mouth guard was necessary to combat the actual issue, this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser has proven to provide a tremendous improvement to the healthiness of my gums.  Flossing, using the Waterpik, and brushing your teeth thereafter leaves you with the cleanest, healthiest looking gums and teeth.  I love this product so much.  I have used it for months.  It comes with 6-7 different types of flossing/brushing tools.  It is easy to set up and use, and it only adds about a minute to your night and morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend anyone to use this product to improve how they feel about their mouth or simply improve the health of their gums.  It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in the bathroom counter, and can easily be stored in a cabinet if you prefer to keep your counter space empty when you&#x27;re not using it.  I personally just leave it out since I use it every day, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine what the condition of my teeth would be without it at this point.  I wish they had an even more portable, travel version of this item because I would buy it for my frequent trips.</li>
    <li> Bought the water pick because I have tight back teeth that regular flossing just wasn&#x27;t working, ever since I started using this haven&#x27;t put it down</li>
    <li> We have had two of these. The first one was junk, the second one was worse. The funny thing is we used Waterpic shower heads and they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope someone makes a simular flosser product that will last.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I am addicted to this and try to use it after every meal when I am at home. My dental hygienist praised the results on my last visit. Thinking of buying one more for work as well. I wish it came in a compact size for office and travel. Great Great product.</li>
    <li> Nice.  Not very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;The design can be made better by placing the on-off switch at an easier place.&lt;br /&gt;But not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this flosser for about a month now, and it really does work. I get food that would have been left behind almost every time I use it.</li>
    <li> She says it works great if it don&#x27;t work good I will let you know but for now we are good!</li>
    <li> Made my teeth feel so clean all day.  My teeth looked so much cleaner than normal too. Everyone should have this to improve their gum health.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I have periodontic treatment. I use it ON and OFF for over 2 years now. It is not a replacement for what you are doing already (flossing, mouthwash, proxy brush etc). The water pump makes a quite some noise. Does not bother though. The most help is provides is for the most inner molars/wisdom tooth. I felt reduced sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> excellent product- At first it leaked when I took the reservoir off to fill but I was told that is normal so I now have a plastic cup to fill it and it is way more convenient to fill now</li>
    <li> It works and, if you&#x27;re really careful about turning it off before taking it out of your mouth, you won&#x27;t get the mirror wet.  It&#x27;s powerful.  Use it only on very low speeds.  On high, it&#x27;ll shoot a stream of water 30-40 ft and, depending on where it&#x27;s aimed, it might make a mess to sop up.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and have been for 10 years, I have always recommended this product to my patients. I have never personally tried this for myself, so I finally took the plunge and got one. It is great for those who are absolutely not going to floss, if your one of those people get one, if your a regular flosser i probably wouldn&#x27;t bother. I think it is faster, and easier than regular flossing, although if you have sensitivity to cold this might be uncomfortable unless you use warm water. This is a wonderful tool for bridgework, orthdontics, crowns, etc.</li>
    <li> love it. had to figure out to push basin in the container before water jetted..gums feel great. love it. great product just greta!!</li>
    <li> We have had two waterpik waterflossers and one had the cord break off at base site.  I read how to fix but it was too complicated.  The next one we got has broken where the hand held part of the pik rest so we have to keep it in a jar near the pik.  I love to use the waterpik but hate to invest in another one that may break-- any suggestions</li>
    <li> sometimes if you get lazy and doesn&#x27;t wanna use the traditional floss, you can use water flosser to rid of the food remains&lt;br /&gt;but traditional floss is absolutely necessary still because the water flosser cannot scratch the bacteria off your teeth. i had my dentist clean my teeth a week ago, and she still found bacteria accumulated on the surface of my teeth, even if I&#x27;ve been using water floss everyday</li>
    <li> all good very fast excelent product if you need clean all your mouth is the best product for all people</li>
    <li> Super great product. Even after flossing with floss thread this machine gets what was missed. Pressure is adjustable so there is no need to tear or bruise your gums. Different tips allow you to share the machine with your family. You can even put mouthwash in your water to freshen your breathe while you use the water flosser.  I have no criticism except that I wish the electric cord was a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for people that don&#x27;t like to floss.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! Feels great and so much better on my bridges! Should have done this sooner.</li>
    <li> My friends has this and they are recommended to me to buy this.  I really like this flosser because every time after use it, I can feel the different  inside my mouth even next morning, too. It feels like massaging my gum. Recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp;#34;Waterpik Ultra&amp;#34; to replace one that I had for years. I found this product to have a &amp;#34;lot of bells  and whistles&amp;#34; ( attachments that in reality are of little use. This unit does not provide much force in the spray, even at its &amp;#34;highest&amp;#34; setting, and its reservoir is very small. I would have returned it if it were not such a pain in the butt to do so. I should have just bought one at a brick and mortar store where returning an item is much simpler. So,I am keeping it, but am disappointed in its performance.</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT</li>
    <li> I have had this a little over three months.  The water tube broke on my prior Waterpik which was some other model.  This one has a better system for storing the tube, so hopefully it won&#x27;t crimp as the other one did.  I am liking this Waterpik very much so far.  It has enough power that I don&#x27;t have to turn it up all the way, although I think I have it on the next to highest setting.  As they get clogged up I have to turn them up, so I like to have some leeway.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up.  Waterpiks don&#x27;t seem to last all that long.  I&#x27;d love to get a year out of it, for the price!</li>
    <li> This comes with several attachments to clean around braces and other dental work.  Makes flossing easy and painless.  It does take a while to master not getting water spraying all around the bathroom, though.  We&#x27;ve had ours for years, and it still works nicely.  The only problem we&#x27;ve had is putting a full reservoir back without spilling.  This can be averted, however by keeping the reservoir in place when filling.</li>
    <li> Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;More supporting tools;&lt;br /&gt;Water pressure regulator large range;&lt;br /&gt;Rational design&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;Relatively simple manual&lt;br /&gt;After the noise pressure increase&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning effect on poor dental calculus</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of manual flossing and was not doing regularly even once (at night time). I saw this product while browsing for Philips Sonicare toothbrush, read the review and thought of giving a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it, I checked it after breakfast in the morning. I first gargle using water and thought most of the food particles were out. Then I flossed using this product and was surprised to see more food particles. I read in one of the product review, when one of the guest has mentioned about using listerine along with water, so tried that and I am impressed with this product. Now I floss twice a day without fail...</li>
    <li> TO AVOID GUM DISEASE USE TWICE A DAY. YOU HAVE GOTTEN WHAT YOU PAID FOR, BUT YOU MUST USEEEE THE WATERPILK.  OK OK OK</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of dental work including implants, bridges, 12 crowns.....etc.  I have just bought my second one of these waterpiks and love it.  Easy to use and really keeps your teeth and gums clean and gets into places not even floss can.  Mold can build up in the fittings and so forth if you don&#x27;t dry it out regularly.  Get one and save money on teeth cleanings!</li>
    <li> Strong water pik and would recommend this product to anyone that needs one.  FAST SHIPPING. I liken all the accessories that come with it.</li>
    <li> The motor stopped working after a year</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me after a dentist visit. My gums are real sensitive so I this at the lowest setting (2-4) and it gets the job done! Food often gets stuck in between the back of my teeth and it gets all the food out! It also helped whiten my teeth believe it or not. I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have my very own personal dentist in my home with this waterpik ultra water flosser..&lt;br /&gt;I was told to make a purchase of one of these an so glade that I did.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to everyone, my wife and I both share this water flosser.</li>
    <li> We got a waterpik at the recommendation of our orthodontist.  Based upon other reviews, we settled on this unit for our 8 year old with braces.  The unit has worked great for him - allowing him to use the specialized tip for cleaning around his braces.  I was a bit nervous that he might make a mess of the water spray, but he quickly mastered the controls and uses the unit independently daily (including the occasional water reservoir replenishment).  For a kid that still has trouble tying his shoes, this unit has worked well for him to keep up with his dental care.</li>
    <li> update-just what I expected</li>
    <li> I bought one last month with a traveler package, but it was burned out in a 240V country. It&#x27;s not a traveler package. It&#x27;s a native American package.</li>
    <li> I recently got braces, and regular flossing became a task in itself so I thought this product would get the job done and it did. It works great, I was very impressed. The settings are perfect and easy to use. Comes with different heads to use but I really like just one, I find the others not as good as the one to get the job done. I would recommend this to anyone with or without braces. Your mouth feels so clean after.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik we have in our household. It is amazing at well they work to creating healthy gums.how</li>
    <li> Why did I wait for so long to get it?  I am addicted to water flossing now.  Healthy investment, worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bulkier then expected. Otherwise, it does what it supposed to do. I use it and like the results.</li>
    <li> Following radiation treatment of my neck and jaw area, my dentist said that it was time to &amp;#34;Reward myself&amp;#34; and get a waterpik.  This was over six years ago and I have been using it faithfully every night since.  Since I have many caps, crowns and bridges, it is almost impossible to floss effectively.  I am always amazed at how much food particles that I wash out every night.  I still have to brush with a fluoride (prescription) toothpaste after waterpik wash though. I keep thinking that after six years the waterpik will die, but it continues on -  I did purchase a smaller, cordless one to use on trips, but this one continues to be my favorite.  Now, after six years, my faithful Waterpik has started to falter.  Not quit, just sort of fades in and out.  So - I ordered a new one from Amazon.  Checking out the &amp;#34;Newer and better&amp;#34; one on Amazon, I decided to go with the same one. It&#x27;s here and working - and seems to work a little smoother than the original. I just hope that this one will give me the same service as the old one - time will tell.  Update:  8/3/16 The second and newer Waterpik quit pumping water - just noise, so I called their customer service line expecting an argument, but instead it was answered by an extremely helpful lady that had me try different things to see what might be wrong.  It turns out that by removing the small black &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; from the bottom of the reservoir, it started working.  She took my address and is sending me a replacement part at no charge.  Meanwhile, I can continue to use the waterpik as before, just cannot fill it prior to placing it on the pump unit.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good size. Tank holds enough water to last about 2 min on medium strength. I use it with a bit of Listerine. Good for the gums and leaves teeth feeling very clean. Fast Ship. Great value!</li>
    <li> this is the best waterpik version.&lt;br /&gt;do not buy the cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;this will last much longer and longer than the others.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing, and I hate being always chided by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;This is the complete answer: Just the right amount of water in the reservoir to complete upper and lower, inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;Kill button on the handle to stop flow when wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Visible debris missed in brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Easily adjustable pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised and does a very good job. I&#x27;m glad I decided to get this model. It takes up very little space on the counter and has a lot of attachments. My dentist will be so proud of me after years of telling me I needed one. Good product. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The item is fine, my husband did not adapt well to using it.  One of my kids is using it with great success.</li>
    <li> Love my water pic.i also have the traveling one.</li>
    <li> To be blunt, I&#x27;m not too good about flossing.  It&#x27;s uncomfortable and too easy to skip.  I bought this as an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am impressed with how well this thing works!  It&#x27;s faster than flossing and not as messy as you might think.  It takes maybe 30 seconds or so to blast the spaces between my teeth, then I can finish up with my electric toothbrush.  Bada-bing, bada-boom, doneski.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have put mouthwash in these things, and I might try that, too.  I am a little afraid of gunking it up doing this, though.</li>
    <li> Good price, serve its purpose.</li>
    <li> Its a very good buy and good product. The number of attachments you get are sufficient for any type of use. I use it few times a week and my wife uses it daily. Very good product and my money was well spent on this one. Not had any problem with this on so far.</li>
    <li> Well, if you really want to make sure you have 100% clean operating system this is the way to go. Use it with lukewarm water and not so hard at least once a day usually at night before retiring.&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
    <li> The waterpik works great.  The real test will abe my next hygienest&#x27;s reports.  I will update my rating of this product then.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik. It gets into all the places that my toothbrush misses. It also came with several different size attachments and a case for them.</li>
    <li> This works well - my husband and I both use it - but it does seem overkill on the accessories.  We would never use all of them and quite frankly I may throw them away because they just fall out each time I take the lid off to refill the water.  (The accessories are stored inside the lid.)</li>
    <li> I though that this item would be an alternative to floss but based on my few of using it I could say that I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I need to do a better job of deep cleaning and recommended Waterpik. I have been very pleased with the results of the cleaning and the gentle application.</li>
    <li> After I received my waterpik, I discovered that Costco has the same product and it comes with a travel waterpik for just a few dollars more.  The product is great, but the Costco offer was a better deal.</li>
    <li> Clean, healthy gums are crucial to overall health. The Waterpik water flosser deep cleans, removing harmful particles and inflammation causing sticky plaque, from between teeth and along the gum line. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This unit performs beyond expectations, uses minimum space and has a nice appearance.Requires some familliarization of controls to avoid spraying my face or the mirror. LOL</li>
    <li> Wow, what I have been missing, I floss regularly, but just got the Waterpik today, and what a difference in the clean feel of my teeth, just one thing, the unit is rather loud, and it is messy, but with a little practice, I am getting the hang of it.  Great item.</li>
    <li> OK I just want to say that before the WUWF I was not at all consistent with flossing my teeth.  My dentist recommended me getting it and wow, I am now to the point of wanting to clean my teeth really good every night.  Very easy to use and my teeth and mouth feel so clean.  I ended up purchasing a second one for my hubby! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a number of months and it continues to work well. When set on &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; the water stream is very effective.  It&#x27;s surprising how much remains between the teeth after a thorough brushing: flossing makes a big difference and except for really hard-to-dislodge particles that may be stubbornly wedged between the teeth, this Waterpik does a very good job.  The real test, of course, will be how well this product is still working 2-3 years from now.</li>
    <li> i love it!&lt;br /&gt;i think this device will help my teeth more clearer!&lt;br /&gt;no need to spend any money for dentist anymore</li>
    <li> This thing works great. I love the power adjustment feature. My last one the pic that I use the most broke so tried to fix and screwed it up. These things are not made to take apart.</li>
    <li> My husbands dental hygenist wanted him to start using a dental pik.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this one since it had good reviews. He was a bit doubtful about it at first but now that he&#x27;s used to it he really loves the way it cleans his teeth. He adds mouthwash to the water &amp; it has done wonders for his breath. He uses it every night before we go to bed. He says he can really tell the difference in how clean his teeth feel. Dental floss never cleaned like this does. We are very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this unit. It is small enough that it is out-of-the-way yet does everything needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with dentist&#x27;s referral. I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. My teeth have never felt cleaner! The product is definitely more efficient than floss, its very hard to floss correctly. My favorite part is the ability to change the pressure; my gums are a little more sensitive toward the back.</li>
    <li> Bought Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator but didn&#x27;t work so I ordered this Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  This one didn&#x27;t work either and it also ended up in a box in the basement.  I used the pik pocket tip but it cracked after a few months.  The pressure settings I used was 5.</li>
    <li> I have an extreme case of Periodontics and my dentist recommended the water flosser to help with my daily routines. I love how my teeth and gum feels after using it, I sometimes use my medication in the water and be sure it will be delivered to every part of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason I gave it 4 star, is because it is a bit messy. if you are not careful the water will spray all over. I wish I got the portable one so I can use in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is MUCH more effective than flossing!  Breath stays fresh longer also!  I ad 1 part peroxide to 2 parts water.</li>
    <li> No need to waste any more words to this product!&lt;br /&gt;After ~2k positive reviews, all I can say is that your $50 will be well invested!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth having this tool for your dental hygiene!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, I wished there was a setting to get more powerful bursts of water, while using less water.&lt;br /&gt;Meaning the water goes through quite quickly (one basin is good enough for one mouth).</li>
    <li> This waterpik does the job extremely well. I have not even used all the different attachments at this time. Will certainly recommend this to friends and family, as well as acquire a new one when the need arises in future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had and used a waterpik for over 40 years.  They last a very long time (this is my second) and they work very well at removing food from between teeth and strengthening the gums.  I use it every day.  I&#x27;m surprised that I&#x27;ve never had this product recommeded to me by my dentist or hygenist.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and does an amazing job cleaning between your teeth without hurting the gums.  If you have permanent retainers on the back of your teeth and don&#x27;t like to have to thread your floss then you need to get this product.  Great value and in the 90 seconds I use it 3 times a week my gums feel like they have been to the spa!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of the Waterpik Flossers - one for my husband and one for me.  I personally love my Flosser and I think it does a great job.  My teeth always feels great when I am finished.  My husband thinks it is just ok.  He does use it, and he has it set on the highest level.  I use mine on the #4 setting.  He doesn&#x27;t feel as though it has enough pressure.  I feel it&#x27;s wonderful.  So I realize this is a mixed review - sorry about that, but I wanted to express how we both feel about the product.  I still felt it deserved at 5 star rating.  We have been using it for about 6 weeks and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Well, the dog hates it when I aim at her. Cleans my teeth well too. Dentist on my case to use one.</li>
    <li> Excellent waterpik the best one I have ever owned I use it every day and keeps on working. Would not hesitate to buy another one when I ware this one out.</li>
    <li> Operation is fine except it louses up the TV if you use it when TV is on.  That should be cleaned up by adding a line filter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I have never flossed regularly in my life, but I use this every day. My boyfriend and I have very sensitive gums, and this allows us to get a better deep clean without bleeding gums or pain. The lowest setting has a good amount of pressure and I rarely turn it any higher.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues that I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, like water leaking or pieces not fitting tight enough. My unit works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;My only tip is to use lukewarm water, NOT cold!</li>
    <li> i like this product because it keeps my teeth and gums clean and refreshed.  my oral health care provider says my mouth is much healthier now than before.</li>
    <li> I purchased  a replacement  part for  3 year old Water Pic. Part was easy to install and performs  like new.</li>
    <li> The flosser works well however there are times that it cuts off. I turn it off and re-start it again and it is fine</li>
    <li> read good reviews on this product and decided to give it a shot..simple to use, clear instructions and it is fun!  haven&#x27;t thrown my string floss away but this is quick and easy to use and I would recommend it..</li>
    <li> This waterpik is easy to set up and use- basically you don&#x27;t really need to do anything- just plug in, fill the reservoir with warm water, turn on, and use. There is a wheel you can turn so the water is still aimed at your teeth and gums as you move along. There is only one normal tip- so if you plan to share, you need to buy more. The other attachments don&#x27;t seem all that useful- it might be better if it came with an extra normal tip and fewer specialized ones, but I still like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband.  We had another one a long time ago, but I don&#x27;t even remember what brand it was, but he wore it out.  He had been having some problem with food getting stuck between his teeth, but doesn&#x27;t really like to use dental floss.  This works very well for him and is a good alternative to using dental floss all the time.</li>
    <li> My sister wanted a water flosser for Christmas. After checking the different models on line and watching the home video that someone posted, I decided on the Waterpik water flosser. I&#x27;m glad I chose this model, because my sister loves it.</li>
    <li> I loved this waterpik, it was definitely a great product for the money.  It has different power controls and a nice pause button that I find very useful.  Great product would buy another one again.</li>
    <li> I just love it. After i use it I feel like I&#x27;ve just left the Dentist. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is messy. Good thing it is only water. I&#x27;m anxious for my next cleaning so I will be able to tell if it&#x27;s really working. I have a bridge and it&#x27;s much easier to use than trying to floss. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective water pik..it was recommended by my hygienist and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. You won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had gum disease since my early 20&#x27;s.  I went to an oral surgeon for quite a while, however, had to stop due to the expense.  My dentist had recommended using a waterpik. She said that massaging my gums with dry toothbrush before brushing had been doing a lot of good.  A few of her patients had recently purchased the waterpik.  She had never been on board until seeing the difference it was making on them.  She suggested I try this and my numbers are improving.  It gives a general feeling of a very clean mouth.</li>
    <li> Although I use &amp;#34;Go Betweens&amp;#34; as floss, I always finish up my teethbrushing  routine with the Water Flosser.  There is definitely a difference in how your teeth/mouth feel after using this product.  Am very satisfied after using it for more than a year.  I have also had better dental check-ups since.</li>
    <li> I am having serious gum issues and as much as I knew I needed this product, I thought it would be just another hassle to my morning and evening routines.  I thought I might hate using it, but would grudgingly do so.  Wrong!  I love it!  It works easily, the process is fast, not messy (after some practice - Ha!) and makes my mouth feel wonderful.  Anxious to see the difference it makes in my exams going forward, but I&#x27;m confident the results will be good.  This is a great product in my opinion.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great! How did I live without it</li>
    <li> Much more effective than flossing in my non-dental opinion.  Helps around crowns where gaps may be.  Works great and it is very effective.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and have been wanting this for awhile now. Finally got and love it very much. Just what I wanted and at the right price. Item delivered quickly. Will be revisiting this seller for more items.</li>
    <li> I like this water flosser.  Never been much for flossing the traditional way, since I have had a lot of dental work and it&#x27;s not easy to use floss without it shredding.&lt;br /&gt;This water flosser cleans in between my teeth well, and I really like the adjustment which changes the pressure of the jet.</li>
    <li> We absolutely love it!! Our teeth have never felt so clean and our gums are much stronger now according to our dentist.</li>
    <li> this water pik will give you an amazing sensation of cleanness , i feel my mouth very fresh after i use it..its light and easy to move , just needs some manipulation around crowns to clean good , i add some mouth wash to the water when i use it.</li>
    <li> Does what I expected and satisfied. One issue with filling up with water. Have to use a cup to fill water reservoir.</li>
    <li> This has a big enough reservoir and a big enough pump to get the job done.  It&#x27;s not the most decorative thing on the counter in your bathroom but it sure gets the job done.  Don&#x27;t bother fooling around with the little handheld gizmos.  This is the one you need.</li>
    <li> It worked greatly for 3 months and then the device stops working. I followed all the instructions to use it and clean it after each use. However, the water now come out drop by drop.  The device fail to create a water stream.</li>
    <li> This is my first Waterpik. It seems very healthy for my teeth and gums. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to just flossing, though that&#x27;s still what I do when I travel. My only complaint is that the pause button started getting stuck after a year. It looks like I can replace just the handle. I might try a cordless instead to save counter space. This one isn&#x27;t huge but I don&#x27;t have a lot of space either.</li>
    <li> Like every thing about it except the hose is a bit too short unless the device is moved right to the edge of the sink.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Waterpik rechargeable flosser which would no longer recharge after less than two years.  This flosser works much better as it always has the same amount of pressure.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who takes great care of her teeth. Always flossing. So this seemed like a good gift for her and she loves it.</li>
    <li> It gets rid of hard to get at junk in your mouth, it has a large resevior, it is a bit messy though</li>
    <li> Love it! My hygienist has been recommending this for so long, glad I finally bought one. Great product, easy to setup and use. Can wait for my next dentist appointment( how often do you hear that?).</li>
    <li> It works really well, adjustable spray is great so I&#x27;m very happy as long as it holds up! I recommend it...</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser exceeds my expectations. My mouth feels so clean after using it. Much better than just flossing. Our dentist recommended it for husband and I use it more than he does.</li>
    <li> After 1 month of use still working like a champ quieter than the older models.Much easier  than string flossing in my opinion..</li>
    <li> i had one before.  i can not live without it.  i purchased one for my sister too and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Before owning this, flossing was a nightmare.  This product makes flossing easy and painless (and it is said to be more effective, too)</li>
    <li> I bought this on the advice of my dentist.  This is the most powerful one I could find.  The dental hygienist and dentist were both surprised at how much my gums had improved over a 6 month period.  This item has worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work so good for me. I found it a little messy and took up valuable counter space in the bathroom. I returned and now use the disposable flosser&#x27;s with the little handles. They work just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I find the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser to be far superior to flossing. It cleans the entire gumline, not just the gums between your teeth. The experience of using it is also a helluva lot more enjoyable than flossing.</li>
    <li> Love this flosserer. My second one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for $45. It works fine. But the bracket that holds the pik broke after a couple of weeks. So I took off the lid and stow the pik in the water bin. I need to buy another for my second home and will get the model without a lid but with a better place to stow the pik for $26 less than this model. Save your money and get the cheaper one.</li>
    <li> I hate to floss.  I really hate the tape/ string, icky business but I understand the importance of healthy gums to the rest of my health, and the need to floss...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this.  Now, every night I floss with the water pik.  All the things I don&#x27;t like about flossing are removed, and  my teeth and gums feel clean.  While my dentist and dental hygienist said it wasn&#x27;t a substitute because it doesn&#x27;t quite get the plaque off the teeth, when I went to the dentist after using this faithfully, my gums were in much better shape than they ever had been previously, so I guess that speaks for itself</li>
    <li> My dentist said I should use a water flosser. The first one I had was a rechargeable one and I had to use it in the shower because water flew everywhere. Then it died with in 2 months. This one is wonderful. Plug it in, fill, then has a button to stop the water until you get in it in your mouth, then release button! It&#x27;s really sort of fun to see how much more stuff you can get out of your teeth even after brushing first!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1PDNOMLII1VG5]]I&#x27;d like to try the Waterpik Ultra Flosser, but between spraying the water all over and dumping water everywhere, I&#x27;m too busy cleaning up the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who is testing this thing must be on their knees or 4 foot tall. The hose is so short that you can&#x27;t get the thing to your mouth without it tipping over and dumping a pint of water all over. The button on the handle stops the flow when it is pressed (huh?) instead of when it is released, so if you turn it on, it sprays water all over. This might not be a problem if you didn&#x27;t have to put one hand on it to keep it from tipping due to the short hose. You need one hand to hold the button and the wand, one hand to hold the unit down, and one to turn it on. I can&#x27;t really think of how much worse the design of this thing could be. I am SO glad I bought this at wally and can take it back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Waterpik is keeping up with technology. If only their re-chargable waterpik had some power. The model that permits you to recharge it is junk. It just does not have the pressure necessary to effectively wash out those hard-to-reach places.</li>
    <li> Really does better than regular flossing.</li>
    <li> I suggest  buyer reads the commentary very closely, so you know exactly what you are getting. I ordered this as a gift and was surprised to see it arrived out of original manufacturers sealed container,</li>
    <li> I have a permanent wire retainer behind my front six teeth and it&#x27;s impossible for me to floss. My dentist recommended getting a waterpik.  This one is great.  It is a little louder than expected but the water pressure is good! It did make my gums bleed the first few times but I&#x27;m pretty sure that meant they were just getting used to the new device (I floss/listerine on the regular too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the product for anyone with braces or a permanent wire retainer .</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and also very effective</li>
    <li> This ultra water flosser is an effective tool in personal dental hygiene. As a retired hygienist, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my third Water Pik since my teen years and braces.  Worked great then works great now.  To prevent gum disease I use daily along with flossing and brushing.</li>
    <li> This is pretty easy to set up and use.  I like how it gets out even tight meat / fruit fibre particles without the need for traditional dental floss, and your teeth feel smooth and clean after use.  I also like that you can mix in mouthwash for double impact, saving a step.</li>
    <li> My husband was having problems with gums receding last year. The hygienist recommended this product.  This has cleared my husbands gums up completely.  He is faithful to use it as directed.</li>
    <li> Recently, I got braces, and I have to say I could not live without this product.  It has a special wand for people with braces that works perfectly.  The 10 speed options make it very easy to regulate according to your comfort level.  Also, I love that the extra wand attachments store in the lid of the WaterPik.</li>
    <li> Bought this for hubby to replace old Waterpik model that quit working after 20+ years. He loves it, and so do his hygienist and his dentist. He says it&#x27;s better, even, than his well used old one. In my experience, Waterpik brand just keeps giving. I use another well-advertised brand, and I am disappointed that I fell for its advertising and spent more money for an inferior product.</li>
    <li> A friend and my Dentist suggested adding this to my regiment and they both suggested this model of the Waterpik flosser.  It took a little while to get used to it, the settings and the right pick to use for whatever the need.  Now that I have had it for about a month I can&#x27;t imagine being without it.  I am truly amazed how clean my mouth feels and will see what my Dentist has to say at the next checkup.</li>
    <li> my mouth feels the cleanest ever... also, i seem to get tartar on my teeth often and heavily, but by focusing on those areas it disappears... my dental hygenist was right -- one of the best investments for my mouth i will ever make...  i encourage EVERYONE to use this</li>
    <li> Lid storage is cumbersome and a PITA.  It doesn&#x27;t hold all the tips that come with.  Love the performance though</li>
    <li> This has saved me from getting a bad grade and lecture from the dental hygienist many times. I use it once a week to keep gums healthy.</li>
    <li> product is good if it can be delivered faster</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new waterpik, it&#x27;s easy to use and completely cleans the gum line and any debris in larger spaces between teeth.  One word of caution when you first use the waterpik, please press the button on the waterpik wand, it shuts the water pressure off, let go of it once it&#x27;s in your moth and held at an angle to your gum line, keep your mouth slightly open and over the sink. this will prevent a wild spraying of your bathroom and yourself.  As I said before I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the item.</li>
    <li> Good product, can achieve high pressure jet (important) recommended by dentist, Amazon&#x27;s price + (free) shipping lower than local stores.    My one complaint is that the extra tip storage inside the removable lid on top of the reservoir is awkward. A hinged lid with separate tip storage would have been much more convenient.</li>
    <li> This was good quality and perfect for our needs. The attachments are nice and we use most of them, I like the size of the water tank because we have two people using it. We have had this for a while now and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> As an adult new to braces it took me 45 minutes to brush and floss my teeth, not to mention the pain.  However, when this waterpik arrived it only took me 5 minutes to have it out of the box and my braces, and between my teeth cleaned with the small tip.  The water shoots well in-between my teeth, even with braces on.  I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone watching me use it as I haven&#x27;t mastered the water pouring out of my mouth thing yet but I would have gladly paid so much more for this product.  It&#x27;s an orthodontic must!!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik has been a lifesaver for me. I&#x27;m 46 yrs old and just got braces. It was a real hassle to floss, but the different attachments makes it a lot easier. I recommend it for anyone who wants healthier teeth and gums, especially for braces wearers.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Waterpik Ultra only after first talking to my dentist and then checking out the user reviews.  I had been told that using Waterpik-type instruments was not recommended by dentists because of a concern about their tendency to push food further into the gums next to the teeth.  My dentist said such was not the case, and he highly recommended that I use one.  I then read the various reviews and decided on the Waterpik Ultra aware of the concerns about its water pressure and the short tube.  While I agree that the water tube is a little short, it has not caused me any difficulty at all in using it.  Likewise with the water pressure.  I have found the water pressure to be more than adequate.  In fact, I have yet to turn the pressure to its highest level since Level 8 does an excellent job.  My only complaint with the Waterpik Ultra is that I wish the water tank was a little larger.  I find that it sometimes runs out of water before I am finished.  Other than that minor complaint, I am completely satisfied with the Waterpik Ultra.  I still marvel at the sight of food falling into the sink even after I have thoroughly brushed my teeth.  That is the best evidence that it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son since he had braces and it is wonderful!  It gets all the food stuck between his brackets and eliminates the threader floss, which is hard to use. It comes with various tips and is a must for those with orthodontic appliances. I would have given it 5 stars, except the first one I got had problems. The pause button would get stuck and water would not come out. However, it was replaced at no charge and the second one is working fine.  Additionally, be sure the canister holding the water is on tight, as well as the tips snap into place.  It takes a little getting used to in the beginning without water spraying everywhere, but one gets used to it pretty fast. Extra tips allow for more than one user.  It was recommended by his orthodonist, in addition to flossing, but I think this can replace it. I, the mom even use it instead of regular floss daily!  Would recommend it, but just be careful about the pause button.</li>
    <li> I purchased two in 11/07 since Amazon had a special.  I have used WPs for years so knew the second would not go to waste (and I was afraid the brand might go out of business or be sold - Oral B is not as good now that P&amp;G owns it). I have been using ever since having braces as an adult, in ADDITION to flossing.  It does not take the place of, just makes the process more efficient. Mine never break but over the years, there have been more ergonomic models with different features.  So I usually change every 3 to 5 years.  This time, its only been two because of the type of water we have here which leaves a white build up.  I admit I could be more diligent in drying the reservoir.  But regardless, I always wonder what is growing in the tube, which you cannot remove and clean : )  Flushing Listerine through it only does so much; on tips too so I use an ultrasonic cleaner on them which works great.  Most people reviewing love them, but for those who complain when it breaks in 3+ years; probably time for a new one anyway until they start selling tubes you can replace yourself!</li>
    <li> My husband has periodontal disease and we purchased this to ward off further problems and have found in our research that using it also actually strengthens the gums to do some reversal on his problems.  I&#x27;m using it too and it is actually fun.  My teeth feel really clean and it does clean all the little bits that get trapped in between your teeth.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things I bought for my teeth besides a Sonicare toothbrush that follows after I use my water pik..My dentist can&#x27;t find any plague on my teeth.&gt;he had nothing to scrape off!  I use it in the am and pm and what a pleasure! I hate flossing but I love my water pik!!!</li>
    <li> compared to the old Waterpik I replaced, this model barely has enough water pressure to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This product helps to remove food where flossing can not reach. However, not as great as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> A friend told me that she had this product and that she really liked it.  I thought that I would try try it as a way of \\&quot;almost flossing\\&quot;.  It takes a few times to get used to how to handle it but it makes your mouth feel great.  I will be anxious to hear what my dentist has to say at my next check-up.</li>
    <li> whether it can be used in china？</li>
    <li> Great for your gums and teeth.    Easy to use.    Powerful.</li>
    <li> I had one of the original Waterpiks from over 30 yrs ago.  My husband and 4 children were still at home, we each had our own color of pik. We thoroughly enjoyed it. During a move 10 years ago, I misplaced it, but found it a few months ago. I dusted if off and started using it again.  It always had a loud, noisy motor, but still did a good job cleaning.  The poor old thing died a couple of months ago and I didn&#x27;t want to be without one so found it online and ordered another.  It&#x27;s much quieter than the old one and cleans just as well.  I am so pleased with it that I bought 3 more for Christmas presents for my older grandchildren to enjoy. It always amazes me how much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; is left in your mouth, even after brushing. I&#x27;m hoping that it will cut out most the teeth cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office that I dislike so much</li>
    <li> The waterpik ultra (not to be confused with the cheaply made waterpik personal)is a quiet nasal irrigator with fine control of the water  stream. With the rubber end of Grossan irrigator tip you can use the waterpik ultra for nasal irrigation at 1/2 the price of the Grossan Hydro system. I prepare a mixture of approx. 2 parts iodine free salt to 1 part fresh baking soda, and add about 1/4 portion of xyltol for a buffered saline rinse. (xylitol is supposed to have anti-bacterial properties)</li>
    <li> I bought this water pik for myself for Christmas.  So far, I love it.  Each attachment works great.      I had one years ago when I had braces.  The new attachments would have come in handy then!</li>
    <li> This Waterpik has a nice strong jet of water that gets into the little spaces between your teeth.  Not as forceful as the dentist&#x27;s water jet, but plenty strong!  I would definitely recommend it.  I have seen reviews that are critical of the (small) size of the reservoir.  If it were bigger, the unit would be bigger and take up even more space on your counter!  I think it&#x27;s a good compromise.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! great product. This waterpik keeps all the plaque off. I use it twice a day or more.I am very pickey about clean teeth,,,,It sure does the job. Now I don&#x27;t need to have my teeth clean THREE time a year. Quite a cost savings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Waterpiks in the past and believe that they have saved my teeth and gums. This model is the best yet. It is quiet, has the intensity dial not on the handle (to prevent inadvertant changes), and a knurled rotator on the handle for easier rotation with wet hands. The water capacity is a little smaller than I prefer, but this is not a big deal.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. Really gets all the gunk out between your teeth better than any floss could. Mine came with a bunch of attachments for a variety of things and two standard-use attachments with a white and blue ring (perfect for my husband and I). I rate it four stars as I&#x27;ve never had a waterpik, so I have nothing to compare it too. This thing is pretty noisy, I must say.</li>
    <li> I have always had issues keeping my teeth clean because of complication with flossing.  This all lead to some costly dental repair. I purchased the Waterpic hoping that it would help in getting the job done. It has done all of that. In a few short weeks I have see a marked improvement with the color of my gums and the cleaning of a recently installed bridge. The pump has more than enough pressure and with the addition of some mouth wash to the water, it feels like your mouth has just went through the car wash. They offer several attachments to the pick unit. I have only really used one of them to any extent. One word of caution ... keep the pic pointed down in the sink when you  start the unit unless you need your walls washed. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> After bought this waterpik there was one thought in my head.  Why I didn&#x27;t buy this earlier?</li>
    <li> We managed to get a few months of decent use from the water jet before the cut-off switch started sticking. After 1-2 minutes of prodding it would finally release, sending water spraying across the room. It was funny the first few times, but after several dozen, it got very old. Coupled with the too-short hose and a nozzle which broke off inside the handle, I recommend searching elsewhere. I know I will be.</li>
    <li> works well for getting food from your teeth. I find it gets you wet while you are using it so wear short sleeves while using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpik or a similar (other brand) device for many years. In my experience you&#x27;re better off buying Waterpik. The bottom line is the Waterpik works much better. Why did I buy the other brand I&#x27;m now replacing? Because it was cheaper and \\&quot;just as good.\\&quot; Turns out that was half true. It was cheaper.</li>
    <li> It really cleans your teeth and gum. Your mouth becomes so clean and nice! But you really need to be careful when you use full power (#10) because the water jet is so strong,it might hurt your mouth;I hurt mine once. Just be aware with the water jet power level(#1~#10)when you using it.   Other than that, this machine is really great!!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended I get one of these to keep my gums strong.&lt;br /&gt;I read quite a few reviews of other models, and they are all seem to be able to do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this one because of the price/reviews were in line. It functions well, even if it splatters water everywhere! I mean, you&#x27;re in your bathroom, so it&#x27;s ok to get a little wet on the sink, but one wrong move, and you&#x27;re spraying yourself in the eye, the mirror, the ear (just kidding). I have to do a clean up on the sink after I am done every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know what? It still works. I think the problem is with me, not the device.</li>
    <li> Still delivers the water at the pressure you need, where you need it.  Small footprint, compact design. Daily use. This is the one to get. Period.</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik at least once a day for many years and continue to please both my dentist and myself with my healthy gums and teeth.  This particular Waterpik was purchased to give as a gift to a family member with good wishes for continued good dental health upon turning 40 yrs. old.  I think it makes a wonderful gift!</li>
    <li> This is great.  It reaches all those hard to reach places that floss can&#x27;t get to.  I noticed a huge difference within 4 days of using the product.  You will learn to better manage the splashing after the first few uses.  Use first on a lower setting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still going after two years.  The holder broke but the rest works!</li>
    <li> I bought this form amazon.com for my personal use. I bought it form amazon.com because its best value among some retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist Dr.Hament Kale &amp; Dr.Deval Kale (India) recommended me for implant and crown product. I express my thanks to them with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water Pik now become apart of my daily routine. This would sure relief us from bad breath, prevent cavities. Before I buy this, there is wrong notion to me that flossing and brushing was enough. I think that Water Pik will sure bypass us from dental disease. This Ultra 100 model is powerful and does the job excellent. Remove bacteria deep between teeth and below the gum line where brushing and floss are not reach. This is great for the people with implants,crowns,bridges. This is best product among Sonicare,oral-B and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like its feature: 6 unique tips, pressure control system with 10 settings, 5 to 9 psi,pause button on handle, can be used with water or mouthwash, smaller and compact model, reservoir with built tip storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone want to use this product in India. I will suggest buy voltage converter. I would suggest one URL: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest Water Pik company manufacture their product can be use universal power 120v and 220&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, with this model there is tong cleaner is not sufficiently work. I suggest company to refer tong cleaner , use in India inverted U shape (metal use like S.S, Copper and silver) copper are best among this because copper will not corrosion and copper is also good for health.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this model instead of the cordless model. I like the possible 10 speeds instead of the 2 speed cordless. I would give this model 5 stars if it had a slightly larger water capacity, otherwise it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> This model is a major improvement over the previous model -- which I owned and used for almost 5 years--- the controls are much more incremental and easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone. Oh yes -- not to forget Amazon---- because of their shopping policies and guarantees I do not shop any where else. they even mediate for you with sellers in their \\&quot;marketplace\\&quot;---</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and it has performed well.  I like the compact size and the fact that it is easy to use and clean up.  The splashing is annoying, but as I get more practice and experience using it, I am learning to limit the splashing.  Over all, I am well pleased</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s super for braker cleaning, but my waterpik came without the tongue cleaner as it promised</li>
    <li> I receive the item dammage and no answer to my mails!I really doesn&#x27;t recommand American RX.VERY BAD SELLERS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always been a clean freak when it comes to my teeth. I had to get braces to correct my bite for my TMJ. I was not happy with just brushing and meticulous flossing. I have always known about Waterpik items but never really gave it a second thought until I read reviews on a forum for adults with braces.&lt;br /&gt;  This is an essential if you have braces! If your child has braces please buy him or her this device. Not to be gross, but you would be surprised at the food particles simple brushing &amp; flossing that are missed. Don&#x27;t think twice, buy this for that 12 year old that has braces and thinks he/she did a good job brushing. My ortho assistant has told me horror stories about kids &amp; braces coming in for their checkup.  She knew I was using a Waterpik!</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  It works much better than the cordless Waterpik.  The Waterpik company sent me this model after 6 cordless units failed in rapid sucession.  The cordless models have a defective battery that will not hold a charge after several months of use.  I should point out that their customer service is excellent.  Each time I complained about their cordless unit, they sent me a replacement within a few days.  However, when it was obvious that none of them worked properly, they offered me the option of the counter top unit even though it is more expensive.  Unlike the cordless unit, this model maintains a strong, steady stream of water that effectively rinses the mouth and removes food debris.  I should also point out that this model works much more quietly than previous Waterpik countertop models.  It is smaller and fits more easily on a small sink counter.  Also, the plastic tube easily retracts back into a slot on the unit so it is out of way.  This is by far the best of the Waterpik models and others should not even be considered.</li>
    <li> Just had implants in my lower jaw and Waterpik is the best cleaning tool I have found.  Cannot do without it.</li>
    <li> The device works great. very flexible with the different speeds and sticks. I don&#x27;t need to floss now since the device does it too.</li>
    <li> Great also for kids that dont like flossing.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks for decades.  They last for years and really clean between your teeth.  You would be amazed at how many small particles the pik dislodges, even after brushing.  I firmly believe they are an essential part of one&#x27;s oral hygiene.  This model is quite an improvement over the older one we had.  It is much quieter, and the pressure adjustment dial works a lot easier than on prior models.  It also has a button on the handle to temporarily stop the stream.  The whole process is much faster and, I believe, more effective than using floss, and certainly gets between teeth far better than brushing alone.</li>
    <li> Product an improvement over the last unit I owned. However although it has 6 typs of \\&quot;pics\\&quot;, it only has one Jet Tip WAT JT 100E. The additional 5 have limited use and are ideally for special needs. I had to go and order an additonal replacement Jet Tips because two people are using the unit.  Other than that the unit is great and was delivered as indicated and on time.[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> After having a new shower head installed I had to replace a shower flosser that was the best. This item was recommended as a good replacement, and I have to agree. I don&#x27;t get as good results, but good enough to keep me from sitting in my periodontist&#x27;s chair more than my regular visits 2X per year.</li>
    <li> As countless people have noticed this unit has one planned obsolescence feature that sort of ruins it - the brittle tubing.  Once yours breaks, do not buy more replacement tubing from this company because it&#x27;ll become brittle again and break in a year or two.  Rather replace it with the \\&quot;Black Polyurethane Tubing, 0.063\\&quot; ID, 0.125\\&quot; OD, 0.031\\&quot; Wall, 25&#x27; Length\\&quot; tubing they sell here for like $5 delivered.  It works much better and there is enough to replace it many times even if it broke again (which it won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s good tubing, unlike the junk they include with the original unit)</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month now.  Owned three of the full size versions prior.  While they worked when they worked, lifespan was short (2yrs).  One of the three was a warranty replacement.  This newer version appears much more robust.  It is quieter and the connection to the base and various tips appears to be more substantial and possibly less prone to breakage.  It also occupies a much smaller footprint on the vanity top and the lid storage for tips is a big improvement.  So thus far it is a great unit.    That said, the reservoir is much smaller than the previous version (20oz vs 35oz) and so I have to refill it each time I use it.  I kept the previous unit&#x27;s reservoir and use that to refill.    Dental irrigators are high pressure units and the longevity of consumer (e.g. cheap) versions is likely to be short (although this has a 3-yr warranty).  But these things are great for your teeth and I will keep buying.    Bonus--it looks like an Imperial Storm Trooper!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in place of a nasal irrigation system because it was less expensive and my doctor said it would work just as well.  He was right.  It flushes my nasal passages and is kind of fun to use.  I would have given it a five, but I was hoping the flush of water could be continuous rather than a constant pulsation.  I am still very please with buying it.</li>
    <li> We read the reviews on the newer one and decided to stick with this Waterpik. I am so glad we did! This will be our 3rd one and we love it. Not at all disappointed with this product it continues to deliver time and time again.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my Waterpik! My dentist recommended that I get a dental irrigator and I am wishing I got one sooner. Okay, it can be a bit messy. But, it is definately worth wiping up some water for how well it cleans.</li>
    <li> Love this little water flosser.  Doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space but is very powerful IF you want it to be.  I love it and highly recommend it to all!!!</li>
    <li> This bad boy rocks!!  At first even at mid range power it made my gums bleed .  But now my gums are used to it and now use midrange.  Great with crowns , and tight tooth gaps!!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my recent purchase of the Waterpik and use it at least twice a day and it does a terrific job.</li>
    <li> I just bought a brand new &#x27;old style&#x27; WaterPik (model WP-60) at Target for $39.  They also sell the new models with the smaller reservoir (the model folks are complaining about), but now they also have the old fashioned model available.  It looks exactly like WaterPiks used to look like except the water reservoir is blue plastic instead of clear plastic.  Same size, same shape, everything is exactly the same.  I was so thrilled to find this because I didn&#x27;t want the rinky-dink new model, so I&#x27;m passing the information along.  If Target has it, it&#x27;s probably widely available...........but the good news is that it IS available![[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> This is our first Waterpik, so I do not have anything to compare it against.  My dental hygienist recomended that I try one.  My wife and I find it easy to use and it seems to do a very good job of flossing our teeth.  I will know more about how well it is working after my next dental appointment.</li>
    <li> Love this machine. Works great! With braces, I often get things stuck in places I didn&#x27;t know food could get stuck! This helps out so much and it&#x27;s not a struggle to floss now.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product!!! So easy to use and can be done so quickly!!! Strongly recommend to EVERYONE!!!</li>
    <li> This has been great seeing as I have braces again for the second time in my life but I can definitely see using it even after I get the braces off. Help to make my teeth feel extra clean in between cleanings. Arrived in two days.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist, and she was correct. Really gets into places that flossing doesn&#x27;t.I would recommend this iten to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best water-flosser that we have used, and we have used others including the Hydro-flosser by Hydrofloss.  The WaterPik has a superior wand mounting system and an assortment of tools (with a storage compartment).  The WaterPik has greater flow, a better on off switch (rocker vs rotational) and variable pressure settings. The reservoir is slightly less than the HydroFloss, but still adequate, and it takes up less space on our vanity.  My wife and I use a mixture of water and mouthwash as well without any problems.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool for cleaning between your teeth especially if you have deep pockets between teeth.  It costs much less than a cleaning will cost you.  It is very easy to use.  Much easier than flossing especially if you have a bridge.  I wish that I would have purchased one years ago.</li>
    <li> Many years back a dentist recommended the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser to me since I have difficulty flossing with &amp;#34;string floss&amp;#34; because of large tori. At that time I was beginning to see early signs of gum problems that disappeared rapidly with the Water Flosser. I also credit using the Water Flosser with helping to head off an infection under a crown recently. I still wound up having to have a root canal, but the endodontist agreed that my adding some hydrogen peroxide to the water I directed at the tooth in question was why I only had to have one visit instead of the three a root canal usually requires. I&#x27;ve given all my family Waterpik Water Flossers and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I never thought that I can get plaque out with water. The pressure is great! I have no need to turn the pressure on all the way as that can hurt the gums if they&#x27;re not used to it. Start small and allow your gums to get used to the pressures before you increase it. I always check my teeth after I water floss by flossing with regular dental floss and no more plaque or food particles! I always experienced pain when flossing in between certain teeth, but I don&#x27;t feel that with this water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other attachments that do other things, but I don&#x27;t use these really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. A little to rough for my gums gave away</li>
    <li> I bought it wit an electric toothbrush and I think is the best option. You need to clean your tooth before and with the waterpik you will feel really good.</li>
    <li> Waterpik advertises it to be better than normal flossing.  But I used it diligently for months, and when I flossed my teeth using string, they bled.  I think the product may be a good adjunct to brushing and normal flossing, but not as a alternative to normal flossing.</li>
    <li> Expect that it will take some time to get good at using this. Be patient. I&#x27;ve got it down pat.  I have several tricks to make it fabulous and super fast. I use my left hand to hold it &amp; let the sink faucet constantly run plenty of warm water into the bin. I use my right hand to hold the &amp;#34;wand.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t dribble the water down my chin as I go, as is recommended in the instructions. That is too messy for me. Instead, I perform the exact same pattern in my teeth every time.  After I spray a certain area of the teeth, it is time to push the hold button on the water pik &amp; do the old fashioned dentist office spit at the drain.  Then I do the next area repeating the process.  I can water pik all the teeth in a few moments, never missing any spots, and not making any messes.  Then I punch off the machine with the left hand, dump out the water, hide it back under the sink (where fortunately the outlet is also), and I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> the tubing broke after one year</li>
    <li> My teeth look great from the front - white and strong. Dentists would say my teeth were healthy and then be surprised to find lots of cavities between them. The reason for this is that I despise flossing. Not only is it uncomfortable but my teeth are too close together to do it properly. The floss gets stuck between my teeth, I actually hurt myself trying to get it in between some of them and sometimes the floss rips. So even though I know I should be flossing it&#x27;s just not going to happen more than once a week. Unfortunately food that gets stuck between your teeth causes awful smells so I bought a water flosser to try and solve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing i ever did! I know dentists don&#x27;t like water flossers to replace floss but this works considering I wouldn&#x27;t be flossing at all if I didn&#x27;t use it. I brush and rinse my teeth thoroughly and then I&#x27;m shocked to see food (lots of it) still coming out of my teeth into the sink. Yes it&#x27;s gross but it&#x27;s worse to think that if I didn&#x27;t use this all of that food would just be accumulating and decaying in my teeth. It has different attachments for smaller spaces between teeth, a toothbrush, tongue cleaner ect. When my old one broke ( I accidentally clogged it up) I immediately bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product in place of my floss. I still try flossing once a week but this is the way I floss 90% of the time and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
    <li> I like this water floss. It is very loud in operation and it is bothersome to clean and dry well the water container to prevent bacteria. In addition, I&#x27;d like to warn you that too strong water jet may hurt your gum as written in the manual.</li>
    <li> best pik ive used so far</li>
    <li> As for blasting water in your mouth I would give it a 5 *****&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is the off on switch and the coil that delivers the water.  I think you should be able to turn the thing of and on at the pic,  I know they have a pause button there but, for my personal taste I would like it to be on the handle.  The water coil is wrapped to tight and you can not make full use of its entire length. Then when you try to return it to the holder you have to massage it in.&lt;br /&gt;My dislikes should not be a deal breaker if you need a pic.  I do like the other features but for me it is a little cumbersome.</li>
    <li> This was my second Waterpik.  Design was great, nice enough looking to keep on bathroom counter.  The pik leaked at the connection to the base of the housing.  Most likely a defect in this one unit.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my water pick. I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel after using it. I am very pleased with my dentist&#x27;s suggestion. Flossing is good, but this is excellent.</li>
    <li> I loved this water flosser when I first got it. It really is great, or was great I should say. I purchased this flosser less than a year ago and it already stopped working. It&#x27;s been in the same spot in my bathroom ever since I first took it out of the box, and one night it decided to just not work any more. And unfortunately I can&#x27;t return it on Amazon any more. It came with a 3 year warranty in the back of the manual so I&#x27;m hoping WaterPik can replace it for me. I really did love it, and I&#x27;m hoping I just got a defective product and can get it replaced without a problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a good stream and great features but it leaks a little.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I just cant believe it can be as effective or more effective than using floss.  My dentist recommended this product to me.  It is extremely loud due to the motor though, so watch out for that since I was surprised when I first turned it on and it sounded like a jack hammer.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail yesterday and couldn&#x27;t be more excited to use it! Although it&#x27;s a bit noisy, it worked its magic right away!! I have a hard to reach tooth that always gives me issues with regular flossing and it always feels like something is stuck in there.Let me tell you, that after brushing and regular flossing before use, I was able to get everything out! It felt great and I love the different settings! I did wind up with water everywhere, mainly because I need to get the hang of it. I hope this product stands the test of time and usage. I highly recommend it and I&#x27;ve only used it this once. My dentist recommended it, I shied away from it initially because of the cost in the stores, once I found it at $60, I thought it was a great deal! Turns out it was!!</li>
    <li> Today after a lot of reading up,&lt;br /&gt;I went got this flosser. Very exciting day! I immediately tried it and am very pleased with it. I need to figure out the settings :) if the water tank was bigger, I would have flodded my washroom :)&lt;br /&gt;The buttons are a bit inconvenient and difficult to manage while flossing. I hope I get the hang if it fast. So far I&#x27;m pretty happy!</li>
    <li> The button on the wand stopped working last month so now it is useless!</li>
    <li> Works well but I feel like water stream isn&#x27;t strong enough even at max.</li>
    <li> Nice machine. Problem is that the material used for the coil tubing attached to the handle tends to become brittle and breaks easily. Replacement cost is about a third of the machine.</li>
    <li> This is a handy gadget for cleaning your teeth, especially after eating something like popcorn. I still brush, but the Waterpik gives a little extra protection. If your teeth are sensitive, you need to be sure to use warm water, and trying to empty the water in your mouth takes a bit of coordination. The pause control helps with that and keeps you from feeling like you are drowning.</li>
    <li> This is a LIFESAVER for braces. Getting braces at 21 is no fun in the first place,  so anything that can make dealing with them easier is much appreciated. Yes, it is loud and yes, it is bulky, but when you have stuff stuck in your braces that would otherwise take 15 minutes of brushing/flossing to clean out, it isn&#x27;t an issue at all. Once you&#x27;ve figured out the best way to use it (mouth slightly open, hanging over the sink) it&#x27;s a breeze to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks waterpik, for making adult braces such a little less!</li>
    <li> Nice design, really like that the extra pieces are covered under the lid.&lt;br /&gt;Nice capacity for the fill tank.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, with multiple settings.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for anyone looking for a Water Flosser.</li>
    <li> It is very loud, very messy (drips water all over the place, not to mention the &amp;#34;splashing&amp;#34;), and it doesn&#x27;t particularly feel better than flossing. I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing (when you floss at least you know you got stuff out!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, all you need is 1 of the attachments, so I would say save a couple of bucks and buy the standard one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only buy it if you have a sink with lots of counter space... and plenty of towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, the things do to please our dentists...</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Flosser was recommended by my dentist. I find it easy to use although it can be a bit messy if not careful.I think it is very effective for cleaning between the teeth at the gum-line.</li>
    <li> Bought this on the advise of my hygienst.  I have used it only two days and I absolutely love the way my mouth feels after using it.  I use mouthwash and the pik pocket to get the area where the tooth meets the gum.  I then use the general pressure tip to get between the the teeth.  After a good brushing, my teeth feel as though my hygienst just cleaned my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would make this better would be a camera so you could see what you are missing.  I owe my hygienst a hug for recommending this device.</li>
    <li> I opted for this over the cordless one, initially.  We don&#x27;t have a large sink counter, for starters, so I wasn&#x27;t pleased with how much space this took.  I found a nice little home for it, though, plugged it in, filled it up, and then had to move it REALLY close as the cord to the wand is VERY short.  I had to bend over towards it in order for it to reach to me.  It was a huge inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the different power settings, however, and the amount of water it does hold.  For whatever reason, the PAUSE option did not function in the way I thought it would.  I was expecting the water stream to actually stop completely, but it didn&#x27;t...there was still a STREAM (not a trickle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this and did opt for the cordless.  MUCH better :)</li>
    <li> I bought Waterpiks for the past few years; they generally last about 18 months. I like the new design, but the lid has storage for the accessories and that makes it a bit clunky when adding water. This one does not seem to pump the water as powerfully as my past waterpiks so I am not giving it a high rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well overall and does what is is supposed to do, so i will keep using and replacing these as needed.</li>
    <li> Love it. It massages the gums as well as gets the food out if the hardware. I would recommend it to anyone with braces</li>
    <li> Before I discovered the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, I was spending a fortune on veterinary dental hygiene! Do you have any idea how much cat fillings cost!? Not that much, actually, but I have a lot of cats, so it adds up. But not anymore! Now my kitties&#x27; teeth are cleaner than ever for the mere cost of 8 oz of tap water, a case of band-aids, and a tetanus shot. Thanks Waterpik!</li>
    <li> Works great! No more struggling with floss in those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I love our water flosser.  My daughter would always fight me when it came time to floss her teeth but with this she comes and gets it done quickly.  I like the way my teeth feel clean after flossing with the water and gums don&#x27;t bleed like they do sometimes after flossing.  Different attachments are provided.</li>
    <li> As advertised, great product.  Especially if you have braces.  Cleans where other cleaners can&#x27;t get to.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpik products a number of times in the past.  This model lives up to all my expectations and I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it was shipped within a timely framework and Amazon lived up to their usual prompt shipping promise.</li>
    <li> The previous water pick held twice the water. When set on 10 or Max , the water reservoir is empty less than two minuets. It appears  that the manufacture designed the product for the convince of the packaging.The only way you can use the product is to continually  keep filling a glass with water as you are using it  Simone else should try this balancing act for efficiency.</li>
    <li> My husband was an Orthodontist, so, he always highly recommended this to his patients and has always used this himself</li>
    <li> This machine is light weight but sturdy.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and has 6 attachments.  I use mine 2 to 3 times daily because it especially gets into and around Bridge work.  With 10 speeds,  it is simple to adjust it to your comfort zone. The teeth as well as the gums get a great workout.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for more than two weeks.  It&#x27;s not clumsy or heavy like the original Waterpik.  It still makes some noise, however it is not a problem for me.  The whole mouth takes only a minute to clean.</li>
    <li> Used it about a month now and am very happy with it. And, even better, my dental tech is happy. She says the improvement is noticeable. It is also very easy to use. I thought the rather short cords, both to the outlet and to the wand, would be inconvenient, but it just took about 2 days to get used to it and placed properly on the sink.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that the hose is too short.  We do not have the newer, higher bath cabinet so, I had to set it on the box to make it high enough so I don&#x27;t have to lean so far over.  Otherwise, great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Still use this - its a great product and helps me with my gums which I have to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say get it if you don&#x27;t floss because it&#x27;s too annoying to use regular floss. The box says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;50% more effective than regular floss&amp;#34; or whatever, so if that&#x27;s true then there&#x27;s a plus..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get tonsil stones, you can also use this to clean them out. Just set it to the lowest pressure, and clean them out. Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one problem after having it for a few months, the button is starting to stick on the &#x27;pik&#x27; itself.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpiks for years but this new model is made very cheaply.  The handle leaks constantly.  I have gotten two replacements and it is leaking again. When I call customer service they tell me that I cannot get any more replacement handles under the warantee because I am not using it properly since I leave the water in overnight.  I had three Waterpiks in the past and I have always left the water in with no problem.  They said I could buy a new handle but it costs half the price of what I paid for the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  THREE YEAR WARANTEE MEANS NOTHING IF THEY MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON IT.</li>
    <li> I am not big on using floss (please no comments about my personal hygiene).  This tool is very effective and unlike less expensive models, has the power to be effective and enough replacement / alternate heads to provide various options.  It really doesn&#x27;t use that much more mouthwash than you would use on your own just swirling through your mouth, but the Waterpik powerpacks the use of rinse that much more especially between teeth and in the gums.  Only downside, when the machine is almost empty, sometimes the foamy portion / air can fill the line.  That can be annoying, but only marginally.  My expectations when I bought it were limited, and the product has far exceeded that expectation.  I would recommend it whole-heartedly.</li>
    <li> The unit works well but the handle broke within a month.  It turns out that the release button on the handle will get stuck frequently within the first year.  Good news you can buy a replacement handle kit.  Bad news it cost 25.00 pop</li>
    <li> I have always liked Waterpik</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  I use it several times a day, immediately after eating anything.  I wish the travel one worked better because I miss it when I&#x27;m not home.</li>
    <li> I have periodontal disease and love this flosser, I use it with warm salt water every night. My father is is dentist and says it is the best out there. So far, I love it!</li>
    <li> This product really helps me get stuff out of hard to reach areas of my teefs. First time using it I was surprised to see all the s*** that came out from between my molars. I had a section of gums that was stanky from gingervitis that cleared up with regular use.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik works as expected.  Very helpful.  I had trouble finding what I wanted in drug stores, but ordering from Amazon was easy and came quickly.  I called my dentist to find out what model they recommend and that is what I ordered.</li>
    <li> For me it is just wonderful. No more bleeding and that &amp;#34;unfinished&amp;#34; feeling where you feel the left over gunk deep between the gums and teeth. Had it for almost 2 months. No problem</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Everyone should purchase one of these.  Even if you brush and floss you will get better results with the additional use of a water pick.</li>
    <li> Within the last year, this is my third try at a water pick/flosser. Save your money on the lesser models. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter who recently got braces. This is a great item for cleaning her teeth &amp; easy to use - she loves it &amp; it makes the whole process of dental hygiene a more pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He said it works as well on the job as he expected it to do.</li>
    <li> My Dentist suggested that I get a Waterpick for some dental issues I was having.  It had done just what it needed to do to help the issues.  I would hightly recommend it to anyone that cares about their teeth.</li>
    <li> Correct and fast delivery. The appliance corresponds to the description. Reliable teeth and mouth help</li>
    <li> I never owned before.  My dentist recommend for me to start using.  Im hooked.  I use it 3 times a day.  It is a lil loud. But overall it works great.  FYI I ordered this on a Wednesday night at 10:50pm.  It was at my door step Thursday 1:30pm.  14 hours shipper is awesome in service</li>
    <li> I loved it! I would recommend it to anymore who has not tried using a water flosser. It makes it a lot easier. I just got mine last month and I just love it. I am so glad my dentist recommends it to me as I am not aware of it. I still do the old style but this is more easier. My mouth feels clean.</li>
    <li> I am so very sorry I did not spend for this long time ago. The dentist want you to keep coming back I guess. The gums stay so much cleaner, my mouth seems to be cleaner and believe it or not the breath is cleaner because it gets rid of all those smelly food particles. I see some post that indicate the black stuff building up in the tube and around the reservoir, but I gotta tell you, that is just not cleaning the unit regularly. Like anything else it requires maintenance. You require the dentist to clean there instruments after each use, well this unit is no different. I alcohol the unit down after each use, no exceptions. For the money it&#x27;s a great buy and it will cut down on the cleaning visits to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews about the various Waterpik models available, was looking to replace my ancient one which started to leak randomly.  All the reviews I read said that this model was the &amp;#34;most powerful&amp;#34;, the other had multiple complaints about a weak stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this model for almost a month now, I must say I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed.  Any of the various heads at different pressure settings are still MUCH weaker than my old model/  I hate to think what the other models do.  Not sure what the alternative is, though.  If I had to do it again, I&#x27;d gamble on a cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues with the vendor though, delivery was very prompt.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week of use, but my gums are feeling so healthy. After I get done using the Waterpik I rinse my mouth with mouth wash and since using the Waterpik the mouthwash hasn&#x27;t given me that burning sensation. I feel like the Waterpik is definitely worth its price and it is so much easier than going through tons of floss. Flossing is made so much easier and I plan on actually flossing like you are supposed to everyday.</li>
    <li> Unit replaced a Braun and works well.  I do NOT like the attachment storage located in the tank cover.  The accessories fall out and the cover falls into the tank.  The old Braun unit had a hinged cover with the accessories and tank hidden under the lid when not in use.</li>
    <li> This has really changed my life with cleaning my teeth. It&#x27;s not a replacement for flossing, but does very good.</li>
    <li> Water should be warmed...noisy and cord is short...cordless would have been more practical.  However, the pressure is very good.  Otherwise, I like it.</li>
    <li> I really love this waterpik and my dentist said my teeth looked much better, after I started using it. Very easy to set up and use.</li>
    <li> It works very good&lt;br /&gt;Easy to maintain and clean&lt;br /&gt;Water container a little bit small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cleaning, and a refreshing feeling after you are done</li>
    <li> Previously I had owned a lower rated Waterpik flosser, which was larger and louder than this one.  This one is much more effective, has a smaller footprint on the counter, and is not as loud.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father-in-law and he loves it.  I&#x27;ve had the same model for several years and it continues to operate well.  The unit is easy to clean and the adjustable  pressure ensures you get sufficient water pressure without hurting your gums.</li>
    <li> very easy to use , ver effiicient way to clean you tooth, i am very satisfied with my purchase, and the price was very affordable</li>
    <li> I use my Waterpik once a day usually at night before going to bed, I invested in this because I recently had 3 new bottom crowns replaced and without insurance I figured I better take care of my mouth better.  Years ago I had on, but this is like a real treat with all the different attachments.  I did get some monetary gifts for my birthday so this really helped in paying for this.  I did call the 1-800.525.2774 to register and was suppose to get some coupons, but have not received them yet.  Sincerely Mary Ann</li>
    <li> waterpik makes flossing process so easy that I finally like to do it! I appreciate a lot of setting of pressure however I use just few.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it twice daily prior to brushing my teeth. It removes all debris from teeth and strengthens the gums. I also floss. I have used the waterpik for over 25 years. I would recommend this product for everyone. Once you use it diligently you will not like being without it.</li>
    <li> love it, it came quickly and would highly recommend it.  very reasonably priced and works great.  doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
    <li> My old waterpik (wp60) started leaking after one year of use. Decided to upgrade to the wp100. Every thing about the wp100 is far better than the wp60. I use it twice a day and love it.</li>
    <li> Blasts stuff out from in-between my teeth that I didn&#x27;t even know were in-between my teeth.</li>
    <li> When you use it, it squirts water in your mouth so hard that it goes EVERYWHERE! Definitely not what we expected!</li>
    <li> Love it... no more flossing.  I was very happy when my package arrived.  It was very fast and well packed.  I was pleased to find that it came with more then just a water jet head.  A hold arrangement of head came with from some with brushes to others that are ultra fine jet stream.  The container holds a lot of water, I can use it for at least 90 seconds or so on a full tank.  The pressure is great and easy to use.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to get away from flossing and waterpikking your way to clean teeth.</li>
    <li> It has a lot of different settings and choices of tips.  I use the plaque stream and brush the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not visited my dentist yet, but it sure feels like my teeth are cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly worth a shot</li>
    <li> When I first used it there was a bad taste in my mouth caused by the crap that came from between my teeth, coupled with gum bleeding.  This soon stopped.  The only logical conclusion was that it did a great job!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent and confident item, it works very well, it functions according to the internet specifications, I recommend it</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Really keeps my gums in good shape.</li>
    <li> Much better than the last one I had.  This unit is much more powerful; it has a spinning brush.  It is easy to care for and use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a flosser because my teeth are tight and it&#x27;s a pain to get the floss between them. I chose this model because it seemed to be the least expensive Waterpik that didn&#x27;t have design problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is plenty big for at least one use, usually two. Refilling the reservoir is easy enough, but I wish the tip storage wasn&#x27;t located directly on top of the reservoir. Minor annoyance, but it seems there ought to be a better way than pulling the storage off the top and setting it somewhere, pulling the reservoir out of the base, and then assembling it all again once every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various tips fit just about any need, though I&#x27;ve only used the standard one and couldn&#x27;t comment on the others. The variable pressure is great- I use mostly the lower settings, but I still adjust it around a bit day to day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, It&#x27;s been a great purchase and even though it has a few minor annoyances I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son because he has a hard time flossing with his braces on. He love it so far and thank me for getting it for him. It is so much easier for me mom he said,and less time infront of the mirror. It works really good.</li>
    <li> I love it, my dentist loves it. It beats flossing and works far better.</li>
    <li> After a good brushing with toothpaste I used the Waterpik and found many particles coming out of my teeth.  I believe that it has saved many trips to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Product was delivered fast and in original manufactures packaging.</li>
    <li> It feels as though my teeth have never been as clean as after using this product. My wife comments that my teeth appear to be much whiter as well. This is addictive!</li>
    <li> People complained about the water cord breaking loose... never a problem for me because I don&#x27;t stretch it to the max, I lean over the sink when using the Water-pic and it works beautifully. My hygienist noticed that my gums are healthier.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that it is noisy.  My old one ran very quite.  I dont know why this one is so noisy.</li>
    <li> I use this more than I ever imagined I would.  It feels so good and makes my mouth feel so fresh I can&#x27;t stand the aftertaste of food in my mouth anymore. I am retired so I use it after every meal and snack.  So easy to use I look forward to the freshness of a clean mouth.  Great quality and easy to clean.  I ordered extra tips so my husband can use it. He really likes it as he has a permanent partial that gets a seed or food sometimes lodged and this completely cleans for him.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is a great addition to the family oral health routine. Takes regular brushing and flossing to the next level.</li>
    <li> WOW, LOVE THIS FLOSSER. WORKS PERFECT. COST IS REASONABLE. THIS IS A HAVE TO HAVE ITEM, IF YOU WANT CLEAN TEETH AND GUM&#x27;S. BRUSHING DOES NOT DO IT ALL. I WAS REALLY SUPPRISED TO SEE WHAT WAS UNDER MY TEETH AFTER I BRUSHED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a waterpik since I was young. I wouldn&#x27;t do without one, but the current medel is not built to last. Ths holder for the waterpik handle is a thin curved piece of plastic that cracks after using it for several months. I wish they would correct this.</li>
    <li> Even following all the directions, this unit leaks constantly. I have to keep it on the edge of the sink, b/c fluid constantly seeps out. It is easy to use and convenient, except for the leaking.</li>
    <li> I purchased to upgrade from older model.  I like the smaller size and quiet operation.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is due to water capacity.  It has enough capacity to do most cleaning jobs, but you have to refill it to do a really super clean.</li>
    <li> I had this before and then I moved to a new location so I bought it again. The quality stays the same. Nothing to complain</li>
    <li> This seemed like a great purchase from the reviews.  Mine started malfunctioning at about 9 months.  I would fill it, but the water stopped moving through it.&lt;br /&gt;On nearly its one year anniversary, water stopped flowing through it altogether.  It is now a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely try a different brand this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have problems with the Waterpik.  If I had any gum weakness, the Waterpik at a low setting 2-3 could cause tearing.  But my Waterpik may have been a lemon or on the fritz for the past 7-12 months.  I am not impressed with this brand, and really disappointed and having to buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is great wayer flose I bought a  several months ago and like it a lot and on Christmas I bought for my daughter she was skeptical about that but soon she tried she love it , good product</li>
    <li> I love the Waterpik!  I used one as a child when I wore braces.  I had no cavities when they were removed after two+ years.  I purchased this for my son who has braces.  His orthodontist was threatening to remove the braces because he wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;taking good care&amp;#34; of his teeth.  Within two weeks of using the Waterpik at our return visit with the dentist, he praised my son for doing much better with brushing and flossing.  This unit came with enough flossers that each of us has one and we all use it daily.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and...the price at Amazon was much better than in any stores near us.</li>
    <li> And I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems whatsoever...I have had bonded retainers on the upper and lower insides of my teeth ever since I took out my braces four years ago and I&#x27;ve had to have extra cleanings since it&#x27;s impossible to get food out of those areas...the waterpik gets everything out nicely and then I use the tiny brush attachment for the gum line so even plaque isn&#x27;t building up there...a great product.</li>
    <li> After being told my my dental hygienist that I might need a deep&lt;br /&gt;cleaning, I asked what I could do to avoid that option.  She told me&lt;br /&gt;to use a Waterpik every day, along with gum massage, flossing,&lt;br /&gt;and cleaning.  I bought one right away.  It worked.  So I bought this&lt;br /&gt;one for my son as a gift.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I feel like its going to last about 2-3 months and then die. I have used it every day for the past month and already feel like its going to fall apart.</li>
    <li> The product has significantly improved my gums, but the controller that starts and stops the water broke within three weeks of ordering it. Now I need to keep the water flowing the entire time I use it.</li>
    <li> For years I was dreading flossing. And then I read somewhere a snipped about this. On a whim, I just placed the order and let me tell you, I am looking forward to flossing now AND the results are amazing. The first time I used it, I realize what a lousy job i have been doing. My teeth now feel like when you come back from the dentist after a cleaning. Just awesome.</li>
    <li> It can never substitute normal flossing, but I believe t complements it well. Dentis and Hygienist concur with my conclusion. Last cleaning was not as painful and lasted shorter than previous. IN addition I think it helped cleaning difficult to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to drain the top and do not leave the top cover on it to avoid breading mold inside it.</li>
    <li> Love it, a little messy at first. I left the dentist earlier and she felt that I was doing better with my floosing.</li>
    <li> It works as was expected as it is a replacement unit for one that the water line developed a leak.</li>
    <li> Works marvelously. Great product. It would be perfect if I could use it after my girlfriend went to bed without waking her up.</li>
    <li> My mum has parodontopathy, when it attack, she can&#x27;t eat and sleep, it is good product to improve her illness.&lt;br /&gt;My uncle recommended us to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, and it is with 6 replacement jets. that&#x27;s helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to junk two expensive Waterpik dental devices after only a year or so due to shoddy materials and construction. Now I read (see the many 1-star reviews of Sinusense) that another of its products suffers from the same problems. WAKE UP,  Waterpik!!!</li>
    <li> This replaced an older model and is much lighter and more powerful than the original. Very satisfied and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked as described. Packed well. Full instructions with good detail. Would get another one when necessary. Great deal, good investment.</li>
    <li> I live in an apartment, my landlord lives above me. The first time I used the water flosser (after 12am) he complained of the noise, it woke him up. If you don&#x27;t mind the noise the water flosser works very well but takes a bit of practice to use properly. Well made and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> i like it its useful and  it helps your teeth  i just do not use it frequently  and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Took a while to learn the technique and not spray water all over the bathroom but now it&#x27;s easy to use and does seem to get into places brushes and floss may miss. Well worth the money and time to commit to using it.</li>
    <li> It was recomended by my dentist. All that I expected. I would recomend this to my friends. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand and style for years and years. No longer need to brush my teeth with a brush or use toothpaste. Big saving with just those things. Dentist says my teeth have never looked better even without having to brush. Love It! BUT a little messy when water kinds of drips down while using. But worth the problem. I think they all do that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a year since I&#x27;ve had this product, and finally, it has given up to the test of time for some reason. This waterpik, flossing machine has done wonders for my dental hygiene. Every single time I use this product, I go through a cycle. The cycle consists of: 1) Putting in a solution 2) Plugging it in 3) Using the flossing machine 4) cleaning thoroughly with warm water 5) drying completely. Just today, I&#x27;ve stumbled on a problem. I couldn&#x27;t use my flossing machine. Why? The button, for some reason, felt like it has gone dry, and is stuck. I cannot, and did not at all use it today because it did not work. The safety button, to hold the water in is just stuck in that position, no matter what I try to do. I&#x27;ve tried running it under warm water (for the belief that maybe it got stuck because of something sticky), pushing the button a tad bit harder to release it (if it was stuck due to some other foreign objects), and even getting a paper clip to pull out the button. Everything failed. I greatly enjoyed this product to the extent of a 5 star review, but given the test of time, and the other flossers I&#x27;ve used in the past, this product has failed me.</li>
    <li> I have used this water pick about twice a day for 3+ months.  Unit is great.  Strong pressure- I haven&#x27;t even gone above level 6 yet, lol.  Someone mentioned the handle piece can hold excess water/get gunky etc.  I just turn the handle upside down when I store it and all water drips out so my handle is clean as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;Just went back to the dentist for my 4 month follow up and they could tell a difference.  My gums had been bright red, bleeding and receding due to gingivitis and now they are healthy pink and growing back.  Whew.&lt;br /&gt;This water pick is so easy and I think it is fun to use.  So much easier than regular floss. It is very satisfying to get all that junk out of your gums.  You just don&#x27;t realize how much can get down in there.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and save your mouth!</li>
    <li> I just have to get use to pressing the button to stop the water flow .. kinda of backwards</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s best feature is the adjustable intensity of the water flow.  Can  be adjusted for adults or children.</li>
    <li> I have had several waterpiks over the recent years and this one is by far the best and is easy to use.  After brushing there is often residue left and the waterpic just did the trick of leaving an amazingly clean mouth</li>
    <li> Bought this after a previous model died.. actually the handle fell apart and turned into a sprinkler...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the same doesn&#x27;t happen to this one.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is much smaller than my previous model.. but I find that on the highest setting, this runs out of water at around my last few teeth (and I have a mouth full of&#x27;em).&lt;br /&gt;If I could improve on the device, I&#x27;d leave the top/container part off and set it up so you can turn the reservoir over onto the rest of the machine for storage.  The top doesn&#x27;t serve much of a purpose as only a few of the tips will fit inside anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Others have commented on the release button on the handle.. I&#x27;ve only engaged that once by mistake.  If that button keeps the handle together, I&#x27;m all for that.&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that previous models have been more powerful than the top setting on this model but all the dentists that I&#x27;ve spoken with about it say to use it on a low setting anyway, at least for cleaning around your gums.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a good array of tips as you&#x27;ve probably seen from other posts.  The toothbrush tip is pretty neat but the gum irrigator tip is hard to figure out.. the other tips are standard with most waterpiks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen this model cheaper in other B&amp;M/discount stores but, if you like Prime shipping, it might save you some effort and gas money in the end to buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpiks for approx. 20 years and like everyone else have always hated the loud noise and short lived life spam, but this model is GREAT, almost silent, and has added features. The shipping was lightning fast. They shipped it one day and I received it the next.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten into the habit of flossing mostly because I have tight contacts. Finally my hygienist recommended some other options including this. (42 years later) It took me about a month to set it up because I am a procrastinator. Now that it is set up I use it every day. So now I don&#x27;t have to get lectured by my hygienist!! woo hoo!  :)</li>
    <li> I have owned earlier models of waterpiks so this was a step up; more gadgets, more adjustments, better controls.  It even looks better, kind of like a Star Wars Stormtrooper (do they make a Darth Vader model?).  Joking aside, it does an excellent job of cleaning between teeth and massaging the gums.  I still floss a couple of times a week but this does the job just as well.  Improvements include a larger reservoir, tip exchange is easier and faster and pressure settings are more precise.  The handle has a built-in start/stop switch and the unit is quieter than previous models.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to getting many years of use out of this product.    By the way, I use the retired model to clean bicycle chains and gears.  If anything can demonstrate the effectiveness of a waterpik, this is it.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the waterpik to enhance cleaning. I use it daily with a little mouth wash. It works great and leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve been to the hygienist for a cleaning.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WATERPIK!  Easy to use and compact! Love the power behind it. Provides great cleaning between teeth. Very quiet too!  I really shopped around to find the best deal and quality. I was not disappointed at all. Have recommended the Ultra to friends at church and they loved it too!  My husband and I both use it. It comes with several separate piks to choose from that store nicely in the top chamber. He has his and I have mine!  Its a great product!  Purchase with ease. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> When my dentist recently told me that I needed to start using a waterpik again, I did some comparison shopping both online and locally. I wanted to get one with the features that I needed but not spend more money than absolutely necessary. This waterpik meets all the needs and is very good quality. It has storage capacity in the lid for the tips (which helps keep them clean and out of the way) and is very easy to use. I would recommend over cheaper models (which I have used before).</li>
    <li> I used a Waterpik water jet previously.  This one is far superior to older models.  I like the size and the features.  The larger water tank is a plus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of the product, small footprint, and how well it works.  Takes a little getting used to--squirted the wall a few times.  But now I can&#x27;t live without it: your teeth and gums feel as if you just had a professional cleaning.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this devise for almost two weeks and can see and feel results.  I can&#x27;t clean between teeth with floss like this does and the debris is always found in the sink after every use.  I have to admit, the tubing from the hand piece to the actual device does seem too short.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this several times, and I finally thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It is not a substitute for brushing and flossing. What it does do is give you an ultra-clean result. My guess is that I&#x27;ll be spending less time in the dentist&#x27;s chair if I brush, floss,Waterpik, and use Listerine. The design is well thought out. An included quick start card was all that I needed to get it up and running.The first time around I felt like my gums took a beating. Note you can dial down the pressure until your gums firm up. Also you don&#x27;t want to hit your softer tissue like under your tongue or throat with the high pressure water. Ouch ;)     I understand that they make a smaller, portable version. But my dentist said that it give the same results due to a lower pressure. I&#x27;d be tempted to try the smaller version for trips. Lugging the full size unit around would be a hassle.</li>
    <li> Worthless! I&#x27;ve used waterpiks for 30 years and have owned a number of them.  The pressure of this unit is so low that I doubt it removes anything.  Also, the water tank is so small that it must be refilled 2-3 times to do a complete cleaning.  Frankly, I&#x27;ve had many Waterpik models and have been very satisfied with them all- until now. Buy anything else other than this unit!</li>
    <li> I used the Waterpik several years ago. Not sure why I stopped- must have been the myth that the Waterpik was suspected of pushing food deeper beneath the gum line rather than flushing it out. I decided to give it another try because after all- Dentist use similar tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Waterpik to supplement my dental hygiene that also includes flossing. The Waterpik when angled correctly does flush large particles, stimulates the gum, and balances out my total mouth care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews indicate problems with insufficient water pressure. I found that fully extending the tube increases the water pressure as the travel is more direct than going through the loops. I add mouthwash to the reservoir giving the feeling of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very pleased- would recommend as part of the total mouth care.</li>
    <li> I have used waterpiks for many years and this model is much nicer than the earlier ones. It is smaller in size than my last one, which is nice if you keep it out on the bathroom counter. The reservoir is also smaller but is still sufficient for a single use. It is much quieter than my last one and I like the water pressure dial. The only problem that I had with it is that if you are not careful using the rotator on the pik, the pik will pop off while you are using it. On the other hand, my previous model required removing the pik after each use if you wanted to close the unit. The older piks were difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> It was as advertised.  So far, I am pleased with how it has been designed.  I hope it continues to work well.</li>
    <li> What can I say? My gums were bleeding and gave off a funky odor before I started using this product; i.e., I had gum disease. After a little over a month of using this product on a regular basis, the bleeding has stopped as well as the unwanted odor. Count me as a 100% satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik. As usual, I did my research and decided to purchase this one due to great reviews and reasonable price. It doesn&#x27;t take up too much countertop space and has plenty of interchangeable accessory pieces which fit right inside the lid. I haven&#x27;t used them all, but it&#x27;s nice to have (just in case). So far, I use the waterpik daily and haven&#x27;t had any issues. It seems to be good quality and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase this on Amazon as Amazon always has a great selection, price and customer service.  I wanted one of these but after reading some of the negative reviews I purchased it at a local Retailer as they had a no questons asked return policy for life. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this new machine for about two months the water handle stop button became stuck.  I took it back and got a replacement and all is fine again.....however, I doubt that this unit will last the year due to the cheap materials it is made of. This device is of poor quality in my opinion.  I&#x27;m not talking about just plastic.  The hose that goes from the base to the squirting device is ridiculously cheap. The on off button on the handle is very poorly constructed which is the reason for my return.  The pump is very cheap and I&#x27;m not impressed with the noise it makes.  It sounds like it will fall apart at any moment. In fact, many people report it does fail regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happy to pay more for a quality product. Are you listening WaterPik?  This is not a product that should be engineered as disposable, like a razor blade; it should be built to last.  If that means I need to pay more, I will.  Apparently that is not their philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad because I really like how this device cleans my teeth before brushing.  I believe it is one of the best things you can do for your gums and teeth.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is any real alternative product in the market place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will just keep replacing it at my local retailer when it breaks.  Maybe when WaterPik gets thousands of these returned they will decide to change the bad design.  (Probably not)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving it three stars because it is a great device, but I took off two stars due to the cheap materials and lack of quality construction.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older model that is worn out.  My husband had oral cancer and due to radiation treatments he has to be super cautious to keep his teeth clean at all times.  The Waterpik is a necessity to his good dental health, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> In many ways this is an acceptable unit.  It holds enough water to give a good cleaning, easy to dial up water stream strength.   My big complaint is that the bracket that holds the wand is made from incredibly cheap and brittle plastic.  My daughter tipped it forward onto the counter when she was using it and the tip of the right side bracket snapped off.  Without the full bracket, the wand will not stay in place.  Now it takes up quite a bit of room on the counter since the cord will not stay nicely coiled and the unit is much less attractive.  Annoying that something so little can diminish the value and usability of an entire product.</li>
    <li> Flossing used to be a royal pain. In fact, the only reason I used to floss was because I was worried of all my teeth falling out. But with this guy, I actually enjoy flossing. I do it twice a day! And the feeling one gets afterwards is awesome.    This is one product that everyone should have. It deserves a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I read pros and cons before replacing my old one. The pressure is adequate, you really should not use really high pressure on your gums anyway, unless you are eating wood. I found this to be good so far. I will update if I see any failures or issues. Very pleased with this so far.</li>
    <li> I had an old waterpik which finally died after approximately 5 years of use and replaced it with this model which is much fancier. It has a smaller footprint, the water tank has a cover and extra tools are held inside the cover out of site. The waterpik handle can be stored without removing the pik and the \\&quot;hose\\&quot; has a built in coil which makes it store much nicer than the older waterpiks. The controls are better although I think this model has a less powerful stream than the old one but it is adequate. It is certainly less noisy. Some have complained about the control on the handle itself which at first seems reversed but actually makes sense; you push it in to stop the flow of water and then can turn the machine off from the on off switch located on the body of the waterpik. When you are actually using the waterpik, you can move it about your mouth without holding a button on which to me seems a better design. With respect to reliability, as I have only had this machine for two weeks and it is working well, I can make no other comments. As my last waterpik lasted many years, I would hope this one will do the same. Is this model worth its extra price? I don&#x27;t know as I have not used the new less expensive one. All in all I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was really leary after reading some of these reviews.  I am very pleased to report that this new Waterpik is even better than my old model.  I have been using my previous model for about 6 years and loved it until the tubing broke last week.  I ordered this one even though there were lots of complaints, because I saw no other choice.  I LOVE the new model.  It&#x27;s a hair more powerful on the highest setting than my previous model.  Fits plenty of water in the basin for a full cleaning.  So for performance it is great!  On top of that, it is more compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up so much cabinet space, neatly stores the heads inside the top, and even has a pause button (this is my favorite feature!).  I&#x27;m very pleased!  Good job waterpik for taking a good product and making it better.  I&#x27;m so glad I spent the extra $10 for the new model! After all, I expect this one to last me for another 6 years.</li>
    <li> My old Waterpik lasted for more than 20 years.  I wonder how long this one will last.&lt;br /&gt; Waterpik does not offer an optional nasal irrigation accessory for the WP100, which is what I use the Waterpik for.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I just found and ordered one that is said to fit the WP100 from another company (RSW Products).</li>
    <li> For years my dentist has insisted that I have my teeth deep-cleaned, because I have a problem with plaque build-up. The last several visits to the dentist, he hasn&#x27;t mentioned the deep-cleaning. I didn&#x27;t tell him that I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik. There is a dramatic difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I ordered a new Waterpik in a rush when I thought mine was broken. It turned out that the power had gone off and all I needed to do was hit the RESET button. However, I&#x27;m glad I got the newer one. It&#x27;s much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a rush order of the new Waterpik because I don&#x27;t want to be without one even for a few days.  The lid is a good touch. There are more choices of tools. It does seem to be quiet. It just seems to be overall better than the old one, which was already excellent. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent way to get your teeth squeaky clean. I&#x27;ll leave the technical reviews to others and keep my review very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-as easy to use as the model I had and used years ago.&lt;br /&gt;-couldn&#x27;t possibly need to be more powerful than it is.&lt;br /&gt;-messy if you don&#x27;t forget to put it in your mouth before turning it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. I recommend it and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it even for a few days.</li>
    <li> This is the best water pik ever.    I have used water piks for over 20 years.  I did an experiment once to see if using a water pik was really effective.  I stopped using my water pik but continued to brush and floss every day. After two months I started using the water pik again and got some blood from my gums.  This convinced me that the water pik is useful and necessary for good oral health.      When I first started using a water pik I set the strength to 2.  Now after having used it consistently I have it set to 10 and it does not hurt my gums. They are much stronger from using the pik.    I water pik, floss, water pik again, rinse with an oral rinse, and brush once a day before bed.  I am almost 56 years old and I still have all my original teeth. Well, I have one crown but there is still some tooth underneath the crown :-).    This newest water pik is very well designed.  The controls are placed more conveniently and ergonomically than the older models.  The controls have a better feel.  The coiled tube is much easier to return with no tangles. On the older models you have to fiddle with the tube to get it to coil back up neatly.    The water stream is heavier, it pumps out more water.  The reservoir holds 20 ounces.  The nozzle swivels easier than any of the other models.    There are fewer little nooks on this model to clean.  So it needs less attention to keep looking like new.  But the other models were not all that hard to keep clean.    A very well designed and engineered machine. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  Love it.  My mouth feels so much better and cleaner than with floss.  Not that I have any measurable data, but I feel it works better than floss.  Definitely get it if you don&#x27;t like flossing.</li>
    <li> Use it as the directions specify. Only problem is that it requires running hot water until it warms up to fill the reservoir.</li>
    <li> I used one of these many years ago, and my dad used it from the day it was invented.  It lost its luster some time ago when people set the force too high and damaged their gums.  If you start at a very low setting and do not exceed your comfort level, you will have all the water in the tank to thoroughly clean in one fill.  This is not a substitute for any other form of oral hygiene.  It just makes everything else much easier and efficient after you first remove the food particles.  I does not remove plaque, so don&#x27;t get lazy.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik - I highly recommend to anyone.  It&#x27;s quite, the speed ranges are perfect for any user.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet. I now use this product after I brush my teeth with my Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush. After I&#x27;m done, my teeth and mouth feels immaculate. A few points:    1. The Waterpik was shipped in a timely manner.   2. I had initial surprise at the new sensation using the 2nd setting.  3. First time, my gums were sensitive to the pressure, but had adjusted by the second use.  4. Dialed it up to 3 the next day, and going to 4 the third day.  5. Easy to use product and knowing how excellent the product is at what is does, encourages me to use it twice a day.  6. Comes with two color-coded jet tips for another user.  7. Lean over the sink, keep mouth partially closed as instructed.  8. No problems thus far (less than a week).    I was excited when it arrived in the mail, I really couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. This product is easy to use and encourages me to use it twice daily!</li>
    <li> Product works great, hopefully the results will be seen when I go back to the dentist.  Amazon shipped it pretty quick.</li>
    <li> My gums feel much better since using the waterpic with a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
    <li> I think the Waterpik Ultra does a really great job of getting all the trapped particles from between your teeth and gums. It makes your mouth feel refreshed every time you use it. It does a really good job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now, and it&#x27;s fantastic. It cleans under your gums very well. When I got brother one, he thought the product was going to be useless. Now, he uses it every day, after his first use. I even got my parents one. all 3 of these still work great.</li>
    <li> This is the second one we have purchased. It works well and does the job advertised.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my waterpik.   I have to turn down the force of the water pretty low so it doesn&#x27;t hurt but even then it does a great job of clearing the debris from my teeth and gums.  I am always surprised at the amount of debris that is still there after brushing my teeth.  My dentist thinks this is a great product too</li>
    <li> Product works well and is much more convenient than flossing.  Use Morning and evening.  Follow up with mouth rinse to kill bacteria  to interrupt plaque formation cycle.  Have used for 3 months now.</li>
    <li> I use product at least twice daily. Best product I have ever used. Best for me is lukeward water and mouth wash solution.</li>
    <li> The unit is easy to use. It has multiple settings and came with various types of brushing tools which store conveniently in the cover of the reservoir. It also has a small footprint, so it takes up little space.</li>
    <li> it works bit of a pain but like I said it works</li>
    <li> Makes a real difference. It&#x27;s incredible how much stuff gets stuck between the teeth! Water pik gets it out immediately. And it&#x27;s a great gum massage too!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik was received on time, well packaged and ready for use.  It is easy to go from the package to use with multiple attachments to meet a variety of needs.  (At this point I tend to use only 1 attachment, but plan to start \\&quot;branching out\\&quot; ;)  Only complaint, this model requires an outlet so the unit takes up counter space unless you chose to unplug it and store it after each use, which is way too cumbersome for me.  Minor issue as I use the product all the time with positive results.</li>
    <li> As a dental professional, I am always trying new products. I decided to try the Waterpik and am pleased with the results. Not only does it remove plaque, but it also stimulates the gums and flushes out bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this item should only be used in ADDITION to flossing. It will not COMPLETELY remove plaque from your teeth. I flossed after using the Waterpik and found plaque came up on the floss still. I have done this several times and always find some plaque on the floss after using the Waterpik- although I find much less plaque on the floss compared to flossing alone. Try it for yourself. (By the way, I always do \\&quot;C\\&quot; shaped flossing, which is the proper way to floss. I don&#x27;t just snap the floss between my teeth as fast as I can!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-- this is a great product, but it does not replace flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to add this in addition to brushing (two minutes, two times a day) and flossing (once a day), then by all means buy this product. If you&#x27;re looking to replace flossing, I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Although I am still trying to figure out how to use it properly, it is so much better than flossing.  I have never had a cavity, and I never floss; however, I thought maybe I should start putting a little extra effort into caring for my teeth since I stopped using the Sonicare when it dislodged my bonding...twice!  My teeth have never felt so clean...even cleaner than after the dentist!  I would recommend this to anyone else who hates to floss.</li>
    <li> Replaces a Water Pic that I&#x27;ve had for over ten years. I don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;. I will not buy anymore items from Water Pic. EnoughSaid.</li>
    <li> I have  bought now three waterpiks in the last 6 months  the first two were the battery operated ones.   they worked quite well at first, but , quite soon, the battery was unable to recharge, so I bought another one.      Okay I said, maybe batteries are the problem, this is a good technology, so I will buy a regular electric one.     I would say it is completely unworkable. It is so cheaply made that nothing works right.  Very difficult to connect the parts, the water jet is uncontrollable, the whole thin is cumbersome. I will throw it away after trying to use it three times.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item 1 month ago and it&#x27;s better than I expected. Shipping was prompt and packaged well. So much better than flossing with string, but use warm water as cold water may cause some discomfort for those with sensitive teeth. I gave this item 5 stars for ease of use and effectiveness at removing food between teeth.</li>
    <li> quiet, compact, priced fairly.  I was able to attach my Grossen Nasal tip end over one of the attachments and I now have a much better Nasal irrigator than the Grossen Unit which costs significantly more and leaks within a short time.  If this unit holds up, I will be in heaven!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I&#x27;ll say this item works great.  The last years, I added a sonicare toothbrush, this, glide floss and a tongue sweeper pro (scraper) to the arsenal.  The combined cost is less than a single dental problem - so if they prevent anything, that&#x27;s automatically money back in my pocket.  I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks for 3 years now, the first one died on me after the first year.  However, I used to add a cup of listerine to my first one for extra cleaning.  After some time, when I thought the water container became grungy, I rinsed it and used a paper towel to clean it out.  The paper towel came out extremely purple (same color as the water container) - it was obvious that the plastic was dissolving somehow but I thought it was just really cheap plastic or something.  This happened everytime I cleaned it.  After it died, I got a new waterpik (same model) and as an experiment I only put water into it. It&#x27;s been 2 years and I never put listerine in it, and when I wipe the inside of the container, nothing smears off at all.  So, personally, I just use concentrated listerine after waterpikking and never put it in the machine itself.  I figure some of the complaints of broken machines may be traced back to this practice.  Either the dissolved gunk from the container clogs up the motor over time, or listerine has that effect on the internal plastic components as well.  Perhaps Waterpik fixed this in the meantime, seems like a glaring defect to how many people use it, but just a word of caution.  TLDR: DON&#x27;T USE MOUTHWASH IN THIS!!!  Edit: June 2012.  Second one still works after 4 years by using only water. Edit: Sept 2016.  This second machine still working.  Every so often flush it with vinegar to prevent hard water problems.  Crack has developed in hose, near base of handle, youtube has a fix for it.  Might look into Jetpik when they fix reliability issues.  This unit has served me well so far. EDIT: Spring 2017.  Machine &#x27;died&#x27; last fall, it still functioned but the hose crack was too much work and I got a replacement instead of spending hours going to the hardware store.  It worked well when I had it.  Would recommend.  I got a chinese knockoff I doubt will last a fraction of the time just for variety.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a recommendation from a dental hygienist that it would help my lack of flossing.  I am very impressed with the design and suitability for storage of the product.  It works very well and I&#x27;m pleased I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> A great way to keep your mouth clean. It will definitely pay itself over time. Over a year running and still working well. Once or twice a day will help your dental hygiene tremendously. Five stars well deserved. Much better than manual flossing.</li>
    <li> I have braces and hated threading floss and the resulting tugs and tangles with dental floss. With the Waterpik, I get a strong floss, clean braces, and healthy gums! I love my Waterpik!</li>
    <li> I brush and floss daily, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever incorporated a waterpik into my daily oral hygiene program.  I love it.  I can really feel the differnce. My gums and teeth feel so much cleaner and healthier.  I am looking forward to see what my dentist has to say at my next check up.</li>
    <li> The machine is performing to my expectation so far, even though I haven&#x27;t tried the max strength of it yet. It saves time by doing flossing, mini-brushing between teeth, and mouth washing altogether (as I add listerine into the machine&#x27;s reservoir). I hope this will help alleviate my periodontitis as well.</li>
    <li> I have been conscientiously cleaning my teeth and using waterpik ultra. However, its tube starts to leak after one year of usage, at the joint of the tube and the body of the machine. What a pity.  I am switching to Hydrofloss now.</li>
    <li> After recent periodontal work, I bought this at the suggestion of my dentist.  Having used one many years ago, and after reading many of the reviews criticizing the quality of the product, I ordered it lacking impressive alternatives. I used it 3 times a day, pleased with its performance until it suddenly died within 30 days. Because it was within the 90 day return, there was no problem returning it for a refund. [I recommend using the &amp;#34;chat&amp;#34; return feature to get all questions answered. But I decided I needed to buy the replacement from a local store at a competitive price where I could return it during the first 90 days since I now expect the need to do so given the questionable durability of the product. Why can&#x27;t a company-- given the thousands of reviews criticizing quality, decide to improve the product and the place of manufacture like the USA? Wouldn&#x27;t people like me pay more for quality? I would.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik Ultra that I have owned. I loved the first one as it lasted for over eight years. I figured that for $35.00 that was a pretty good buy, so, I bought another one and I noticed that the container is now a little larger and the unit seems to run somewhat more quiet than my previous unit. I&#x27;m happy with this unit.</li>
    <li> Having used this particular waterpik in the past it was the only style that I wanted to replace it with.  Simple to use and will last for a long, long time - even with excessive usage.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my son to clean around his orthodontic appliances. The product does well and he uses it 2X daily. It does a better job of cleaning around the wires and brackets than the stuff they give you at the orthodontist.     The design is an improvement over the one I used as a kid.    Even with free shipping, the item arrived in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Waterpik for my daughter who has braces. Works great, much easier for her to clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Referred by another family who has kids with braces, we bought the Waterpik ultra water flosser via Amazon and it&#x27;s in use by five family members nightly since it arrived.  Our 15 yr. old has braces and she swears by it.  It has a small footprint on our bathroom sink which makes the parents happy!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I was having a hard time healing after having my wisdom teeth removed - still painful a week later.  Turned out there was food stuck in the hole that I didn&#x27;t know about!  Ever since I got this product it&#x27;s not a problem.  You wouldn&#x27;t believe the crap that comes out from between your teeth everyday.  I&#x27;ve only had it about a month but I really like it.  I am confused about one thing - this product comes with 6 different heads.  The lid holds 4 of them, and you can store one in the handle.  What about the last one?  I was able to just store it loose in the lid compartment, but it seemed odd anyway.      Great product, worth every penny!  If it seems high priced, think about how much it costs you to get a cavity filled!</li>
    <li> I use this every night and even have a spare for traveling.  It is easy to use and clean, it also is pretty durable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Vast improvement over earlier waterpiks. Better location for controls and storage of accessories etc. Hope this one lasts longer though.  Earlier models did tend to wear out quickly!</li>
    <li> I received this a few days ago and have used it every day since. There&#x27;s a lot of attachments for it but I just use one the entire time. I run it on about a 6 currently. The lower settings work alright but a higher setting will clean a little better. Of course you also run through water faster on higher settings. You definitely need to keep a cup next to it to refill while you use it. The only negative I have for this is the small reservoir. I hate flossing but this thing makes it so fast and easy there&#x27;s no excuse to skip it.</li>
    <li> After I used it, I bought 2 waterpiks.  I presented my parents. It&#x27;s too good for my family.  highly recommend the product to people who has teeth.</li>
    <li> The Water Flosser work very well and I&#x27;m impressed with its cleaning ability.  This is the third Waterpik I&#x27;ve owned.    The first worked well for years.   The second was a piece of junk.  The hose continually would puncture where it would attach to the hand-piece, I would repair it time after time, shortening the hose until it was un-usable.  It worked okay otherwise, just was a poor piece of workmanship or at least engineering.  Only lasted a little over a year.  Checked on the Net, no mention of a recall or fix, except for repair kits to replace the hose with a cheapy splice kit.    The water flosser works great, no problems so far.   Would have liked to have more regular flosser heads and skipped the other tools.    Directions say you can add oral care products to the tank, but say some may shorten the life of the unit.  They don&#x27;t say which ones to avoid.  I do use H2O2 and H2O2 based products with the unit.    If the hose holds up, I think this will be a great product.    Also owned an interpak waterpik knockoff, a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price!!  If you do not like to floss but enjoy that freshly cleaned post dental appiontment feeling, you will love this product.  Amazon has the best price available on this product.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Does a good job removing stuff from between the teeth.  The ability to change the pressure is also greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> Just bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and a Phillips Sonicare Flexcare plus toothbrush.  I&#x27;m seeing gums in the mirror I didn&#x27;t know existed (nor did I know they were being blocked), the pulsing water is extremely powerful, has increased blood flow in my gums, the coloring looks healthier, and it feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to begin using, and it changes everything.  I&#x27;m addicted and think everyone should own these products!</li>
    <li> I have a 13 year old with braces. The Waterpick was a good decision. He doesn&#x27;t use it often but when he does, it does a great job! They often ask go they can</li>
    <li> This is our second purchase of this product.  Our first one was bought in Nov. of 2013 at the request of our dental hygientist.  We bought the second one this month because we both so loved the first one enough that we had to have one for our RV as well as our home!  This product works so well, you will find yourself forgetting about brushing at times.  It has completely reversed all of the pockets we use to have and my gum recession.  We are in our 60’s and our gums are as healthy as when we were in our teens!  I kid you not!  ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Unit leaks and flange holder cracks and breaks. Do not waste money. Waterpik gone downhill in quality.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product.  Since using this the visits to the dentist have improved greatly, not to say they were bad better and I visit the dentist very six months.  You don&#x27;t realize what you miss by flossing and brushing alone.  This does take up a little space on the counter.</li>
    <li> My teeth always feel cleaner after using this. There is a bit of a learning curve, as it can be a messy process to start. I&#x27;m not the best at flossing, but I try to use this and floss at least once a week. This helps blast away any gunk left behind my permanent retainer. My teeth seem happier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last couple of months now ...  and my teeth and gums feel a lot fresher and cleaner. and no more bleeding gums due to flossing or fighting with the floss to get it in the gaps between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all - the speed of the jet is pretty fast - on a full speed, it can fly close to 8-10&#x27; - with that kind of speed - it can actually cause your gums to bleed (atleast mine did) and I had to reduce the speed where it comfortable for me (i keep the 4th/5th speed setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at high speeds, your mouth can fill up pretty fast with water and you need to keep spitting out often, the way I do it is that I have set this up right next to the sink and while flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - i would highly recommend it as an alternative to flossing</li>
    <li> This product worked really well as recommended by my dentist. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but now after a year &amp; a half the stand that holds it broke a few months ago &amp; as of yesterday i have to get a new one because it no longer works.</li>
    <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentist recommend I get a water flosser, and so far this one has served me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like it gets deeper into the gums, and overall more hygienic than traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Easy to use once you get the hang of it. A water flosser was recommended by my dentist and I definitely feel like it is doing my teeth and gums good to use it daily.</li>
    <li> This flosser is so good I bought a 2nd one for travel.</li>
    <li> This thing works very well......would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace my old one which eventually died. I was a big fan of this product, but my new one leaked. The seller was great and very responsive and mailed me a replacement. The second one also leaked, and so I called Waterpik. They told me that I have to empty the water container each time after I use it, that it will leak if I don&#x27;t. That is a pain plus I have never had this problem before with my old unit (same model) nor has any of my family members who I have bought Waterpik for had a leaking problem with their older units so I can&#x27;t help but think that the quality of their product has dropped or it is an excuse from Waterpik. I am contacting the seller to return this second leaking one and I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does exactly what it claims-- cleans around and between teeth quite well. It, however, takes a bit of time to learn to use properly.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. :-D Very Happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  It has held up for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> It can do the job: clean my teeth. however, the noise made from this machine is so loud that my neighbors think im using a chainsaw</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as she now has braces, she loves it, says it is one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve ever bought. Really aids in her ability to thoroughly clean her teeth.</li>
    <li> this is a great waterpik.  I had the large stationary and threw it away after getting the portable.</li>
    <li> I love that fresh, clean feeling I get from using this appliance.  It is the same feeling I get when I leave the Dentist office after a cleaning.  I am always amazed at how gentle, yet effective this device cleans and flosses at the same time.  I use this in conjunction with an electric tooth brush to keep my cavities to zero.&lt;br /&gt;I had cancer and radiation treatments on my lower jaw three years ago. Since using this product and the electric tooth brush I have had no cavities and no problems with my teeth.  That is a blessing since a cavity or dental problem combined with a radiated jaw would result in a very costly &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; which would not be covered by ANY dental plan.  If you are concerned about keeping your teeth and gums in tip top shape then this is an absolute must IMHO.  I will never be without this waterpik for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Perfect teeth flosser. I bought it at the recommendation of my dentist and I have not been disappointed. My teeth feel so much cleaner now, especially after eating! I am not sure what I would do now without it. The design of the machine is great. I love the fact that I can push the button on the handle to pause it, and the moveable (?rotating) tooth flosser.</li>
    <li> Tube connecting water reservoir to the hand handle is leaking.</li>
    <li> The dentist and periodontics&#x27; doc both recommended this to me.  I really like it, but the water can get away from you sometimes, just use the button....</li>
    <li> Good item needs to be cleaned once a month thou. A lot of water stains but that&#x27;s normal. No issues so far had it for a year or so.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I was a 20 year smoker who quit 6 months ago and needless to say some of my gums were in bad shape. In certain areas they were red and swollen and throbbing. When my dentist measured them i had some 7&#x27;s and 8&#x27;s in the upper back. I have been using this several times a week for 5 months now, usually with a bit of hydrogen peroxide in the water and it has made a huge difference. They aren&#x27;t perfect and this doesn&#x27;t substitute a dentist but I have seen them turn to dark red and painful to a healthier pink. I never go above pressure #5 and it does an excellent job of getting food out of your gums.</li>
    <li> I am not too satisfied with this flosser. as it leaks from the handle while flossing</li>
    <li> Love how clean it makes my gums and teeth</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was having a problem getting floss under a bridge. The Ultra Water Flosser works!</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t do with out it as it flushes out all the food between your teeth</li>
    <li> I love this machine. So much more efficient than regular flossing!</li>
    <li> I LLOOOOOVVVEEEE MY WATERPIK.&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t imagine life without now. I always hated flossing (but still did it) and now it&#x27;s just so easy ( a bit messy). All I can recommend is to not do it while you are wearing your best clothes, you just might get wet.</li>
    <li> This was a waste.  Its sitting in my hall closet because a piece of the plastic broke off and when you turn it on, all the water pours out onto the counter.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars!  My dentist told me to pick this up. Said its a great tool for my teeth. I love it. The pieces that come out from my teeth sometimes is astounding. Also, the power out of it, is also shocking. I havent even put it on full force yet. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now &amp; really love it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Good Product, good price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Great product and it came in a timely manor, AWSOME....</li>
    <li> works great, easy to set up/  small but just right to fit  where we need it</li>
    <li> I have been using a Water Pic for almost 20 years and my dentist always tells me &amp;#34;Whatever you are using, keep it up.&amp;#34;  I ordered the Water Pic because my old one finally died.  Delivery of the item was amazing. I ordered it one afternoon with standard shipping and it arrived before 10:00 AM the following day.  Amazon delivery has always been good, but this was amazing.</li>
    <li> Have used several older models from waterpick company so I did not hesitate when time came to replace the old ones. The one so far is the best and the water pressure very strong and can be adjusted etc. Price here was the best I can find so I give amazon 5 star for service and price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going through withdrawals because I can&#x27;t do this since I am away from home for a few weeks.  Should have brought it with me.</li>
    <li> Good waterpik, very powerful. Only at #4 setting so far and its pretty powerful. Would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> This is great.  We use it everyday.. Super Water Pik.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> The product is mostly ok.  It does not do as good a job as floss in some respects but does fairly well overall.  My water flow button as started to stick so if I stop the flow I can&#x27;t get it started again unless I hit the button with something hard.  Finger pressure won&#x27;t release it.  I don&#x27;t like sending items back for repair so will just have to put up with it for now.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik water flosser is a great substitute for flossing by string floss, which for me is very problematic. This device is a pleasure to use, and it was delivered promptly in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband on dentist&#x27;s orders. He says it works great and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommened I buy this product and within two weeks of use my teeth were whiter cleaner and have not bleed nearly as much as they had  just so my dentist and she noted a vast improvement in my teeth</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife, easy and powerful.  She has had it for a few months, no issues at all parts are available.</li>
    <li> POWERWASHING MY TEETH IS AWESOME. THIS THING DOES IT WELL.</li>
    <li> Purchased this at the recommendation of my dentist, and he&#x27;s right! The only product I have used that gives a feeling close to a cleaning at the hygenist.  My gum inflamation has healed quite a bit too. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the splashing that others have mentioned. If you follow the directions and go slowly at first, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this daily and it has seemed to cut down on her dental problems.  It is powerful enouth to mremove nearly all food particles and yet small enough that it does not cramp her mouth to use it..</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one we bought from our dentist several years ago. We&#x27;ve had this Waterpik flosser for a few years now, and it still works just as good as new. It has been a great positive for helping us keep healthy teeth and gums. Just about every time we go to our new dentist we get positive comments on how well we are taking care of our teeth. Nevertheless, this flosser does not eliminate the need to use regular floss, but  enhances and improves your teeth and gum health. The power/water pressure is fully adjustable so almost anyone can use it. It&#x27;s a good idea to run fresh water through it after each use if you use a diluted mouthwash solution in it like we do. We been using about a one third mixture of mouthwash to water in ours for many years and it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago because I have periodontal disease. After having the first big cleaning I started using this water pick and got my gums back to healthy shape in no time. I like it over flossing not just because it&#x27;s easier but because I feel it keeps my gums in better &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; due to the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I&#x27;ve had is recently the button gets stuck and I have to press it bunch for it to loosen up. I&#x27;ll order a new one, but that&#x27;s a bit of a bummer.</li>
    <li> Product is in use every day and have very little difficulties with it. Yes I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for daily for 2 months.  The first time i used it made my gums bleed heavily..probably because i&#x27;m horrible floss-er.  My first dentist appointment is in a month, i&#x27;ll see if the dentists notices a difference.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of this product after getting braces at age 56 - very pleased with price and quality of product!  Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> this water pick is just what I needed it works great I have extra clean teeth now. thank you much</li>
    <li> This is my first water flosser. . I can&#x27;t compare it to any others, but to say I was pleased would be an understatement. Price, although not the cheapest, was very fair. A little slow on the delivery but well worth the wait. I have only used it a few weeks, but am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the third or forth Waterpik I have had. The only problem is that the plastic&lt;br /&gt;tubing springs a leak. This is the nicest I have had. The plastic tubing is positioned better and&lt;br /&gt;I htink it will not break. The styling is also better.</li>
    <li> Broke after about a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made of of very cheap parts. The spring used to push out the &#x27;hold water&#x27; button gets jammed constantly, making the product useless.</li>
    <li> I have used this device for about 6 months and I wish I had gotten one sooner. After brushing you can still get bits of debris out of the teeth and since I don&#x27; t like the toothpaste taste after brushing, I can floss out all that residue. I had thought that my sonicare was thorough, but I was wrong. Just like the dentist says, brush and floss.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the product a card read &amp;#34;If there&#x27;s a problem, don&#x27;t return the unit...&amp;#34; That gave me pause. It suggested that these are problematic. Mine worked fine for a year until it just stopped working. Go return it or hassle to get a new one. No way. And in the end you are better off buying things like this at a Costco where they can be returned, few questions asked.</li>
    <li> Better than flossing and toothbrush,this is very good product .this water pick is just what I needed it works great I have extra clean teeth now. thank you much</li>
    <li> Excellent and works better than floss in removing fine particles. Only one tip needed, for along the gumline. Don&#x27;t have any reliability issues with mine; has worked for over two years- calnative1</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and good for your healthy teeth!!! If you want to keep good teeth, you can click and buy it.</li>
    <li> This Waterpike has saved my teeth....literally. I went to the dentist about 1.5 years ago and found out that I was quickly developing Periodontitis (gum infection) in the back of my mouth. The dentist injected some antibiotics but made it clear that was just a temporary fix. In order to truly combat the Periodontitis I would have to step my oral hygiene game up big time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been very good with brushing and okay with flossing but that wasn&#x27;t going to cut it anymore. The dentist recommended flossing twice a day but even went a step farther to recommend this Waterpik. I tried flossing for a few weeks but for some reason the Waterpik recommendation stayed on my mind. I decided to make the purchase and boy am I glad I did. My daily routine now is brushing and flossing in the morning and brushing and waterpik&#x27;ing in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone to the dentist three times since the time the dentist discovered Periodontitis. And all three times the dentist has confirmed that the Periodontitis is gone. I can&#x27;t always tell if the Waterpik is working (compared to the flossing where you see junk on the string) but the dentist is able to confirm that it is definitely helping improve my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik has several attachments and you can adjust the speed. I usually go with the highest speed because #YOLO. It is somewhat uncomfortable but doesn&#x27;t last more than 1-2 minutes and in my opinion is well worth it. Make sure to lean your head down a little bit above the sink so that the water falls into the drain - bending over also helps prevent the water from splashing when it hits the sink. I am very happy with this purchase and recommend it to anybody looking to step their oral hygiene game up regardless if they have Periodontitis or not.</li>
    <li> No longer works and it&#x27;s too late to return it. Very unhappy, I got the same one from target and it lasted much longer.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Waterpik and I can&#x27;t believe how much noise this flosser makes. It&#x27;s nothing like my first one which was very quiet. However it does do the job it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> This is the first time to use a water flosser. I found that Waterpick it is very good in terms of performance. Also, the different types of picks that are included make it more effective. On the negative side, it produces a relatively loud sound during use, however this is a minor drawback compared to its benefits. The package came in good shape and delivered on time. I recommend this product for anyone intending to buy a water flosser.</li>
    <li> Fulfilled my wishes as a consumer, was just as they said is was, no complaints from me and I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Received the Product well packed and good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Work like a charm, can&#x27;t complaing about the device itself.&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure adjust feature is perfect, if it is a &amp;#34;letuce&amp;#34; stuck you go on smooth jet, if this is a Pork Ribblet from outback... then you go all the way !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for a couple months, I expect to come back here and write something more detailed.&lt;br /&gt;Peace!</li>
    <li> My mom recommended the Waterpik to me. Admittedly I don&#x27;t use it as much as I maybe should - once every one or two weeks now. Every time I use it, I love the clean, fresh feeling of my teeth, as if I have just had a thorough cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. I haven&#x27;t had cavities since I started to use it, which is a GREAT thing, since our family has rotten teeth genes and all of us have tons of fillings and other dental work. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love my water pic and this replaces an old one that stopped working, I was so glad to find this and that Amazon makes the buy so easy!</li>
    <li> I hate flossing.  Really, really hate it.  My dental hygienist keeps telling me I need to do it, so I started researching devices to help me.  I purchased this Waterpik based on all the good reviews, thinking I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  It&#x27;s extremely easy to use... I just fill it up with warm water (and sometimes add a small capful of mouthwash to it) and then simply spray between my teeth and around my gum line.  There is literally no pain associated with this thing (I associate regular flossing with pain).  I really wasn&#x27;t sure just how well it was working until my next trip back to the dentist a few months later.  I didn&#x27;t tell them what I had been doing, but they could certainly tell a difference!  Way to go Waterpik!</li>
    <li> I have owned a Waterpik for many years. It finally bought the farm and it was time to be replaced. I shopped several sites and found this product fit my needs and budget the best. The product arrived quickly and in good condition. Minimum assembly and is working better than my last one.</li>
    <li> This is my first water pik I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my 12 yr daughter after she got her braces.&lt;br /&gt;The water pik works good. I like all the different attachments for the pik. And it evens comes with one for her braces.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this water pik!!</li>
    <li> keeps teeth clean and stimulates gums.  Very satisfied.  Need to be careful that you don&#x27;t damage your gums.  Competitively priced so check that out before buying</li>
    <li> I like it very much.Every night I use it and it is useful to help you to clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> my mother in law referred us to this. Omg the same day you use it you will feel a difference in your teeth. Our dentist tells us whatever we are doing to keep it up.</li>
    <li> This waterpik works like a charm. It gives me a feeling close to that &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; feeling without having to sit in that chair with all those smells and noises. Not saying that it replaces the dentist but definitely does more to rid plaque than flossing alone. i have a permanent retainer behind my lower front teeth and helps dramatically!</li>
    <li> Wonderful machine, does exactly as claimed.</li>
    <li> My dentist said my teeth looked better, so I&#x27;m sold. It was worth the money. That said I haven&#x27;t totally given up on my good old floss either.</li>
    <li> Bought this years and years ago. Still kickin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Great for quick &#x27;flossing&#x27;...there is a &#x27;learning curve&#x27;. Your gums will have to get used to the pressure before using the higher strength jet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend traditional flossing every now and then and use this as a follow up. Also, fill the chamber with some mouth wash and water--kill two birds with one stone. :D</li>
    <li> It works if you use it.  Still think a bit of regular flossing might help.</li>
    <li> I take particular care of my teeth.  The Waterpick Water Flosser is invaluable to me.  Works well.  Does an excellent job.  Has replacement parts available.</li>
    <li> First, this Ultra Flosser does a superb job. I bought it after having seen the excellent video review at http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HEG12C48KXPW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R2HEG12C48KXPW.

Long ago I saw this video on his site that explains how to save money on inexpensive disposable  razors: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does the Waterpik save money in this unexpected way?  Trying to clean a disposable razor under the water faucet is a losing proposition. However quickly blasting the razor with the Waterpik cleans it perfectly. Then it&#x27;s a simple matter of drying the razor with a hair dryer; it only takes a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ..;. with tongue in cheek (which is NOT a suggestion on how to clean your teeth :) I&#x27;m glad to report the Waterpik exceeded my expectations as a dental hygiene tool and also keeps my cheap-o disposable razor clean and usable for many months.</li>
    <li> I recently had to get a bridge and flossing between some teeth became tricky.&lt;br /&gt;This device is easy to use and quite worth the money because you don&#x27;t have to buy floss anymore.</li>
    <li> This water pik is great.  Using it twice a day - prevents gum disease, tooth decay and build up of plaque and tartar.  I bought this to replace my old Waterpik which died ( after 10 years of use).  It&#x27;s amazing to brush your teeth after dinner and then use the pik.  All sorts of little pieces of food apparently hide from the toothbrush but not from the waterpik.  I bought one for each of my adult children and they love it.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> After several uses, I have now learned how to use this waterpik flosser properly and like it very much.  Moderately priced for the importance of the product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Adjustable speed and tips, though intend to use just the general one.  Once you get the hang of it, you won&#x27;t wet the counter or mirror :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, holds tons of water.  A little loud, but whatever.</li>
    <li> But I find that it, too, leaks (but just a little) when using the tip I prefer on the highest pressure setting.  Now I see in the instructions that when using that tip it should be set on a lower pressure.  My bad.  The flosser is a big help for dental health, especially when used with diluted peroxide periodically.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this item. It really gets a lot of crud out of my teeth. I have tried flossing after using it, and there is little to nothing left, and it is much more enjoyable for me to do than flossing. The only problem that I have with it is that the pause button, the large blue button on the part that you hold, began sticking shortly after I got it. I only really used that to move from bottom to top, and it works just as well to keep my left hand on the machine and just shut it off for a second.</li>
    <li> This flosser is powerful. I like that you can change the force. It is  easy to fill with water and easy to clean. It is a great deal at any price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and will fit the bill I need it for. Thanks again for quick shipping and a great value for my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing some issues with my gums for the past couple of years; and finally I felt like I needed to start using a product like this. I was not excited about the prospect. I researched different models and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research paid off. This model EXCEEDS my expectations - it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my small bathroom countertop; it&#x27;s the smallest waterpik I&#x27;ve ever seen, but it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to use...my 6-year-old son and I share it.&lt;br /&gt;- A wide variety of jet tips (6) are included, including 2 of the &amp;#34;general use&amp;#34; type with differently colored ends - again, perfect for me and the kiddo so we can see which one is our own at a glance.&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s convenient, accessible storage for the tips that are in use (up to 4) inside the lid that opens up.&lt;br /&gt;- I use it together with my SonicCare toothbrush - and I literally feel like I&#x27;ve been to visit the dentist every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether my dentist notices any improvement remains to be seen; my next appointment is 4 months from now. If I remember to, I&#x27;ll come and update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a waterpik and have limited space, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Have read bad reviews of this product and I disagree.  For the price this unit does what we want it to do.  It is a great fourth step to oral hygiene.  Floss, brush, scrape tongue, and use this irrigator.  My husband and I each have one and recently lost both to a power surge which melted components, even tho&#x27; both were plugged into approved bathroom outlets. I recommend unplugging after each use, also, never leave water in the resevoir.  Dump it out, invert resevoir on a towel, and dab water out of the contact point on unit where resevoir sits.  These steps will greatly improve the life of your product.  Some complained of short hose which caused one to have to lean over the sink to use irrigator.  I can&#x27;t imagine not leaning over the sink, otherwise one would splash water all over the mirror.  The \\&quot;pic\\&quot; can be rotated with one&#x27;s fingers while in use to facilitate the correct spray angle, which also eliminates the need to over stretch the hose.  Rarely is high power advised.  Try midway, which is adequate for removing stubborn particles and massaging gums. Hope this helps.  Meanwhile, we immediately replaced our zapped Waterpiks, and have gotten into the habit of unplugging after each use.</li>
    <li> It does what is designed to do, cleaning the places around your gum line and between teeth.  This is my third unit.  These last about 18 to 24 months, then the hose between the reservoir and the hand unit breaks and can not be repaired.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old man, and I bought this water flosser a few months ago out of an interest in keeping my teeth and gums healthy.  The dentist had recommended I floss more often for some very mild gingivitis.  In addition to flossing more regularly, I use the waterpik at night probably at least 4-5 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went in for my 6 month dental cleaning, I didn&#x27;t say a word to the hygienist about the flosser.  I let her go at my teeth with the scraper for a while, and then she remarked that I seemed to have very little plaque today!  I&#x27;ve never heard that from a dentist, so I feel very encouraged about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely make sure to use it every day now that I realize it is genuinely effective at plaque removal and prevention.  I am skeptical that it could be a replacement for actual flossing, but it seems to be great for gum health too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser is a bit loud, and on the higher power settings it can run out of water in the reservoir too quickly, but I keep it at about the 3.5 setting and it gives me plenty of time to get through my routine.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help clean out my braces when I had them. Worked like a charm! Work your way up slowly to the more highly pressurized settings so your gums don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re getting attacked.My teeth feel so clean after using!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this item.  My dentist has been after me for years to purchase one, finally did and I am happy about it!</li>
    <li> I often use my Waterpik more than once per day many days of the week -- often immediately after each meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the best oral hygiene tool in captivity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this water flosser for a little over a 2 years now and its held up quite well.  No issue with the pump or power and even the tips have seen very little wear.  I like the assortment of tips that come with this unit and personally like the toothbrush attachment the most.  The one thing that would have made this a better product to me would have been a larger water tank size.  I usually run it at about 6 and fill the tank twice per usage.  Overall great product</li>
    <li> This water flosser&#x27;s incredible.  It feels like a waterpark exploding in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The last water flosser I used was from Sharper Image, it was battery powered and didn&#x27;t spray that strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily when receiving this, I was able to actually plug it into my wall.  Before turning on the switch, make sure to press the little blue button down as it&#x27;ll block the flow of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with so many little attachments, although I haven&#x27;t used all of them, the ones I have used are durable, and easy to pop-on/off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product; was actually recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> It works great and is everything Waterpik said it was.  I use it after I brush and am always amazed at what the waterpik gets out of my gums.</li>
    <li> I had this for a year now and I love it! It works perfectly! I got braces and so I only use the braces attachment, but can&#x27;t wait to try the others! I totally recommend this to all people with braces. My husband is an oral surgeon, and he told me that I NEEDED one of these, cause it would make it a lot easier to keep my teeth clean with the braces. Hate to admit it, but yet again, he was right;)</li>
    <li> This is such a great purchase! I had braces, so at times, I would get lazy to floss using the thread, so I would just waterpik and be done! Now I have permanent retainer and can&#x27;t floss the front part of my teeth so I waterpik them, and after I floss the back I still get particles out using this. I wish I could carry with my on my trips.</li>
    <li> First, I give it 5 stars for cleaning, it is amazing what it flushes out from between my teeth even after I use my Spin Brush. It&#x27;s easy to use. But a big detractor. My handle &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button keeps sticking and won&#x27;t release. It is poor design, some engineer could have easily designed a membrane covered &amp;#34;on-off&amp;#34; button that wouldn&#x27;t allow water/food particles, or whatever it is that causes it to stick. I keep soaking the handle in vinegar just to get it to release. Because of this issue, I now don&#x27;t even press the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34;, just quickly get it to my mouth as soon as I turn it on. I&#x27;ve debated about spending another $12 for a replacement handle only to have the same problem happen again. I&#x27;ve read online numerous complaints about the handle issue, so its not just an isolated incident. I think the handle should be redesigned so this doesn&#x27;t keep occuring. Do I think that the folks at Waterpik read these reviews, probably not, but if they do and they want me to rave about this product, they can email me for my address to send a replacement. I personally don&#x27;t feel I should have to spend money to fix a manufacturing design flaw. russcole@traversecitymall.com</li>
    <li> I really like this waterpik. It is just the right size to sit snugly in the corner of the bathroom vanity. More importantly, it has a nice jet stream and nice extra tools. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Your dentist will be angry at you for buying this...because it will make you need his services less! Seriously, this thing works great and I am glad I got it. It is less harsh than flossing and you can &amp;#34;work up&amp;#34; to higher pressure levels as you go to make sure you get all the gunk out of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Awesome price and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Careful, had to replace mine.  Power went out and not quite sure how it got turned on while power was out, but burned unit out.</li>
    <li> Loved this!  My dentist gave me heck about not flossing as I should. Got this and I feel much better about my teeth. I still only floss when &amp;#34;I need to&amp;#34; but use this almost every day.  Definitely less painful for dental cleaning too.</li>
    <li> This water flosser works as expected. It takes some time getting used to the pressure this unit puts out. Start off on the lower settings and work your way up. I think the cover that stores the other tips is a great and practical idea.&lt;br /&gt;If there is any improvement to be made, it would be the addition of a retractable power cord.</li>
    <li> If you have any issues with gum disease or pockets this is a must. I&#x27;ve used this product daily and to the amazement of my dentist my gum problems are nearly gone.</li>
    <li> I am sure that this machine must keep your teeth healthy. hhh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am  satisfied with your delivery sevice.. that&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> We finally had to replace our old Waterpik, which we&#x27;d had for many years.  This one is SO easy to use, and takes up very little space on our bathroom counter.  It is much quieter than the old model.</li>
    <li> I have had this for approximately nine months now and it has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> my family use this every night now, since it has more than one of the tubes, it can be easily shared among family members.&lt;br /&gt;it does its job pretty nicely with the price it has, so overall, i would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a water flosser with good price to quality ratio.</li>
    <li> It is not what is appears to be in the photo.  It is cheaply made of cheap plastic and the lid keeps on falling off.  Also the photo is misleading.  It does not come with different assorted colored pics.  This is misleading.  Everyone in the family has to use the attachments.  I did not give it one star because the water pressure is pretty good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I buy a waterpik product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use and has a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue for me is that you need to have a good balcony or to install it inside the shower or something, because it spreads water all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it really cleans very well along the gums and between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Great Item and Price cheapest I found was on this site . Works great and my Dentist suggested I buy one and use once a day. Teeth feel clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this water flosser, which does everything it&#x27;s supposed to. The following reasons are why it didn&#x27;t make five-star status for me: 1. cord attached to actual flosser could be longer; as a person with no bathroom counter, I need to sit this on the top of my toilet to be close enough to the sink, and the cord is a tad too short. 2. Machine, at times, vibrates enough for it to move; as previously mentioned, this sits on top of my toilet, and once during use it vibrated close to the edge (but did not vibrate off--never has). It slightly worried me, but only happened once. 3. There is always about a little more than a tablespoon of water left in the water holder after the machine has finished it&#x27;s cycle, requiring me to dump it out before putting the machine away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all small things, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the way this cleans my teeth and makes my mouth feel.</li>
    <li> I am suffering from gum disease last 5 years and had flap surgery 3 years back and didnt work well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist prescribed me to go for Flap Surgery and tooth replacement. I was looking for alternative products in Amazon and got many recommendations. Surprisingly saw this product and wanted to give it a try after seeing many likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product I had 9mm depth and I used this product for 3 weeks. Again I went for routine visit and was surprised to see the depth got reduced to 6mm. I will recommend to anyone who is suffering from Gum disease</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I like using it more than dental floss. i would recommend this product to any one that want to improve their dental hygine.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is great for keeping your mouth healthy and giving you a really clean feeling.  I like it better than flossing alone.  Well worth the money. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son because he recently got braces on his teeth because he was having difficulty cleaning properly.&lt;br /&gt;Now, there are no more complaints from his dentist about his poor oral hygiene since getting the braces. :)&lt;br /&gt;Great product- prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> I have several of these over the past 20 years but this is the best yet. Perfect water pressure, and I like the way you can store things in the lid. I also like having a lid to keep flying objects out of the water. Other models did not.</li>
    <li> I had a water pic previously - got it 1998 and it just died.  Hoping the new one lasts just as long.  The water pic is fantastic at keeping your teeth as close to the professional cleaning that I have ever found.</li>
    <li> Def enough pressure to clear out junk in your teeth. I even did the popcorn hull test and got them all out after messing with them in my mouth with my tongue for a few hours. Only thing is i thought i would be able to watch it spray by leaving mouth open but thats wrong water gets everywhere, on bathroom mirror, counter. Gotta close mouth and try to aim in right spot. Meanwhile when its on, you have to hold down the button or it will shoot everywhere when ur not cleaning. It does what i needed it to do so thats good though. No more floss.</li>
    <li> I think the other reviews overplay this. The production quality is average and the functionality also only average. It can also get kind of messy with a lot of water flying around. It does work overall though, so not a complete waste.</li>
    <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt; this is a very useful tool to clean tooth/ mouth through in and out. the first time I have tested with it, I was surprised by how powerful of this machine. It can dig dirty out where it clogged between your molar very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it everyday, super clean and more confidence of talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;They described in this package should have a special tip to clean tongue. I just don&#x27;t have it in package instead of another classic tip. so I do have 6 tips in box, but two of them are &#x27;classic jet tip&#x27;.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WORKS WONDERFULLY WELL.. AND I IT IS A HIGH RECOMMEND BY ME...&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD BASIC ONES DID. THE WATER BASIN&lt;br /&gt;STAYS ON MUCH MORE SECURELY.. AND THERE ARE VARIOUS SPEEDS ON IT,&lt;br /&gt;USED BY TURNING THE DIAL.. AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT VARIOUS&lt;br /&gt;PIECES THAT ATTACH TO THE HAND PIECE, FOR ONE&#x27;S MOUTH.. THIS IS GREAT&lt;br /&gt;FOR IRRIGATING THE GUMLINE.. AND MY DENTIST TOLD ME ABOUT IT..&lt;br /&gt;THEY RECOMMEND THIS ONE, TOO. IT&#x27;S MUCH MORE ADVANCED THAN THEY USED TO BE.</li>
    <li> Works great, very easy to use and has good pressure.  Very happy with the product.  HIghly recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> great product.  have a pick for every family member.  be careful when turning on first time as it will make a mess on mirror otherwise.  feel my teeth are so much cleaner after use.  great buy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 88 and 91-year-old parents. I showed them how to use it and they love it. It comes with inter-changing heads so you can brush, floss, and massage gums all with one unit. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> bought when my son got Braces. Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present, and she not only loves it, but is ordering one more for her sister. I have one for myself for more than 3 years and it is still working like new. My dentist notes significant improvement of my mouth health (when I am not lazy to use it).</li>
    <li> As it claims, it cleaned deeper and less painfully than floss.</li>
    <li> Works great as usual. This is the third water pick that I have owned over the years. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its funny how the ads for this make it look like you can use this product with a smile on your face and stay dry....NOT.  You&#x27;d better have your face squarely positioned over the sink and be prepared to wipe up after your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what its designed to do and it feels good to use it.</li>
    <li> this product functions admirably. it is slightly superior to an earlier version that has begun leaking. it uses very little space and i consider it perfect.</li>
    <li> It is great! My teeth feel smooth and clean. My gums are invigorated. It is far betterand easier than flossing.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too big. I should have bought a smaller version.  Now I have to try and dump it at a garage sale.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this product and it has helped us very much keeping our gums clean. It&#x27;s a better way than having to have to go to a periodontist. Fast seller,product is perfect.</li>
    <li> our dentist recomended we get one for our teeth so after looking at reviews we decided on this one we have had it about a month and really like everything about it we have had no problems</li>
    <li> This Waterpik works perfectly. Lots of pressure when turned up to max.  Not perfect though. I often need to refill before finishing the job.  And the tip holders in the cover won&#x27;t hold all the tips.  Also, my unit was missing the tongue cleaner even though it&#x27;s mentioned in the manual. Having said that, the unit does exactly what you buy it for, the sanitized floss.</li>
    <li> The flosser arrived quickly. My dentist recommended that i use one. its easy to use and clean and works well. It also was less expensive from this seller which was a real plus! I&#x27;m  very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I just got braces.  It does an OK job, but, the hardest pressure isn&#x27;t really that hard.  The different heads are nice to have, but, for the money, it is OK.  It is pretty loud when the motor is on, but, I am not sure how to compare it to others because it is my first one.</li>
    <li> I have several dental crowns on my teeth. As I get older, the tops of the crowns are now below the gum line. Food catches in the tops of the crowns. My dental hygienist recommended the WaterPik flosser. It works great. I still use regular floss too, but I use the WaterPik often, and my gums are comfortable and healthy.</li>
    <li> Surprised it came with all the attachments.  I&#x27;m having fun trying them all.  I&#x27;ll have two buy one more regular pik attachment so all three family members can have one. Works great!</li>
    <li> this helps my 9 year old daughter with her braces.  It makes flossing and cleaning her braces fun and she will actually use it!</li>
    <li> Very important piece of equipment to complement a well cleaned mouth</li>
    <li> I bought this waterflosser to replace an old one that died after 4 years of daily use.  The love the job this does on my teeth; it really cleans them and is a great addition to daily oral care.  But I really dislike the new product design.  Removing the water reservoir in order to fill it is cumbersome, and replacing it back onto the base when it&#x27;s full of water results in some sloshing.  I finally decided to just leave it in place and fill a pitcher with water and pour it into the reservoir.  The lid of the reservoir doubles as the storage place for the picks, and it isn&#x27;t large enough to hold all of the different picks that are included.  I don&#x27;t know why this product was redesigned when the old version was SO much better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a greatpurchase! The first rime you use it you can feel the difference in your mouth. It really helps you keep your teeth clean and we use it with a little listerine to refresh our gums. Me, my husband and our kids use it, so far we are happy to have purchased it.</li>
    <li> Works really well - lots of attachments to choose from.  I use it mainly for its gum pocket cleaning attachment.  I still floss as my dentist recommends that I continue to do so.  I add some beneficial cleaning fluid to the water which makes it even better.  Definitely cleans well.  That said, they recommend buying new attachments frequently but they are spendy and you can&#x27;t replace just one.  Some attachment replacements hard to find.  But they don&#x27;t need to be replaced as often as the literature suggests.  Also, it is a loud device but not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> After receiving a not-so-great check-up at the dentist, I decided to give this a try. It works great, with many different settings so you can get used to the pressure gradually. It is much easier to reach your back teeth than trying with dental floss. It also makes very little mess as long as you keep you mouth closed when using it.</li>
    <li> My experience on this product is nil, but my wife has a problem with her teeth and gum and her dentist suggest it. So far is going well.</li>
    <li> I always use this at morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds not loud than before my Waterpick.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my gums clean. And I do nt get anymore swollen.&lt;br /&gt;But it is not easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Water comes out to fast for me.</li>
    <li> great buy love the water flosser!</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do: blows yucky junk out from between your teeth and gums. Works great.</li>
    <li> The BEST way to really clean the wax out of your ears ... takes a little getting used to but you will come to LOVE how clean you can get your ears ...</li>
    <li> I adore my Waterpik!  I never knew what I was missing until I got one.  I&#x27;m amazed by the food particles that will come out of my mouth even after brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik about four years ago and it&#x27;s still working like a champ (I use it five times a week or so). Yes, I suppose if you&#x27;re hard on things in general, you&#x27;ll break it, as like some reviewers have reported. But with reasonable care, it should last you a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the benefits, they are measurable. I am prone to developing plaque on the inner surfaces of my bottom teeth front. Using this and flossing every day has cut way down on the plaque. My hygienist doesn&#x27;t need to use that ear-piercing, sadistic sonic thing nearly as much. That alone is worth the cost of the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This is the best waterflosser I have ever used and that&#x27;s saying a lot since I&#x27;ve tried a bunch. It can be a bit messy if not used correctly but once you get hang of it it&#x27;s less messy. Other than that it is a godsend. I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to anyone concerned with maintaining excellent oral health. In my opinion everyone should own a waterflosser, especially people that don&#x27;t like to manually floss. The seller was great as well, shipping was fast and product arrived nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I started using this after my last professional cleaning, and my teeth have looked great for months now. I have small teeth that are close together in a very small mouth, and it is very easy for me to get to each and every tooth. I love the little pause button too - I&#x27;ve avoided spraying water up my nose countless times now because of it, but my &amp;#34;accidental&amp;#34; sprays to my husband&#x27;s face have been a total blast. He doesn&#x27;t know about the pause button, lol. Shhhhh. It&#x27;ll be our little secret. ;D</li>
    <li> Worked great at first but after 4 months started losing its power</li>
    <li> Hose became brittle and snapped off in just 3 years.  I didn&#x27;t use this very often, but was pleased with cleaning performance when I did.  However, the hose is very poor quality and it snapped off the end of the wand.  I opened up the wand to see if I could reattach the hose, but the hose was so brittle is just broke apart.  No excuse for this poor quality material.  My previous Waterpik last many years.  Very disappointed with this one -- will not buy another.</li>
    <li> Perfect waterflosser. Gets any debris out of your gum line, especially if you have had extensive dental work..</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 years and 7 months ago. I have used it once daily (about 1300 uses, or maybe 43 hours total usage at 2 minutes per use) since I bought it.At first, I did not like the fact I had to fiddle with the tank and really push down on it to make sure the water would flow but I got used to that. I think a child might have difficulty with this, but I lived with it. Two weeks ago the water hose broke about 2 inches below the hand unit. It just snapped - not a bend point or a pinch point - however it is where the unit rests when not being used. Waterpik&#x27;s response to my complaint was that it&#x27;s out of warranty and directed me to their replacement parts division. Well I won&#x27;t be spending more money on a bad hose - in my opinion, they clearly have not done a good job specifying the tubing here. Purchase at your own risk. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these for over 3 years now and still love and use it! My kids love and use it as well and they hate brushing their teeth. This makes them want to and enjoy to do so. Very easy to use and makes your mouth feel very clean. A good friend saw it and asked about it and went our and bought one right away and he loves it too. Worth every dollar I paid and I would buy again. Yes it takes up some room but that doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit. I&#x27;ve never had much counter space but always made room for this, it doesn&#x27;t take up that muck space that I miss it.</li>
    <li> I went to the dentist the other day to find out that I had a few cavities!  After some work I was talking to the Asst and she was saying to get a water pik with GOOD preasure along with a good supply for water.  She recommended I put 1 teaspoon of bleach in the water area with warm water.  This gets into the gums and kills the plaque.  Well,  I have been doing this for 2 weeks and it was alittle uncomfortable at 1st but I am used to this now.  My gums are getting so healthy.  I LOVE this pik,  It is great quality.  Love all the tools.  I shopped around for a pik and I decided that this was the best price with all the options.  I am so so happy with my choice.  Thanks to the good experience and painless purchase I am on my way to less bills at the dentist.  Thanks again,  I would do it all over again!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent choice, as there are several options to the Waterpik.  This is my 2nd waterpik and I highly recommend this type.</li>
    <li> It had been about 25 years since I owned a Waterpik.  I don&#x27;t remember liking or using the old style \\&quot;piks\\&quot; that much.  Hygienists and dentists always preach flossing.  Trouble is I hate flossing, so just couldn&#x27;t get into a lasting regimen of using the tape, even the waxed kind.  My teeth are very close together; the tape was a joke.  Further, I don&#x27;t like to put my fingers into my mouth.  So recently, I saw this Ultra Water Flosser on the Amazon site and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve had this item about 2 or 3 weeks and have used it faithfully twice a day, every day -- and I actually enjoy it!  My teeth and gums have never looked better.  At first, I noticed the usual minor bleeding, but now the water runs clear.  I set the speed about mid-range, but am going to increase it to really toughen up my gums.  I need to see a dentist for a couple cavities I&#x27;ve had a while, and when I go in, I want my gums to be really healthy, and I will insist the hygienist does not use floss on me.  In fact, I doubt the need for professional cleaning since I now have this water flosser.  I also don&#x27;t believe a tape could possibly get into as many tooth crevices as a powerful water jet. A tip:  use warm water, as cold water hurts like heck if you&#x27;re sensitive.  The warm water makes my water floss sessions actually a pleasure, not a chore, and therein lies the main advantage of this device versus tape floss.  Nothing is effective unless you use it and even enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I use it every day and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. It should be a must for everyone.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik cleans great between the teeth and below the gumline. I double checked by manually cleaning afterwards and got no residue. Mouth feels good!</li>
    <li> This is my third Waterpik and it is the best yet. Many of the small gripes I had about my prior units have been fixed and the unit works great. The new adjustable pressure feature and rotating nozzle are two of many improvments. My only problem with ther new unit is the pressure and direction of effort needed to turn the unit off. It takes two hands to turn it off without having it slide across the vanity top.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Best Water flosser in the market. I have to say as an advice though, is to use it on a low pressure setting for if its used on high, it can have adverse affects. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with it! Highly recommended. :]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this Waterpik.  It works just great.  This is my first experience with using one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is fantastic.    We love the various heads and settings.    The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is that the water tank could be a bit bigger.  It runs out fairly fast, but you just have to add a bit more if you feel it is not done yet.</li>
    <li> All waterpiks do the same job.  This waterpik has some additional features such as \\&quot;many\\&quot; different tools which I may never use.  It&#x27;s a selling feature to put addititonal \\&quot;tools\\&quot; to make it more saleable.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this waterpik is the on-off switch.  I&#x27;ts difficult to turn it off without holding on to the tank.  The switch should have been turned so it goes off and on in a vertical state.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product isn&#x27;t tauted more by dentists. It is a great tool for cleaning the teeth and good oral hygene.  I just love mine and wouldn&#x27;t be without one.  This particular model comes with several tools which I never use and I am not sure that is why it was the most expensive version but I love the amount of power available to adjust the water pressure. This is a good tool to keep one&#x27;s gums in healthy shape. I highly recommend this and have purchased several for family members and grand children.</li>
    <li> I hated flossing and every time I went to the dentist he would ask if I had been flossing and I would tell him yes for the last week but before that just every so often basically because I was too lazy/tired/didn&#x27;t feel like it, as with dental floss it really felt like a job. I absolutely love this waterpik, it is so simple to use and very easy to do and you can fill it with regular water and don&#x27;t have to use distilled water so I actually look forward to doing it and my gums have never felt better....Wish I would have bought one of these a long, long time ago now!</li>
    <li> Purchased product in November 2010 and product arrived promptly.  It is actually fun to use and I am experimenting with the various \\&quot;brushes\\&quot;  I have found the brushes to be a bit flimsy and not really industrial strength (durable and long lasting).  I am not sure how long the brushes are designed to last - I use the waterpik every day.  My dental hygienist had recommended this product to me and she indicated she saw nice \\&quot;pink\\&quot; healthy gums - so that is an endorsement for using it!. My hygienist also recommended adding some hyrdogen peroxide to the water basin (and use the peroxide every 2 or 3 days) as that will be an additional cleansing agent. I like using the assortment of brushes and the product is convenient to use.  I would rate the product a 5 star if the brushes were of higher quality - maybe that is just the starter kit that comes with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik for many years. I am very happy with my new Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, not only do I like the different design but also it is more functional than the old Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works good. Just make sure you empty the container after each use. If there is any liquid left and you happen to forget to attach the flosser handle back on the holder(like my kids do), the water will keep running and you end up with a mass. It is little hard to handle on younger kids since you have to push the stop flow button really hard. Other than that it is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It seems to be powerful enough to blast the gunk out from between your teeth and I can notice a difference in my gums appearance in just a month of using it. It kinda massages the gum-line while it blasts the food out. The only thing I can say is a down side to this unit is, the fluid reservoir is fairly small and at 90psi I only get about 2 minutes or so of squirt time. I like to thoroughly clean my teeth before bed, and I use one full reservoir for the upper teeth, than another full reservoir for the lower. Another downside is the noise. Its a bit loud (relative) for such a small device, it shakes and thumps about like the dickens but so far, I have not heard a complaint from my roommates. For a small, affordable water flossing solution, I would recommend this unit easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik 3 years ago when I had lingual braces (braces behind the teeth), and wanted to find a way to clean the hard to reach spots.  The Waterpik did a great job in doing that, and in cleaning between my teeth and along the gum line.  It does take a little getting used to at first (the feeling of the water jet tickled), but you&#x27;ll get used to it in about a week.    The only issue I have is that it may not be the most hygienic after years of use.  Yes, you can put the various attachments, lid, and the water container in a dishwasher, but there&#x27;s little you can do about the tube connecting the handle to the machine itself.  Also, after a few years of use, the blue button on the handle allowing you to pause the water spray may become stuck when pressed.    A great product, to be sure.  Just plan on getting a replacement after 2 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for years and the one I had finally needed to be replaced. I filled the small reservoir with water and turned the setting to 10...the highest. It was a weak stream, something I wasn&#x27;t happy with after having used my old one. Then the reservoir emptied. I tried it the following day with the same results so, I called the company (as requested) and the woman who answered was not one bit helpful. Her advice: \\&quot;it&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve got and if you don&#x27;t like it, return it\\&quot;. So I did and ordered a different model</li>
    <li> As I suspected, it&#x27;s messy and that is the reason I don&#x27;t like it. Consider it a personal reason. It is powerful.</li>
    <li> I have a congenital problem that invariably results in receding gums &amp; often, tooth loss.  I&#x27;ve been battling it for years.  Knock wood (HARD!), I still have all of my teeth, although several of the molars are broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a terrible dentophobe, no thanks to a jerk of a mother who had 6 of my baby teeth pulled daily for 4 consecutive days when I was 15, after she waitd 4 years too long to have the baby teeth removed so I&#x27;d have permanent teeth.. The adults had to hog-tie me &amp; carry me into the dentist&#x27;s office the 4th day..  I spent the summer &amp; into the fall with the most godawful itching &amp; inflamed gums, sucking everything through a straw..  Called all sorts of stupid names by the other kids for having no teeth..  And all the logic in the world doesn&#x27;t register on trauma like that.  Which hasn&#x27;t helped the gum problem, especially now that I&#x27;m a great-grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a portable, rechargeable Waterpik &amp; it either had such soft action there was still lots of stuff left between my teeth, or such hard action my gums bled, depending on tip.  Neither is good..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit came yesterday (fast!), I used it immediately, and not only did my gums not bleed, it got everything out &amp; there was plenty of adjustment in the pulse harshness.  My teeth &amp; gums have never felt so good.  WOW!  Really!  Ignore anyone who gripes about solution dripping from your mouth; that&#x27;s normal for these units.  Think of it as sloppy fun, not some hygienic chore..  I wish I&#x27;d had it years ago.  It gives me hope bcs it does the job the way it should!  I rattle my tongue for this unit!</li>
    <li> Product:  Bought this about two months ago. Had to return the original unit because it kept tripping the GFCI outlet almost every other time it was turned off. Kudos to Amazon for easy replacement. From this experience I found that this product does not have a built-in GFCI safety device. Strange, since it is a 110 volt electrical device that sits right on the edge of the sink with running water. No issues with excess noise or its flossing power.    Performance:  However I have the highest praise for the product itself. Having periodontal problems for years, and on a three month periodontal maintenance schedule, I still had inflamed and bleeding gums. After using this water flosser for three weeks, the gums were noticeably better. The bleeding stopped and the inflammation greatly reduced. After two months my gums now feel tight and normal.    Recommendations:  I am no dentist but I surmise that I got these good results because I started using this product a week after a periodontal cleaning. I believe that what was especially important was that deep pockets of bacteria were removed below the gumline. Plaque is the soft biofilm that is formed almost immediately after a cleaning. If not removed within a short time it hardens into tartar or calculus - either above or below the gumline. Once this happens, it will take professionals using dental picks or a cavitron to remove it. I doubt this Waterpik, even at its highest power level, can remove the calcified deposits, especially deep below the gum line. However I am sure it is effective on plaque when it is still soft. My recommenations for others than is get a thorough dental cleaning first and then use this water flosser two or three times a day to eliminate the soft plague.</li>
    <li> Great price and a great product. Wish i got one ages ago.</li>
    <li> Although measurements may have been included in product description, I wasn&#x27;t aware this model would be so compact.  I like the smallness of it, but believe it should hold more water.  Unlike past Waterpik&#x27;s, the water runs out before I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WP still has not cured the drip from the handle issue.</li>
    <li> Because it was Waterpik, I thought it would be good.  I needed to replace my prior water flosser so I purchased this one by Waterpik.  Not only did it fail to deliver the necessary force, it was messy and difficult to use.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I do not know where to begin!   I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS THING!    My teeth are super smooth and shiny, as the plaque is blasted off them by this. It feels really nice on my gums, and they have gotten very healthy since I started using this. They are healthy, strong, and pink! I have no cavities/ fillings, or any other dental problems like that.   I started on a level 4 without feeling any discomfort (I could go up to an 8, but it was somewhat uncomfortable). Now I can go up to the level 9 without a problem! I could FEEL them getting healthier.    I think this would be VERY useful for people with braces, or crowns, or bridges, and other dental devices that are difficult to floss around.    My personal advice is to INVEST IN THIS! It may save you some very expensive dental procedures later on!!! I agree, it seems a little pricey. But it was some of the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent! Also, don&#x27;t use this as an alternative to brushing and flossing.   This probably could replace flossing, and it&#x27;s definitely better than not flossing, and if you are going to choose one, I would choose this. BUT, why not brush, floss, and waterpik? You&#x27;re teeth and gums will thank you!    \\&quot;If you are true to your teeth, they will not be false to you.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> it was good but it was FIFTY dollars..well i guess it does floss ur teeth really well and since i got i used it everyday wheras i rarely ever flossed my teeth  with regular floss...so overall if u are willing to pay 50 buck it is definetly worth it</li>
    <li> I am only giving this product a 4 out of 5 due to the mess it makes.  It could be my lack of coordination skills, but we purchased this for my son who recently got braces...well needless to say it makes a mess out of my bathroom and whoever is using it. lol  I think it is a product that takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Have now for a month, I like it in general but there are a few things that are a pain:  The main tip (like the one it is displayed with, moves. To work on the backside of your teeth, it always turns inside your mouth and it is hard to get the back of the front teeth cleaned. The water tank lid is a pain, falls in to the tank sometimes. A light flip open lid would be so much better. But it works in general well (even if I would love a little more pressure).</li>
    <li> Works very well and is far superior to the old one(original). Easy to use and lots of tips from which to choose. Recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to get one of these. It works like a charm. my only complaint is it is noisy. I would still buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is really just as good or better than flossing so I floss first then use this water pik system. It&#x27;s really fun to use. Just be careful it doesn&#x27;t sqirk all over the floor. It takes a few uses to get acclimated to it. The stream of water flow is powerful so I use the number 4 setting. When I used the number 7 setting my gums began sore. When I go in for my cleaning, I will find out if this system has made a difference in my oral health. It does need a longer cord. I have to put the device right on the edge of the sink near me to reach my mouth. Hopefully the next model fixes this problem.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims to do.  My husband uses it for his bridge.</li>
    <li> I had used Waterpiks since they were invented in the &#x27;60&#x27;s, but my old faithful had died a couple years back (it lasted many years).  I tried one of those shower types where you hook it up to the showerhead.  What a joke - no pressure and the tip kept blowing off.  This unit seems sturdy enough to last for awhile, has enough pressure to reach those pesky particles, and looks nice on the countertop.  IF it lasts for awhile, I&#x27;ll come back and give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  OK, I&#x27;ve had this long enough to come back and give it 5 stars - it&#x27;s working perfectly!</li>
    <li> I recently got braces, and this is SOOOOOO much better than threading floss between, then flossing, then pulling the floss back out, and then doing it over again for another area. It&#x27;s faster, easier, and my mouth feels cleaner afterward. Takes a little getting use to, but I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I carefully reviewed the waterpik products and the reviews before I purchased this product.  And I like it so much.  During my recent dental check up, the doctor told me my teeth look better than they were the last time, and asked me what I did.  I said, I use the waterpik now.</li>
    <li> While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Waterpik.  It beats flossing with a string. Had this one for a year and a half now and it is starting with the same problem all my past ones have had - You have to juggle the water container or push on the rubber gasket that the water passes through to get it to &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; the water. I&#x27;m disappointed that this has started to occur after only a year.  My others lasted longer.  There should be some type of gasket replacement part so I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one every year.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;machine\\&quot; is recommended by doctors here in Brazil, but the price is a joke(we pay almost 300,00 dollars for this product).</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, the wire that holds the cleaning device split, no way it can be fixed.  It lasted me a month shy of two years.  I certainly thought I would get more use out of it then that.    John Joyce</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks, and I am very pleased.  It is still early to tell the result until the next dental visit.    I do find the product useful by the feel of my mouth, though the cleaning process leave my counter a mess.  Maybe in the future, there is a sucking action so the excess water can be directed into the sink instead of all over the place :)</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Flosser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used an older model of the Waterpik, I found this new Ultra unit to be significantly quieter and easier to use. The pressure control is now on the base unit and the motor sounds quieter and smoother. With the old model, it sounded like a Sherman tank fired up and I have to close the bathroom door to avoid disturbing anyone else in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips are different, so you have to buy replacement tips designed for WP-100 which isn&#x27;t that well advertised. In my opinion, the manufacturer should have streamlined the tip design so that they used one design/variety and interchange it among models like Oral B does with its electric toothbrushes. The Oral B unit I bought in the mid 1990s uses the same brushes as the new Oral B 5000 I purchased earlier this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spare tips for the Waterpik Ultra are stored in a lid that clips to the reservoir which I think is a faulty idea. I almost broke the lid trying to remove it to fill up the reservoir, and I had no place to put it in the meantime. I almost broke it twice so I just kept it in the box. Waterpik should have kept the tip holder in the base unit to make it convenient for the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally just use line floss and my hygienist and dentist both agree that my gums look fine, but I use the Waterpik just for extra cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars</li>
    <li> Here is another little device that has been extremely useful!  Absolutely love this!  My dental hygienist loves it too! Great for the gums and various settings make it extremely helpful in keeping your mouth clean!</li>
    <li> The new waterpik arrived in fine fashion, and my wife loves it even more than the last one.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd water pic we have purchased from Amazon.  It is so easy to use.  My dentist cannot believe how clean my teeth and gums are after using the water pic</li>
    <li> Received the Water Flosser last week.  Dentist recommended using a waterpik in lieu of floss for some peridontal issues that were beginning in my mouth.  Wow does this thing blast!  Use the peridontal attachment for deep cleaning gums and in the rear molars where floss would often break.  Only complaint is that you need to use lukewarm or warm water because the cold water will make you feel like a scene in \\&quot;Marathon Man\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I ordered it after my Costco one failed which isn&#x27;t unusual with Houston&#x27;s hard water. It arrived amazingly fast within 2 days. I love this model as the hose is protected in it&#x27;s little cove away from my prying cat. It comes with a number of attachments and does a thorough job of cleaning particles missed by just regular rinsing. Even though I don&#x27;t wear braces anymore, I greatly appreciate having teeth and gums. Always get great dental exams too.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily to get out my tonsil stones and it works great.  It can take a bit of getting used to it as the lowest setting can seem harsh, but it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> If you are near 6&#x27; (or taller) or have low basin, the constantly vibrating hose can/will rub the sharp edge of unit and eventually wear through. Consider deburring plastic and even adding tape or sponge to one piece or the other. Doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as, recently deceased, 10+ year old Brand X. Reservoir easy off/on for filling; even easier with Ultra tip case/cover in drawer.</li>
    <li> The cord is not only short, but it is wrapped so tightly that it doesn&#x27;t go as far as it could. It should be redesigned with a longer, more flexible one, so that you don&#x27;t have to be so close to it when in use.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] If you want to invest in your health, that is the one to have!  I had it for a few years, and bought another one for my husband now. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser making my gums healthy and clean. Make sure to keep it inside your mouth when it&#x27;s on. Once by accident I got it to my eye, aaaaaa, no good!</li>
    <li> We purchased two of these about 1.5 years ago.  One unit failed within 6 months.  The other is still working but not very well.  You have to turn it on and off several times to get the water to flow.  It works for my husband but I have to then bang it on the counter to get it to work.  We empty it every use but it still grows mildew  under the top cover and under the well.  We just received the new Phillips Airflosser - hopefully it will be better.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Waterpik unit.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I try to take good care of my teeth. I use listerine and brush twice daily religiously. However I could never get into flossing, and as such between dental cleanings I could see a visible buildup of plaque between teeth and along the gumline.    This product was excellent for removing the majority of the plaque that had built up in a single use. Some of the more stubborn  plaque required a little scrape, but this did well. I definitely plan to continue to use this frequently to prevent any plaque from building up in the first place.    A few quick notes - it takes some trial and error on how you let the water fall from your mouth. First time users please anticipate getting your shirt and bathroom a little wet. Also if you have sensitive gums (that bleed when you floss) they may bleed when you begin use of this product.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is one of the best gifts he ever received...who would have thunk it!!!  He uses it any time he gets a chance and it works great!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second one for my wife&#x27;s bathroom.  Been using them for years at recommendation of dentist.  Should be used with floss or dental brushes first. Then WaterPik then brush.</li>
    <li> This waterpik works perfect. It is very quick and simple to set up and use. Much much easier than flossing.</li>
    <li> This water pic replaces one that I bought 10 years ago.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same cleaning power with the water stream as the previous one. My new water pic is definitely noisier than previous one and when the tip gets close to my teeth the pressure seems to decrease.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is designed this way or not.  Will continue to use it and see how it performs.</li>
    <li> Good price. Recommended for all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;This site is easy to used. I like it. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This waterpik does an excellent job. It takes some getting used to though. I had to watch a YouTube video to see how to exactly use it. There is a lot of information in the video that is not in the instruction booklet. The waterpik does get out a lot of food that can&#x27;t be reached with just a toothbrush which will help the gums stay clean and maybe eventually heal. I am still at a &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; setting (for 3 weeks now) - anything higher is too much pressure. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to increase the pressure later on.</li>
    <li> This product removes debris from my teeth; is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Flosses like a pro.  Nice that additional flossing tips are included.  Not too loud when in use.  It really does a quality job of removing food bits.  Combined with dental floss, your teeth should be very happy!</li>
    <li> It is much more cheaply made than my last one. I have to set it on 6 instead of 2 as it is less powerful.</li>
    <li> The reservoir is a bit on the small side. The lid that holds the pics is difficult to use and the pics fit in only with some difficulty. The pics tend to fall out unintentionally from the pipe/holder mechanism. It is a challenge and irritating to have to replace them. This is otherwise the same as they have been making for years. Quality is the minimum needed to get it to work as intended and seems destined to break at some point, perhaps 2 years down the road. But I still like it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> love the water pik but second time i have to buy the same one because the plastic holder that holds the pik has broken now on both of them...i am very reluctant buying a third one though i use it everyday, once broken you cannot keep the pik level and therefore water goes everywhere...it&#x27;s a mess.!</li>
    <li> Have bought this product a few times, and purchased this one as a gift for a family member.  It&#x27;s a great product to use if you have gum issues or braces, and it also will keep your gums healthy and keep tartar from building up on your teeth between dental cleanings.  I use this product daily as well as brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> Dentist said it would be a good idea to use the water pic along with flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Went back for a check-up&lt;br /&gt;,she said she could see the improvement.</li>
    <li> it is simply the best and the most useful thing i have ever bought. i use it every day, if you have problems with gums or teath it helps a lot</li>
    <li> Love it! My son just got braces and he loves using it. Hope when he goes back to the dentist, he gets a good report.</li>
    <li> My dental hygenist recommended this because I have bridges and all my wisdom teeth. In all the years it&#x27;s been around I never thought about getting one, but I&#x27;m really glad I did. This is super for cleaning in areas that are really hard to brush. I haven&#x27;t tried the brush head yet because I have an Oral B electric. I like the multiple settings and options for other heads that my husband uses. He  also likes to use mouthwash in place of water. A great buy! It was lots more expensive with less features at Bed, Bath and Beyond and every where else I could find it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on advice from my dentist. Works great and gets out more of the food particles then I was able to do with just my tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love it.  Works great and very easy to use. Very easy to clean.  It is amazing how much there is left in your gums after brushing.</li>
    <li> Had 1 of these (different model) years ago, but the container vessel broke or something. Forgot how much I like it and how well it cleans. I&#x27;ve never been one to floss. This does the job!!!!  You think the brushing gets your mouth clean; wait til you see what this machine dislodges.</li>
    <li> When our ancient waterpik died, we bought this Waterpik Ultra Water Flossers. We now have 2 of them.  Flosser is really a misnomer.  Our dentist and many others do not advise using this as a flosser, but use it in addition to flossing the conventional way.  The reservoir is a good size, but  I always still need to add more water.&lt;br /&gt;We had never been very regular using a waterpik.  One night we tried catching all the water in a glass as we used it.  The water was still cloudy with suspended material the next morning.  That convinced us!</li>
    <li> love it ,works great. just like leaving the dentist office everyday..works way better than flossing and brushing alone. I would highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> My son got braces/palate expander and food gets stuck in the hardware. This removes it quickly and well. A little noisy but tolerable. Smaller than it looks in the pictures which is a plus as it will likely camp on your bathroom counter. The hose self coils. Very nice design. Tank hold enough water for a thorough cleaning. I tried it myself and find it a  nice addition to my regular floss and ultrasonic toothbrush routine when I have eaten something that gets stuck in my teeth (popcorn comes to mind).</li>
    <li> This is much, much better then all of the little devices that I try, including different varieties of floss to get into very tight spots especially with solutions that contain different types of solutions.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Two older waterpiks failed with broken parts inside, so we&#x27;ll see in a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the package included several types of tips. Waterpik does remove food particles between teeth that brushing misses.</li>
    <li> I bought these waterpiks &amp; replaced as they broke - which was far &amp; in between.  I&#x27;ve used them since they were invented - gives you an idea of my age.  Using the waterpik has prevented me from getting gum disease..</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing and powerful. I bought it to better care for my braces, but will continue to use it when they&#x27;re off. My wife now uses it as well.</li>
    <li> Used it ONCE and the next day, the power would not come on.  Not sure this was a smart buy.</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  It is not as effective as the one in a dentist&#x27;s office but it&#x27;s a close second and I like using it.</li>
    <li> I have had the WP-100 for all of six weeks and the pause button on the handle is stuck!  I am also having difficulty keeping the nozzle head secured.  I&#x27;ve ordered a new handle assembly and will give this mass of plastic one more shot and then I&#x27;m through.</li>
    <li> I have always had a difficult time disciplining myself to floss everyday.  The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser has given me results that are amazing.  I look forward to using it.  It turned the task of flossing into an &amp;#34;I want to floss&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;I have to floss&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Need to keep lips tightly closed or splash water all over the place.  I actually can swish small particles out with water and or floss.  Might work for some but a waste of money for me or I just don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Waterpik has always been a high quality and very reliable product for me.  I received the Waterpik in a timely manner and as advertised condition.</li>
    <li> I like this so much that when the water tube split (hahaha 3 yrs 1.5 months after purchase and a 3 year warranty!) I ordered another one, overnight delivery.</li>
    <li> The Ambient weather station lasted 6 days and stopped working!  The water flosser did not have enough pressure to knock a nat&lt;br /&gt;off his butt.  Grain Brain is nothing but a gluten free diet.  I expected more from the book!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6 months now.  It is hard to believe how much it get out that you don&#x27;t by brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say that this is a very good product.</li>
    <li> This really gets out stuff between your teeth and gum line. I have noticed my gums are healthier and teeth are getting whiter and I use smokeless tobacco. Make sure to start off on the lowest setting and work your way up. I was impressed on how many types of tips where in the set as well. So if you have braces, a bridge or any other type of special dental work, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I love this Waterpik.  We had an old one that we replaced.  I love that is one is smaller and has so many attachments for your dental needs.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser  The product is very good, big brands, trustworthy, recommended to buy.However, control of the water should be improved,make the switch button is more appropriate elastic.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I purchase this.  I have braces, and this little gadget is better then the string flossing method.  It enables me to reach all the way to the back part of my mouth, and flushes out any food particles that may get stuck in my teeth/braces.  I do still use the old method of flossing.  Since I have been using this, I do see an improvement in the overall quality of my gums/ teeth.  You can probably find this a little less expensive at say Walmart.  I think it is a little pricey here.</li>
    <li> Wow was I impressed after the first time I used the Waterpik.  Even after flossing with ribbon floss, the Waterpik still removed additional food particles.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy! I have always used water dental flossers. This one is the most efficient I have bought. Great for tooth pains from compaction or pits. Also great for those hard to reach areas! Great deal for this product!</li>
    <li> This item was so great that I ordered two for the home. We had to replace an old one and this was a excellent replacement.</li>
    <li> I will never again believe simply flossing and brushing are enough.  I would rather use this than even brushing, if I had to choose just one ( I use the waterpik first, then floss, then brush).  My teeth and breath are cleaner than they&#x27;ve ever been.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I chose a five star rating because the water flosser does what I want.  It is quieter and uses less water than my 15 yr old water pic did.</li>
    <li> THIS WATERPIC WILL MAKE A DENTIST HAPPY.  OUR DENTIST SAID IT IS ONE OF THE BETTER WAYS TO KEEP FROM HAVING PERADONTAL DESEASE. IT LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER WATER PICKS AND HAS ALL THE PARTS YOU NEED TO DO THE JOB RIGHT.</li>
    <li> Good product, price and shipping: recommend seller!</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik flossers diligently for the past ten years or so, and my dental hygienist has noted the improved quality of my teeth and gums ever since.  No problem there.  The problem is, however, that these products are so poorly made that they rarely last even one year.  After my last Waterpik failed (just refused to turn on) after about 10 months, I bought a replacement from Amazon in late November, 2013.  On Christmas Eve, less than one month after purchase and about 3 weeks after I received delivery, the Waterpik would not turn on.  I no longer have the receipt, so have no hope of returning item to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I purchased a replacement (with smaller, travel size, in addition to the regular model) at Costco.  Took it home and guess what?  BOTH models refused to turn on.  Phoned Waterpik after trying various outlets in the home.  The tech person advised me to return the product to Costco, which I will do (Costco is a long drive!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to give up my improved dental health, but will now seek out other products in the hope that the quality will be better than the shoddily-made Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I had a dental checkup a few weeks after starting use of the Waterpik. My gum &amp;#34;scores&amp;#34; dramatically improved over my floss-only ones. This unit is nice because, unlike the rechargeable version, it has more than enough power to give your gums a thorough cleaning and toughening up.</li>
    <li> Excellent to clean between teeth and help keep mouth clean and fresh when brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> I am very happy I bought this. It definitely makes my teeth feel cleaner. One thing I would change is that the cord from the&lt;br /&gt;machine to the utensil which is all curled up rather tightly should be longer.</li>
    <li> Works well except the on/off button on the handle fails quickly. Many reviewers have this complaint. Obviously this is a design flaw and I don&#x27;t know why the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t fix this problem.</li>
    <li> It worked as describe once it is used properly.  Especially in cleaning between  braches, however one need to work with it slowly</li>
    <li> THIS WATERPIK PUTS MY OLD ONE TO SHAME. I USE IT ON THE LOWEST SETTING ALWAYS. I USE IT WITH WARM+ TEMPERATURE AND SALT WATER.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a big improvement over the last water pik I purchased about 3 years ago. Very quiet.  Pressure of water flow more adjustable than previous ones. Has multiple heads that perform different tasks.  Holds about 500 ml (the older ones held 1000 ml) but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  It is smaller in size so easier to store.  The design is sleeker than ones in the past.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I hate flossing, so when I got braces and was told that I had to floss everyday, I decided to get this waterpik. It&#x27;s been 6 months now and I&#x27;m still totally impressed with it. My teeth are really close by the way, and it still does a great job in cleaning inbetween  my teeth and at the gumline. Simply put, It does the job!!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product after my last check up.  I bought it shortly afterwards and my gums have never felt better.  The machine is easy to use after getting used to the mechanism.</li>
    <li> It makes my teeth much cleaner than before.It&#x27;s realy usefulI.&lt;br /&gt;I have already introduced it to my friends. ^ ^</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik Ultra for myself on Christmas Eve after my bi-annual dentist visit the previous day.&lt;br /&gt;I had two cavities and a 5mm pocket between the back two lower molars due to difficulty of flossing way back there.&lt;br /&gt;So I hope this unit can help me in that area for the future.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have noticed is the unit has some noticeable vibration at higher power settings, is that normal?&lt;br /&gt;I also saw at the Waterpik website they have a $10 coupon offer right now on the Ultra until mid-Jan 2014.</li>
    <li> A number of years ago we had a Waterpik flosser and used until it eventually broke. In the ensuing years our teeth and gums have been requiring more and more upkeep (plus expensive dental maintenance), so when I ran across a recent Amazon ad for the same flosser, I thought we&#x27;d try it again. This time around it&#x27;s even easier to use, plus it eliminates a bunch of time-consuming daily dental chores. I use it in conjunction with an electric toothbrush and am very happy with the results. My husband, a much harder person to please, is just as happy.</li>
    <li> I decided it was time to replace my decades-old Waterpik and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This one is more compact and somewhat quieter and does a great job.  I&#x27;m probably never going to use most of the attachments included (most have special applications, like for use with braces) but they are in a drawer near the appliance should anything change.  I&#x27;m in my mid-sixties and keeping my original teeth is of paramount importance.  Waterflossers are great tools to advance that goal and I do believe Waterpik still makes the best one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not messy when you get used to it. I have very sensitive teeth and it is nearly impossible to get the water warm enough for the icy cold jet to not hurt my teeth and gums. It may work for others, just not me.</li>
    <li> So convenient and easy to use. Many different attachments. Make sure to read the details on how to use them as you can actually do damage with one of them if you use it on the wrong setting</li>
    <li> I have been advised by my dental  providers to get a better flosser than I had been using. I found Water pik on Amazon at a reasonable price and have been using it daily and got a good report from the dentist a few months later about the improvement of my mouth and gums. It is easy to use and the warm water pulsing , cleaning out food debris, feels good.  Water pik service is very good also when I had a problem with my ist one.</li>
    <li> I bought this water pick because I have trouble with my gums bleeding. According to my dentist, I don&#x27;t floss near as much as I should and I agree. I just don&#x27;t like flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this water pick and found it a lot better than flossing. It was easier to get into the tight areas that I needed to, and it really seemed to clean out my teeth/gums even after brushing. At my next dental checkup, the dentist was very surprised at the results. And said to keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pick is a nice design and comes with several different tips that are neatly stored away in the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone struggling with keeping their gums healthy.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me, so no much to point out. Things that i notice, it need more than one full tank (at least for me) and has much more power that i expected</li>
    <li> i hate the mess of flossing this saves me the headache get one and you will know what im talking about.</li>
    <li> Loosens up food particles, soothes gums, a great addition to occasional flossing. Especially helpful with bridgework and other special dental situations.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist gave me rave reviews after checking out my teeth and gums. The places I had trouble flossing were looking much better after using my waterpic.</li>
    <li> i really like thie water pik much better than the cheaper one.the cheaper one only last about 1 year. i bought 2 of the cheaper ones because that was all they had to offer in the store.this is a great deal</li>
    <li> It would take a while to get used to it but you&#x27;d get a light, clean feeling after you used it. It doesn&#x27;t substitute flossing, however. if you have plaque on your teeth, this won&#x27;t blast it off your teeth. It would push the food particles out of the smallest area your toothbrush cannot reach though, and I think that is one of the biggest reasons for cavity. I think it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to set up, I&#x27;m extremely pleased. I&#x27;ve never been a good flosser and now that is changing. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Considering this is the first water pick I&#x27;ve ever used, I think it works as intended. It is pretty easy to use and leaves your mouth feeling cleaner. Would recommend to a friend and seller sent the item on time!</li>
    <li> it works and I feel my teeth  cleaner than ever. Not a complicate machine to use.I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> You will be astonished at how much debris remains in the mounth after eating. The Waterpik removes it. I still also use dental floss to remove plaque film at night but I hardly ever find anything on the string now. I wish I had started using one of these a long time ago. I would likely have had fewer dental bills. We had a rechargable battery powered Waterpik first. This electric model Waterpik is more powerful, adjustable and just as easy to use if you have an outlet. We kept the box our electric model came in and we pack it back in the box for traveling.</li>
    <li> Our wish is that we would have purchased this longer ago if we had understood how effective the Waterpik Water Flosser is at removing tiny particles of leftover food in between the teeth. We use it following brushing our teeth for a complete cleansing.</li>
    <li> The button on the wand stuck after a month. No worry used the on and off switch. Four months of use by one person daily, stopped working. Thought I would at least get a year out of it. Verb disappointed in waterpik.  Usually great products. I guess I&#x27;ll try another brand. Loved the water floss idea. Worked great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> This model waterpik is far more superior than the model sold at the local mega store. I specifically saught this one out because of the superior performance that I experienced in the past. I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> GReat Product does a great job.</li>
    <li> got this for my mom because she has bridges and had a lot of gum inflammation from not being able to floss inbetween the teeth, since she s had this there is no more redness or inflammation, she called it a miracle :)</li>
    <li> I just started using this product. The only issue I have is that it is too loud. Hopefully it works since my dentist recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase. I want my whole family to use it. It really met all my needs.</li>
    <li> Quick overview of notable features:&lt;br /&gt;WP-660&#x3D; lightweight, LED panel, timer, massage setting.&lt;br /&gt;WP-100 Ultra&#x3D; built solidly, better accessory holder (holds more/easy to reach), overall cleaner appearance (coils/wand go back neatly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  WP-660c. &amp;#34;New model&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;• The new WP-660 is lighter (610 grams), but feels flimsy/cheap.&lt;br /&gt;•Case is very thin.&lt;br /&gt;• Clear water reservoir container, BUT you can&#x27;t read the measurements when attached because they face/covered by the small accessory storage area.&lt;br /&gt;• Accessory storage holder only holds TWO tips (you receive 7 tips total/3 are the same). Inconviently placed on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;• Wand holder is much smaller and narrow. The coils are difficult&lt;br /&gt;to put back neatly due to this downgrade. This gives the unit an unkept appearance.&lt;br /&gt;• More compact, but it is taller and you lose the accessory tip holder.&lt;br /&gt;• Does have a stutter at 30 seconds and 1 minute. A nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;• Does have a &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; mode. The other nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;• LED panel&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------//-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;  WP-100 Ultra. &amp;#34;Older model&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The older WP-100(ultra) is heavier (1,100 grams), but feels much sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;• Blue colored water reservoir, but you can read the measurements.&lt;br /&gt;• Comes with 6 tips (only 2 regular tips instead of 3, otherwise the same as WP-660)&lt;br /&gt;• Accessory storage unit holds 4 tips. Located on top of reservoir for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;• Wand holder is wider and longer, but is very easy to use. The coils neatly go back without much (if any) effort. This makes the entire unit look clean and maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Here is a link of a side by side comparison:  http://waterflosserreviews.com/waterpik-ultra-vs-aquarius/</li>
    <li> Replacing one that I had just like it.  Worked perfectly after 10 years of daily use, but I dropped it and broke the wand holder; figured it was time to get a new one anyway.  Th new one is just like the old one (why mess with a winning formula?) and it works great.  Great seller too, with fast ship.</li>
    <li> thats all i got to say, cant believe how much food and gunk is stuck between the teeth. a must have.</li>
    <li> I returned this because it was too loud, too messy and too big. For me. It otherwise worked great. If those things aren&#x27;t an issue for you, I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this.</li>
    <li> It is a great tool to keep your teeth clean. I have braces and the waterpik helps me to keep my teeth clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good item - a bit noisy but ok.</li>
    <li> Like all Waterpik products the water squirts around, but it works.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.....it works so great, if I had known water picks worked this great, I would have bought one a long time ago and maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have had so much trouble with my teeth.</li>
    <li> Let me put it like this. I had not been to the dentist in several years. When I did finally go the hygienist as me if I had been using a waterpik. She told me it was evident because of the good condition my gums were in. I still recommend using floss.  If I don&#x27;t use my waterpik my teeth just don&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
    <li> Husband wore out first one, this is the second one, good product.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great. I just don&#x27;t  like how it automatically  starts throwing water as soon as it&#x27;s turned on. It would be more convenient if it threw water when the (now pause) button was pressed.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is made for and that is to remove food particles from between teeth and/or around dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a couple of times using it to get the pressure setting(s) one likes but that is what it is made to do.</li>
    <li> Would not be without it. Really cleans between the teeth and keeps the gums healthy.</li>
    <li> it stopped working like a minute after i plugged it in</li>
    <li> This is an easy way to take Carr of Your teeth!  Dentist recommended. Get one soon!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without my water flosser by Waterpik. Have had excellent results with the dentist since I started using it daily.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Works terrific with braces.</li>
    <li> Every so often I get really enthusiastic about flossing with traditional string floss but could never maintain the habit; this Waterpik gets me to floss every day. It fits right into my bathroom routine between brushing with my Sonicare and rinsing with mouthwash. I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in my oral health as well as a visible decrease in plaque. It may not be a 100% perfect substitute for string floss, but it&#x27;s pretty damn close.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old one I have used for years. It works well and leaves teeth and gum very clean. I was very happy with the quick shipping and good customer service. Yes, I would purchase from this seller again and will buy this item again if I ever need a replacement.</li>
    <li> Makes mouth feel great.  You can see the effectiveness while you use.  Gets particles out of complicated areas.</li>
    <li> I like this.  It helps my mouth feel really fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take up a lot of space, which is something of a problem in my small bathroom, but still worth having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping, though, that I can learn a neater way to use this.  It always leaves me, the mirror, and the sink/counter covered in water - a mere nuisance in the summer, but I&#x27;m not at all looking forward to getting soaked when winter clothes are being worn.  AND ... I definitely hope no one secretly videos me making this mess.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one of these!!</li>
    <li> use it very often, just like what we go through in dentist office. very useful for my cavity.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after a few months of occaisional use -- didn&#x27;t even last a year -- and the company does not stand behind their product. You can&#x27;t return or replace it. I liked it when it worked, but it&#x27;s a waste of money for just a few months use. I recommend you NOT buy this.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing... because honestly - who really likes doing it? No one. I love this thing... makes flossing easy, fast, and so easy to use. I also use it to clean my sink because the power this thing puts out is fierce! lol. Not what it&#x27;s intended for, but it keeps me from having to scrub my sink... i can just spray it down and then put a little cleaner on it, and wipe it down... but for teeth, it really does the job and does it well!! Clean feeling without attending the dentist! SCORE!</li>
    <li> So much better than the rechargeable ones!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My gums no longer bleed.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why everyone doesn&#x27;t own one of these.  This is my first waterpik, and I am astounded at how many tiny particles are removed from my teeth STILL after extensive brushing, flossing, and scrubbing!  This should be just as standard in everyone&#x27;s routine as a toothbrush.  There are plenty of attachments, but I primarily find myself using the one pictured on the cover.</li>
    <li> Good product. It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It is not as Strong as it was advertised.  The tooth brush dose not work at all.  It is too big an clumsy.  I would like to return it for a refund.  Please explain how and where to return the pick.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use. It is effective, especially for my daughter with braces.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as usual with amazon prime. The water pic works perfectly, thinking about buying another one for a gift. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Purchased  the waterpik water flosser by recommendation from my dentist to help clear up a gum infection. After two days of use, my gums were no longer bleeding when I brushed and it cleared the gum infection after only a few uses. It&#x27;s very easy to use and keep clean. I love the storage compartment on  lid to store the attachments, It&#x27;s very compact so it&#x27;s easy to store and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. It has several picks so everyone in the family  has their own and I especially like the rubber tipped pick for peridontial pockets. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> My kids love this product.</li>
    <li> I owned the hand held waterpik before and I loved it but it only lasted under a year.  The charger area gets wet and then eventually it stops charging.  People said to use vinegar to clean the area and I tried it but it didn&#x27;t work.  This one is a little bulky but it works great.  It also has more power then the hand held so I feel like it&#x27;s doing a better job.  The only thing that would be great is if the lid would stay connected instead of always having to be removed.  I don&#x27;t leave the lid on when I&#x27;m not using it because otherwise it doesn&#x27;t ever dry inside and I feel like bacteria and mold will grow in it.  So, when I leave the lid half on top it always falls in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I hate to floss so this is fantastic.  Ever since I started using it my dentist always says she wishes every one of her patients would get one.</li>
    <li> I used to have the cheaper waterpik with the rechargeable battery - don&#x27;t get one of those, they are useless. The battery runs out in a  few mintues.  But the plug-in version, I really like. It has lots of power and really cleans out the mouth like nothing else. I have some periodontal pockets and this unit has become an essential tool for me. My only critiscism is that it is basically 3 units stacked on top of each other, so if you don&#x27;t hold it by the base when you pick it up, the whole thing falls on the floor. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had seen these for years and never gotten one, but did so on the advice of my dentist.  Much more effective than flossing - I was surprised at what the device was able to remove, even after conventional flossing.  As one reviewer advised, be sure to use warm water - cold water at pressure is a sensation most people will not want to repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would prefer that it came with with more basic tips - the assortment of different tips is confusing and likely won&#x27;t get used.</li>
    <li> I like the service of amazon.very good.  Easy to order and shipping on time. The waterpik is very good to use, easy to use and it can clean my teeth better than floss.</li>
    <li> What a pleasant surprise!  Even after normal flossing, and brushing this appliance always finds more to clean.  I could not believe the results.  Not only does it remove more particles, the teeth in all areas feel cleaner than ever before.</li>
    <li> Waterpik. What else can you say.  Recommended by our dentist.  Thought the price was very good.  Four stars because of the Waterpik itself.  Messy and a little hard to use.  My wife still gets water all over when she uses it.</li>
    <li> I bought a total of 4 or 5 of this exact same unit and gifted for past christmas; i did keep one for myself, of course. this is my first water flosser ever, but I am very satisfied by it. however, i can&#x27;t seem to stop using regular floss after i have a nice piece of steak. this machine is not to replace floss altogether, but to be used in conjunction.</li>
    <li> Surprised how well it works , removing particles of food between my teeth!  I would recommend this product to anyone as a supplement to brushing</li>
    <li> After using my original waterpik for years and very satisfied with it I ordered a new one for our second home. The new (improved?) one weighs a fraction of the original one. This could be considered an improvement if not for the loss of power and the noise level increase. It just sounds like it is struggling very much and will wake most anyone else up. Could this be that a weaker/lighter motor is replacing the original version??  Was this a decision made here in the U.S. or should we blame China again? Either way someone dropped the ball on this one! OLD or NEW (not so improved). At least give us the option to maintain the level of quality that we are accustomed to here in this great nation.</li>
    <li> I have had this Waterpik for about two months now, having previously owned and used a battery-powered handheld model that eventually stopped charging. Using this counter top model, I noticed it had a more consistent force behind the water. Though it lacks the portability of the battery powered model and takes up more space, it more than makes up for those minor inconveniences in usability. It is so easy to use in fact, that I use it EVERY time I brush. Much quicker and less painful than traditional flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Things I LOVE:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the adjustable pulse setting, while the handheld only had a High and a Low which eventually broke. With the finer adjustment knob you can tune it to exactly the strength you need. I usually leave it set on 10 because I am most comfortable with that setting, while my boyfriend who is a less-experienced user can set it lower because his gums aren&#x27;t accustomed to the Waterpik. One of the main reasons I never flossed before was that my teeth were so tight every time I flossed I had to pop it between my teeth which ended up making my gums bleed and left them irritated.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the fact that I don&#x27;t have to spend 10 minutes flossing. As I have braces it takes a while to use floss threaders to use traditional floss. It is so easy to use that I use it EVERY time I brush my teeth. I would say on average It only takes me 2 minutes to clean my teeth. This is only because I pay extra attention to my braces, so it would probably take most people less time.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the different heads that come with it (as in no extra purchase necessary), however I usually only use the traditional tip and on occasion the braces tip.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE how much better it cleans than brushing alone, and it often gets food particles that FLOSSING, BRUSHING, AND RINSING with mouthwash DON&#x27;T get.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE how well it cleans behind teeth. The head is completely (360 degrees) rotatable without removing the tip. I have had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed which left me with shallow pockets behind my remaining molars. Food often gets stuck in them and can be hard to get out even with brushing or swishing, but the Waterpik does a great job of flushing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it may not be a full replacement for traditional flossing, it saves me a lot of time and frustration. I also feel great knowing how the jet of water is powerful enough to remove hard water lime scale from my sink! A superior clean indeed. I would (and do) recommend this 100% to anybody!</li>
    <li> This was a gift.. It arrived as described. So far she has great reviews. She is still playing with the different parts but has stated when she uses it, it feels as though she had her teeth cleaned at the dentist..</li>
    <li> My dental hygenist  recommended it. . .I believe I pay more attention to flossing since I have the waterpic. . .I&#x27;m not at all certain what all the attachments that came with it are to be used for though. . .</li>
    <li> I got a small one at Walmart &amp; after using that for a week, threw it out! This holds more than enough water &amp; plenty of control numbers to work as hard as you need it to. I highly recommend this for anyone &amp; any age!</li>
    <li> Bought this for our second home so we did not need to transport the other one back and forth. My husband likes this much better than the older model that he uses. It is much quieter than the other one.</li>
    <li> This is the best water flosser I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of construction is very good.  The number of attachments is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switch turns on and off easy.  The water capacity is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this per recommendations of other consumers and my dentist.  You know it&#x27;s a good tool when a dentist says it helps greatly to clean the mouth thoroughly.  The Waterpik waterflosser Ultra is a basic all you need device for water-flossing and accepts additives of other products that dissolve in water to aid in cleaning.  At the highest settings, the pressure of this can also clean around the bathroom crevices or any hard to get off scum, win-win!</li>
    <li> Got this yesterday and what a blessing to me. I have braces and it makes cleaning so easy and wonderful. My teeth feel so clean. I just can&#x27;t say enough about it. It is a little messy but I think as I use it I&#x27;ll learn the best way to do it. I am really enjoying it so far. This is a great gadget for anyone with braces (I&#x27;m old so they are more difficult for me) but hubby uses it and it works great on his bridge also. We love it! I&#x27;m recommending it to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> It feels weird and really forceful at first, but it&#x27;s awesome. It works great. MUCH less plaque buildup on your teeth during the day and it&#x27;s definitely easier than conventional floss. It&#x27;s kinda gross seeing all the stuff that falls out of your teeth though.</li>
    <li> After losing my full time job and being relegated to the world of part time for the last few years, I have had to live without the security of insurance.  Teeth are crazy expensive.  This thing helps keep me from having to pay those bill while I do not have insurance.  It works super well and my teeth have never been whiter.  BONUS!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, removable reservoir is good and built in tip storage in lid.  It&#x27;s nice that it is more compact than the earlier models.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best waterpick on the market. it is actually my third one. I am 55 years old with absolutely not a trace of gingivitis. I&#x27;m sure that this product used on a bi-daily basis has everything to do with that. I beleive that absolutely everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Mouth feels fresh after every use.  Also can use a cap full of mouthwash with each use!  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> The product came on time and I like it. I only wish I could have bought it a lower price</li>
    <li> Product is great for knocking out little particles, but is not a substitute for flossing. Waterpik is a more informative name than Water Flosser.</li>
    <li> This broke within just a few months. Not worth the money. I bought a $20 travel water pick that works 10x better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase this product!!!</li>
    <li> for someone who has dental problems this works wonders.  Used several times a day is best.  This is especially good with braces.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik since they came out and they continue to improve them.  This one is excellent and easier to use than previous ones.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have not used one until now.  This thing is great.  I highly recommend this over flossing.  Simply put it easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> You probably arent expecting this but im a kid. So i just got the waterpik and it works great! A 2 works for me and now my dentist was AMAZED, but i still have to get a filling.&lt;br /&gt; But the best thing is that it really small and portible and it also has two genral piks so me and my mom can use it and even now it still works GREAT!!!:)</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  It is easy to use and has a wide range of selections for pressure of the water.  Also, it comes with 5 or 6 attachments for various uses from crowns or bridges to braces.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I bought another just because my first one was very old and had turned yellow.  This has been highly recommended by all the three dentists I have used. I have a lot of crowns and really need this for thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> This water pik has everything you will ever need! There is a nice compartment to hold each tip, and it is useful for all people. Very compact too!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and good buy, but I wish Waterpik would include more than one standard pik with the product.</li>
    <li> Waterpiking is much faster and easier than flossing. I love this little machine. I just adjust the pressure to max with the flossing tip attached. It blasts away anything between the teeth.</li>
    <li> The price was much better buying it on line and my dentist thinks using it daily has been very helpful.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised how much food is left in your mouth after brushing.  The waterside cleans your mouth extremely fresh.  I would recommend to a friend..</li>
    <li> It works very well. I wish it has a spare regular tip for an extra user rather than all the other special tips</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this product to me and I checked at local stores and found it a bit expensive for my budget. Luckily I looked on Amazon and found it for a price I was more comfortable paying for something I had never tried and for which I didn&#x27;t have recommendations from my friends. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it - it cleans my teeth really well, it has good power at the highest levels and more comfortable pressure at the lower levels, it&#x27;s easy to maintain and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space, and  really enjoy having it. The only detractor would be the attachments ... in my opinion they&#x27;re not really worth the fuss unless you have orthodontics, perhaps. I find that I only ever use the normal attachment. I tried the tongue-cleaning attachment once and found it not particularly helpful, so I just keep it stored away. I didn&#x27;t pay any extra for the attachments, though, so I still give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> Get ready, what I&#x27;m about to say is gound breaking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossing is Fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, this thing is really cool. I&#x27;m actually okay with flossing now. My gums don&#x27;t bleed yet I feel like my teeth and gums are twice as clean and fresh when compared with normal flossing. This thing has 10 speeds so you can start out low and work your way up. My only gripe lies within the upper speeds. Once your on speed 8+, you don&#x27;t have much time. The machine runs out of water quite fast at this stage  so you&#x27;ve got to be on your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience on an otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> Very powerful. I love that it clears out the pockets caused by my wisdom teeth. My teeth are so close together it makes flossing nearly impossible so this is a life saver. Cant go a day without using it or my mouth feels gross. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product served its purpose and served me well with daily use for two and a half years. But now it&#x27;s developed a crack in the hose near the hand piece. Water squirts out of the crack, rendering the product useless now. I&#x27;d expect to get well more than just two or three years of daily use out of a product like this, so I&#x27;m dissatisfied. Hence the three out five stars rating, due to mediocre product longevity,</li>
    <li> Great product works as needed I have been satisfied with results since I started using it over a week ago.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Waterpik! It makes flossing painless, quick, clean, and fun! The Waterpik Ultra comes with all these different heads that I haven&#x27;t taken the time to test out, but the basic head seems to do all that is necessary in cleaning EVERYTHING in your mouth! It will also help get in between fillings that you may have a hard time getting floss in between, or even stuck in! The water pressure dial is also awesome because I like it in the middle, but if I ever needed it more or less, I have a pretty big difference of pressure to choose from! My dentist recommended this to me, as I have had a hard time wanting to floss in the past for various reasons (sensitive gums, hard to get fillings, etc.) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I got it! Well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend. He tells me he loves it. Now I need to purchase one for me.</li>
    <li> Actually,I bought one several years ago,and purchased the same type this time.They keep the same quality and make me satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Bought a second one as a gift for someone who recently had braces put on. Keeps your teeth clean without having to run for floss every time.</li>
    <li> It broke after the 2nd time i used it. It didnt work good either way. Crappy product i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> If teeth were absolutely square, toothbrushes and floss would be all we would need.  But such is not the case.  Water being pulsed against the teeth and gums is more likely to dislodge particles stuck against the base of the tooth where it meets the gum.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a lemon (bad one) but I missed the window to return it and I&#x27;ll have to live with it.  I have to take it downstairs to use it because my wife compains about how loud it is.  The button on the handle sticks nearly every time so I have to turn it off and wait for the button to pop back into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it when I ignore the sound and the rare time the button doesn&#x27;t stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has ideas on how to get button to work properly please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> there are too many attachments.  The main water pic attachment is all I need.  the six other attachments are dust collectors.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this product because my dentist recommended it to and boy was I suprised at the effectiveness the flosser cleaned my teeth and gums! I&#x27;m very satisfied and happy that I made the investment.</li>
    <li> The moment this Waterpik arrived,I was so excited to use it. I was pleasently pleased with how effective it is in cleaning in between my teeth and gums. After usuing it for just a short time now, I can already see a major diffence in my gum health. My favorite thing about this product is that it comes with various pik attacements and also has low and hi speed variations. This is the one of the best investments ever.</li>
    <li> Never used this product before thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have to say, I noticed improvement with tarter control etc.after using for about a month, leaves gums tingling and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This water pick has good water pressure. It&#x27;s cleaning ability is very satisfactory.  My problems are two fold: the holder is brocken on one side. the pick unit retains a black mold on the inside of the handheld unit. All my methods to clean it did not work. I need high pressure low maintence unit.</li>
    <li> It should be required for everyone to have one. This thing is awesome! This thing gets gunk that floss couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the water pik as it cleans areas of the teeth where flossing sometimes can&#x27;t. It is handy as it&lt;br /&gt;uses different speeds of water depending on ones needs.</li>
    <li> works great.  This was a replacement for another brand that quit after 2 years.  What I like about the Waterpic is that the water reservoir is large enough that you can complete a full mouth flossing without stopping to refill it.  It also comes with several different tips for special situations.  My dentist tells me that using a water flosser keeps my gums in much better shape and the dental tech doesn&#x27;t need to do much scraping at my checkups.  This was a great price too- better than any price I saw in the retail stores and included free shipping.</li>
    <li> The power is perfect. Just what I was looking for. Easy to use, and does not clutter up my vanity .</li>
    <li> Had a recent teeth cleaning at dentist office a few weeks ago who gave me a pamphlet regarding this exact machine. While my hygene person was discussing it with me, I knew deep down that I could beat this price on Amazon, and here I am! My Amazon ordered machine works as it states and it came with a few flosser tools I did not anticipate. Great! Yes, the procedure can be messy over the sink while flossing but I am happy with the outcome and my teeth feels almost as clean as the dentist&#x27;s work. As for the different settings, I am presently working myself up to a five and yes, the pressure does increase as it should without any leakage from machine. So far so good! Presently, I am glad I went with my dentist&#x27;s recommendations and thrilled that Amazon had it on their site. Awesome Amazon, just awesome! Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I have TMJ and very tight spaces between my teeth. This does the job of flossing very effective as well as less painful than trying to string floss with TMJ.</li>
    <li> Gums were bleeding blood.  Tender, red, I was loosing the war to keep my teeth.  Hurt too much to use floss, gums was bleeding blood.  started using this to get the food chunks out that you carry areound all day.  this makes ya breath smell like rotting food cause littler chunks is rotting betweet yer teefis gisin yous the ginger vitalis.  When i used dis thing, dare was chuncks uf stuf in the sinks.  this also gits rid of the tarter sauce that builds ups anlong ya gums liner.  Take kare of ya teefis, this helped me ceeps mine in ma head.  Seriously, great product,</li>
    <li> This was in perfect condition. I bought a discounted one and I could not tell a difference. I love having a water flosser and this is a good one. I have braces and would say that even though I think this water flosser is good for anyone I would say it is a necessity if you have braces.</li>
    <li> I bought this for tonsil stones, and it has been very helpful. It comes with an attachment that works perfectly for that use, and helps clear out some of the gunk inside the tonsils, not just on the surface. True, it does feel initially like you are waterboarding yourself, and water goes everywhere... mirror, sink, counter, etc. But after a few uses you get used to it, and figure out how to position things to avoid getting water everywhere. I definitely feel my breath has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also fairly compact, and doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, which I like.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this too much but I like the different attachments. It&#x27;s too bulky for travel. I like the &#x27;stop&#x27; button to stop the water from flowing when needed. I like the top part that has a lid and keeps in the attachments inside away from germs but has air holes so everything dries out. Needs to be plugged in. I like the different levels of pressure to set the water to.</li>
    <li> Great waterpik!!  Liked the first one I purchased so much I bought another one to keep in one of our extra bathrooms.  Has a good, strong jet of water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK for traveling.  Does not have strong stream.</li>
    <li> I really like my water flosser. I&#x27;m certain my decision to buy it has saved the teeth that the dentist said may need to come out.It works great. I don&#x27;t mind the mild mess.</li>
    <li> It was a good concept but the base unit leaked within a month.  The leakage continued to increase until now, after nine months, the product is virtually useless.    UPDATE:  To resolve the problem:  remove the hose from the unit (there are two screws that hold the \\&quot;L\\&quot;-shaped connector to the base unit.)  Apply a sealant (in my case I used toothpaste - whatever you use may get into your mouth).  Re-connect the hose to the unit.  Put water in the basin and turn the unit on.  Let it run for a few seconds to insure that the flow path is clear.  This appears to have resolved the problem as there have been no leaks in several weeks.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible machine. I use it DAILY since 2011 and performs as well as new. It helped me a lot with my orthodontic treatment.</li>
    <li> It is perfect, I used the product before that is why I am a repeated customer of the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year, and I&#x27;m just now writing the review.  I use it daily and sometimes twice a day and it still works fine.  A few times a week, I&#x27;ll dilute mouthwash, such as Closys in it for a little more periodontal disease reducing punch.  It comes with different attachments but I find the regular attachment is best for me.  There is an ortho attachment but that one is to refined for my level of sensitivity.  I think mine has lasted so long because I put the canister upside down to dry after each use.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to water picking, I recommend starting on the lowest setting for the few times before going up.  Especially if you have diseased gums.  I has some bleeding the first few times but that went away.  With continued use, my oral health has been much better and I&#x27;m getting cavities at a much slower rate than I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> Very good product happy with it.</li>
    <li> Anyone who isn&#x27;t using a Waterpik is making a mistake. My wife and I started using one several years ago and haven&#x27;t been to the dentist for anything but checkups since. We own several. Mine, hers, guests, travel.  The one I use at home now is the Ultra model and it&#x27;s really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews about whether to floss or Waterpik.  I brush, floss and rinse, and then am amazed at what the Waterpik gets that the other methods don&#x27;t. But, I both floss and  Waterpik. Why not?  It takes like two minutes. Do both.</li>
    <li> wish I got it 30 years ago, would of saved myself 15,000 dollars</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist tells me to floss and I have been ignoring her because I just can&#x27;t seem to get into the routine.  After 5 months of using the waterpik, I went to the dentist.  My hygienist was amazed at the improvement in my teeth and gums.  Previously the measurement of the gap between my teeth and gums was 4-5 (not so good).  This time it was 1-2 which is normal.  My mouth feels better and It seems I&#x27;ve found the solution to my dislike of flossing.</li>
    <li> NO WATER COVER ON TRAVEL UNIT</li>
    <li> So far I have been very happy with this product.  The only problem I have is the limited storage for all items which come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure control is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this flosser for more than six months.  It is great at getting particles from around two implants in the back of my mouth. I never knew these flossers were so effective. My gums never bleed anymore.  The machine is fairly quiet and smooth for a little water pump.</li>
    <li> This works very well; a bit noisy, but the flow is good when turned to full capacity.  It does a good job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed with high-end electric toothbrushes and went back to using a generic hand toothbrush. This product, however, is amazing. It works great and makes flossing a lot easier.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is easy to use except the operating button is confusing. The button is not marked on and off. You push the button to stop the water and leave it open for the water to enter the flosser. Otherwise it is easy to operate and direct the water into the spaces of the teeth.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!  I love that there are 10 different settings so I can change the pressure to my comfort.  Would totally buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have a wisdom tooth with a quarter of it fallen off, and a filling holding on to it dearly. It is a very precarious position to floss, and floss string gets stuck in the minuscule space between tooth and filling, and I have several instances of the floss breaking off the filling. I bought a waterpik exclusively to help me with this problem, and here&#x27;s my review to how it fared:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. One takes a long time to get used to the pressure. The effectiveness of floss Vs waterpik studies are done with the pressure setting at 5 and above..it took me a month to reach level 5, and it still hurts..a lot. So the waterpik claim that you will notice positive change in 2 weeks was not at all true for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Sometimes I experiment flossing before waterpik and sometimes waterpik before flossing. Flossing is still better than waterpik for every other tooth except for the above mentioned wisdom tooth where now I am too scared to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Whatever be the setting of pressure, its a stream of water pounding on your tongue, and mouth. It hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Cleaning does get better from pressure 4, 5 and above should be better but I haven&#x27;t come to that stage yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The other attachments, are supercool, especially the one for braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product, if say you have braces and cannot floss. Otherwise flossing is way better and cheaper than using a waterpik.</li>
    <li> I had an older Waterpik. I like this one even more. It is more compact yet more powerful. I like the tank layout with the lid rather than the other model I had where the tank flipped over and was used as a cover for the unit as a whole. The other one lasted about three years with twice a day use. SO far I have had this one about five months and it seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  It has a deep reservoir so I don&#x27;t have to refill during my teeth maintenance</li>
    <li> We are hooked on this machine.....I already have one and my son talked me into buying him one!!  Two minutes to use twice a day, and my mouth is so amazingly clean.  What a feeling, truly.  Price was good, all arrangements were excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and when I gave it to him he was so excited it was cute. It saves him crucial minutes in the morning getting ready for work and that wasn&#x27;t the main goal but he won&#x27;t have dentures on my watch that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> I got this contraption after my dentist informally recommended it, saying that the patients who use it seem to get better results than those who just floss. So far it appears to be working as advertised. My teeth and gums feel much cleaner after using it, every night. I am curious what the dentist will see during the next checkup.&lt;br /&gt;It is rather voluminous, it makes a terrible noise, and the plastic construction seems flimsy and might give at some point in the future, but for now I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase because I&#x27;d never used a Waterpik, but decided to give it a try after my dentist recommended it. Turned out to be a great addition to my oral healthcare routine. It doesn&#x27;t replace flossing, but my teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> Had for almost a year now and its still working and cleaning my gums. The stuff that comes out while I&#x27;m using this is just amazing to look at. Why? Probably because there is a certain satisfaction I get watching my mouth/gums get cleaner and the food remnants go bye bye down the drain. I usually have this set at a higher setting like 7-9, does the trick for me. Its a noisy machine, but the way it makes my mouth feel super pinaud (Aka Fresh) makes that obsolete in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. The only problem is that it only lasts a couple of years. Then I have to buy another one. But what can I do? Business is business...</li>
    <li> Better force than my old one, but this is identical to one I&#x27;ve been using for over a decade.  I had expected improvements.  You still have to brush and floss, but for food pockets, braces, etc. it&#x27;s the best answer.</li>
    <li> I bought this and I don&#x27;t find the purpose of it. I bought for my boys to avoid dealing the issue of plaque and I can honestly tell you that this did not do the job... I am still trying to find something that can help me with this issues for my boys.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction and product</li>
    <li> The first one we bought the plastic that held the entire headpiece where you put the different sized nozzles, completely broke off after a couple months. Thing works so good, we bought another one and treat it as if was fragile in design, which it is.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this years ago, and I wouldn&#x27;t have had to spend so much at the dentist. Use after each time you brush, and your teeth will be like new ...</li>
    <li> What, no more floss?  My hygienist assured me that was the case, and I thought, with all due respect, yeah, maybe. I got the unit, and followed up with floss.  Nothing, absolutely nothing on the floss.  Amazing!  The features and assorted tips make it a great addition to my healthcare.  Plus, I had enough bonus points on my Amazon VISA card that I got it free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m becoming a fan.  I have a couple of beefs with this unit, though, which keep me from giving it 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button sticks.  The button shuts off the water through the pick head, and it often sticks.  I find I have to whack the handle against the side of the sink to get it to come back out again.  It usually sticks about every other time I use it.  If it gets worse it&#x27;s going to be a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more attachment heads than there are places to store them in the unit.  I could probably just toss one away, since we only ever use the default head anyway, but it&#x27;s sort of an annoying thing to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband&#x27;s tonsil stones.  Boy, does it work.  Disgusting.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you have braces!</li>
    <li> I would like it more if it was the right call if you can do me black instead of blue</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After purchasing in June of 2014, the button on the handle that controls the flow of water off and on has jammed and the unit i no longer useable, nor it is still eligible for a return. Very displeased that after so little use, and great care of the unit itself, it has already broken down. Terribly disappointing.</li>
    <li> reservoir leaks constantly, have tried washing the valve as recommended without any success&lt;br /&gt;just makes a mess, had same one before worked great</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my WaterPik ultra water flosser.  This is the greatest invention since toothbrushes.  It comes with a brush to brush my  teeth, then it comes with the plaque  seeker  tip, and several other devices to get below the gum line to get rid of even more plaque.  When I have  finished  my teeth cleaning, I run my tongue over my teeth, and they feel &amp;#34; Dentist&amp;#34; clean.  My only regret is I waited so long to buy the Waterpik.  I bought this model, because I have two bridges, and this Waterpic gets under my bridges with a flush of water, &amp; blows out any food particles my tooth brush missed.  Thank you Amazon for all the great products you have, because you make my life so much better.  Of course I enjoy a Prime Membership.</li>
    <li> I thought I was replacing my old Waterpik that I had purchased at Walgreens a few years ago but this is not the same product.  It is much lighter in weight, also a tinny noise during use.  I guess it is my mistake for not understanding but it certainly is not described well on the site.  The picture looks identical to my old one but upon closer inspection the main &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; logo does not appear on the front of the base.  I&#x27;ll know better when this one bites the dust which I&#x27;m assuming will be much sooner than my old one.  Sadder but wiser.</li>
    <li> Having had much more expensive versions of an &#x27;oral irrigator&#x27; decided to go with this one based on other reviews... yes, it&#x27;s a great product and far less expensive than the ones that are supposedly &#x27;recommended by dentists!&#x27; if you are looking for a good-- excellent, water pick, whatever they call this, buy this one!</li>
    <li> Waterpik is the best product for maintaining and improving Gum health.I could not believe how good it is.I recommend using at the highest pressure with the mouth open and controlling the angle of the tip to prevent splashing of the water.I have been using waterpik every night since i got it in the mail.  I hate Dental Floss,I cannot get both of my hands in my mouth at the same time like most others can.My Dental health has gone from Zero to to Sixty in one minute every night.I highly recommend this product for everybody,it will put Dentist&#x27;s out of Business.</li>
    <li> We bought this Waterpic on July 23, 2008.  I liked the way the product worked on my teeth, but the nozzle did pop off more than when once putting my hand in the wrong place. Even after getting used to it, if I was tired and not paying attention, if would happen now and then. The on/off switch on the handle stuck after a couple months, but it&#x27;s not necessary (you&#x27;re standing over the sink anyway). After about 2 years, the nozzle would no longer stay in the handle, rendering the device useless (and I tried everything out in my shop, short of breaking the plactic to fix that). We switched to identical unit that my wife&#x27;s dad had bought (having inherited it when he died last Dec.).  That one quit working last week (less than 2 yrs. old)...lost pressure to almost zero. We really like them when they worked, but expected longer life for the money. Just got an Oral Breeze through Amazon - hooks up easily to the faucet; pops on and off when you WANT it to, and seems a much better value at $25.  I won&#x27;t review it until we&#x27;ve had it for a year though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I have a nasty tendency to brush to hard at times and floss as well til my gums bleed. I also heard that these were more effective than just flossing so I bought it to improve my dental hygiene/ The unit is small compact, and easy to setup and use. There are many different types of tips that you can plug into the main tube, depending on what area you are trying to reach in your mouth. Only thing is that it might take a while in getting used to using the thing. I guess you are supposed to keep your mouth somewhat open when using it, but I tend to have it spray all around my bathroom sink, etc. You definitely can&#x27;t keep your mouth closed as it will fill up very quickly with water. It just takes practice as I have gotten better since I first started using it a couple months ago. All in all I would recommend this product, as it does give you a nice clean mouth and does the job just as good if not better than standard flossing.</li>
    <li> When will I ever learn? I wasted money on two other gum irrigators because I believed those reviews that stated they were so much better than the Water Pik. NOT TRUE! This device is fabulous and I love it. I highly recommend it to all those who care about their health -- gum, teeth and overall general. Ridding oneself of plaque and other disease borne irritants that lodge in gums where regular brushing does not touch them is very important. Get this device. You won&#x27;t be sorry. I love the just professionally cleaned feeling that it leaves me with, and it cleans so well around my crowns. I use just a splash or two of hydrogen peroxide in the tank of warm water. Simply wonderful!</li>
    <li> We really like this waterpik flosser.  It works well and  this is the second one we have owned.  The first was a travel  size, and we decided to upgrade to the larger model with the  big reservoir.  Using a waterpik has really improved overall  oral health.</li>
    <li> Works great really makes your mouth &amp; teeth feels so clean the only reason for not giving 5 stars is it only comes with 1 regular pik the other 5 are specialized and for a family you have to purhase addt&#x27;l pik heads.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with the noise, amount of water or anything like that.  My issue was that it destroyed my gums.  The only times this cleaned my teeth where my toothbrush couldn&#x27;t, was after eating popcorn.  Other than that, it did not help and it destroyed my gums.  I kept it on the lowest settings and have very healthy gums otherwise, but they became torn up after using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  I have family members  that have used them in the past when they had braces, but other than maybe in that instance, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i purchased the water pik on the advice of my dentist.  i saw the fabulous ratings and i figured let me do this because i needed this because of all the bridges in my mouth.  in any event, i used it the first time and it was fabulous.  the second time i went to use it it did not work.  the water did not flow to the tip.  i checked everything and it was all correct.  what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is the top model from Waterpik. I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 years and so far everything is still working. The tongue cleaner does not do anything except wash it with a lot of water, but the other tips all work great. The waterpik can get left over food and other junk out of the mouth that floss could not reach. The hose does not leak, although if the hose was a bit longer it would be much more helpful. It is a foot or two short. The reservoir is also a little bit small compared to the other models, but if you are fast then you can clean your teeth before you run out of water. There could be more tips if you wanted to share it with a few people. Some of the tips are also unnecessary or not practical. The pressure is great though. I would highly recommend getting this waterpik. The waterpik is the best device for your teeth along with a sonicare.</li>
    <li> i have never owned a Waterpik before but can&#x27;t see living without one now. My Waterpik is powerful and very refreshing to use. Really happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The Waterloo is a quick and easy yet thorough, effective, and painless way to address periodontal threats and plaque challenges!  Not much changed dice the first mod I owned more than 30 years ago. But just as effective!</li>
    <li> I like the capacity and intensity of this product.  I don&#x27;t know how durable it will be but I know my dentist approves of it.  I am very pleased that it cost fifteen dollars less at amazon.com than at walmart.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this is a must have if you have braces!  Works fantastic, exactly as one would expect.  Wouldnt hesitate to buy again,</li>
    <li> Because I can&#x27;t physically floss under my bridges the Waterpik Flosser has gotten my teeth cleaner than they have been in years.  Now I can save money from having to go to the Dentist so often to clean my teeth, I can do it myself.</li>
    <li> I have owned Waterpik&#x27;s before, and was satisfied.  This model has NO power!  At max strength of 10, it is still very weak.  I would have returned it, but I missed the return deadline by one day.  Bummer.    I loved my previous model as it had the power to blast junk from between my teeth.  This one is basically a gentle massage in comparison - does nothing for the gums in my opinion.    Waterpik has gone down hill.  Check out other options, or be prepared to return it if it is of lower power/quality, like mine.</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine. I would prefer if the product felt a little sturdier for the price. It seems to be a cheap plastic. But, I will know if it&#x27;s really working AFTER I see my dentist next.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this Waterpik. There are a couple of extra heads in the accessories. Works great! Shipped fast! Will use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> The spiral cord on my waterpik came off from the handle after 2 years and ten months. I cursed a little about what a piece of junk it was. Thought I&#x27;d have to throw  the whole unit out. Got mad all over again.  Looked up on amazon when I bought it.  Read warranty (3 years- which is probably what convinced me to buy it in the first place).  Had to turn unit upside down to get serial number so discovered that it would be easily fixable with a new part. Saw it was about $8  for the part and thought that was great.  Filled out inquiry/warranty request on manufacturers website.  They got back to me in a day, sent out the part and I got it within a week. Put it on and it works great again. Very impressed. Realized how much I like it when I couldn&#x27;t use it for a week.  Am tempted to order a spare for 3 years from now when it breaks again but then I&#x27;d have to remember where I pit it.  Guess I&#x27;ll just trust they&#x27;ll keep these replacement parts for another decade or until I get an app on my iphone that does the waterpik thing.</li>
    <li> I have used this Waterpik every night, before brushing my teeth, for over five months, and I still have to be careful to control the splashing water. It runs out my mouth, as the directions say it should, but it splashes on my hand and all over the sink--sometimes onto the floor. I keep using it because it does a good job of flushing out particles between the teeth, and seems to invigorate the gums. I wish the base was only five inches deep instead of five and one-half, because the depth of glass bathroom shelves is just five inches. The Waterpik would be five inches deep if the cord were attached to a side instead of the back. I also wonder why Waterpik furnishes six different kinds of nozzles when most people probably just need the basic nozzle. I would have been happier if they had provided a couple of extra basic nozzles. Still, I would recommend this as a useful, healthful tool for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I had never tried one before, the dentist recommended I use get one. Not sure how they work, I went by the ratings and that led me to purchase this particular water flosser. I am happy with my decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done pretty well with dental floss over the years until recently.  My teeth seem to be tightening up and the floss gets caught  and then getting it out becomes a real headache.  Then, last fall, in trying to dislodge floss that had gotten caught, I broke a tooth and had to have a crown.  While that tooth might have broken anyway, you don&#x27;t want to be breaking teeth when you are trying to do the right thing.  The Water Pik is very inexpensive by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little messy but that&#x27;s probably me.  But, it does the job very well.</li>
    <li> My upper and lowers are now 90% bridged and this \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; cleans as no floss and toothbrush  can do... add rinse of your choosing and WOW !  Ample power and settings but I feel water cache too small.  Nice ompact unit. Too many attachments in unnecessary storage lid.    Thanks,  70+ year old guy in Hawaii</li>
    <li> When I first saw this item I noticed over 1500 reviews with a pretty good rating so I thought....this must be good!     I ordered this item late Tuesday night and it arrived early Thursday morning of the same week - yeah Amazon shipping! Right of of the box you get 1) water pik 2) All the different variety of waterpik tips (plaque seeker, tongue cleaner, orthodontic tip, classic, toothbrush).    I first filled the water reservoir and plugged the unit in. I \\&quot;primed\\&quot; the unit and was ready to go. Using this thing definitely does not make you look sexy. :oP I put the waterpik tip in and my mouth quickly filled with water, even though I had my mouth just partially open as instructed to let the water flow out. Water does not flow out of your mouth like the picture (a nice thin downward stream). Water was flowing down everything! Keep your hair up girls! Sometimes I would move the waterpik and the waterpik would shoot water out onto the counter - so just make sure you keep your lips relatively closed enough. I did this three times by accident. :o/    I started on power level 1, but it honestly didn&#x27;t feel like enough pressure. I felt like I was just dripping water on my teeth. Eventually, I worked up to a 6. I didn&#x27;t go any higher because I feared soaking my entire bathroom and/or drowning myself with water.    Apparently, my dentist said that you also need to floss and not only use the waterpik, but I guess for people who don&#x27;t floss anyway...this is a good alternative.    There were studies done (sponsored by the waterpik company but studies had full disclosure) that showed that the waterpik removed biofilm from the teeth. And after I started using this thing I went to the dentist and she did the \\&quot;probing\\&quot; thing to measure the strength of the gums and she said, wow you have really healthy gums. Do you floss? I rarely do, she said it is genetic AND that the waterpik must be helping. She said she loves the waterpik.</li>
    <li> The Waterpick Water Flosser works very well.  I was impressed with the water pressure it produces.  It comes with several types of specialized tips and two basic tips.  Years ago I got a water pick for my children with braces.  It had four tips, all color coated so each child could identify their own tip.  To share the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser in your family you would need to purchase more tips.  The information that came with the product did not have an order form for additional tips.  However I&#x27;m assuming I will be able to purchase them.  I feel this is a good product and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> We purchased this months ago and I really like it. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find extra attachments.  UPDATE: So it is now 4 years later and I still have this water flosser.. Still the same trouble finding heads for it.. We have really hard water and still have never had a problem with it... ( Knock on wood lol ) I don&#x27;t use it every day. Sometimes I will do it daily but normally its more of a once a week thing and I use regular floss on a daily basis...   but I still really like it and would Def purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. (Much easier than flossing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable intensity is great, I use 6 and hubby uses 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space.  Water capacity is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well for getting under special dental appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun, too.</li>
    <li> You sent me three of the same product when I ony ordered one.  My impression is that the cancellation prcess is deliberately difficult.I hate lambyrynth to return.</li>
    <li> love love love this product. easy to use, compact, gets the job done. i&#x27;m going to buy one for everyone in my family!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen son with braces.  Made a huge difference in his dental hygiene.  He uses it three times a day after brushing.  Food is dislodged that prior to using this product just sat there, building up.  His dental hygienest suggested we buy one of these.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way the pik functions. It flosses well!  I just find that it has a design flaw.  All parts to the pik are stored in the top white cap.  This cap does not have a clasp so every time  it is removed the contents fall out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days, but was &#x27;sold&#x27; the first time I used it.  I was hesitant to make the purchase given the negative reviews and complaints on the size of the reservoir and low pressure, but those were apparently exaggerated concerns. I use the waterpik on a 4 out of 10 setting and it does the job gently and the reservoir does not run empty.  Honestly, your gums are sensitive and you don&#x27;t need a water hammer to dislodge food particles.  I have placed it right next to the sink and I lean over the basin when I use it and the used water goes down the sink drain.  Simple!  I don&#x27;t need to stand up look at the bathroom mirror while using it, and drool all over my body.      Some others think it is expensive, but it may save you a painful visit to the dentist in the future.  Your teeth are important and a heart surgeon once told me that bad oral health leads to other more severe health consequences.  My teeth are much cleaner and I only floss with Glide occasionally when needed.  I had the old waterpik over 10 years ago and the pressure was way too strong and the reservoir emptied out much quicker (because of the greater water pumping rate).  This seems to do the job and it has a 3 year warranty.  I&#x27;ve only use the standard attachment, but again it works fine.    I also use a sonicare toothbrush!  Don&#x27;t be put off by the bad reviews.  Do yourself and your health a favor and purchase this model.</li>
    <li> I bought this for two reasons:  To supplement or replace flossing, and to remove tonsil stones.  Unfortunately, it is not really useful for either.  I will keep it, because I do think it has a function to clean your mouth, and between the teeth, and it is generally more gentle than flossing or brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers on the internet have noted, it is probably best to find other ways to remove tonsil stones.  The tonsils are very delicate, and a concentrated water gun could potentially rupture it.  So, don&#x27;t use it for that.  In my case I have simply found that I can&#x27;t get the stones out with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have teeth that have very small gaps and I find it somewhat hard to get the floss in between.  If you have a similar issue, the best floss that I have found so far is \\&quot;Glide\\&quot;.  It is quite thin, very strong and very smooth.  Other types of floss break easily on my teeth.  If you eat food that has fibers in it (like meat or some fruits), then flossing is necessary to remove something stuck between the teeth.  If it is stuck tightly then the water flosser will simply not get it out.  So, flossing is still better than the water pik, although it will often cause your gums to bleed.  The water flosser usually won&#x27;t cause bleeding.  (The manual claims that it is better than flossing..  simply not true!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a relatively expensive devise, and I will keep it and learn how to use it (I think it will take some time to explore its use).  However, it is almost certainly not a replacement for flossing or brushing.  Be careful where in your mouth you point it (the manual cautions about this also), it can cause harm if not used correctly.</li>
    <li> I like Water Pik flossers.  This is a smaller unit than my older model.  I purchased it for a second home.  Frankly, I would take this on trips.  It stores using a small space.</li>
    <li> Am quite pleased with this Waterpik.  Gets to food particles that are missed by brushing (electric brush) and flossing.  Reservoir holds enough water for one person to do a thorough job of all teeth.</li>
    <li> My son got braces, so I got him this Waterpik.  It works great, he loves it and is using it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This is the best decision you can make for your gums and your health.  Since using this Waterpik, my gums have become pink and healthy and never bleed even with rough flossing.  It is incredibly powerful and I use a setting of 6 out of 10 and its about as strong as I can handle!  After eating oatmeal with walnuts and raisins... you wouldn&#x27;t believe what comes out from between your teeth!  I will never be without one for the remainder of my life.  Go ahead... order it!</li>
    <li> I am using it day and night, really enjoy this machine. I feel my mouth so fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> Came right away great price works great my gums feel so much better flossing was missing soo much thank you my dentist thanks u too &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> what can I say... there&#x27;s nothing better than a waterpik to keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I know the words may be harsh but that&#x27;s exactly what this is. If you&#x27;ve ever had a dental cleaning this is not even a tenth of the pressure. Doesn&#x27;t do squat.</li>
    <li> These are awesome little compact items.  I bought two of them for me and my husband at the recommendation of our dentist.  After figuring out how to use them without taking a bath, they work nicely.  They are a little noisy and messy, but they do the job.</li>
    <li> Top and bottom, fast and clean. No my dear it&#x27;s not a dream. IT&#x27;S A WATERPIK ULTRA WATER FLOSSER , sold on  ( AMAZON )</li>
    <li> My new Waterpik is wonderful.  It certainly is much quieter then my original Waterpik, which I have had fro many years. Amazon has been wonderful to deal with - Prices are good and delivery is sensational.</li>
    <li> happy to find a good deal on this waterpik from Amazon got for adult son to improve oral health and look forward to results  thank you</li>
    <li> Just got this today...returning it tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filled the reservoir then put it on the shelf next to the sink and noticed water was coming from somewhere.  It was coming from the waterpik itself - out of the top (where you put the heads in) and from around the big blue \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button on the front that you see in the picture.  So before I even plugged this thing in I had lost about an inch of water from the reservoir and it was on my floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought, \\&quot;maybe it just needs to be run through a bit...let&#x27;s try it out.\\&quot;  I plugged it in (but did not turn it on) and because water was still coming out I pushed the pause button to put one of the heads in.  Water immediately started coming out (unit is turned OFF, remember).  I turned it on, and water was coming out even faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover to the reservoir is the case to hold all the tips...but there are more tips than slots.  And then to top that off the cover doesn&#x27;t have a latch.  It just closes without a lip so if you don&#x27;t get the top on quite right when you&#x27;re trying to fit it on top of the reservoir it will fall into the reservoir or the floor and then it will inevitably pop open and then the loose heads you&#x27;ve stored in there go flying.  Just adds to your lovely Waterpik experience!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was just plain MESSY.  By the time I gave up I had water on my hair, on my shirt, on the floor, on the mirror.  Everywhere.  Also, the heads don&#x27;t do anything except spout water.  So, why you need 6-8 heads is beyond me.  They don&#x27;t swivel or vibrate...nothing.  I expected the brush head and the plaque seeker to swivel (like my Oral B electric toothbrush).  So you have all these heads that do the same thing...spout water.  Oh, and the water pressure?  1-5 are virtually the same.  Some people on Amazon must have some reallllly sensitive gums to need to start at 2 and work their way up...but I&#x27;m pregnant and my gums are pretty sensitive right now and which is why I purchased this item.  I wanted my mouth to feel very clean and be able to get into those hard to reach areas.  I feel like I just paid too much money for a toy that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My dentist advised me to get one of these to stop the progression of &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; in my gums.  Easy to use, and the best solution out there for cleaning below the gum line, I can&#x27;t believe how much junk it blasts out after a meal.  It doesn&#x27;t replace flossing, but is a GREAT addition to a dental hygiene regimen.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality waterpik.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now.  It&#x27;s easy to use and really makes my teeth look and feel clean.  My dentist says my teeth and gums look great, and I am 67 years old.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble flossing and, as a result, I have steadily lost teeth over the years. I was surfing the internet about dental implants and found two dentists that said not to even bother flossing but use a Waterpik water flosser instead. I bought one and love it. There is a small learning curve for the flosser since the first time I used it was like taking a shower. Now I bend over, rest my wrist on the sink edge and use the flosser with my lips only part way open and there is virtually no mess. Flossing is more important than brushing so if you have trouble flossing, either get one of these or lose your teeth. (Voice of experience.)</li>
    <li> I had one of these many years ago (probably the first model they made) and I liked it then. Not sure why I waited so long to get another one. Works better at getting food out between teeth than floss especially under my bridge. Really like the different settings and worked my way up to level 8 within a week. Right now just using the standard head, haven&#x27;t tried the other ones yet. Great product!</li>
    <li> It is small &amp; compact, but very effective.  I rate it a four star and not a five, because I spend too many moments using it.</li>
    <li> One reason I purchased the Water Flosser was the excellent reviews it has had, and now that I have used mine daily for several weeks, I wholeheartedly agree --- it is an excellent product to help clean teeth, and I wish I had purchased one years ago.    I&#x27;m using mine on \\&quot;6\\&quot; setting and that seems to work well. The reservoir holds more than enough. I use a little mouthwash (about a capful or less) with warm water. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the piks except the classic one, which works well for me.    The only suggestion for improvement I will mention is that I wish Waterpik would figure out a way to store the power cord --- maybe a coiled cord. I fold it by hand and use a rubber band.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was advertised as having the stongest water pressure. You can always turn the pressure down if needed. I think the Waterpik was advertised up to 90 psi. It&#x27;s ok but the old Interplak it was replacing was stronger. I thought about getting another Interplak, but they didn&#x27;t advertise as having sufficient water pressure. The Interplak  was advertised as having about 70 psi.</li>
    <li> THIS WATERPIK IS KNOWN TO HAVE ISSUES EVEN A GIRL THATW ORKS IN THE DENTIST TOLD ME NOT TO BUY ONE IN THE OFFICE AS HERS BROKE DOWN IN A FEW MONTHS, I BOUGHT ONE AND IT WAS SPEWING WATER ALL OVER THE PLACE AND MAKING A VERY LOUD NOISE, I CALLED WATERPIK AND THE AGENT I GOT WAS VERY RUDE DID NOT OFFER TO HELP ME AT ALL, JUST SAID TO RETURN IT TO AMAZON, AND I SURE DID!!!! DONT BOTHER BUYING THIS ITS A BAD QUALITY ITEM</li>
    <li> I highly recomende using the Waterpick for oral care. Would not beleve what you miss just brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. I expected the jet to be more powerful than it is. But it does remove food particles lodged between teeth</li>
    <li> The product arrived sooner than expected and so far has exceeded my expectations.  It really is the Ultra Water Pic!  In my opinion if you have braces, this is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Does everything I expected it to. I have used floss in the past but this waterpik ultra water flosser works just great.</li>
    <li> Love my flosser!  :-)</li>
    <li> This machine works so well that I am wondering how I got by without one. It cleans stuff out of your teeth that you didn&#x27;t even know was there. Lots of different settings and accessories to fit any tough or sensitive mouth. Love it.</li>
    <li> After using mine for a couple of years and being very pleased with the results, I bought one for a son.  He too is very pleased with it and enjoys the way it leaves his mouth feeling really clean.  My dental hygenist has noticed an improvement in my dental health since I began using the waterpik.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;I like you can change the speeds.&lt;br /&gt;it works in the back of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;My gums look great</li>
    <li> I loved the pik when I first got it&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had since February 2011 and it has a leak out of the side.&lt;br /&gt;So last night I purchased a brand-new one. For $39. Which is cheaper than the original purchase. With shipping it came to 44 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the unit, it was very powerful and over the years the water force has decreased. But it is still a great piece to clear any debris from your mouth. I use it anywhere from 3 to 5 times per day. Can&#x27;t live without it. This will save you many dollars at the dentist office. I deducted one star for the leak.</li>
    <li> This new model is much better than the old one I had.  It has a control knob to regulate the flow, a button to release the tips and is more compact.</li>
    <li> My daughter &amp; I have been using for several weeks.  It&#x27;s a bit messy and unsure if it&#x27;s really doing what it&#x27;s suppose to do(I watched on YouTube to make sure we were doing it right).  My young daughter doesn&#x27;t floss, therefore, I got the waterpik as an alternative for now.  I use both the string floss plus this waterpik nightly.  We have a dental cleaning next month, so we will know if there&#x27;s any changes and whether this was a good purchase or worthless one.  Stay tuned....</li>
    <li> I have used this waterpik for years.  i had to  throw away my old one which had twice the power &amp; quite heavier.  This is a cheap version today &amp; I am greatly saddened since it will only last for a few years where my old one lasted 10years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It gets left behind food particles that the toothbrush and flossing missed.  You need to be aware of the power behind the pik.  Too much power can make your gums bleed and they could be a bit sore after use.  I have learned to lower the power.  I would recommend this product.  It is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the strangest thing- I have nice teeth but they&#x27;re unhealthy. My dentist tells me that for whatever reason, my saliva causes plaque to collect at my gum line. Awesome. Every time I was going in for a checkup- I had something wrong from a simple cavity to a root canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my dental hygienist basically demanded that I get a waterpik. I do floss but definitely not as regularly as I should. This waterpik has been a game changer. Finally at my last cleaning- I got a clean bill of health! This flosser is the best. It is super easy to refill. I use it twice daily and it only takes a couple of seconds. It really does get even the smallest areas- like underneath my permanent retainer. I find myself filling it every two days- not a huge deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is that there are different settings from 1-10. When I first started using it, I couldn&#x27;t get past 6. Now I&#x27;m able to use 10 and it really does shoot that water out strong. There are 4 different attachments but I just use the regular one as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it! Totally worth the investment. Hopefully now I won&#x27;t have to spend as much in dental bills.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  I like that I can change the setting of the water pressure depending on how sensitive my teeth are each day.  This has been very handy with my braces.  I like that I can remove all the food particles before I brush. I have a much cleaner feeling mouth when I am done using the Water Flosser.</li>
    <li> i was not sure which one to purchase but am glad i got the cordless one- works wonderfully and not taking up a lot of counter space. thanks !</li>
    <li> The  Water Flosser Ultra takes up less space on the counter yet works with more power. I was pleasantly surprised and  love it.</li>
    <li> Small simple and does a great job.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik has served us well for over a year.  It has great pressure and capacity, and has been reliable.</li>
    <li> We love this. My husband&#x27;s dentist recommended it for his receding gums and it has helped a lot. He received praises at his last checkup. I use it also to help remove stubborn plaque.</li>
    <li> Recommended by the dentist for better cleaning and improved gum health.  You&#x27;ll brush more effectively with this tool. Works well.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik unit is great and really leaves my teeth and gums sparkling.  But the cutoff switch on the handle started sticking within a few days of arrival.  This seems to be a design flaw, as many reviews cite this problem.  It&#x27;s a pain to have to exercise the warranty, so I am using this workaround: I turn the unit off whenever removing the wand from my mouth.  Waterpik: Time to fix this problem!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare tooth brushes for years, and I think they do a really good job at removing plaque.  My family&lt;br /&gt;has not been blessed with good oral DNA, and I normally go get descaled two to four times a year.  All my Grandparents had&lt;br /&gt;dentures - not a very good dental history lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s vital that the surfaces of the teeth be clean, but for my family the more important part is the gum line.  No matter how much you brush - the brush is not getting between the teeth and especially not down where only floss can reach.&lt;br /&gt;This device gets the vast majority of the particles that the brush does not.  When I look in the sink at all the bits that come out of my mouth even after two minutes of brushing I know that this was worth every penny.  Do something that will impact your future dental health, and be diligent about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to floss, but my hygienist told me:  Its like the peanut butter that&#x27;s left on the knife even after you&#x27;ve rinsed it.&lt;br /&gt;Now that was the visual message that finally changed my mind.</li>
    <li> As someone who was not very good at consistently flossing (Yes I know you don&#x27;t have to yell at your screen, my wife and dentist have chastized me enough for it) I decided at reading a couple of reviews to try this product. This product is amazing and if you are on the fence about buying one I suggest you go through with this purchase. As someone who hardly flossed I now can not go a night without using this product. Simple to use and efficient Easily 5 stars</li>
    <li> So many fun little attachments, and, man, when you crank this baby up to Power 10, you wouldn&#x27;t BELIEVE the rotting chunks of crud that&#x27;ll get blown-out between your gnarly old choppers. I mean, you could create a fabulous little hors d&#x27;oeuvre tray with all the goodies that come out after every use! Don&#x27;t laugh. The holidays are coming up. Friends are coming over. Folks get hungry. You may need extra supplies in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik is always the best, and this ULTRA model is one you ought not to be without, if you are serious about overall dental health. Dentist (and hors d&#x27;oeuvre-chef!) APPROVED!</li>
    <li> It works really well.  It is hard to get used to and the spraying water can be a mess sometimes but I like it.</li>
    <li> This is doing what it should do.  It is helping me with my new problems of keeping my teeth and mouth clean.</li>
    <li> This unit is fantastic! I wonder why dentists always mention the old fashioned string floss but rarely a water flosser? I believe the water flosser reduces your need for the dentist and has a much higher use rate once a person starts. Is it a conspiracy? I don&#x27;t know but I do know the water flosser is not the best thing since sliced bread, it is BETTER than sliced bread. It will help remove the bread stuck between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves your teeth and gums super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Actually is a joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Once you use it for about a week, you ACTUALLY look forward to water flossing which is the opposite of string flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. FAR MORE enjoyable than regular flossing. Yes, I needed to say that twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It cleans between my teeth BETTER than regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. At my last dental cleaning after a few months of the water flosser, there was literally nothing for the dentist to clean. Normally I have quite a bit of tarter and plaque that requires a lot of unpleasant scraping. So it cleans my teeth better, not just between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Simple to use. At first you may spray some water over the counter until you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Adjustable. You can adjust the force from 1 to 10. I use 10 and that&#x27;s plenty powerful (I&#x27;m a macho non-squeamish man).&lt;br /&gt;Most will prefer the middle range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Quick. A tank of water lasts 90 seconds on level 10. In 90 seconds your mouth is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Relatively inexpensive for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than a pair of running shoes, four IMAX movies or the emotional turmoil from losing the love of your life because your teeth are messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Definitely increases my gum health by the massage action which flossing does not do. Some of the reviews gives you actual dental numbers of gum health. They state their gum numbers at the dentist improved from 5&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s to 2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s (lower is better). I fully believe that. When I went back to the dentist after a few months of using the water flosser the dentist found virtually no tarter or plague on or between my teeth. Normally it is a good bit of very uncomfortable scraping but not after the water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dentist also said that my gums did no bleeding like they normally do when the dentist flosses during the cleaning. Although I did not have objective gum numbers, my gums are definitely in better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No truly small portable unit. Once I&#x27;ve gotten used to the water flosser I miss it when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;2. Somewhat noisy. If someone is sleeping in an adjacent bathroom, it will likely wake them up.&lt;br /&gt;3. Needs AC power&lt;br /&gt;4. Takes up counter space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really aren&#x27;t any significant cons that I can find on this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best investments in my health that I have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both you and your smile will love this unit!tually no tarter or plague on or between my teeth.

    <li> Works well. Has the power to blast the left overs between your teeth so they don&#x27;t fester and rot your gums.  Don&#x27;t bother with it if you waited too long and you don&#x27;t have any more teeth.  Easy to fill with nice warm water for sensitive teeth.  Cheaper than having them pulled.  I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 different (other) brands over the years and this is the best.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I received my waterflosser for Xmas. I have never been able to floss with the string stuff successfully, my teeth are too close together. I had some plaque build-up between my lower front teeth that I had for years. This unit removed that plaque in about three little sessions!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It is very easy to use daily and I absolutely love it. I bought one for my wife for her birthday and she loves it too! Do yourself a favor and buy this baby. It will pay for itself with reduced dentist cleanings to remove plaque, plus the food particles between your teeth will be blasted out of your mouth simply and effortlessly.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s fantastic for getting rogue food particles dislodged from my braces. I plan to continue using it even after I get my braces off. It&#x27;s very refreshing. The pressure settings are nice as you are able to start with a less intense setting if necessary. I don&#x27;t really use many of the varying attachments, but I like that there are options. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The price was the best that we could find.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My dentist said that my teeth were really in good shape on my last visit.  I use the water pik every day with an electric tooth brush as well as dental floss.  I would not live without it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of how well this mini pressure-washer (that&#x27;s essentially what it is...) would work, but to my surprise it&#x27;s been working very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every time I use it I notice little bits of food falling into the sink which must mean it&#x27;s doing its job. It&#x27;s a little messy as far as water splashing around but maybe I just don&#x27;t quite have the technique down yet. No worries, it&#x27;s only water anyway. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> By far ,best purchase of the year.I wish I knew about this years earlier.For me personally it has been very helpful.With two occasionally bleeding and irritating spots in my mouth it seems  all taken care of  .Within a month all bleeding stopped.The whole family loved it .I&#x27;ve purchased extra attachments for everybody&#x27;s taste .We gave it as a gift last Christmas to a friends and it seems to have the same effect.</li>
    <li> After many years of using my Waterpik Water Flosser, I found that I was in need of a new appliance to help with my flossing. I purchased this unit as it was advertised as one of Waterpiks best models on the market. I have used this flosser for several months and agree that it is indeed one of their best models.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Is very compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on counter. Removes small particles from underneath gums that can cause cavities and periodontal disease. Attractive looking. Simple instructions for use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  loud and can be messy, but it is the best thing for my gums.  The health of my gums have improved 100%.  I only use the flosser with the rubber tip, but my mouth feels so clean.</li>
    <li> Water flosser works well.  I don&#x27;t think it is quite as easy to use as the old Water Pik, but it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product. My dentist has been after me for years to use this and I finally bought two of them. A little messy but quick to use and leaves your mouth feeling dentist check-up fresh.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that it removes 99% of all plaque along with another claim that it performs better than traditional flossing.    Well, if it really truly performs better than flossing, then I shouldn&#x27;t be able to see anything on a string of floss after using the Waterpik.  Wrong!  After using the Waterpik at the highest setting, I tested its effectiveness by using floss, and there were enough plaque and debri that the floss picked up AFTER the Waterpik to deem it not adequate.  I performed this test multiple times over a 2-week period and got the same results.    Just think about it.  How can it be possible for a stream of water to reach certain places under the gum line that string floss obviously can?  Thus, the claims by Waterpik were all marketing hype!</li>
    <li> I have this product for 32 days, I was using everyday. Works perfect, much better than the oldest model, It cames with many accessories it is easy to use, the water deposit is perfect for the time that you will need to clean your teeth.     You have the option to adjust the pressure of the water, so in the beginning you will use low pressure and after some days you will increase the pressure through you will feel confortable.    It is a great product      [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]      Thanks      Roberto</li>
    <li> Bought this wp-100 several years ago at the request of my dental hygenist.  Used it for most of the first year and realized the cord was short, had to bend over and it was not comfortable on my back, and I could expect the tip to come off at least twice a session, if not more.  Then near the end of its use I noticed a black residue lining the seams of the handle and when I pulled the tip off and looked down into the handle there was more black ooze.  Needless to say I am thinking mold and go research the instruction book where nothing is said about mold.  I go to their web site and do find instructions for dealing with mold, which tells me to run bleach through the unit to rid it of mold.  There is also a warning that doing this might reduce the effectiveness of the unit.  Lets see, mold being pushed into your teeth, gums and mouth under pressure or worry about the life of the product.  Well I used the bleach and it looked clean, but you cannot take it apart to see for sure. So there it sits on the shelf in my basement.      Good luck to all.  I just thought everyone should know.</li>
    <li> Overall, I was impressed of this product. It does the job well, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, it is motor/water pump it has in it. The more you raise the speed, it gets loud and shakes the whole stand a bit.</li>
    <li> Perfect work , I use this daily for a deep clean .  My wife wants other for her and we wil buy another one</li>
    <li> Amazing product, worth every penny spent. I should have bought it long back. Better late than never. Works very well. Small, easy to use. Very powerful, still using it at 3</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Husband who had a stroke during heart surgery and he cannot use his Left arm.  He was left handed and to floss you need 2 hands.  We tried little brushes etc., and then we decided to try this - he feels it does a great job.  He can use it all with one hand and he feels it cleans his teeth and mouth beautifully.  he is able to brush his teeth - this seems better for overall mouth hygiene.</li>
    <li> It is strong enough to get all dirty stuff from my teeth, and I can also control the strength. I am freaking satisfied with the merchandise!</li>
    <li> If this works the way it&#x27;s supposed to, it&#x27;s a great product; but I&#x27;ll have to wait till November to get my dental check-up results.  It seems to work pretty good, but there are a couple of small things that could be better:  a) the reservoir is a little small and b) the electric cord could&#x27;ve been a bit longer. It takes a while to get used to using it.  I just hope my dentist says it works as good as the WaterPik people says it does.  I&#x27;ll let you know in November.</li>
    <li> The product work really well and it is extremely easy to use.  It has really helped to reduce inflammation of my gums and keeps the areas around my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I have found that using the waterpik nightly has improved my gums. It has helped reduce the pocket size around my molars and I don&#x27;t get gum bleeding anymore. It is great to feel confident about my breathe when I talk to someone. I love the fact the different adapters now have their own case.</li>
    <li> This item works very good, I have never had my teeth so clean, arrived promptly and all pieces, very nice.</li>
    <li> this water pik is the best tool to maintain healthy gum. it cleans where the brush or the dental floss can not reach, it is highly recommended  i found the best price at amazon</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product in form and function.  I consider it to be the best on the market at this time.  This is my fourth or fifth Waterpik.  All the prior models lasted only a couple of years before the hoses would break at the base of the handles.  The pluses for this newer model are a water tank lid that stores the extra nozzle tips, the unit is a little quieter, and the controls are more convenient than its predecessor.  However it lacks the water pressure of its predecessor (disappointing) and it&#x27;s designed for one person only - lacking additional nozzle tips for your mate.  It&#x27;s a little pricy at your retail store but you can save 22% plus tax if purchased on the internet (Amazon) which makes it an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> This water flosser is not as loud as other reviewer mentioned. They probably used it during late night when the surroundings are so quiet. I found the noise level is acceptable. It dose a fair job of flossing,between teeth and under the gum where the normal flosser can not reach.I feel like it is doing a very good job of flossing, but only time will tell.  I will keep using it and hopefully it will be the only flosser I use. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When our (20 year old plus) Water Pik died, I did a little Amazon research.  Decided, in spite of a few negative ratings, to try the WP brand again.  Got it (as usual) quickly from Amazon, for \\&quot;free\\&quot; (have a Prime account - wouldn&#x27;t be without it). (It actually came in one day - don&#x27;t tell UPS they screwed up and beat their promise).  So far, it works great - no problem with the hand unit switch, head release (How did some people confuse that with the turning knob on the sprayer?).  The hose IS about five or six inches short, but I can live with that, as long as this one lasts another 20 years (I should live so long).</li>
    <li> First Waterpik ever and I LOVE it! I floss nightly yet, surprisingly, I have seen some \\&quot;missed\\&quot; food particles in the morning when I use the Waterpik Flosser!  It is a great device; sorry I waited so long to buy one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the water flosser for a short time but so far, I am pleased. I haven&#x27;t used all the accessories yet. I basically use the flosser. I feel that it is doing a good job for my back teeth which is where I have deep pockets.  Definitely consider this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because string flossing is very inconvenient for me.  The standard Water Pick attachment and the flosser attachment are the tools I use most often.  I also use the Pocket Pic, and find it very useful for reaching recessed areas in my mouth.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is amazing for getting to the hard to reach corners and in between your teeth. With my braces, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to floss everyday. Now all I have to do is use the waterpik for about 2 minutes in the morning and at night, and I never have to worry about plaque build up.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for good dental health!  I use it every night to make sure I have no leftovers around my teeth and in my gums to stave off cavities.  Add a little Listerine to help prevent cavities and bad breath.</li>
    <li> What a bargin!  Every where I shopped they were $59.00 as always AMAZON.COM beats most prices.  Love this tool, when my old waterpick died after 6 years I knew I wanted to replace it with another Waterpick.  This product is absolutely wonderful and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Makes my dentist happy too....</li>
    <li> After a month of using this product, I&#x27;d say it works very well. I like its package of tips. However, it makes too much noise like helicopter sound. Amazon shipped very fast and packed very carefully.</li>
    <li> Using the pause button hurts your hand. If you have this on your counter you can&#x27;t reach your mouth unless you bend way down. I have a bad back and can&#x27;t bend that far down. Otherwise I like it.</li>
    <li> This product gets it done and this shipper does too! Excellent choice. Very happy with both. Lots of pressure and the reservoir holds sufficient water to take care of each usage. Gary</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many Waterpiks over the years.  Most worked great and lasted quite a while.  My least favorite one was the WP-70W, I finally threw it out and got the WP-100 (Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser).  This is a much better design than the one it replaced. Some of the features I like: the handle has a nicer grip, it has a button to eject the jet tip, the jet tip can easily be rotated, the water tank fits well, and the unit is much easier to clean after use.  I&#x27;m happy with it so far and use it daily.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This machine  does a very good job.  I hate going to the dentist and they ask have you been flossing.  Maybe the next time the dental personnel won&#x27;t ask me that question...</li>
    <li> I bought this unit and it may indeed work sometimes, BUT:  a) from day one it leaked water and destroyed our wood counter top.  b) in fairly short order it failed in so much as it didn&#x27;t pass the water through. Sometimes it finally worked and sometimes it didn&#x27;t. But increasingly it didn&#x27;t.  Lousy product design and/or execution.   Tonight I threw the damned thing in the garbage.  Hopefully someone makes something that works!  PS: I have a Panasonic unit for travel. Infinitely better made, but its pressure is nominal at best.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is great. Despite my diligent oral care, I have trouble with pockets. I bought this in an effort to avoid a deep cleaning, and it worked! After only 2 weeks of use (pretty frequent use), my pockets had improved enough that my dentist downgraded the scheduled procedure to a regular scaling. At the one month follow up, the pockets had improved further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained about the mess. Yes, it&#x27;s pretty messy until you get your technique sorted out. I followed the instructions and other reviewers&#x27; recommendations about gradually increasing the pressure (over the course of a month). Even if it were still messy, it would well be worth the trade for the way it has improved my gums. If you&#x27;re considering one, by all means get it!</li>
    <li> I like this one better than the classic one.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong here, the classic waterpik functioned very good but in time I found that the handle portion sprung a leak which caused the pressure to drop off about 60%.  Not good.&lt;br /&gt;So I replaced the classic one with the Ultra and somehow feel much more trendy and hip because I have an &#x27;Ultra&#x27; Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;It works great. I think because it&#x27;s an \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love this Waterpik. It&#x27;s the right size for me, has a small footprint on the counter, and looks good as well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that, over time, the blue button on the handle, which temporarily interrupts the flow of water, sticks when depressed. It&#x27;s suppose to unstick when you release the button. But after some use, it takes up to 10 seconds after removing your finger before water flow is restored.  I tried periodically cleaning the device with a apple cider vinegar and water mixture. That briefly fixed the button problem. Eventually, I tried a few drops of grapefruit seed extract in the water. That entirely fixed the problem. The button immediately was as good as new.  You can buy grapefruit seed extract here on Amazon. Try the Nutribiotic GSE Liquid Concentrate. Just use a couple drops and your Waterpik will be good as new.  Since grapefruit seed extract also has natural antibiotic properties, one of its uses is for brushing teeth. So it&#x27;s safe in a Waterpik. Also, I&#x27;ve found that just a few drops around the Waterpik handle/tube, where black gunk can start to grow, immediately cleans the area and seems to prevent growth from reappearing. I&#x27;ve started using a few drops to clean the inside of the tank and the lip where it rests on the base. Wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by the amount of junk that was still in my teeth after brushing.The pik can be messy if one doesn&#x27;t put the instrument in your mouth before turning it on.  I am well pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product works very well once you learn how to use it. I admit that the first time I used this, I managed to spray more on my bathroom counter, mirror, walls and my 9 year old son than I actually did on my teeth. But once I figured it out, it works like a charm. I have braces and this works very well at getting all the nasty left overs out from in between your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have a Via-Jet water flosser, owned for more than ten years and still working. No complain aside from covering larger real estate compare to this Waterpik. All good stuff said and what it promise to do is great and it will floss between teeth and gums. Does a good job.  The attachments are somewhat gimmickry. It&#x27;s not a to do it all, it&#x27;s not to replace your toothbrush and dental floss, it should augment them for proper cleaning. The extra attachment other than the standard and one other is great the rest might do a little benefits, don&#x27;t depend on it 100%.  The cover/storage is somehow difficult to remove, sometime instead of removing the cover to fill the bucket with water, you end up opening the storage bin. They have place an indentation below the cover. If the attachment holder is still on its holder, depending how fat your finger is, you will force to dig deeper and in doing so pushing the brush mechanism forward. Be careful, it might break the holder. The best design is to place a knob good enough size to hold open the storage cover. To lift the whole storage out, one intuition is to grab in two opposite side to lift up but won&#x27;t work, instead grab the back (storage) lift it follow by holding on the opposite (front) side to complete the task. I learned it by trial and error.  The water bucket should have a finger to latch on two sides instead of a smooth side wall. Once the water container has been in used, the water outlet is tightly seal, harder to pull up without shaking it loose. The tendency is to grab hold with more pressure for better grip to lift it up. This might create a fractured crack.  This is not a functional flaw, rather inconvenient flaw you will perform every time you use it. Who wants that?</li>
    <li> I had a waterpik which was over 20 years old,and I was really reluctant to use.  It just was outdated and slow getting started and noisy.  This ultra Waterpik  is the best I use it twice a day and I love it.  It gets in between the spaces and remove the food particles just brushing doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Much better than the hand held - it has different speeds - takes up a little space but worth it - I can feel a difference in my gums since using this for only 2 weeks - The seller is excellent - quick delivery and brand new!</li>
    <li> even though, i must say that even with the pik pocket, it doesnt have very good access to periadontal pockets, and I&#x27;m not really sure that it does what it says its supposed to, but the pressure is good(there is actually a little too much) and the tank is about 20% too big which is good because it means that you wont have to refill it twice in one rinse.  I mix in a couple capfulls of mouthwash for good measure.</li>
    <li> Works great. If your looking for water flosser this model is great. It has like 10 different water pressure settings and I dont go over a 4, very strong pressure</li>
    <li> there are you tube videos online about how to use this and it&#x27;s been so great for me so far</li>
    <li> Good product. However, wrong voltage rating of 120v that does not suit users in Australia (240v). Unexpected expensive postage and handling cost for oversea buyers, though.</li>
    <li> We bought one of these two years ago on the recommendation of the hygenist at my dentist.  It is the single best purchase I have made in years.  Even a single use daily, before bed, produces a cleaner mouth and much healthier gums in a short period.  I use a full tank of warm water and the highest power, but I started off at about 50% power.&lt;br /&gt;  The first thing you notice is that the old \\&quot;morning mouth\\&quot; is gone.  Gone.  Now, our gums may even be coming back where they had been receeding.  (Yes, old folks.)  I also had some areas where my teeth were sensitised to acids like grapes, and cold drinks.  Not anymore.  I am about to purchase a second one just to have it iof the first one ever breaks down.&lt;br /&gt;  March 2013:  Now several of our friends have put their dentists \\&quot;out of business\\&quot; with this WaterPic.  You cannot go wrong - It will pay for itself 100 times over!</li>
    <li> I just use it several times but I think it can make my teeth clean. It could be more helpful after brushing.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik. I bought it because I wore the first one out. My dentist says this is the best way to protect your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have always suffered from gum bleeding my whole life. I flossed every day but that didn&#x27;t help much. It was so bad my dentist suggested that I clean my teeth every 3 months. It still doesn&#x27;t help. Gum disease is terrible and it causes heart disease, diabetes and other health problems. After researching the internet, I finally bought this Waterpik and used it after I brushed, and flossed. After a week of using this water pik. My gum bleeding has stopped.  I came back to my dentist a few months ago and he was suprised that during teeth cleaning I didn&#x27;t bleed like before. My gum is also much healthier. I told him that I used Waterpik. He was dismissive about this device and said data is inconclusive. I don&#x27;t know, it worked for me. How do I know for sure? When I traveled out of the country for 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t use the device, my gum bleeding started to return.  It works best when you brush, floss, and then use this waterpik. After ward, I also gargle with salt water and then fresh water.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. Restored my gum health from one dentist visit to the next. Teeth and gums feel cleaner, even if you brushed first and then use the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Love this model. Hope they don&#x27;t stop making it. My dentist and hygienist can&#x27;t believe how good my gums look since I started using a waterpik. I was on the verge of losing my back teeth before I started using a waterpik a few years ago and it has made a world of difference.</li>
    <li> Love this flosser! I was having problems with my gums getting sore so I started using this after brushing my teeth and it has solved that problem! Great product! Several settings and different picks to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This water flosser worked fine for little under one year, but yesterday it just died without any warning or apparent reason. I have yet to see whether I could get it replaced, under warranty agreement.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a timely manner with adequate packaging.  I&#x27;ve been extremely fortunate in my dental health, never having any major issues, but I never flossed my teeth.  As a result I started developing early stage gingivitis.  I started using floss swords every night, following that up with using this product after flossing.  Six months later my gingivitis was gone and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  My teeth feel as clean as they do after a trip to the dentist office for a general cleaning all the time.  I use the jet and toothbrush attachments - the tongue cleaner isn&#x27;t the best, I use another product for that.  I would highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> My first waterpik.  I love it.  I was going to get the newer model but some of the reviews said they liked this one better.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It does a good job of getting the gunk out between my teeth. Just fill it up and go..</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this Waterpik. It shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. The Waterpik works great. I love it!</li>
    <li> Daughter LOVES it!!!! (She&#x27;s a Dentistry Hygiene Professional)</li>
    <li> Helped me clean. I have been using for 2 years now, no problem at all.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Item as promised. Great buy.</li>
    <li> First I really liked this flosser, worked fine, but then after a few months the button started getting stuck, it was pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;At last after a year of use the plastic pipe just broke making the unit useless, see photograph.&lt;br /&gt;They should have made the pipe from more flexible plastic.</li>
    <li> It is working great ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this water pick for a while and love it.  it&#x27;s not that noisy, it has an adjustable strength of water flow so I can take the pressure all the way down and use it on my kids.  easy to clean, compact and a nice addition to dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth transaction. Item arrived as advertised. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a gift, but like the one I have already &amp; will be well appreciated.!!!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I love it. It is well designed. The handle tucks neatly away. It comes with more accessories than you will ever use but, hey, at least you know whats available for you to use. I&#x27;ve had this about a year now without any issues</li>
    <li> I love this.  I really wish I had gotten one sooner.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how small this actually was. I was disappointed by how cheap the materials feel. The reservoir feels like it&#x27;ll shatter if it ever gets knocked over onto the floor. The tube that feeds the water tot he nozzle is also very cheap, stiff, hard plastic, and it&#x27;s in a coil so it doesn&#x27;t stretch very much. This didn&#x27;t come with the tongue cleaning brush even though it&#x27;s listed in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I don&#x27;t think this is worth 60 dollars. 20 maybe. It does shoot the water out good enough and for long enough but even after you shut it off, if there&#x27;s still water in the reservoir it&#x27;ll keep dripping out of the nozzle, so you have to completely empty it before you put it away.</li>
    <li> great item, dental hygienist was amazed at what a good job it did on plaque!</li>
    <li> Great deal for this product</li>
    <li> Great product. After 3 weeks it has greatly improved my gum problems. I used this in conjunction with a protocol by cardiologist Tom Levy who has a book on oral health. Excellent complement</li>
    <li> Works great, has lots of attachments and a knob to control water pressure.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for daughter when she got her braces.  Invaluable tool for keeping her teeth clean. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> My wife bought it and after a while I started to give it a try. It does clean much better than the traditional teeth brush. I feel much cleaner than before after using it every night now. Like it has different levels so I can adjust to the one I feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> What a great item!  I wish I had this when I had my braces!  It has several pic heads for many different uses, one is for braces, one for gum pockets, a toothbrush pic, etc.  After my first use of this unit, my mouth felt like I had just left the dentist office after having a cleaning!  I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth and I am not able to get dental floss between the teeth.  This works great at cleaning between those tight spaces. It is so much easier to use than dental floss.  I look forward to seeing how it does with shrinking my dental pockets.  Thanks for making such a great product, I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I the item arrived in good condition, was well packed and is of good quality. I am very satisfied and would recommend this item and seller to others.</li>
    <li> My wife suggested buying one of these ages ago but we never got around to it. We finally bought one and I have to say I should have listened to her sooner. I think it&#x27;s a great product. It does a better job than regular flossing, without the fuss. I use the Waterpik product every day, and I have to admit that I was never that consistent with regular flossing. Yes, if you&#x27;re not careful you can inadvertently squirt your bathroom mirror, but wiping a mirror is easier than having a tooth extracted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not much of a &amp;#34;product recommender,&amp;#34; but I think the Waterpik water flosser is great.</li>
    <li> Been using mine for at least a year, maybe more. Continues to work great!</li>
    <li> This waterpik was recommended by my dental technician and I purchased it wondering if it would really make a difference. In fact it is great and goes well beyond what flossing can possibly hope to do. If you want a clean mouth, this is the right device. Takes a little getting used to, but well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Very useful. It works similar to a cleaning your receive from your dentist. A very effective unit. You can really feel  a difference after using this unit. A good product, good delivery time, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived at the specified time.&lt;br /&gt;Product described correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik flosser for a few years now. I love it! I bought this one after my old one started getting a bit too calcified (from hard water). I usually buy a new one every 3 or so years. I got this one cause the price was right. Thanx!</li>
    <li> I love my new Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  I don&#x27;t have the greatest teeth and this really helps me keep them clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a unique sensation the first time you use one. It takes a little getting used to so that you can direct it where it needs to go, and it is perhaps a little undignified to be standing over the sink with the extra water flowing out of your mouth, but the results speak for themselves.  Between this and my Sonicare brush, I don&#x27;t think my teeth have ever been so well cleaned outside of the dentist&#x27;s office.  I wish I&#x27;d had them a long time ago. It might have saved me some fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might not entirely eliminate the need for actual floss, but it also gets in places that floss can&#x27;t. I almost look forward to getting some popcorn hulls stuck just to see what it can do, as bizarre as that may sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of downsides though.  The base could be heavier so that it stays put while you operate the power switch or lift off the reservoir to fill it. Also, the lid holds four tips, but it comes with six, and for the most part, you only need one unless you have special dental needs, so in spite of the handy storage area, you&#x27;ll still need to find a place for the extra tip where you won&#x27;t lose it (Even if you never end up using it).</li>
    <li> Product does what it says but I just have the feeling it is pushing more food into my gums that out of it.  I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet to ask about this product but I will.</li>
    <li> This was specifically recommended by our dentist.  I have used it for a month now and have already noticed a difference in my teeth.  It seems to help blast away coffee stains and my gums look and feel healthier!  It takes a little getting used to but after a week, I felt like a pro.  5 stars all around for a great product!</li>
    <li> Had the first for about two years. Dentist recommended it had great check ups as a result. Went a couple of weeks before ordering this one. Traditional flossing can&#x27;t make teeth and gums feel as happy as this thing. My husband and I both noticed a difference without this. Much fresher and cleaner from the first use of it.</li>
    <li> First, this is coming from someone who hates flossing. I hate dentists and fiddling with my mouth in general. That being said, I love this. I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of faith about it, but my spouse insisted we get it. This version came with an assortment of tips, however I have only used two, the original one and the brush. The instructions are super handy and they give you an outline for the uses of each tip. The machine pressure could take paint off a wall, I am comfortable at about a 4. The reason I use this everyday now is because when you are using it, you can see all the bits of stuff coming out and that&#x27;s AFTER brushing with sonicare brushes. Now when I think about going a night without, I just think about all the tiny bits of food that come out. Ew. It is a little bit messy, and if you aren&#x27;t careful it&#x27;s very easy to spray down the whole mirror. It&#x27;s great to use with mouthwash too. Overall, great investment. I have crowns and in the last 3 months, have not come across any problems. The book does say which tools are best for which dental work. If you have sensitive teeth, like me, it&#x27;s even more effective with warm water! Really great product.</li>
    <li> It is like being your own dentist. It is great. I feel like my mouth is getting care it needs. I am obsessed with teeth. I hate having pay a huge dentist bill and it will definitely keep you away from getting cavities. It wont hurt your gums like regular toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Such an improvement over our old one that was very old!!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of getting between teeth, but need more practice in not getting water everywhere.  It does take up a lot of counter space.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning my teeth since I wear braces. Makes getting in between the brackets and wires a lot easier, and makes my mouth fell very clean.</li>
    <li> Works great and is sturdy.</li>
    <li> This has been the greatest purchase for my husband.  He never flossed and this device has gotten him in the habit and is performing wonderfully!  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> A month after purchasing and faithfully using the WaterPic everyday I went to have my teeth cleaned. I have had Jan as my dental hygienist for six or seven years. She was so impressed by the results that she asked the name of the WaterPic so she could get one for herself.</li>
    <li> Definitely has improved my dental hygiene--especially great since I currently have braces.</li>
    <li> easy to set up and use.  Like all the different tips. Doesn&#x27;t take up much room on cabinet so I can keep it out.</li>
    <li> bought as a birthday present for my husband; he set it up and used it immediately; even said he loved it. finally got something right!</li>
    <li> Your teeth are not really clean unless you are using a Water Pik. It is amazing what floss leaves behind. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it myself.  My dentist recommended that I get one because of plaque build up. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Using the water pik is more effective and less painful than flossing.  This was recommended by my dentist after a brutal semi-annual cleaning.  My only wish is for it to be cordless.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how we ever did without this product!  My husband and I love using this 2-3 times per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently took it with us traveling on the road and I accidentally left it at my sons house!  We were truly missing our Waterpic for several days while it was being shipped back to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our teeth, gums, breath, and overall mouth health had been positively impacted by this Waterpic!!!</li>
    <li> Use it always! My favorite ever.</li>
    <li> Works as its suppose to.</li>
    <li> It is larger then I thought.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love my WaterPik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every time I went to the dentist, they would ask me if I was flossing and I was!! I kept having problems with my gums, especially around one tooth in particular. The dental hygienist recommended that I get a WaterPik, so I ordered one on Amazon and received it quickly. On my next check up the hygienist said &amp;#34;you got a WaterPik, didn&#x27;t you?&amp;#34; It made such a difference even she could tell that I was using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I purchased this and would recommend one to anybody. Very easy to use and my mouth feels clean and fresh when I am done.</li>
    <li> Some, like me, will find this device impossible to use. The brush fiber vibrating against my tongue initiates a strong tickling sensation to the point of being very uncomfortable. I wish I could, but I&#x27;ve been unable to use it.</li>
    <li> My hew favourite toy!</li>
    <li> Excellent performance</li>
    <li> This waterpik works very well, however after about a year of owning mine, the coord just broke off. With very little force and taken care of over it&#x27;s life.  Outside of the coord issue, I love this thing.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Lots of heads and good operation.  I&#x27;ve had this for over 2 years now and it is running great.  Granted, I should use it more.  I probably water pick about 4 times a week.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best.  good power to get the job done.  Would recommend this to anyone thinking of buying a water flosser. C.Koehler</li>
    <li> I love it.  Can&#x27;t believe what you miss with brush and floss</li>
    <li> Great product really works well to clean between teeth. Have used it for 5 years daily and not had a single problem.</li>
    <li> Works well but I do not know if I would recommend water flossing as a whole. It does a good job as far as removing particles but it doesn&#x27;t feel quite as clean.</li>
    <li> Have used for several months and it works great.</li>
    <li> very very good, I really love it</li>
    <li> Worked well before recharge.  Useless after the first recharge.</li>
    <li> It got here a day early.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t use too much bathroom counter space.  Getting used to it will take a few more days.</li>
    <li> Does what it does well.</li>
    <li> My wife and I enjoy using this.  Looking forward to shorter dental visits.</li>
    <li> just what my doctor ordered!  already seeing improvement on my gums.  easy to operate.  sleek design. funny....had a waterpik years ago and remember it being loud..guess that&#x27;s hard to improve upon.</li>
    <li> it does what it suppose to do - flosses your teeth. Very easy to use and teeth feel great. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great, thanks it works wonderful...i love all the extra attachments i get with it. Quit requiring so many&lt;br /&gt;That is why I do not bother to rate.</li>
    <li> You no longer have to use dental floss (except to sew on buttons) if you own this machine.  My teeth have never been this clean before and it is almost effortless to get them that way.  My dentist recommended this product, I bought it, used it, and was so impressed I bought one for my son and daughter.  If I had known how great this thing worked, I would have bought one years ago.  It&#x27;s also good to clean jewelry.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It leaves your mouth feeling really clean.  It gets out what regular flossing misses. It is awesome</li>
    <li> This was my first waterpik; my dentist had suggested getting one over a year ago, but I drug my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to find it so easy to use, my teeth feel so clean.  I&#x27;m sorry that I waited so long to get one.</li>
    <li> After starting chemotherapy last month I purchased this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on the gums, and has helped keep the mouth free from sores, which is a side effect&lt;br /&gt;from the chemo.  A variety of attachments and speeds, right now I am content with the low and gentle&lt;br /&gt;speed.</li>
    <li> Easier than flossing, almost as good. Always have to use the highest setting, with a little Listerine in there, but it seems to work fairly well with a deep-ish clean. Bled the first time (which is good because it means my gums were bad), and has been helpful since. Also use it to clean my sink sometimes, like a little mini power washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took off 1 star because mold sometimes grows on it. Why cant it be moldfree, cmon science, get it goin.</li>
    <li> Is small and powerful and quiet. Besides, it has a number of tips that fulfill mostró of your cleaning requirements</li>
    <li> Works as expected still going strong</li>
    <li> Does a good job . Makes it fun to floss .&lt;br /&gt;Good buy</li>
    <li> I have a waterpik and just love it for it does for my teeth.  However, this is my second unit and on both the cradle that holds the wand when not in use has broken 2 times.  To give Waterpik credit they replaced my first unit at no charge.  However now that the unit is no longer in warranty there only advice is to buy yet another unit.  The unit is only about 1 year old and is in otherwise perfect condition.  I have asked Waterpik for a solution and in both my replies they have been less than forthcoming.  The first reply was to buy another unit and the second reply was to advise that there were no replacement cradles available which I already knew since the cradle is preformed in plastic with the rest of the unit.  I have been draining the water completely since the water will continue to drain out and wet everything it comes into contact with.</li>
    <li> Needed for proper teeth and gum care</li>
    <li> As described n fast shipping. My wife still uses it.</li>
    <li> me and my ordered es-rt51-s shaver wet and dry for its a men&#x27;s shaver from Panasonic.  i used it and it work better then any other shaver out there and my wife ordered a Panasonic wet and dry shaver for her its a ladys shaver es-2207p she really loved it and Amazon. is no1 in are book so thank u Amazon u guys are the best online again thank u brian and lacey flugga and she also like her new wedding band set</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter. Able to find the speed suited for me because it is adjustable.</li>
    <li> All of the  previous products played out quickly although Waterpik honored its refund policy and sent me a new product. However, I got tired of fooling with refunds so I spent so more money for a higher priced item. It is working very well so far and does more things than the less expensive models. Most importantly, it appears better made and has a 3 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Using it is really good for gums and teeth</li>
    <li> My new years resolution was to take better care of my teeth because I had to dump a butt load of money into my teeth last year and I don&#x27;t want to have to do that again!  This water pick is great because it has multiple heads designed to different dental conditions.  I use this product 2-3 times per day and my teeth have never felt this clean and healthy!</li>
    <li> My wife needed this in additional to flossing. Some friends and dentist actually recommended getting this. We love this gadget, although it does take some space on the sink counter, it does not bother us as much anymore. We were also able to clean off dirt from an engagement ring, the results were a shiny diamond like it was purchased originally! Multi-use!</li>
    <li> The entire family absolutely LOVES this!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really flossed because it was a pain in the ass. This solves that issue and more. After some bleeding, I was quickly able to use the full blast 10 power. It&#x27;s really helped my gum health and tooth hygiene. What I do is brush my teeth with my SonicCare, then instead of spitting out the toothpaste, I rinse it out by water flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to use hot water. Using cold water is TORTURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple months of using it, I noticed a strange smell. I never really cleaned the water flosser, so I poured in some Listerine and used it. That seemed to solve the problem.</li>
    <li> Bought this Water Flosser few months ago. It is still working perfect. In order to keep it clean and running longer I empty the whole device and tank from water every time after I use it, till the last drop of water is gone. Love it and I would recommend to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my water flosser. I got braces at the age of 27 and am so glad I invested in this. My gums feel tougher and healthier than ever and my mouth feels much cleaner. Braces are a lot of work, this tool helps me out a lot! I do want to note that I didn&#x27;t know I would still need to use string floss, but I find I don&#x27;t need to use that as often when I use the water flosser after each brushing. But you will still need to use the string floss. This little machine is amazing.</li>
    <li> My dentist insisted that I by a Waterpik, so initially I bought one from a local store.  It lasted about 6 months and just died, it was the kind that was rechargeable, so maybe it got water into somewhere it shouldn&#x27;t.  For about the same price I bought this one and it is great!  I love the adjustability and different tips.  I will admit that my teeth feel so much cleaner and hate when I miss a day.  If you&#x27;re thinking about it, stop thinking and grab one!</li>
    <li> I love this water flosser. This is my second one , only that my first one I wore out. the hose started to leak but with the use it gets it was worth getting a new one. This really gets missed food between teeth out that regular floss misses. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> fair, not great quality</li>
    <li> I have bought two Waterflosser Cordless PLUS Waterpik because dental cleaning system I like and wanted him not for my international travel. However, the first of these stopped working after 6 months and bought the second lasted only three months and stopped working. Check in reimbursement policies and points to the product and it can not return. Terrible product and terrible service. Would not recommend to anyone. And but I have returned with another product despite Waterpik: Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser on, it stopped worked some purchased one year nor refunds.</li>
    <li> She doesn&#x27;t use it all of the time so I dont think its working that great, or maybe just too much of a pain to plug in.  You might want to get a stand for it with a permanent plug.  Also have an easy access spot to change the water out. That way it will get used.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right but this never worked for me.  I gave it to a friend and don&#x27;t know how it is working (or not working) for her.</li>
    <li> I just wish it was.. well really I wish it was ONLY the pik part.  No wires or chamber.  That would be awesome.  Like it sucked moisture out of the air and flung it at my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this ain&#x27;t Star Trek holmes.  It&#x27;s a great little guy.  I like the pressure options as I have crazy sensitive gums that are receding so I need the super gentle touch.  This delivers. Can also make me bleed on like the 3rd setting so..be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More tips than I know what to do with (they&#x27;re not that effective really.  Could sell without and make cheaper!</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik. I like the product, does a great job of getting particles out of my teeth. But both of the ones I&#x27;ve owned ended up leaking at the hose. They last 2-3 years before the leaking starts. It stinks that everything today is made to break.</li>
    <li> This being my first water pik, don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I&#x27;m happy with it.  None of the leaking problems as reported in other reviews as long as the tip is inserted properly.  If you&#x27;ve never used one before you&#x27;ll find that no matter how well you think you&#x27;ve brushed and flossed, the pik will find some tiny particle or seed, once again proving my DDS to be smarter than the average bear. If you wear bridges, you need this.</li>
    <li> To start, I&#x27;m the type of person who carries dental floss in my pocket for after meals, so when I heard of the WaterPik I was definitely interested. I received my unit as a Christmas present and the scene could have been mistaken for a little kid getting an amazing toy - Amazon box ripped open, packaging carefully but quickly removed, and a quick wash to prepare for use.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy setup, fill the tank, pick your &#x27;pik&#x27;, plug it in, and turn it on (hold the &#x27;pause&#x27; button if you don&#x27;t want your bathroom sprayed). I have a slightly receded gum-line, but the instructions to follow the gum-line and pause between each tooth worked. I started with the standard pick at about half-power and it succeeded in removing the rest of my breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;I now alternate the standard and pik pocket tips (for a problematic area in rear of mouth) and use a watered down mouth rinse solution in the tank (If doing this, be sure to wash/flush the system as outlined in the manual). Occasionally I will use the tongue scraper tip which definitely cleans it but gives a tickle to the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely enjoy this product and recommend it to anybody looking to get a totally clean mouth - I use it in conjunction with a Sonicare toothbrush and between the two my mouth has never felt better!</li>
    <li> I like it, but as its for my 6 year old I&#x27;m writing it on her behalf.  Difficult to use, button on the handle to stop flow is hard to keep depressed and the machine seems to be inconsistent with pressure.</li>
    <li> Wow!!  You can definitely tell the difference between using regular floss and the water flosser.  My mouth feels cleaner than when using regular floss (although I&#x27;ll still use that in conjunction with the water flosser).  Anyway, the product arrived very quickly and works fine.  The only thing I wish is that the pik compartment held all of the tips instead of just four, and the reservoir didn&#x27;t empty so quickly (I have to fill it twice).  Other than that, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am the kind of person that takes better care of their teeth than their hair or face. I recently got my braces on and flossing was difficult and I felt as if my teeth were not clean enough. My Dentist recommended the water pik.So I purchase the item, this is the best product I have purchased on amazon. I love it! It cleans my gums, teeth and in between. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this produst for a while now and it performs OK.  My only complaint is that the water stoarge is not adequate to do a full and complete teeth cleaning while on setting 10.  It needs to be bigger so I do not have to hurry thru the cleaning.</li>
    <li> Solid product that dose what its advertised to do. I learned not to put cold water in the first day and after that we got along fine.</li>
    <li> As someone that does not particularly like to floss, this product is just what the dentist ordered. It only took 1 time using the Waterpik and I was hooked. I could not believe what it removed after brushing with a leading electric toothbrush. I have since purchased 3 additional for other family members. I am amazed at how clean my mouth feels after use. Now my cleanings at the dentist are brief, and I don&#x27;t have to hear, \\&quot;You haven&#x27;t been flossing, have you.\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love this Waterpik.  It works as advertised and I can definitely see and feel a difference in the cleanliness of my teaath.  Much easier than flossing and I don&#x27;t have to worry about using a floss threader to get around and over my bridge.  I have not experienced any issues with the tip rotating on its own like some have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a wide variety of tips, though I would have preferred a few less of the specialty tips, which I am likely to never use, and more of the regular tips to have some spares or to have one for me and my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think the button control on the handle is backwards.  They should have made it so that the flow is stopped until you press on the button versus the other way around.  That&#x27;ll help avoid some unwanted spraying in the event you turn it on before you have the tip fully in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Had a water pik many years ago.  Forgot how helpful they are in your overall&lt;br /&gt;dental health.  It cleared up a problem I was having flossing around a crown.  I love mine.</li>
    <li> It is too bad that this device only supports 120 volts, nowadays all electronics support 120 - 240 Volts.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to order three, but unfortunately they are not compatible in my country (I need a transformer).</li>
    <li> I do like this little machine--it does wonderfully for people like me who have a lot of dental work in their mouth.  But, there are no directions for cleaning the unit and so I thought I&#x27;d share what I learned from a very helpful Waterpik customer service rep.  I have well-water and she recommended cleaning it once a month by putting 3 parts of warm water with 1 part white vinegar in the reservoir.  Put the hose &amp; handle (with no tip attached) pointing down into sink drain and let gravity drain the reservoir (in other words, don&#x27;t turn the machine on).  Make sure to rinse thoroughly before using.  You may clean the tips by soaking them in 100% white vinegar for 5 minutes and rinsing thoroughly.  Not sure how often it was recommended to clean the tips but I plan to do both together monthly.  Call 800/525-2774, the customer service number for Waterpik, if you have questions.</li>
    <li> Our dental hygienist&#x27;s recommendation narrowed the search to this brand. It was difficult selecting a model, though, because there were so many to choose from on amazon and on Waterpik&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser works well, but even if the intensity is only on the #4 setting, the water reservoir empties out too fast. Using a higher intensity setting requires adding more water once or twice. A larger tank would be helpful. When we&#x27;re finished flossing we turn the reservoir upside down to dry out but there&#x27;s nothing to cover the base unit. The tank cover would be a reasonable thing to put over the unit, but it&#x27;s not shaped to fit. The base, the upside-down tank, and the cover take up a lot of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found nothing in the instructions about how to clean anything before first use.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is the best of all I&#x27;ve owned. The design is sleek and so user friendly. It has many attachable tooth cleaning instruments.  It doesn&#x27;t get the user all wet. Simply put, it is a great Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Product was not labeled that it could not be used in Australia. Even with plug adapter. Item blew up on first attempt. No information from the seller to advise that it was not suitable to international power. So overseas purchasers beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item itself arrived as described in good time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say this is messy, but I don&#x27;t find it any more messy than brushing your teeth. It&#x27;s really effective at cleaning and toning your gums--I already notice a difference after only three weeks. Also, your teeth feel incredibly clean! You should still floss between the teeth, but I can&#x27;t imagine not using this product twice a day from now on. I haven&#x27;t used all the fancy heads--I just use the basic plastic water pic head. Throw away the gum scraper (or better, recycle it)--it&#x27;s useless, Toothbrush works better for that.</li>
    <li> I like to use Waterpik Water Flosser after my flossing.  It feel fresh and clean.  My dentist suggested water floss to me as a gum massage tool to prevent gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;We will see if it help after 3 months when I go to see my dentist for check up.  I have bought this device for one month.  So far it work wonderful, no problem.</li>
    <li> I put off buying this due to thinking I might not use it enough to make it a worthwhile purchase.  How wrong I was!!  I use this daily and it makes my guns and teeth feel so good and clean that I can&#x27;t imagine not using it.  It is so easy to use and the water resevoir holds enough water without refilling it to fully clean my whole mouth which is a big plus!  The extra tips that come with it are super nice.  I have dental implants and there is a special tip to use on them which I love.</li>
    <li> Very effective and easy to use!!! Quiet also. The water container is the right size and the adjustable pressure control is great</li>
    <li> This is a nice little unit that does exactly what the description claims. The handle and attachments are nice and small so that you can put it in your mouth without feeling like you have a fire hose in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Having braces is like eating with a mouthful of paper clips, and no matter how much you rinse there will still be food stuck around your bands and wires.  Fortunately when the meal is done I can race down the hall and - ta DA - Waterpik to the rescue! This device is awesome. I use the special ortho nozzle, which has a brush on the end, and I am at once both amazed and disgusted to see the huge chunks of food that the Waterpik dislodges. I have even tried brushing first, and the Waterpik still gets at food that brushing can&#x27;t.  The reservoir is plenty large - I generally only fill it up slightly above the halfway mark and I have only \\&quot;run dry\\&quot; once.  I have not had any leaks or other problems so far with the gasket (three weeks).  The adjustable water pressure is great and has a good range from light spray to bone-numbing blast.  I ended up somewhere in the middle.  In short, I couldn&#x27;t imaging having braces again without this device.  Must have for anyone putting in the work to remodel their smile!</li>
    <li> I recently had a 4 tooth bridge put in my lower left moler forward and was given these fishing line loops with a tail(Best way to describe them)that you put floss through the loop and push it under the bridge to protect from food under there.  this is a real task for an old guy!  I did it about twice in 5 days, because I could not get this thing through the back of my mouth.  I went to the store to purchase a waterpik and found the price to be about $100.00.  I cam home and went to Amazon on my computer and found the same item for half the price and it works great for many more things then just getting food out from under the bridge.  i couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I love the device and can highly suggest you get one no matter how your teeth are.</li>
    <li> This waterpik keeps my teeth and gums clean.  I had $15,000.00 of gum grafting done and cannot brush the way I did before!&lt;br /&gt;the waterpik does the job.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to make this purchase! My dentist suggested that Waterpik made a great product, and he was right!</li>
    <li> My family loves using this.  It is a effective flosser.  Not entirely a directly replacement of real flossing, but at least the whole family is motivated to use this daily.</li>
    <li> Bought it a couple weeks ago at Walmart for $60.  This is my first try at water jet picks.  It&#x27;s not that loud.  I rinse with Listerine after, to get a nice clean feeling.  The tank is big enough for one cleaning.   The power is more than enough for me; I have it set to a little more than half the power.  If I set it too high, it actually hurts.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with no complaints.  I&#x27;ve only tried the normal attachment and that&#x27;s all I really need.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll last long.  There is a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 months ago at a local chain store.  This is the first waterpik I&#x27;ve owned, and I have to admit that I wish I had been using one my whole life.  It seems to be built pretty solidly and it certainly has enough pressure to clean out anything you may have stuck between your teeth.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fun takes a little to get used to but does good job</li>
    <li> Best thing for your teeth.</li>
    <li> I thought water flossed was an outdated technology and&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other flossing I think they are great for getting bits of food out between your tooth and it does as well of a job against plaque.The only defect I found  is after using for more than a week in a full water  pressure mode,it just feel like pressure is not enough to satisfy my needs.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I am only using  limited number of features and cannot do an overall review.  I do, however, love it.</li>
    <li> Best buy I could find for replacement brush for my water pick</li>
    <li> The water flosser gets everywhere. After more than a year of daily use I noticed that the pressure has somehow diminished and that the button in the handle sometimes locks. I have to turn it off, remove the top accessorie and then this button will get released. Fortunately, this button stops water instead of allowing water to go through ( i instinctively thought otherwise) so basically you can work the flosser with the on/off water in the container and stop using the button in the handle. I only use water on it and clean it every week, specially where the container is placed. Always leave it in the upright position, otherwise it will leak.</li>
    <li> Was a gift to husband; he loves it!</li>
    <li> We purchased this after my husband&#x27;s dentist recommended it. After one use, we were hooked. We wondered why we waited so long to purchase a Waterpik because now we save money on flossing products. It makes my teeth feel like I had them cleaned. Just a warning that using it on high pressure is not advise by the dentist because by doing this, it will really mess up the gums. Not sure why they have such a high pulse.</li>
    <li> OK - it flosses effectively - certainly more effectively than a piece of waxed string. And warm water is pleasant, but for me it will take a while to get used to ... I felt like I was drowning in too much water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like using a firemans hose to clean your teeth.. Wear a poncho lol</li>
    <li> This unit has a lot of different heads. And lots of blasting power, we keep it on a low setting to avoid damaging our gums.</li>
    <li> Good product and helps with your dental hygiene  If used on a regular basis, it has ti help with your dental visit and bill.</li>
    <li> Ended up under my sink, useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated flossing with a traditional floss- it&#x27;s annoying and it hurts! Waterpik is the perfect solution to my flossing woes. It&#x27;s gentle and gets rid of all the residue in my mouth- it even makes flossing fun! I&#x27;m especially impressed by the wonderful customer service Waterpik provides. I contacted them because the holder on my unit broke after a couple months of regular use. They immediately shipped out a new one to me. Definitely give this product a try- if you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m sure the Waterpik customer service support team will be happy to work with you to resolve any problems!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long the cord leaked at the handle connector and broke off....No way to repair it, less then 2 years old...</li>
    <li> About 40 years ago the dentist told me that I need something done which involved scrapping under my gums.  I used a water pick and rinse my mouth out with hydrogen peroxide and have had no dental problem in that period of time.  I don&#x27;t use the pick every day, just several time a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Nagle</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Works great</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth and gums clean.</li>
    <li> Works so well! I love it. My teeth sparkle. I had to get the hang of it because it was messy at first. But once you know how it works the water doesn&#x27;t spray all over and it is way easier than dental floss.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described.  It is able to reach places and dislodge crud which no amount of flossing could remove.</li>
    <li> Good and efficient power even on the lowest dial. I love the storage area as well.</li>
    <li> Makes a huge difference in oral care.  Every night simply floss with string first, then floss with water using this flosser, and then brush.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how this helps your teeth and gums.  Put a cap full of mouth wash in the water flosser and that helps too.</li>
    <li> I have tried three different  Waterpiks and all  work fine for about 2 years, then the hose cracks and it is not worth repairing. The hose is made from a ridged tubing material and does not last. If the tubing was made from a more flexible pliable tubing it would last longer. This is the third and last one I will purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. It leaves my mouth refresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Product by itself is great, I&#x27;ve brackets and Waterpik is the best way to clean it up. But build quality is really poor! I&#x27;m on my third Waterpik in just 2 years. Motor just died on the first two. Current one has issues with plastic button that releases a water only after couple month of using, is it too much to ask for product to work for more than a year? :)</li>
    <li> I have used this flosser twice a day for about seven months now and find it so convenient.  The dentist says he can see a difference in the condition of my teeth.  That is enough for me to continue with it. I would (and my dentist would) recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have bought every style of Waterpik and have bought the Ultra twice.  It is perfect.  It also has specialized heads that help with any dental need.  I am 86 and thankful to Waterpik for helping these past many years in keeping teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product! Everyone should one a Waterpik!</li>
    <li> Works well haven&#x27;t had a problem at all.</li>
    <li> Have used Waterpik Flossers for some time now and they keep my gums healthy and so the dentist is happy too!</li>
    <li> got this for my grandson as he just got his braces, really helps him</li>
    <li> awesome, on the highest setting you could almost cut glass! But on a lower setting it works amazing. Its amazing what comes out even after a very thorough brushing. Kinda makes you want to do it every day!</li>
    <li> Works well, love the attachments</li>
    <li> My daughter just recently got braces and uses this waterpik both morning and night to finish off her teeth cleaning routine.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> It is really good. Easy to use and comfortable</li>
    <li> My gums have never been healthier.</li>
    <li> Read many reviews on this and other models but decided on this one. Has all the features I was looking for and some extras. I like the adj. pressure but mostly use it on the highest setting with the exception of a few of the tips that come with it and that are recommended for use at lower settings. It is quieter than other models I have used and has a water tank with a good amount of water volume easy 90 sec.. Not to large for counter. I have only given it a 4 for now as I do not know anything about its durablity. However it does come with a 3 year warranty. I previously had the handheld rechargeable model which did not hold much water and did not hold a charge either. I also do not believe it had as much power however it was smaller in size. For the difference in price I would fore go the rechargeable and choose any of the other plug in models. I have read where others thought the pressure was not strong enough but I feel that it is fine 90psi I think. I do not want one that will blow my teeth out. I also find it much easier to use than floss and feel that if used along with a power toothbrush your dentist will be happy and not lecture you about not flossing.</li>
    <li> This water flosser is great! It&#x27;s very simple to use and surprisingly effective. I am repeatedly amazed at how much stuff it removes from between my teeth. I shudder to think that all that gunk stayed in my mouth before I started using this machine. And when I floss with a standard string after using this Waterpik, I never see evidence of remaining gunk. Simply a wonderful product. I wish I had known about this thing years ago!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t replace flossing as I had hoped it would. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and have flossed right after use, and food residue is still present.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s orthodontist recommended a water pik as soon as he got braces.  My son wasn&#x27;t the best at flossing and after the braces were put on, he hated flossing even more. When he did floss, he didn&#x27;t do a good job. With this Water Pik, he was able to clean between his teeth and under the braces wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate:&lt;br /&gt;The wide variety of tips and the tongue cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable water pressure settings&lt;br /&gt;The button on the handle that allows you to start and stop the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;The water basin is just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son thinks it&#x27;s fun to use, which is a plus. There have been a few times when other things in the bathroom were squirted with the Water Pik, but when I threatened to take it away, he used it appropriately. He really enjoys using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son no longer has braces and I&#x27;m proud to report that he hasn&#x27;t had any cavities. This is truly and effective product!</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered one for myself and decided to order the 2nd one as a gift after using it for two days. I am going to order the 3rd one. Just love it!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It&#x27;s ideal for people who hate flossing. It is user friendly and much less time consuming. I&#x27;ll recommend the Ultra Waterpik Flosser to persons with braces.</li>
    <li> Works fine given the following limitations; resivour is too small, i have to fill 1 &amp; 1/2 times to clean at 2 seconds between teeth.  The high power is too weak, should be increased.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my gum hurt a lot while I were eating hot or cold food.  I thought the pain may due to my teeth and gum not clean enough so I bought this product to give a try.  I spend over 5 minutes to clean my gum with this water flosser.  It works.  At least I don&#x27;t feel pain when I am eating hot/cold food.  I fill up the water container and use all up every use.  Overall I rate this product as an efficient product per my own situation.</li>
    <li> I received it shortly after my order. It was used as exactly as what is described in the information sheet. I like it.</li>
    <li> Requested by my dentist to use this for gum disease prevention.  Cannot believe how great it works even though skeptical at first.  Although I use a sonicare electric tooth brush, I am amazed by the amount of food particles the waterpik cleans out even after brushing.</li>
    <li> The basic idea behind the Waterpik flosser is OK, but both the engineering and especially the manufacturing are flawed. The flossing wand is basic, and its motor primitive - you can get a little dribble of water or a gum-tearing torrent, and not much in between. I have a Braun flosser (no longer made, sadly) which was far better made, but after 10 years its hose fell apart. But it was very sturdy and easily adjustable. With Waterpik, the whole setup is very lightweight, so it tends to slide on countertops. Moreover, the tank has a terrible rubber valve controlling the flow. It took only a few months for that to get stuck on the open position, meaning that if you lifted the tank it leaked all over.  The last straw was when it started leaking while it was mounted on the machine. I threw it away, frustrated. Unfortunately, no one seems to make a decent alternative, now that Braun has left this market segment.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels so clean after using this and I&#x27;m still surprised how much debris is removed even after brushing and flossing.  Great price.  My only complaint is myself and my bathroom sometimes end up soaking wet, but I think it is more user error than the machine.  LOL!</li>
    <li> different from the old one, but a lot of neat details.  now there is a storage case for the different tools, much better then the old design.</li>
    <li> Never used a water pick before and found it cleans between the teeth much easier than dental floss, getting out food particles in teeth that are very close together.  Toughens the gums as well, so much less bleeding when needing to use dental floss at work or when traveling.</li>
    <li> Bought this on the advice of my dentist because of a gum problem. It does indeed do wonders for gum health. It cleans under my bridges and in general has greatly improved my mouth conditions. Very easy to use - after a few wet accidents and inadvertent mirror splashings. Fun toy to chase one&#x27;s wife around the bathroom. But I am very pleased with the machine and the results. I do like the ability to regulate the strength of the water stream.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to get this, because my old waterpik had broken.  This is a much better model that is easy to use, and very effective for implants.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the countertop and is convenient to use.  I like that you can adjust the pressure.  It definitely makes my teeth feel much cleaner than just brushing, and removes food particles from places that are difficult to floss.</li>
    <li> Very highly recommended unit, well worth the money and shipped faster than date given! I would buy another for a gift, no problems with my unit......</li>
    <li> Product was as described.  Nice to work with and easy to use.  Had a wp when first came out in 1970.  New one is less force which I find better as does not damage gums.  The water container could be larger but works.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product, helps me floss more often</li>
    <li> This works better than I expected. One of the best Waterpiks I&#x27;ve used. My last one didn&#x27;t hold enough water and didn&#x27;t have enough pressure. Not a problem with this model. The reservoir holds plenty of water and the water pressure is fantastic. Go out and get one now.</li>
    <li> Nice product, great price, great customer service!</li>
    <li> After buying it this month I used the water flosser for about 2 weeks before the press button to activate and stop the flow of water jet started malfunctioning. When pressed it should stop the flow of water completely but the flow still continues with lesser pressure. As a result, it has become difficult to use it. I cannot say if this particular flosser, in general, is defective. Since I like such type of water flosser, I would like it to be replaced by a similar but non-defective one.</li>
    <li> This is a really good, well made flosser. It gets the little bits of food even after you brush and use dental floss.</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd Waterpik and I love it. Dentist says my gums and teeth have greatly improved. I would definately recommend this. I even bought one for my friend and she sees the difference. I ordered it from Amazon and received it very quickly. I have never been disappointed in any deliveries I receive from them.  Sometimes they come before the scheduled delivery date.  Keep up the good work Amazon!</li>
    <li> The Amazon site states that there are two classic jet tips included in this package... this is not correct!  There were six tips... each of a different type.  I was counting on the two classic jet tips... or would have ordered extra tips as part of this purchase and saved time &amp; shipping expense.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing and this is the best. I use it day and night. I love the different brushes. I can see a huge difference. I recommend this to anyone. This is a great holiday gift. Everyone should own one:)</li>
    <li> Love it - really helps keep my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get along without this flosser.  Receding gums require a whole lot of hygiene care.  Last visit to the dentist, I was showered with compliments on how well I am taking care of my gums.  I owe it all to this water pic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this gets lots of great reviews, so I just want to add the suggestion of using warm water. It makes it much more pleasant, especially if your teeth are sensitive to cold.</li>
    <li> Make no mistake, this is not meant to replace flossing but it is a helpful and handy addition to a daily oral hygiene regimen.  The various tips and speeds make it quite versatile.  My one complaint is that the storage area atop the water basin does not snap closed.  As a result, one must be careful taking it off and on or everything will spill out.</li>
    <li> The Waterpic was delivered on time and packaging was good. The product is great, I use it every night and love it. However my dentist had the same product for sale for the same price I paid from Amazon. But at the time I was not having to pay state and local tax when ordering from Amazon, so I saved a little on that. Other wise I would have been just as well off buying from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the sole reason that I get tonsil stones that are hard to remove.  Sometimes I could get them out with a Q-tip, but would end up giving myself a sore throat from poking my tonsils.  At setting 3 (you don&#x27;t want to go much higher than that or it&#x27;ll cut the tonsils), I&#x27;m able to aim the pik at the stone and fire.  It almost always gets the stone out, even ones that are kind of stuck or big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are looking to get this to remove tonsil stones, it works!</li>
    <li> I have really tight spaced teeth &amp; flossing with string is difficult. My dentist recommended using a water pik &amp; so I bought this one about a month ago. My wife &amp; I both use it daily &amp; feel it does a good job of cleaning around the gums &amp; between teeth. Easy to use, cleans good &amp; reasonably priced. I&#x27;ll never go back to string floss.</li>
    <li> I just received my waterpik in the mail, and I must say that I was pleased with the results. I love the settings, and found 10 to be powerful. I am pleased with this merchandise.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik Ultra flosser we bought and it works extremely well. It&#x27;s powerful and easy to use. The first one we had  had to be replaced when the coil tubing had a leak.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t floss for years (I&#x27;m 31). Just never developed good habits, hated flossing, thought it was painful, etc. etc. Led to a HUGE amount of problems at the dentist, root canals, caps, crowns. I&#x27;m in the midst of a total rehab of my mouth, but I have good insurance now, so score. I ordered the waterpik and the Sonicare E series toothbrush. Both of them are amazing. The waterpik is very easy to use, the tank empties after about 90 seconds of flossing, which with this much power is all you need. And you can put listerine or a capful of hydrogen peroxide, my dentist said. If you do that, always rinse the basin after use to prolong life. All the picks are good, mostly I use the regular jetpick and the periodontic pick, because I have bridges and crowns. I haven&#x27;t used the toothbrush attachment or the deep pocket one yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re good. I saw a video where the dentist said to leave it at low power, that any more is bad for your teeth. I don&#x27;t know about that. Flossing with string is pretty brutal. But I&#x27;m very happy with this and I would highly recommend it. You will save so much money at the dentist, and your teeth will look and feel good. After using, it feels like you&#x27;ve had a cleaning. And you will be amazed at the crap it gets out of your teeth.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra is really nice addition to your dental care. I like the pressure knob 1-10. This helps you fine tune the product to your gums and teeth.This water flosser gets everything out of your teeth from your last meal it&#x27;s great. No more (sawing) your gums from reg. floss products. :)</li>
    <li> I like how it clears out all the bits and pieces of what I have eaten (which is visually obvious when you use it), and it gets into dental work in a way that a brush or floss cannot.  Also I use it to clean between tooth and gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually put off buying for several months b/c I was not buying their advertising that it is a replacement for flossing.  Then I realized that I don&#x27;t have to choose between water pic and flossing; I can do *both* for better care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given 4 stars instead of 5 b/c the pressure setting is not always consistent.  Having said that I am still glad I bought it and use it several times each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, in the 5 months since I bought mine, the price here has gone up by forty-five percent.  Do a search for Walmart, Target, etc, then tell this Amazon seller you want a price match.</li>
    <li> The product gets 5 stars. It&#x27;s great, works well, does what it&#x27;s supposed to. However, like most of us who buy from Amazon.com, I expect to pay a fair price. This item retails for $59.99 and can be found at an everyday low price of $49.97 on Walmart.com (free shipping). The price seems to fluctuate on Amazon.com depending on who the seller is, so be careful how much you pay!</li>
    <li> At my last dentist visit the dental hygienist informed me that my gums were bleeding and that I wasn&#x27;t flossing. Well,of course she was right but I didn&#x27;t let her know that. You know, I don&#x27;t hate flossing but I don&#x27;t enjoy it either. So, I picked up a Waterpik. I increased my vitamin C intake so as not to suffer the \\&quot;Yo Ho Ho....\\&quot; scurvy disease, and religiously started using the Waterpik, and now my gums don&#x27;t bleed--yes, it feels like I just had my teeth cleaned, yea!</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik water flosser. The first one was a wireless water flosser, the battery died after a year. I think this one is much better, and hope it will last a bit longer. The tips are useful, easy to change, and I like the adjustable pressure setting.</li>
    <li> ...or so says my wife.  Her tentist recommended it, and Amazon had the best price.  If the lady of the house is happy, all is right with the world.  And happy she is with this product.</li>
    <li> Best water pik I ever used. Plastic water spray holder turns easily with your fingers so you don&#x27;t have to turn your face around or lean over the sink at a weird  angle.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product to me as I have dental implants and crowns in the front of my mouth.  As my gums are very sensitive, the changeable tips provided with the product allow me to clean around the implants and crowns(the product includes several different tips, one specifically for implants and other periodontal work) while also being gentle to the surrounding gum tissue.  At the same time, the other tips allow for thorough cleaning that supplement the brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my dentist had a rebate brochure that provides for a $5.00 rebate with proof of purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best choices I have made. I have trouble getting threaders through my bridge work and I get lazy about flossing, but with the Waterpik it is so easy to do. My gums are healthy also which is so important. I had my 6 month checkup and right after that I bought a Waterpik. I can&#x27;t wait till my next dentist appointment to hear what they think about the improvement. This product really works.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with my old waterpik,but the handle broke so i purchased a new waterpik. The new one does not have as much pressure and it starts much slower. I called Waterpik and they said it was within their standards and they made no attempt to correct it. I purchased a new handle for my old Waterpik and it is working fine.</li>
    <li> we bought this because I am too lazy to floss. I feel this is fairly good replacement for flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very convenient, easy to use.. less cumbersome than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The kid just got the first checkup after installing the braces, it wasn&#x27;t good. Brusheing wasn&#x27;t cutting the plack.., he now uses the waterpik every morning and night and changed to look of the teeth. This is a great addition to brushing your teeth with braces. He removes the tip and little later we wipe up the puddle (small) of water on the counter, must leak from the hose a little (gravity feed). Spraying the mirror or the dog is not allowed, so far the mirror is spot free.</li>
    <li> Water started jetting out of the bottom of the handle yesterday after 9 months of use. Until then I was pleased with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;and I will be again. I wrote to customer service and they responded immediately to say that they were mailing me a new handle.</li>
    <li> Wow, so much easier than the old string floss. Sometimes, regular floss still does a better job loosening debris, then the Waterpic flushes it out very efficiently. This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This has improved my oral situation in so many ways. I have had some prior changes in my schedule that have allowed plaque to accumulate faster than before. Now with this waterpic i have been much more aggressive in by cleaning and of my upkeep. I recomend this product to anyone who has been having problems keeping their mouth clean and happy. This message has been approved by my dentist.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Works beautifully and worth the money. Don&#x27;t buy the cheaper models, or the rechargable models.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel very clean after use. Easy to use, once you learn how not to flood the counter top. Quicker than string flossing. Gums subjectively look better.</li>
    <li> Worked like a champ for a week. Then (after I had tossed away the packaging and other paperwork) it just up and died on me mid-floss. It&#x27;s 46$ - so it&#x27;s not worth calling customer support or amazon. I&#x27;ll just have to chalk this one up to poor quality control and bad luck on my part I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I did not want to give up on this, so I bought another. This time I kept the packaging safely. And of course - it has been working like a champ for the last 3 months. While having one die within the first week is rather irksome - I&#x27;m going to upgrade the rating to a 4 star because it&#x27;s just so handy and effective at getting those annoying little bits out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (Nov 2013) - Well this unit has been going great for well over a year now with no issues. So - upgrading from 1 star to 5. This is a must have for everyone.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it does a good job at explaining how to use it . It was frustrating at first and there is water all over the place ....didn&#x27;t think it was worth switching from floss.</li>
    <li> Very nice, was suggested by my dental hygienist to help since I have periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;Has helped me in between cleanings.</li>
    <li> I have used a water pik for 35 yrs. or more.  I can&#x27;t get along without one.  I use it twice a day every day.  This is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> I like the Ultra and use it everyday, to me it is much better than standard flossing because my gums bleed much less and it is very easy to use, my dentist recommended the Ultra to me for the deep cleaning of my gums around the teeth line.</li>
    <li> I recently bought one of these and love it! Great for your dental health! Takes a bit of practice in knowing how to use it but like the electric toothbrush is well worth it!  I also have the hand held battery/electric operated model that I will now use for travel.  FAST delivery!</li>
    <li> Only time will tell if this product can truly replace flossing, but nothing has ever made my teeth feel so clean.  I just got braces and needed something to  help me quickly clean between my wires and brackets.  After every meal and snack, I go for a quick trip around the mouth with this device. I didn&#x27;t find it hard to use, as long as I bend over the sink.  It&#x27;s easier than a neti pot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t replace brushing. Irrigating one&#x27;s mouth alone doesn&#x27;t give it that fresh taste feeling, but it does get out any food particules that are irritating your gums and sticking between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both the plaque seeker head and the orthodontic tip and found them both comfortable. Even at a very high setting, I didn&#x27;t feel any pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without one of these. I guess my next trip to the dentist will be the real test however.</li>
    <li> This is the third WaterPik we purchased over the past several years. Each time the hose got brittle and broke into several pieces within a couple of years. Also, customer service is not willing to help with replacements. We will definitely try another brand.</li>
    <li> Hi - I bought this based on a recommendation from my dentist. They said that on top of brushing and flossing, I needed to use a pick to spray water into my gums. I did this pretty regularly at first but then it just became too much of a pain in the behind. Its very large, very loud, and it makes a giant mess all over the place. Maybe its the conductor, but I haven&#x27;t used it in months. I do believe its well built, looks nice, but it takes up a lot of real estate. I hope this feedback helps.</li>
    <li> I have been useing this water pick each day for a month. I have found I don&#x27;t need to set the dial any higher than 6 which is plenty of pressure for me.  It holds enought water to do all my teeth twice on both sides. Makes some noise but not to much.</li>
    <li> My gums used to bleed a lot every time  I go for my 6 months cleaning.  They don&#x27;t anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give a 5 stars if the flow control button on the handle/wand doesn&#x27;t become stuck very 6 months. But, I have no trouble get a free replacement from their customer service.</li>
    <li> I have had a waterpik for so many years and have never been without. I bought my last  Waterpik Ultra Flosser 6 yrs ago and one of the lines just broke on me. I have gone without one for 2 months (can&#x27;t imagine why!). I never feel like my teeth are clean. OK, so now I am buying myself another one. I cannot live without a good waterpik. I floss without it until it is embarrassing. Merry Christmas to myself. A healthy mouth and always clean teeth! Yes, I taught dental hygiene yeas ago and this never leaves you. I am 69yrs old and never get a new cavity and I have my own teeth and always with.  Walda Letson</li>
    <li> The water flow was not consistent , sometimes strong, sometimes weak.  I tried 2 weeks and expecting it was going to be smooth but still not as good as the old interplake that I had.  So I returned it.</li>
    <li> First, I agree with the other reviewer-- these aren&#x27;t quite at good as they used to be--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I still think it&#x27;s pretty good except for one major thing-- These tips are almost impossible to find when they need to be replaced.  I&#x27;ve checked 9 different stores-- from pharmacy to department store-- and several sell the machine-- NONE sell replacement heads of any kind for this brand.  So-- If you are ordering this from Amazon today-- be sure BUY ENOUGH TIPS FOR YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.  (I bought this over a year ago during an after-Christmas sale (locally) and order the replacements from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find tips anywhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really like it, feel nice and clean and fresh after I use it, it&#x27;s simple enough for the kids to use (though my son-- who isn&#x27;t the biggest little fella-- does have a hard time pushing the \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button to stop the squirting while he empties his mouth in the sink.  So-- he either has to turn off the entire machine, or make sure he aims it quickly into the sink and work quickly so the water reservoir doesn&#x27;t run dry too quickly.), and it&#x27;s got a nice set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up-- I like the machine-- but find it really annoying that I have to have tips mailed out to us (and currently, the best price I can find is Amazon, but with shipping, it&#x27;s still around 9 bucks for 2 little plastic tips)-- (So annoyed that I took off 2 stars!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE: If you are going to buy a water pick-type device-- If you are like me and would hate to have to order toothbrushes and floss through the mail-- then go to a local store that would carry replacement parts for these devices, see what they carry, how much they cost, and THEN make the decision on what water-flossing device you want to buy (and where to buy it.  Amazon will probably be cheapest for the actual  machine-- but what a pain to mail order replacement parts that you are supposed to replace every six months.  That means for my family, to replace allthe jet tips, plus the brush tips, etc, that we use-- I will be spending the same as I spent for the entire unit TWICE A YEAR!)  Originally, I gave this item 4 stars because the tips situation was annoying... I removed a second star after I ordered the replacement tips from amazon, and did the math on what yearly maintenance parts on this machine is going to cost.  You can&#x27;t possibly give it more than 3 stars unless you happen to have a store nearby that sell replacements!</li>
    <li> I have braces &amp; gets into all the hard to reach areas leaving your mouth absolutely clean. In fact I&#x27;m addicted to it- when at home I use after every meal...then brush :) I only wish I could take it with me when I go out to eat. I would also recommend you try the lower settings first. I started with thee highest &amp; now I just can&#x27;t get into the habit of using a lower setting .</li>
    <li> The WP-100 water reservoir is too absurdly small!  Switching the Waterpik off when you&#x27;re just partially done, removing the tank to refill it, then reassembling the unit -- all this before you can get back to the job -- is tiresome and ANNOYING.  That said, this latest model is (1 star) more functional and (2nd star) more attractive than any of Waterpik&#x27;s earlier fine products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn&#x27;t cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I&#x27;m still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn&#x27;t strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.The dentist HADN&#x27;T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!</li>
    <li> I just got my braces on and am getting a little paranoid about my oral hygiene. This thing cleans the hard-to-floss areas very easily. I use the lowest setting as I feel that it is kind of strong enough. And it feels like massaging your gum as well. The machine itself is surprisingly small, so it doesn&#x27;t take too much counter space.</li>
    <li> Like it, love it!  Not bad at all but when you set it at 10 do not put it really close to your gums as it will sting and cut ya.</li>
    <li> This item replaced our worn-out Waterpik that we had bought, and used daily, for  more than 10 years.  It is easier to use than the old one was.</li>
    <li> I have been using a waterpik for many dozen years.  It got me through braces and periodontal cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot do without one.</li>
    <li> very happy with the Waterpik water flosser, Works as advertised. Have used it for several months and am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> The best water flosser I&#x27;ve ever used.  Cleaned up my gums in 30 days.</li>
    <li> I like it, works really good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in late December and this was used by 2 people intermittently (roughly 3 times a week each). It began leaking from the handle this morning and is now unusable. Waste of $ for sure; sad because I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who was using floss.  I kept telling him, once you use a Water Pik, you&#x27;ll never go back to floss.  After one use, he was sold.  He said he could not believe it took him so long to make the switch.  He likes his new &#x27;toy&#x27;. He also remarked his breathe is fresher than it was using the floss ribbon.</li>
    <li> my husband really likes this plus the extra pics have a closed case so they stay nice and clean little high price but he likes it</li>
    <li> It was time to upgrade (my old square one was still working by the way). I love how the cord has a little space to tuck into when not in use, and there is a holder for the tip and handle.  The handles is a bit too big and take some getting used to - probably perfect for someone with larger hands. The knob that rotates the tip seems a bit fat and tight, takes some getting used to as well. The lid on the top that holds the tips falls off easily. Would be nice if they had some type of gasket to make it seat better. The water reservoir is just about perfect for getting everything done. It is a bit tight to get off but I guess that is good in the long run. The water pressure is good and has a nice range. I like that it is somewhat slim and does not take up too much space. I have yet to try all of the tip choices but it is great to have so many choices.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used. I would recommend this for everyone.</li>
    <li> Just bought yesterday but already feel the difference. Great replacement for flossing. Purchased at Walmart.com for only $49.97 with free site to store.</li>
    <li> Everyone should used this water pic daily</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist. Very effective in cleaning those areas a toothbrush can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> Water pik is great, but the hand button is starting to stick in the off position for the water flow. I used it 2 or more times a day.</li>
    <li> What my dentist always said to me before buying a waterpik &amp;#34;You need to floss more, here i&#x27;ll show you how&amp;#34; This always made me feel like I was a 8 year old kid.&lt;br /&gt;Now my dentist only says &amp;#34;See you at your next check up&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE flossing (yeh I lied to my dentist before about flossing every day) but  I love using the waterpik. It does take some time for you adjust to the pressure so start low and build up using the pressure settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: SOOO much easier and better than flossing with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I don&#x27;t use any of the extra bits/tools that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;  You do have to explain to everyone who uses your bathroom that its a dental device and not something colonic related.</li>
    <li> The whole family uses this every night and we love it</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended  the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser i and it is great.  It is very very effective in removing food particles from between my teeth.</li>
    <li> I prefer this instead f my toothbrush. It comes with 8 attachments and one is a brush. My mouth and teeth are so clean&lt;br /&gt;and I use a little mouthwash along with the water, which freshens my breath.</li>
    <li> I have lots of dental floss on hand, that I&#x27;m afraid will never go away now that I have found this device.  My flossing trouble spots are now fixed, and my dentist has mentioned a marked improvement in my gum health.  Do something good for yourself and your family and give this a spin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a WP-60 for two years.  The WP-100 is a lot quieter and easier to use.  I have arthritis in my hands and I&#x27;m able to easily press the pause button.  It&#x27;s also smaller and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  I am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a couple weeks already. &lt;br /&gt;No complains. Easy to use. &lt;br /&gt;Feels much better than flossing, and it takes less time.</li>
    <li> Well, it only took them about 30+ years to change the design of the water pik, which until recently was the same as when I was a kid.  The new one is much more aesthetic.  Mechanically, it does what it is supposed to.  The storage container on tip is neat too.  Both of my dentists recommend it, and I trust them, so go out and get one.</li>
    <li> I wear an appliance and have pockets that capture debris. I use this unit daily. I thoroughly enjoy the feeling and the effect of the waterjet on my gums and in between the teeth. It is extremely easy to use. Just remember to be sure that the nozzle is completly attached otherwise you can get a \\&quot;bath\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Can&#x27;t believe the cleanliness of my kids&#x27; teeth.  This waterpik is very powerful &amp; does an excellent job yet is more compact than some of the other models.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You can brush and floss as good as you possibly can then use this and still get \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; from between your teeth and gums!   &lt;br /&gt;I love it.....use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; I love this product.  Makes your teeth, mouth &amp; gums feel clean &amp; fresh.  I would recoment it to everone.</li>
    <li> There has been a lot of info lately on the correlation between poor oral health and other ailments such as heart disease. The purchase and use of this item will insure healthy gums and teeth. We all have one original set of teeth, so careful maintenance is required. You could avoid other problems with the continued use of this item.</li>
    <li> I recently got braces and purchased one of these on the advice of a friend who just had braces removed. I could not believe how clean my teeth got. My teeth have always been very crowded and hard to floss between so I wouldn&#x27;t floss. Trying to floss around the braces was even worse - I just stopped doing it all together. I started using this and my dentist was amazed at the difference it has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pulsing warm water really soothes my sore gums after an adjustment of my braces. This also makes cleaning my braces very quick and easy - it gets all the food out of the braces and really makes my mouth feel clean - every time I brush and use the Waterpik, it feels like I just left the dentist. Combine this with a sonic toothbrush and you will be really surprised at how clean your mouth can be. I noticed that there were parts of my gums that the toothbrush was not cleaning well - when using the Waterpik, I have found small pockets of bacteria that have a very bad taste but get rinsed clean with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed, I asked my boyfriend to try it and he loves it too - he adds a cap of Listerine to the warm water and says his mouth really feels clean and fresh afterwards. All of the included tips are great. If you&#x27;ve never used a Waterpik though, you can make a huge mess. Also, the first few times you use it, the reservoir will seem like it&#x27;s too small. After a few uses and you get the \\&quot;trick\\&quot; of using it, it should be just right - I can clean the inside of my teeth, the outside AND my braces with one use on the 6 or 8 setting. You might want to start at a lower setting until you get used to it - the pulses can be painful. I&#x27;ll never go back to just brushing!</li>
    <li> I really like this Waterpik. It&#x27;s got a great assortment of tools. The reservoir holds the plenty of water...and it a shoots a very powerful stream of water.</li>
    <li> My dentist insisted I start using a device like this in order to prevent gum disease.  I had used one about 40 years ago and got water all over the bathroom.  However, this model seems to prevent that.  I am quite pleased with the ease of use.  I hope it does the trick as my dentist predicts.</li>
    <li> I used my Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet for the first time this afternoon. It felt wonderful and my mouth has that \\&quot;just cleaned by the dental hygenist look and feel.\\&quot; I think I haven&#x27;t bought one before now because the old units look so clumsy, unattractive, and like something I&#x27;d find in a retirement home. This new design is what sold me on this product. Too bad I missed out on the results because of the former lousy designs.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I ran through two reservoirs of lukewarm water exploring the settings and using the tongue attachment. It&#x27;s not a big deal to add more water. Also, I don&#x27;t understand why people leave water in the unit when they aren&#x27;t using it. The instructions I received with the unit clearly say to empty it after use. If empty, there should be no leakage problem from sitting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, if one reads the simple instructions, it works great. Originally, I didn&#x27;t read how to insert the tips into the holder and was disturbed at how loosely they fit. Then, I read the instructions and no problem. I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the unit as well as the design. Really a great product.</li>
    <li> I love the new styling of this water-pik. It fits perfectly in the space I have. It seems more powerful than the other water-piks I have had</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! Anyone that has teeth that are very close together will really love this product. I always had difficulty flossing between some of my teeth because they were tight together. This water jet gets everything and leaves your mouth feeling like you just had a cleaning at the dentist. Tip: For a real refreshing cleaning put a cap full of your favorite mouth wash in the reservoir.</li>
    <li> Pros: I found the WP-100 to be a good value for the price. It&#x27;s easy to use with plenty of power, [I haven&#x27;t used the high setting yet]. This kit provides an easy way for cleaning between teeth and the tooth &amp; gum. A plus is the kit comes with a variety of jets.    Con: As others have noted; the plastic hose could be longer. The user has to stay fairly close to the unit so as not to strain the line.  Also the jets are stored in the tank top which is isn&#x27;t attached to the tank. I would&#x27;ve preferred a hinged top and a jet holder on the side of the unit. I consider both of these issues to be minor.    Usage: I use the water jet 4-5x a week and my gums rarely bleed if ever as they did before. I add a little hydrogen-peroxide to warm water and rinse out any bacteria below the gum line, [caution note: this solution is never to be swallowed].   HTH</li>
    <li> I must say I always wanted one and finally got one and  love it</li>
    <li> The only thing I hate worse than flossing is a flossing lecture from my dentist. She recently switched to a high-pressure water cleaning system instead of the old-fashioned metal scraper so I thought I&#x27;d try it at home. Boy was I surprised! It&#x27;s actually fun to use and feels good! After two weeks of use my neglected teeth felt like they had just had a professional cleaning! You know that feeling, when you leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning? You can feel the space between your teeth and the sharp edge of your teeth with the tip of your tongue. My teeth feel like that every day now! I was not expecting anything near this good. Need I say more? Oh yes, no more bleeding. The only thing I have not mastered is the tongue scraper. I have used an Oralgiene electronic tongue scraper for several years and prefer it as of now. But I will give the Waterpik scraper another try. I bought my W-100 on sale here for $40 but even if it cost three times that much I would gladly pay it now that I have tested it. I prefer it to the best electronic toothbrush as far as results for the money. Of course I use both.</li>
    <li> This product was great out of the box but it broke and leaked all over the place after less than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the previous waterpik because the hose on the old one gave out and, apparently, there is no way to repair it.  Because of the design of the new one, the height of the pik obstructs the door of the medicine cabinet and it is a hassle.  Also the water well holds a much smaller quantity meaning it has to be refilled during each use.  Not happy with this one although it is more expensive than the previous model.</li>
    <li> After using this product my mouth has never felt cleaner!  Beware of the short cord though.  I feel I need to look in a mirror while using to see where I&#x27;m aiming.  My bathroom sink has no counter top around it.  The first night I was trying to balance it on the edge of the sink and the cord that attaches to the unit is not long enough - I ended up dumping the reservoir of water all over the bathroom.  I will need to buy a stand that is the right height.  Anyway, the product is great if you have a good surface to set it on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 9 months now.  Overall, it is an excellent product.  The power control is a very handy feature.  Don&#x27;t get an oral irrigator without it.  Also, this has a nice large tank which turns out to be essential also.  I have to fill it twice to do my whole mouth.  Of course, the higher the power setting the faster you use up water.  I set it to 5 (midway) and I need 2 tankfulls for my whole mouth.    Overall, it works well, is effective and well worth the price.  It gets behind my wisdom teeth well.  An area that no brush can reach.    The only thing is that it takes getting used to.  You can&#x27;t look in the mirror while using it because if your mouth is open, it will spray all over the mirror and bathroom.  As directed, you have to close your mouth, put your head facing down in the sink, and let the water drool out of your mouth.  This makes it difficult to know where the water is shooting in your mouth.  However, after a few days, you get the feel of it and learn how to position the head.    Wish the cord was a little longer.    Recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like my new Waterpik W-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet.  The on/off is easy to use.  The dial is easy to use to change the pressure.  It cleans up nicely and holds a decent amount of water.  It came with plenty of choices of attachments so I&#x27;m set for a while!</li>
    <li> Very cheap and fragile piece of junk.  Noisy, messy and obnoxious.  We broke one of the tips right away.  Went to the water pik website to order replacement parts.  That was a real maddening experience.  They charged me $12 for a cheap, tiny plastic part and ended up sending the wrong part. Then they want me to pay to send it back, even though they agree it was their mistake.  No phone number listed on their website so good luck getting to speak with anyone and the email takes about 2 days to get a response.  The only thing worse than this product was the customer service.</li>
    <li> Product setup is very easy.  You need to remember to push the water holding tank firmly onto the base otherwise there will be no water flow.  Unit is very easy to use and keep clean.  Adjustments very simple but meet all requirements.</li>
    <li> I was never able to floss my teeth. No matter how hard I tried, and whatever products I used, either it did not work for me or I gave up the process after a short time. But not with the waterpik. I am using it daily and loving it. First, it is very easy to set up and use. Second, my whole mouth feels so much better after using it. And third, I used to have gum problems regularly, but not since I started to use the waterpik.    My only concern is with the reliability of the product. I had a previous model of the waterpik for just over a year and the pump stopped working one day. I hope it does not happen again with this one.</li>
    <li> This water pik works very well, you can set pressure, has a hand stop on the handle to pausee the flow and comes with 9 different tips one for every occassion.</li>
    <li> Okay, I would have given this 5 stars, but it failed after 4 months.  I had the exact same problem a previous reviewer here had: water started leaking from the handle around the tip-eject button.  Water would still come out of the tip but at very low pressure and increasing the power did not help as it would just leak faster. A few days before the leak happened, the tip became noticeably harder to insert into the handle.  If you eject the tip and look down the insertion hole in the handle with a flashlight, you may see a warped black thing that looks out-of-place.  This is the rubber o-ring seal that has become dislodged from the slot that holds it in place.    FIX: Luckily I was able to fix it, for now at least.  Since it seems impossible to disassemble the handle without breaking it, you need to somehow slide the o-ring back into place.  This was a royal pain to do and took about an hour, though I hope to do it faster if it ever breaks again. If you&#x27;re interested, here&#x27;s what to do:  You&#x27;ll need to straighten out a paper clip, then put a tiny 90 degrees bend at the end, the smallest you can manage using say needle-nose pliers.  Assuming you don&#x27;t have 3 hands, you&#x27;ll need to position a flashlight (hands-free) so that it shines on the side of the handle near the top (say, around the eject button); if it&#x27;s bright enough at the right place, the light will penetrate the handle enough for you to see the interior when you look down the hole.  Insert the paper clip and try to nudge down or hook upwards the o-ring back into its indention.  If you hook it, you can pull it all the way out if you want, then push it back in.  Try to get one side of the o-ring to fall in, then pull the other side into place.  You&#x27;ll need to have an idea where the slot is first.  Use the paper clip to feel around for it.  It should be a little past the gate that holds the tip in place (the ejection button raises it).    This is harder than it looks, but now it&#x27;s back to working perfectly.  My guess is that every once in a while, an insertion or ejection of the tip accidentally pulls the o-ring out of place, so perhaps gentler handling is in order.  To read about others with similar problems, type \\&quot;ring\\&quot; or \\&quot;handle leak\\&quot; in the \\&quot;Search Customer Reviews\\&quot; box found on this page.    Otherwise, this thing has been convenient to use, featured a nice design look, and otherwise has been reliable (no other leaks).  It has plenty of power.  I keep it set just above the lowest setting as anything higher is painful.  It&#x27;s supposed to have a 2-year warranty and there is a customer service phone number in the manual in case it isn&#x27;t on their website, though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a waterpix for 15 years and this one has met all my expectations. Came with all the extras - Small enough to leave on top of my bathroom vanity and large enough to do the job. All the tools store in the top of the units&#x27; handy storage compartment.... Preasure is stronger than most units out there and adjustable.... Would reccomend to all... The  Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet--- - If You Like Your Teeth, Buy It !!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this unit.  A great improvement over previous available units.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago and loved it. Best dental exams I&#x27;ve ever had! Unfortunately, after some years the tips cracked and I was unable to find replacements. When I saw this I knew I had to have it. Still as good as the old one in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about. It does its job in cleaning your mouth.  It&#x27;s a good value for those who want to avoid dental issues down the line (prevention).</li>
    <li> This makes teeth cleaning very addicting because of how clean your teeth feel.  Even if I&#x27;m tired at the end of the day I use the waterpik faithfully, where as before with regular flossing I would normally just skip it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and it has lived up to all my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone..</li>
    <li> This is the second unit I bought. My first one is more than a year old and it is still working fine. I use some Listerine with the Waterpik. The dentist found improvement in my gum during the last two visits. I have no bleeding when I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> We have the electric tooth brushes in house and motor home. The Water pik is a benificial add to our attempt at a healty mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently taken a visit to the dentist.  For the first time in my life, I&#x27;ve actually had some spots where I would have cavities.  Before I had good dental hygiene, always brushing well and never had a problem with cavities.  My dentist recommended I tried using the Waterpik to help floss where the braces get in the way.      Like everyone says, after you brush and you think your mouth is clean, use this and like magic food bits come flying out.  Although I don&#x27;t think this can replace flossing, it does help a great amount, especially for those with braces.</li>
    <li> After having this waterpik, flossing is no longer a trouble for me. instead, every night, I would look forward to using it. I usually brush first before using the waterpik to see how much more &#x27;left-over&#x27; it can find - it turn out it did help me to drive those tiny things between my teeth. I feel so much refresher after using it, and my dentist just praise me about how good I did with my flossing work. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Hope you like dealing with customer service, if you plan to actually use this product, expect it to fail within a month.  If you plan to let it sit next to your sink, I would highly recommend this product.  The handle is the weak link in the design, we have been through a pile of these things!</li>
    <li> Great item! Looking for the one fits 220V for travel use, but, still haven&#x27;t found out where to buy!</li>
    <li> Pros: strong pressure, good assortment of tools, easy and straight forward to use, compact size    Cons: stream shut-off button sticks in off position often, could use 90 degree water tool, pressure stream is always on when machine is on unless one depresses blue shut-off button on hand tool    Be prepared to squirt water everywhere when you first start using this model.  That said, maybe the same would be true for all \\&quot;waterpik\\&quot; type hygiene tools.  But does average consumer buy several to test to see which is best?  Even though there are some cons, spending money on cleaning your teeth is money well spent.  My dental hygienist recommended that I use some sort of waterpik type tool to aid in my tooth care and it has been worth every cent.  I wish I had began using a tool such as this long long ago.    Happy Teeth!</li>
    <li> I never enjoyed flossing my teeth, but I have absolutely enjoyed using the Waterpik to blast food particles from between, beneath and on top of my teeth. It&#x27;s a lot more fun and , to me, more efficient. I also think it is better for my gums as they do not sem to injure them as much.I use the Waterpik several times a day, even to wash between my teeth and beneath my gums with mouthwash. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, easy way to effectively clean their teeth several times per day!</li>
    <li> The water pressure is lower than I expected. However, it is adequate if you use the narrow, pointed nozzle. Other than that, it&#x27;s well constructed, and mine hasn&#x27;t leaked as others have reported.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Reasonable price for a quality waterpik.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - This was my first oral irrigator and I absolutely liked it.    The only con: After a month of use, it no longer develops instantaneous pressure. I need to wait for ten to fifteen seconds before it pumps up and sprays water. Not sure what&#x27;s causing that and haven&#x27;t bothered to call them up and ask.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month once a day and this device works great. The tongue cleaner came with is useless and it does not work. I am rating this product 4 star only for useless tongue cleaner and I do not know the durability of it at this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of similar items, but this one is my favorite.  I had a bleeding gum problem, but after a week of using this at a lower level, then upping the pressure, I no longer have that problem.  In fact, my visit to the dentist was better than normal!  This unit is small and just the right size water reservoir.  I highly recommend this unit!</li>
    <li> This is the best waterpik product that is for sale.  It is so much easier to keep the equipment clean than previous models. I recommend this for everyone who cares about good dental health.</li>
    <li> Never use traditional floss again. This thing works wonders and is quick. It&#x27;ll even strengthen your gums.</li>
    <li> Excellent way to get close to a dental cleaning...every day! Just don&#x27;t turn up the dial too high until you know what is best for you.</li>
    <li> This is the first Waterpik I&#x27;ve owned and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. Gone are the days of getting dental floss stuck in my teeth. This product does a great job of getting into every nook and cranny and removing food particles. It has several pressure settings but I find that I don&#x27;t need to use a setting higher that 2 to get the job done.    It includes a number of picks including a tongue cleaner which I find invaluable. I used to use a tongue scraper which irritated my tongue, but this one does a better job with no irritation or gagging.    I found that the water reservoir is just the right size to clean my teeth without having to stop to refill (don&#x27;t bother purchasing a Waterpik with a smaller reservior, it will be too small).     I resently developed tonsil stones (food build up) in the pocket surrounding one of my tonsils causing an infection. I tried cleaning the pocket with q-tips but couldn&#x27;t get all thet way back into the crevice&#x27;s so I tried my Waterpik. In no time at all it cleaned ever speck of food build up and the irritation is gone and my tonsil is healing. This alone was worth the purchase.     I&#x27;ll be interested to get feedback from my dentist during my next visit to see if he notices an improvement. My guess is that he will.    I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in improving their oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Powerful water jet and great attachments provide a thorough cleansing.  Great purchase and the kids enjoy using it too.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am satisfy with Waterpik Jet.  although the tank is small, but I don&#x27;t see that as a problem.  just adding water few times in 1 use, other wise it works great and makes me feel good about my oral hygiene.  I like it alot</li>
    <li> First it was great.   I started at 1 pressure then now I am up to 10 pressure.  Your gums do improve and gets stronger.  My mouth do feel cleaner after every use.  Be careful on your first use, since water will get everywhere.  One problem, the button on the handle gets stuck. It&#x27;s very annoying!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Rinsing with this gives the most clean feeling you can get.  Plaque seems to be less of a concern as well.  I wish it were smaller to take on vacation with me.</li>
    <li> I have seen an improvement in my gum and know the Waterpik has made an difference.</li>
    <li> It works great.  It does what it is supposed to, but the part that holds the handle in place cracks apart and breaks quickly.  I had to use velcro to make it stay.  As with most things these days that are poorer quality versions of what they used to be, this is made in china.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I&#x27;ve recently added a Water-Pik Ultra to my oral hygiene regimen, and I really love the results.  My mouth feels great ALL the time. While I also switched to an Oral B 9400 electric toothbrush ([[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]])I feel that the Water-Pik makes a significant contribution to the improvement in how my gums feel and I won&#x27;t ever be without either of these tools again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. We like the way everything stores in the cover.  the unit doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the sink. Some of the accessories like the tongue cleaner and the dental pik were tried a quickly discarded as junk. would have liked more jet tips.</li>
    <li> I had my last WaterPik for nearly 15 years. I didn&#x27;t use it nightly - perhaps once a week. But I&#x27;m getting older and gum/teeth care has become more important (it should have been important all along!!) I thought I was doing a good job with flossing and use of a Sonicare, but not so. I started using the old Waterpik regularly, and last week, it gave up the ghost. I started searching, and Amazon had the best price, plus free shipping and the $10 off coupon. I didn&#x27;t bother comparing other brands - Waterpik makes a good machine.    I was very pleasantly surprised - this model is more compact, more attractive (which means it gets left on the countertop and used nightly!!) and is quieter than my old model. I love the various attachments, particularly the pictip. I also like the storage compartment - everything nicely in one place. The resevoir is big enough and easily refilled if you need more water. And the pressure? Wow! Pressure to spare and so easily adjustable. Overall, a great improvement over my last, very faithful, Waterpik. Nice to see a company keep all the good features and add new ones. I liked this so well I ordered a second one for my son.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with the product, just that over the years Waterpik products tend to become a little less performing with each new generation, I just wish there was someone else out there that would make such products and give a little competition to Waterpik and light a fire under their butt.    /Nick</li>
    <li> WaterpiK is the best thing that happened to Dental health since the Toothbrush was invented.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]  If you want to ensure that you will NOT have gum disease in the future, purchase one of these and use it religiously.  My dentist told me that I have sav ed my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Next to going to the dentist&#x27;s office, this devise is the best product for keeping gums and teeth in good shape.    Anne Meteyard</li>
    <li> I was at first attracted to the [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]] to use in the shower but a common review theme was the need for frequent refills during use and poor engineering.  I therefore turned to the WP-100 countertop model featuring a much larger resevoir.  With a month experience I quickly learned how not squirt water all over the bathroom and overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it.  The wide range of jet strength settings is great.  I add a little mouthwash to the resevoir for a nice clean feeling after use and I typically use a whole resevoir of this solution during one cleaning.  The unit comes with two of the standard jet tips which is enough for me but it also includes several other specialized tips that some will find useful.  The only minor shortcoming in my opinion is the blue button that temporarily stops the jet while it is pressed.  It would be nice to have an on/off valve on the handle instead of the momentary press-off valve, but this is a minor point and I quickly got used to the momentary off button. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be far more superior to other water pick devices I have used.  The device has different settings to allow you to change settings as your needs arise.  In the beginning it is suggested that you use use a lower setting, as time goes on you can increase the setting.  I found the product to be much more than I expected it to be.  I purchased this product for my Son who is a college student.  He tells me it is one of the best gifts I have ever given him. This device has helped him to achieve better dental hygiene.  The product is easy to use, and the directions are simple to understand. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good Water pick device to improve their oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Not exactly like a dentist&#x27;s (minus the suction of course! ) very useful tool if you use regularly and properly!</li>
    <li> I have gum disease and the Waterpik Ultra really helps. It cleans and removes food particles and plaque. I love all of the attachments.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner and works perfectly.  It was much cheaper than other places that  l checked</li>
    <li> Used the Flosser for a few times, pretty easy to use. It is a little noisy. No big problems. Surprised at the food residues that came out of my mouth even after I brushed and flossed (manually).</li>
    <li> I brought it for my daughter who has braces she loves and says it works great I would recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Rarely a product these days fulfills the hype on the box. This simple device actually does what it says it does, and does this very well at a very reasonable cost (partly because of the low tech nature of the design I guess). I am a first time user of this device, in fact I&#x27;ve never heard of it before till I bumped into the display at a local Costco the other day. The results blew me away and I never looked back! This thing rocks! It caused my gum to bleed a little for about 10 days. At it&#x27;s worst I had to take pain killers all day. But once that&#x27;s gone, my teeth never feels this good, tight, solid, and clean. Now I use the maximum jet strength and it works fantastically well for me. The device is not an engineering marvel by any measure. But it&#x27;s solid enough to get the work done well. The vibration is great addition to the water jet. Very smart design indeed! Comparing to all those fancy but do nothing designs of the shavers, blades, brand name batteries and whatever else just to trick a few more bucks for the general public, this thing is a honest-to-gawd great idea. I mentioned this to my dentist and he has never heard of it. Wonder why. My wife is not a fan of mechanical devices, much less the ones with big noise. But she was sold after her first try! She got her brace on and it has been a pain in the - for her to clean her teeth for a very long time. Now she said she&#x27;s giving up on the floss and use this instead. She even brought the wireless one to her office for use after lunch! I am still using my floss, tooth brush and Waterpik together.    Thanks, Waterpik!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product. The on/off switch has changed from the past model which was much better. The tips are easy to change and you receive a wide assortment. I&#x27;d recommend this product.    Dennis</li>
    <li> I had a Waterpik as a child.  I looked into getting one once again after getting tired of hearing the dental hygienist criticize my poor flossing habits (I flossed every other day, but not well apparently).  I really like this thing.  I add some Listerine to the water and it is refreshing.  It appears that my teeth are staying cleaner than usual since my last cleaning.  If I try to floss after using the Waterpik, I get absolutely no plaque (none!) on the floss, so that also confirms to me that it is doing a good job.  It can be a little messy (watch where you&#x27;re pointing the tip when you have it set on 10, or it will shoot across the room!), but you get used to it.  The \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button on the handle helps save on messes.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  Try all of the tips that come with it.  The only tip I like myself is the blue one (the green one is the same, just a different color).</li>
    <li> WHAT MORE CAN I SAY, I LOVE IT.  It helps remove particles that ar emissed with flossing.</li>
    <li> Most of us just hate having anything stuck between our teeth after finishing a great meal. I know, I just have to remove whatever&#x27;s there immediately! Knowing how frustrating a toothpick can be, I prefer something better. The Waterpik is just fantastic for the purpose, it&#x27;s like a water cannon against stuck-in-your-teeth debris. I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this with extra tips for my kids but I have found I love it too even though I am a pretty good flosser!  Much easier once you get the hang of it.  Got soaked a few times but of well.  Like the high speed to get into the gums and all, clean in quads on this setting to avoid drowning.  Kids will have braces eventually so I think we will get good use out of this.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> My old hygienist told me not to use a waterpik.  My new one says she highly recommends one.  So I bought this unit.  My wife and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It comes with a ton of different flossing tips - although I really only use one of them.  It has plenty of pressure behind it.  Has been working strong for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a little tip - fill with warm water, pour some mouth wash in the water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide.  Will do a good cleaning for you.</li>
    <li> After using the cordless travel waterpik for years, I thought I would try the plug in kind. That was a mistake. After the first few uses, it stopped working. I turn it on and hear the unit whirring, but no water comes out. I was going to return it but had such faith in the product, I didn&#x27;t keep the box. I ordered 3 more cordless waterpiks and although charging them is a pain, at least they work and the spray is powerful. Now, if they could just make a purse-size cordless so I can carry it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with my husband in mind, as he has a lot of cavities that are in the process of being filled. He really loves it for flushing them out gently until all his dental procedures are complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself have been using this twice a day. I feel that only the highest level really does much. I think the lower settings are more suited for irrigating large pieces of food out. Just be careful when starting out on setting ten! My gums bled the first use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely with a passion hate to floss. It happens very sporadically. This water flosser has been a help in my dental hygiene and care. It is so easy to use that I sometimes use it 3 time in a day. It makes it very easy to clean your teeth after a meal and my floss string can be used to tie things up now.</li>
    <li> Waterpik could use more pressure, comes with only one mouth pik &amp; a bunch of useless pik accessories (tongue pik. braces pik, etc.). I&#x27;d rather have 4 individual  mouth piks &amp; buy the useless accessory pack on my own. It&#x27;s a way to make you spend more money on something that should have been included (unless your family wants to share one pik). A nice looking unit &amp; does the job, but disappointed with only one single pik.</li>
    <li> Excellent, quality tool. The different pressure settings are wonderful. Makes a big difference with my teeth and gums.  It takes a little getting used to so that you don&#x27;t squirt water all over, but then it is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I really like it! I have braces and its great removing food from my braces, but the pressure isn&#x27;t consistent. I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Great item to have and price was good, however I bought one too many and had to return one.</li>
    <li> I would strongly consider this product. My dentist recommended it and it works great, just takes some getting use to it..</li>
    <li> It works as described on the brochure and totally serves the purpose. Only had to use one of the tool heads</li>
    <li> This is a real improvement in terms o great dental hygiene.  It is like a little pressure washer for your teeth and you can adjust the pressure.  Takes only a couple of times to get used to it.  I use every day.  There are several types of heads on it.  I just use the same one.  The water reservoir could be a little bigger.  But you will see that flossing does not get everything, so finish up with this gizmo</li>
    <li> Last of the old model. Can&#x27;t compare it to the new one, but I know I like this</li>
    <li> Great product gets the Job done. Leave my mouth feeling super clean. Especially great for those with gum problems. Happy customer</li>
    <li> I bought this after years of hearing from others how great it is.  I didn&#x27;t think much about it until my hygienist recommended it.  I will never go back to pre-Waterpic days (floss).</li>
    <li> My 14 y.o. got braces, so knew this was a necessity (having owned an old version of the WaterPik as a youth when I had my braces.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his use there at my ex-wife&#x27;s house, and my trying it out and loving it, bought a matching one for our house too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after every meal when I&#x27;m at home.</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations.... nice product, easy to use after some practice, easy to store.  I&#x27;ve only had this product for a short time, but do really like it.  I compared prices and other reviews and because of so many possitive reviews, went with this product and name brand.</li>
    <li> I researched the Waterpik because my dental hygienist recommended I use one.  She said it is more effective than actual flossing.  Many years ago I had one when I broke my jaw and my teeth were wired shut.  So I basically knew what they were about and what they did.  I like the fact that the water reservoir is covered as it sits on the vanity,  we have cats; enough said!  The machine operates very well and does what it should.  I don&#x27;t use all the picks but seeing as I wanted a covered container I have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik is a good brand and I am looking forward to many years with this unit.</li>
    <li> This gets material from between my teeth even after I have brushed with a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, I hate dental floss, but use this every day.</li>
    <li> I would give a 5-star rating.  It was recommended by my dentist and we gladly purchase other Waterpik.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Definitely easier and more fun than flossing, especially with any leftover bars from braces etc. Not sure if it really works as well as flossing but it definitely removes food from between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I have a Hydro-floss &amp; had heard that the Waterpik was better.  I am sorry that I bought this even though it serves the purpose.  My Hydrofloss has more pressure &amp; is easier to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I don&#x27;t have much experience with water flossers but so far the Waterpik WP-100W is proving to be a great product. I had it about a week now and it leaves my mouth feeling very clean, I was thoroughly impressed after my first go at it. I was bit hesitant about buying something bulky for my small bathroom but it&#x27;s surprisingly compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all... another plus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a great product to use for maintenance, cleanings between the dentist cleanings. I do find it&#x27;s much more effective than using standard dental floss but I use both anyway, probably overkill but I&#x27;m just not ready to let go of my floss picks :).. Oh I&#x27;m also using this with a tarter dissolving oral rinse which can go into the WP-100W and is good for under the gum cleanings. It&#x27;s called Periogen and is available here on Amazon as well. The rinse makes my mouth feel \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; although it probably isn&#x27;t :) but it sure does feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh yea, the instructions say \\&quot;do NOT turn ON unless the flosser is in your mouth\\&quot;... yea... definitely adhere to that... the water sprays out as soon as it turns on... I learned the hard way. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ll use it till one of us dies. Purchased to replace the older one I had, which I out lived.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever had! Button on handle to shut off water flow is great improvement. Motor is quieter than previous.</li>
    <li> I guess it works okay, but I really wish I didn&#x27;t have to use it. I don&#x27;t have time to write extensive reviews on everything I buy.</li>
    <li> I used this for a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I only use the standard tip and I just tossed the rest of them out once I decided to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use water in this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this machine after a dentist visit for cleaning. I had some sensitivity issues.  They said I had some receding gums and I needed to keep my teeth cleaned and flossed to let them heal.  I skipped my next dentist visit 6 months later due to time constraints.  After a little more than a year I returned to the dentist for my next cleaning.  The hygienist said that I just had a very light build up and whatever I was doing to keep doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning routine I usually use is as follows.  I brush my teeth in the morning, use the water flosser, rinse with full strength hydrogen peroxide followed by a rinse with listerine.  Before bed sometimes I don&#x27;t brush but I do use the water flosser and a rinse with the listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe my 45 year old gums are healthier because of the machine and my cleaning routine.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I hoped it would be. Works great and so easy to use. Can&#x27;t believe how much better it is than floss.</li>
    <li> Use it every morning. I add a shot of mouth wash to the reservoir. Makes for a more pleasant experience. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> We got this at the recommendation of our orthodontist and it has helped get the tough spots where flossing is impossible.  The other kids enjoy it as well and I figure the more they do for their teeth the better.  No leaks or problems and we have had it for about 2 months.</li>
    <li> This item really does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without being too graphic, every time I use it (AFTER brushing) I see that it has dislodged a number of food particles that would otherwise be decaying my teeth all night. Sometimes it causes a little gum bleeding, but only for a moment - not painful and not harmful (I should be toughening my gums by brushing harder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip on remembering to use it regularly: it&#x27;s also great for blasting caked debris out from disposable razors - I get several days from one with daily cleaning, rather than just one or two days. Be sure to tap the razor dry after such cleaning to keep it sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, do not let the &amp;#34;power tip&amp;#34; hang down below the unit, or it will siphon water onto your floor.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product arrived just before Christmas and was just what my wife wanted.  I would recommend this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have used the Waterpik several times now and find it to be exactly as described and what I needed for dental cleaning.  It is very simple to operate and seems well built.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three other water jet devices in my day, and so when I bought this I thought it was just a humdrum affair.  But I was really pleasantly surprised by the features and the size and the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must not have read the description well before purchasing (I mainly look at the stars and reviews to compare to other items), so I was pleasantly surprised to see the tips were cleverly stored in the lid.  I really like the toothbrush tip.  My only complaint here is that there&#x27;s one tip that doesn&#x27;t fit in the lid (even when keeping a tip on the wand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is very nice.  Not too big, not too small.  I thought it was going to be larger from the description, but I was pleasantly surprised how little room it takes on the counter.  The water reservoir holds plenty of water, so you never have to stop and refill.  The instructions say you can use mouthwash, etc. in the water, so that&#x27;s a nice thing.</li>
    <li> We love this waterpik it is wonderful. I bought it for my daughter that has braces ! She loves it too</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed, I hate flossing and its hard for me to do because I have a permanent metal piece holding my teeth in line so they dont move so much from having braces! Very hard to clean that area which is mainly the reason I bought this product.  I couldnt wait for it to come in the mail and as soon as it did I used it right away and I was amazed at how well it did. My teeth felt healthier right away and seem to clean up the plaque build up I had around that metal piece on the back of my front teeth. It can see it making a difference already and cant wait to use it every night.  Best money I&#x27;ve spent in awhile! Who would have thought a simple thing of shooting water at your teeth to clean them would work so well! Thanks waterpik for making a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint I have is that there isn&#x27;t enough slots to put all the tips in the top of the water tank but I can get past that!</li>
    <li> This is a great water flooser. It is gently clean the tooth. I Advice Every One I Know</li>
    <li> I use it daily and performs as expected.</li>
    <li> This works good!  Mouth feels clean and gums are healthy and pink.  I add essential oils or iodine drips for extra cleaning, disinfecting.  Gets in all the hardest to reach places!</li>
    <li> Works great, best thing since sliced bread.</li>
    <li> I love the water pik.  My new dentist recommended it.  Don&#x27;t know why the old one never did.  I have had noticable improvements in gum health is less than a month.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I expected and wanted.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought the same type I had before.  Works great, not too noisy.</li>
    <li> We love it, nicely made and I like the fact it hold more water than the wireless one does.</li>
    <li> Great and better alternative flosser. Must have.</li>
    <li> A little loud, other than that pretty good.</li>
    <li> This was a fine purchase, if my intention was to only use it twice before the motor burned out and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik because I have periodontal disease and was told by my dentist that I needed to clean better using this device.  He was right!  It works great.  Having 6 tips included in the package is a plus, I use three of them daily.  Never thought I would actually clean my tongue but with the correct attachment it is easy and works well.  My gums had developed pockets of 6+ and were sore but after using this for a week with the pocket tip they felt almost normal.  Works best after flossing.  Not much water runs down your hand/arm; I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t very messy.  Brushing is a snap afterwards.  Would definitely recommend this water flosser.</li>
    <li> So Good I bought another for my wife! I agree with some of the feedback. It comes with several tips, most of which I&#x27;ll never use. But, someone might so I guess that&#x27;s why they included them. The storage lid stores all but the one in use and the Tongue tool. It&#x27;s pressure is great on high setting and the reservoir holds enough water/mouthwash to do a thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> Product ships really fast. This waterpik really cleans your teeth. I clean my teeth with the waterpik everyday and before dental appointments and my dentist complemented on the hygene of my teeth. Its just as clean as getting it professionally done by a dentist at a fraction of the price. Definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I replaced a very old waterpik. This new one is much quieter and has adjustable pulse rate on the base, which is much easier to adjust than having it on the handle. The water reservoir is blue transparent so you see how much is in it, and the cover opens to store the interchangable tips, protecting them from dust. All of it in a compact design for counter space saving.      My only concern is there is only one of each type tip.  We have two people using the appliance and would have liked at least two of the basic tip.  I&#x27;ve not been able to find replacement tips locally where the Waterpik is sold; will have to order online.    Overall, it is an excellant value.  The cheapest price I found was on Amazon.com and included free shipping.</li>
    <li> We got this Waterpik after my 12 year old boy flunked his first check up after getting braces. The dentist read him the riot act and suggested to my husband that we get him a Waterpik since he wasn&#x27;t doing too good a job keeping his braces clean (glad I didn&#x27;t take the kid to the dentist that time -- how embarrassing.)Anyway, the Waterpik was easy for my son to use and he doesn&#x27;t mind using it, although he has to be reminded sometimes. Anyway, by the next check-up, the dentist said the braces looked much better and told my son that he was doing a good job keeping his braces clean. Yeah! A $4,000 investment is worth caring for. I started using it too and found that it gets my teeth cleaner than just flossing and using an electric brush. Keeps the breath fresher too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I hated flossing, but the waterpik is a joy to use. If you&#x27;ve never used one, it is super simple BUT it can be a little messy. You are irrigating your mouth under pressure. That water has to go somewhere. It is amazing the first few times you realize what is left between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 critiques. 1)The lid which holds the extra picks is more of an encumbrance.  You have to take it off to fill water canister and it isn&#x27;t the easiest to replace with one hand. It isn&#x27;t that it does not fit, it just fits perfectly. If you sit it incorrectly...SPLASH right into the water canister.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is a valve on the bottom of the water canister that is spring loaded. The idea is when you set the canister on the machine it pushes the valve up and the water is fed through the machine. After about a month I notices when I removed the canister that the valve would not shut completely. Because of this when you fill the canister water would leak out the bottom. One would think &amp;#34;okay just quickly put it on the machine&amp;#34; but that is bad idea as when you do the water overflows the lip of the machine and soaks the unit. The real problem here is it makes the rubber feet slick and the machine won&#x27;t sit still when you try to use it. It slides all over. Now my solution is easy. Whenever I remove the canister I reach in and physically push the valve down. Perfect? No. Workable? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is a great unit.</li>
    <li> I have been brushing carefully and regularly with both a regular toothbrush and an Oral B Electric brush. I also floss nightly. My teeth have been feeling really clean, but on my last visit to dentist for cleaning, my gums were still not doing well. I had a few pockets and some areas were receding slightly. The hygienist suggested the Waterpik so I ordered one from Amazon. I now run two tanks of water through it morning and night after brushing and flossing. It is amazing how good my mouth feels after the Waterpik.     My only complaint is that the water storage tank should be at least 2x as big and 3 to 4x would be even nicer. If you have never used one of these I highly recommend you try one.     It takes a little practice to get the technique down but once you get used to it you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t buy one sooner.</li>
    <li> Had one of the early versions many years ago.  Like this one&#x27;s multiple speeds very much.  It does as it needs to.  The only thing i don&#x27;t care for is that it only has one place outside the lid to set the pick.  I do not care for the lid compartment and would like to place the oicks upright and outside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to flossing and I&#x27;ve maybe flossed 3 times in my whole life.  Besides the being lazy part, I find it very uncomfortable flossing.  After my last dentist visit, she noticed bleeding in the gums and when I told her that I didn&#x27;t floss, she said I would have to start doing it to take care of my teeth and gums.  The same day, I ordered this off Amazon.  Since then, my gums have stopped bleeding and I never get the same pains I did when I didn&#x27;t use this thing.  It&#x27;s excellent at getting all the stuff out of your teeth left over from eating plus I believe it removes unwanted bacteria that builds up.  This, along with the Sonicare toothbrush I bought, my teeth have never felt better.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for cleaning between very tight fitting back molars where floss does not do the trick.  I&#x27;ve also discovered at my last cleaning that there was less plaque buildup as compared to previous years.  WOW!  My last water flosser lasted for two years of daily use so I&#x27;m hoping this one will last as long.  So happy for this product.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, when using this you need to be very conscientious about pointing the tip in the proper direction or you can cause yourself some damage by pushing particles deeper into the gum line which is not the way to get or maintain a healthy mouth. Just be aware of this possible misuse of the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;I would not be without this product.  Best thing I&#x27;ve found to keep the teeth in my small mouth clean on all sides.</li>
    <li> The dental hygienist recently told me I had some \\&quot;5s\\&quot; between gums.  I looked over on their shelf and I see the Water Pic.  I asked if that would help. She said \\&quot;absolutely\\&quot;.  So, I purchased and wow, you should see all of the debris it washes out.............better than flossing.  I can&#x27;t wait to go back to see the look on her face regarding improvement.  Buy this product and do your gums a favor.</li>
    <li> We all know about using a toothbrush twice a day...right. Then there is flossing! ...If I must. Get a life - get a water pik.   Once you start to use this along with brushing at night you will soon feel the smoothness from reduced plaque to the back side of your teeth. Mmm - Small bits of &#x27;debris&#x27; will come flooding out of your mouth from between teeth along with build up just under the gum line. Everyone should use a water pic and cut down on visits to the dentist. I have used various models and this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is excellent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for his birthday. He really likes it also. I think this is a very good item. I would tell People about it when I see them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik after getting adult orthodontics.  I recalled having a Waterpik in my youth and what a great device it was for really cleaning the teeth.    The old units had four attachments for four different people in the household to use, that sat neatly in little peg holes in the base of the unit.  This new model has attachments that I do not use - what I would have preferred is another basic nozzle or pointer or whatever it&#x27;s called for my husband and a neat place to store it.  I just don&#x27;t like the lid with the unnecessary attachments in it.  I think sacrifices were made to make this model ergodynamic and modern looking.  I liked how the old reservoir simply flipped down over the top, the little attachments went in the holes and bingo, you&#x27;re done and it fit square in the corner of the counter.    Either I&#x27;m a better brusher and flosser these days, even with braces, or the new model is also not as good at dislodging bits of food caught in the teeth.  As a child I remember watching all the little bits come flying out.  Of course that is quite likely because I was a child, and not brushing properly in the first place.    Bottom line, it works and I&#x27;m glad I invested in it, but I like the old dinosaur better.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday after eating or if I&#x27;m in a hurry. It still no substitute for flossing. But it&#x27;s a good in between. Also I mix warm water with mouth wash for best results. I think it&#x27;s plenty water pressure.</li>
    <li> Besides being compact, works great, love all the different picks, etc the color goes with the decor in  my bath room -</li>
    <li> great product....well worth the purchase!!!...have used one for years....actually works better than a toothbrush!!!! The price is right and shipping is fast!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here, but while it was great for the 6 months it worked... I just can&#x27;t give this more than 2 stars given how long it lasted.  I might try getting another one, gambling that I just had bad luck (since it seems the manufacturer support in these instances is a complete waste of time), but not sure yet.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a long term supply of replacement pick heads, that&#x27;s for sure.  I read the instructions and it claims there is \\&quot;no maintenance required\\&quot; (which I found a bit odd and too good to be true), so I don&#x27;t know what could be going on. Now when I turn it on it just sits- no sounds, nothing.</li>
    <li> Bought this flosser upon recommendation by my dentist. On receiving the package noticed that a tip was broken. I used it for a week found it to be more of a hassle (and mess) than anything else. The conventional dental floss works the best, floss pick comes next, everything else comes next and then I would rank waterpik.</li>
    <li> PRO:   * Flushes out the gum line pretty well.   * \\&quot;Pause\\&quot; button is nice.  CON:   * Noisy.   * Messy (splatter and misty overspray is inevitable)   * Controls are bit awkward (recessed power dial, and a toggle switch design that requires you grip the entire unit, instead of a toggle where you could grip just the switch itself).   * Top is a smooth plastic accessories-container that doesn&#x27;t say clipped shut, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to drop into the reservoir. Haven&#x27;t found a need for more than one of the tips, and the top won&#x27;t hold all of them ... so, I&#x27;d prefer to store the tips elsewhere, and have a simpler top.   * Using add-in (mouthwash) means using a *lot* since it gets diluted in the water reservoir.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend for anyone that has deep pockets floss cannot reach.  It works great and is compact.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Useful to clean gums; not as high pressured as I would&#x27;ve hoped. Good to use if you have permanent retainer, I suppose.</li>
    <li> I love the waterpik, but the little back doohicky in the bottom of the tank will not seat.  The result is a leaky mess when I try to fill it.  I push down on it, but when I reinsert the tank then it happens again, continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry Mund</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and in good condition.  It works fine but I agree with the other reviewer comments on this being less powerful then the Waterpik we had for the last eight years.  We like our Waterpiks and will get used to this one but would have appreciated the extra power.</li>
    <li> Love my water pick. I have had it for over a month and now I use it at least twice a day. If I skip one day, I feel very uncomfortable.  My gum is no longer bleeding and mouth feels fresh all the time. I&#x27;m very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Does a good job at a good price. I used a different brand for years and this is as good at half the price. Plus i like that the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; are in the top where they will not be lost.</li>
    <li> With 4 permanent bridges and many caps, I needed something that could clean under and between everything and this waterpik certainly fills the bill. With several power settings and a water container that doesn&#x27;t have to be filled more than once, it&#x27;s easy to keep my teeth clean and my gums healthy. I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this purchase (and it was less expensive on Amazon than at my local drug store chains).</li>
    <li> I really like the product. It removes particles that brushing misses. Of course it does not completely replace flossing, but pretty darn close.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this as often as I am sure my periodontist would like, but she is pleased that I have one. I think the perio tip works really well and I am keeping my pockets clean with this device. They realy are serious about using it on the low setting with the perio tip.</li>
    <li> I have braces.  This product is invaluable.  I love it.  I highly recommend it.  I have it set on the mid setting and it is plenty powerful. Many tips to use for different thing. I am highly pleased.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for Christmas gift. Item is for husband, he has an old one and was replacing for him. Hope the quality is as good as the first one purchased years ago.</li>
    <li> It took a little bit getting use to using this Waterpik flosser to control messy sprays and gum pain, but once you&#x27;re use to it, this is another handy tool to keep your teeth and gum clean and healthy.  I can see how people with braces would definitely benefit from this water flosser.  Highly recommend having one in the family.</li>
    <li> Its&#x27;s cleaning out between the teeth everything a toothbrush can&#x27;t get to.  The flow of water is easily adjustable.  It is compact and easy to store when not in use.</li>
    <li> Waterpik flosser.  My friend told me about this and I bought one for myself.  It is really helpful when you eat food that gets stuck in your teeth and brushing doest do the job.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Hate that the water floss head moves. I have to hold it down with my index fingers and thumbs to position. Can&#x27;t just use the handle</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since my sonic toothbrush. It is easy to use, not cumbersome, and sits nicely on the counter. After using this flosser, there is nothing left to floss. My hygienist has already seen a difference in my gums and I have only had it for one month. I am delighted. It arrived on time and was securely packed. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and have recommended this to many people.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. Digging though the drawer for floss has never been part of my routine. The Waterpik is always in sight and is easy (perhaps fun) to use.  I have had it for a month and I have used it twice a day since I got it.  I can feel the difference.  My breath is fresher and my mouth feels cleaner. I&#x27;m not sure how it stacks up to mechanical flossing, but for those that can&#x27;t remember or are just lazy, the Waterpik is a great solution.  I highly recommend it.  Update.. This thing is still great, but I have a bone to pick with the design.  Why give me 6 attachments and then give me only enough space to store 5 of them?  WTF! Plus the storage is on the top of the machine which you have to remove to fill the tank with water.  Its a little annoying, but this thing is still great overall.</li>
    <li> Very strong stream at low settings, easy to operate, and so much cheaper than the Hydro Floss for what seems so far to be the same functionality.  I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> The water Pik is great. It has a huge Well for the water..and different dial settings and it comes with all different piks for your teeth. I teeth are cleaner and breath much fresher. You will not be disappointed. It comes with it own Tooth Brush..never seen one that has it own Tooth Brush..I love it and it is a great buy..you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product arrived the following week, and gave me no problem during the last several months.  Good value for a new product.</li>
    <li> Your product  just leaks all over the sink----I should probably return it, because I find I don&#x27;t use it…..too messyl</li>
    <li> It always finds junk that my toothbrush missed.&lt;br /&gt;Will be getting one for my wife. Recommend it for anyone with tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this - recommended by my dentist and it is exactly what I need for the periodontic work I have had</li>
    <li> works much better than expected!!&lt;br /&gt;an upgrade from our last one.&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;we use it daily.</li>
    <li> This unit is well worth the money.  It keeps your teeth very clean and free from germs.  Using it daily really help when you visit the dentist.</li>
    <li> This is my first product of this type.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go with out one again.  It takes a little practice to use with out making a mess but it is a short learning curve. My mouth and gums fell great after use. I&#x27;m not sure if its good for my gums or not but i always see small particles removed I didn&#x27;t get out by simple gargle or rinse.</li>
    <li> I have had three of these Waterpik products and this one is the best.  Its pause button is tight, that is good, and it functions like it should.  Multiple options for tools.  Glad I got this one to replace my failed one.</li>
    <li> Just when you think you had cleaned out all the remains from between your teeth, the machine did its job and flushed out an incredible amount of debris. The accessories came with the package help to massage the gum (the best effect of the machine and the rest of the mouth.Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Very effective, has enough pressure to clean out those small pesky crevices. Overall, a good step for us in dental health.</li>
    <li> I use the water pic to keep my gums clean and it does the job well  I would recommend it for maintaining good oral hygiene</li>
    <li> I have no complaints&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very easy product to use and gets the job done each time.&lt;br /&gt;well worth it and would recommend.</li>
    <li> This I should have brought years ago.  I must have been in my right mind to have missed the obvious. This is a no brainer buy.  After you use it once, WOW!  First I floss, then use Waterpik, mouthwash, then brush teeth.  Just see what comes from you mouth when you use it, however, more important is the particles that you can&#x27;t see that are still present that feed that bacteria that damage you teeth at and below the gum line, exactly where this gets.  Flossing only get the larger pieces, the small, very, very small stuff is what does the damage. Simple mouth washing is like just getting that piece of clothing wet then move it around with your hands rather then putting it into the washing machine, or  using Waterpik on those gums and teeth. Machine has some noise, not obnoxious, works great and very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to by someone who used it when they had braces. It works great and is easy to use. The power of the water stream is pretty strong and I haven&#x27;t used a number higher than 6. It also comes with a lot of attachments but I&#x27;ve only used a couple of them. The one thing that I really like about the Ultra that I know the other one doesn&#x27;t have is the pause button. I think it would be a pain to have to turn it off instead of being able to pause it. The water reservoir holds a lot of water.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the same product that I&#x27;ve had about 8 years. The cord must have dried out, it just cracked and broke off. The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as potent but otherwise the same and I love it.  Much better than the style with the small reservoir mixed with air.</li>
    <li> the sensation of clean it is amazing, use water with Listerine , need to be careful with the strength of the water jet, because of course it fill your mouth with water, so it is a game of rinsing and spitting and timing how long to keep it inside, but it is how it get the job done very nicely!!</li>
    <li> UPDATED STYLE, BUT MAKES AS MUCH NOISE AS OLDER STYLES.  STORAGE OF ATTACHMENT TOOLS NOT AS GOOD AS PRIOR MODELS, YOU MUST REMOVE THE TOP COVER OVER THE WATER TANK.</li>
    <li> easy to use. not too loud. steady. various devices for mouth, teeth, tongue, and gums. easy to clean and store.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Great price. Works really well! I love how clean my teeth feel. Like dentist clean! Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!</li>
    <li> We purchased this waterpik to replace our 8 year old version of the same brand. Our dentist recommends this for anyone with issues with their teeth or gums; waterpik, brush, then floss.&lt;br /&gt;This new model is better constructed and easier to clean. The pulsing is sufficiently strong to dislodge and remove food particles and plaque easily but does not hurt or damage the gums.</li>
    <li> This is just what the doctor ordered...literally. My dentist recommended this waterpik and I am so happy he did. It works great, has so many features and settings and is making my mouth healtier every day. I love it.</li>
    <li> good product. plenty of pressure at nozzle. just what I wanted. Price a little high.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy another one but knock off another15%.</li>
    <li> We bought this quite a while ago and it&#x27;s still running strong. Works very well and stores easily. Has some other types of tips as well.</li>
    <li> I wanted a Waterpik to take care of my gums and remember the one my parents had when I was a kid.  That thing had some power.  I bought the Ultra Water Flosser based on all the great reviews.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have nearly as much pressure as I recall the old ones did, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough pressure to get a stream of water into the space between teeth that are close together.  The part where the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; head snaps into the handle leaks a lot too.  I ended up going back to regular floss since this device doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me and dripped a lot of water.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try the Philips Sonicare Airfloss.</li>
    <li> I have been using Water Piks for years. All Water Piks are great for dental hygiene--effective and fun to use. This unit is the quietest, most compact and easiest to clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can only assume these work as I have no way to test, but it definetly gets rid of the Chlorine smell</li>
    <li> Not loud and works great has been 1 month now still works . Better than the last one. I hope I get many years out of this product.</li>
    <li> Really nice product for flossing your teeth especially if you have braces. My daughter just got braces and this was the only good way to clean left over food and prevent any gum disease. The extra water capacity helps a lot so you don&#x27;t have to fill it frequently. I recommend this model over all other waterpick flosser.</li>
    <li> It is easier to use that the older model with more options. It has many morermtips of different designs for different uses.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I stumbled upon this Waterpik.  I have had braces for about a year now. Every time I go to my orthodontist appt&#x27;s and dentist visit--they always ask me about flossing.  I must confess I am not a regular flosser. Since having this Waterpik I actually look forward to flossing.  After my first use--I said WOW! I never knew how much food was still stuck in between my braces and teeth even after brushing.  I have had this flosser for about a month and I can tell a difference with my gums and i floss 2x per day. I am looking forward to my next dentist visit in the coming weeks!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a close friend, but I haven&#x27;t heard yet how it was received.  I&#x27;ll report again after I hear something.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for keeping healthy gum and teeth,&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s not perfect in using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser handle holder broken&lt;br /&gt;and I have to purchase oriental-plug socket of Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will recommend this Waterpik to my friends.</li>
    <li> Will never use floss again! Product shipped as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to start out on pressure &#x27;8&#x27;, but am now at a pressure &#x27;10&#x27; &amp; my gums are doing great.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Definitely worth the money. Was recommended by our dentist.  Helpful for gums.  Would purchase again for self or for a gift for someone else.</li>
    <li> it is really a great waterpik.  it came on time and that was very important to me because I really needed it.</li>
    <li> I used this brand water flosser years ago and it worked well. And this one works equally well. I have no problems at all with leaking, and the product is convenient. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The first one was great and still working when I ordered this one. I just ordered this one because it was more compact than the old one.&lt;br /&gt;My wife also ordered one and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Very efficient, helpful and very nice to use the device. Pay off the cost of the unit for six to seven months.</li>
    <li> I had a previous model of this and liked it......and then my husband took it over to use for his sinuses.  I needed something to clean out my braces and my portable model broke, and then a cheaper non-brand one was junk.  So finally decided to spring for this one.  Its really nice!  I love how the strength can be adjusted to a fairly strong jet, and there are several different attachments to choose from.  My husband would just probably complain that they did not include a sinus attachment but no big deal, that&#x27;s not why we bought this one.  It holds plenty of water to do your entire mouth and its compact enough that it does not take up too much room while using it, especially if you have a small sink like I do.  Great purchase.  Waterpik does it best!</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it everyday, no problems. Easy to setup and use. Great price, would recommend to anyone. I love the multi-adapters.</li>
    <li> I hated regular flossing and found it uncomfortable and tedious. With this flosser, I can get around my teeth, see the food particles fall to the sink and get washed away.  My Mouth feels much cleaner and fresher.  Follow with brushing, and I&#x27;m good to go!!  When I am out of town and I don&#x27;t have it to use.......I miss it!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my son.  It was hard enough to get him to floss before braces.  But once the braces went on, there was no more flossing and his gums were a mess.  We got this and not only did he kind of like using it because he had this new gadget, it worked great!  Within two weeks, there was a big improvement in his gums and last time into the orthodontist, he got a big gold star for healthy gums.  We have all the attachments we could ever use (and more) and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have multiple crowns &amp; a dental implant. Flossing alone never worked that well &amp; I struggled with plaque around the bases of my crowns. After I brush with my electric toothbrush and floss, then I use the Waterpik. I am amazed at what gets missed without the Waterpik! I have a cleaner mouth &amp; fresher breath with my Waterpik. ( I also have the travel version.) I get glowing reviews when I visit my dental hygienist &amp; dentist! :-)</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I feel compelled to on this one because it has changed my life.  Yes this product has held up well for a year of daily use, nothing has broke, it always has worked, etc, etc.  It has not changed my life because of plaque removal (It does a good job though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has changed my life by removing 100% of my bad breath problems.  And they were serious problems!  It gets old when your spouse asks you on a daily basis where you are hiding the poop sandwiches.  Trust me, I have tried everything through the years- every mouthwash, tongue scraper, oral antibiotics, antibiotic mouthwash, I could go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, use the attachment that looks like a spoon (its a tongue scraper that shoots water).  Fill your tank with water then ADD 2-3 caps of mouthwash.  Turn it on 10 and scrape all the &amp;*#! off your tongue.  You must face down and breath deep or else you will constantly gag, but you must clean as far back as possible.  This will leave your tongue surface clean and a red color rather than gray or white.  You may need more than one tankful on your first attempt to get all the junk off.  Once you got a good deep cleaning only 1/2 a tank is needed daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My spouse can not believe it.  She says if that thing every breaks one will be on order the same day.  So no more poop sandwiches for me.  If you are even on the fence just try this thing.  It could change your life!</li>
    <li> This is the second unit that bought. I bought it for my brother. I believe it clean the gum and the teeth beside the gap between the teeth. You can adjust the pressure to your comfort. I have a dentist told me to use the lowest setting but the other one told me to use the setting that I am comfortable. I keep it around 7-8, and my gum bled the first couple weeks but after that it is good now.</li>
    <li> Although this product is a bit expensive, it&#x27;s well worth it...My dentist has told me, that my guns  and teeth are in great shape...</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product in the worst stages of my TMJ pain issues. I had a very limited mouth opening, and just could not floss the majority of my teeth. This product was recommended to me as an alternative to flossing. It was a savior when I couldn&#x27;t open my mouth. I could at least use this on the outside of my teeth if I couldn&#x27;t floss or brush all the way. I was also told you could mix a little bit of mouth wash in with the water, and that worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my TMJ symptoms are much improved, I still use this product on a daily basis. I prefer it to flossing and it seems more effective as well. This product is also amazing if you are a popcorn lover- it gets the kernels out better than any other way I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every now and then there&#x27;s a little water that leaks out, but other than that, this Waterpik has been great. It&#x27;s not too noisy, the water reservoir holds more than enough water, and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for anyone wearing braces. My dentist praises my braces upkeep and it&#x27;s all due to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I continued using it even after the braces were removed and it&#x27;s a great device that completely replaces flossing. Since i have permanent retainers in, flossing is such a chore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great. I&#x27;ve had it since 2010 and it&#x27;s in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. The dentist told me I had some gumline issues, so I started using this as well as flossing. Issues cleared up right away!</li>
    <li> todo perfecto, gracias, excelente producto. todo excelente. perfecta toda la operación, gracias por todo, excelente toda la operación. todo bien</li>
    <li> This Waterpik flosser is the best around and one of the most reasonable for what you get. The hose is replaceable so if it gets old and used and maybe leak you can get a replacement instead of buying a whole new flosser .I was impressed with that.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I finally purchased this water pik.  I am addicted to it.  Really!  I use it every  time I eat anything.  I think it is keeping the plaque from building up on the front lower teeth.</li>
    <li> I have the start of gum disease,  so my dentist sugested that I purchase a Waterpik, it has inproved my condition</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really thought about my teeth too much as I&#x27;ve never had any problems- until my last check up. I had heard that a waterpik was more effective than flossing and an electric tooth brush was more effective than a non-electrical one. I switched to both. It really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a bit of learning curve to it, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. It comes with 6 different heads so there are lots of ways to make it work for you (braces, crowns, getting below the gum line, etc). It&#x27;s not as big as I thought it would be so it&#x27;s not taking up your whole counter. It&#x27;s quiet. I&#x27;ve got nothing to complain about at all.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product or other similar product for flossing my teeth. So, when I saw my friends start using it, I was surprised by the result. So, I decided to give it a try. Now, I love it! It takes out &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; on hard-to-reach area and my teeth are clean. It&#x27;s another effective way to floss teeth although in the long run water bill might increase a little bit if the whole family use it.</li>
    <li> Thank you I have been looking for a waterpik for months now.  I bought one from walmart but returned it bacause it was a lot of money and cordless it didn&#x27;t work the well.  I was very happy to get the old fashion waterpik with some power.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  About the same as the one I had many years ago but more compact.  The first time you use it you have to remember that you press the noozle button to turn it off, not on, because the spray starts automatically when you turn on the unit and set the pressure.  It&#x27;s only going to spray all over if you point it to spray all over.</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik for many years, find that it can dislodge food particles that even floss can&#x27;t get sometimes. This one works as well as my prior model that finally quit working after more than ten years. But to me, all of the different attachments are just about useless, I use only the standard one, the rest just clatter around and occasionally fall out of their storage place inside the reservoir lid. And the attachment comes off too easily, I&#x27;ve had it come off while using it a few times. My old one had none of these flaws.</li>
    <li> I find the plaque brush to be a great help and there are several different tips for differing needs.  Also the design is clever and space efficient</li>
    <li> This water flosser works great.  I use it every day and it comes with many attachments to reach every part of your mouth.  Great water pressure as well.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I am considering getting them for my married kids.  Little bit messy at first till you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I used to never floss or write Amazon reviews, but I thought this Waterpik deserved an amazing review.  It did the unthinkable.  I floss daily now.  I&#x27;m excited to brush my teeth.  My mouth tastes clean and feels so incredibly fresh.  The Waterpik is incredibly easy to use, and I&#x27;m in love with all of the different attachments.  If you hate flossing, buy this.  It will change your life forever.</li>
    <li> I use this flosser nightly. Am constantly amazed at the particles of food it dislodges, makes me cringe to think how often i used to go to bed with that stuff in my teeth, even after brushing.  My dentist says my gums look better too. I think this a great value in a water flosser, and it sure beats brushing alone.</li>
    <li> User-friendly and love the way it cleans!  I find I am easily able to clean gums well even on a low setting.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I chose this product and am very pleased. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it does a great job of cleaning my teeth and received as advertised. Very fast delivery received the next day!</li>
    <li> This is the second one we purchase and every day we keep thanking for this invention. It helps proper mouth cleaning by forcing water to reach everywhere in the gums</li>
    <li> Good device. The product description and even pictures of the box say it includes a tongue brush but it does not. Please update your product information Amazon!</li>
    <li> Above the reservoir is a storage case for the attachments. It is made to hold 4 (?) and the unit comes with 6. Maybe there is additional storage somewhere else on it. Alas, I haven&#x27;t looked at the instruction booklet yet, and this could just be my own ignorance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used Waterpik devices in the past, this was no surprise. Great pressure, and does a great job. Compared to previous devices, this one&#x27;s operating noise is much quieter.</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik for many years, but my old one was dying, and there were features of its design which I believe contributed to its demise. From what I have seen so far, this model avoids the issues I had with the older unit. My only issue with this is that although it came with 6 or 7 tips (all of different types) I would have preferred a smaller selection, which included two or three of the basic tip. Instead, I must now buy these separately, at what seems an inordinately high price.</li>
    <li> Let me first say I hate flossing. Raking a bit of string between my teeth always felt like burdensome torture. I know it&#x27;s a necessity, I&#x27;ve seen the difference it makes in my dental checkups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, what you really want to know is whether this device works. The quick answer is: Yes. It&#x27;s not any faster than traditional flossing, but works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details: If you&#x27;ve never used a water flosser, keep in mind that it sprays a jet of water at your teeth. Not a little bit either. So unless you like drinking your lukewarm cleaning water, you&#x27;ll be bent over the sink while it pours out of your mouth. That&#x27;s the first thing you have to get used to. The other is sensation of spraying your teeth and gums and running the nozzle along your teeth. For the former, Waterpik intelligently included a dial to adjust the water pressure. Definitely start this at the lowest setting and turn it up to your comfort level. If your gums are in a soar state, you&#x27;ll want to leave it lower until their health improves. I also suggest using a light touch with the nozzle. You don&#x27;t need to scrape the nozzle along your teeth anyway, but if you have a few sensitive or exposed roots you&#x27;ll be in for a twinge running the nozzle past those teeth with too much hand pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it does what you want it to, i.e. clean between your teeth better than floss. So a few bullet points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Cleans effectively&lt;br /&gt; - Massages the gums&lt;br /&gt; - Doesn&#x27;t cut gums&lt;br /&gt; - Lots of extra tools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - The motor isn&#x27;t quiet (so it may wake light sleepers)&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s messier with water flowing out of your mouth and the occasional errant spritz&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s more prep/clean up to fill the tank and clean it out afterward</li>
    <li> Bought for the kids and use it myself daily. It gets a work out but have not had any problems yet.</li>
    <li> I have had this at my house for a few days now and am really beginning to enjoy t. I always hated flossing, so i never did it. This seems to make it a litle bit more enjoyable and is relatively clean.</li>
    <li> This is my latest waterpic, I&#x27;ve been using one for about 20 years. It&#x27;s about the same as far as flossing goes as my others. I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the lid. I don&#x27;t like it, doesn&#x27;t hinge, doesn&#x27;t seem to want to go right back on without a little moving around. I still wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> when i first got it does take a little time to get use the water pressure (start low then gradually work up). also i would suggest reading the manual for all the accessories. easy to set up. i bought it because of all the positive reviews. at first i was skeptical but after getting into the routine of it i will say this: its an eye opener what regular flossing and brushing still leaves behind and my teeth are looking whiter then before!! so if something as simple as this small machine does those 2 things well then its a keeper. i havent used every accessory yet so still have to do that.</li>
    <li> This was a tremendous improvement over the cordless waterpick.  You do need the bigger reservoir for a proper flossing job as the smaller, cordless version needs refilling at least 3 times for one flossing job. Also, as other pointed out, the battery on the cordless does not last long. After 4 months of use it no longer gets charged. I was hoping to use this waterpick for home and the cordless for travel but that one is kaput. I am saying this so that buyers who are not sure which to buy are warned that it&#x27;s worth spending more money for the non-cordless version.</li>
    <li> My dentist had to \\&quot;suggest\\&quot; I get a Water Pik for several visits before I finally got one. For some reason my childhood memories of using a Water Pik were vaguely unpleasant. Once I finally tried my new Water Pik, I was amazed. I love the way my teeth and gums feel every time I use it, and I use it two or three times daily. I know my gums are much healthier now. Do yourself a favor, buy and use this product.[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I feel like my gums are healthier and my breath has improved as well! It works just as well or better than using floss. It comes with a lot of different ends like a tongue scraper and other specialty fittings, which are helpful. I also was pleased with the price I got it for on Amazon.com. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]We had an older model of the Water Pik for many years.  The water tube finally broke off at the handle.  We had made good use of it and wanted another.  We had looked in a number of places, and finally decided to look in Amazon,  It is very useful and helpful instrument to give the feeling of really getting your teeth clean and keep the gums healthy.  We would highly recommend it for family use or for individuals.</li>
    <li> i feel it&#x27;s my duty as braceface to write a review. i have ibraces on my top and traditional braces on my bottom teeth. i have had them on for awhile now and only recently started using a waterpik. i&#x27;m almost mad at myself for not having bought this earlier. i used to brush and floss like a mad woman and still felt like i couldn&#x27;t get my braces clean enough. with the waterpik it gets all the food that gets stuck on, in and around my braces off. and after reading previous reviews i add mouthwash to water and your mouth really feels fresh. i finally feel clean! the pressure is good, i use the highest setting. it&#x27;s slightly noisy but it&#x27;s not that bad. and if you don&#x27;t push the hold button in hard enough it does slightly leak. but i don&#x27;t find these things to be a problem. i love it so much i bought the cordless version for when i travel. if you have braces or can&#x27;t floss for some reason this is definitely the way to go. even if you can floss this is a good add to your routine.</li>
    <li> I purchase a ultra water flosser and and I am so happy I recommend to everybody that want to keep a healthy  teeth  floss never be so easy</li>
    <li> Crazy about  it love it</li>
    <li> Nicely designed / built unit.  I&#x27;ve owned older Water-Piks in the past - used them until they died.  This unit is the best of the units I&#x27;ve owned so far.  Pretty quiet, very effective.  While I would not totally replace flossing with a Water-Pik, one can reduce how often flossing is needed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, quite glad I purchased the unit.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use to floss when I got braces because I knew I was not going to take the time to floss every night. I am not sure how effective it has been at helping my gums stay healthy, but it sure has done a great job getting all the food out of all the crevices of my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that the rating is mediocre is because after 5 months of use the button that stops the flow of water on the handle will not depress, which means I need to pay another 20 bucks for a replacement. I feel that waterpik should replace these for free when this happens, especially if it occurs within the first year, or should just make a better built product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another brand and just start from scratch, but since I will go back to flossing when I get my braces off in 6 months I am going to have to give waterpik another 20 bucks for a cheaply made product.</li>
    <li> Our teeth are cleaner and left over food is removed even after our teeth have been brushed and flossed. We will never be without this product again.</li>
    <li> My husband has used waterpiks for years. the old fashioned one with the bucket on top, then the new sleek one that at least looked a little more like you could keep it clean and share the other holders with the kids. Third purchase was the individual handheld waterpik, didn&#x27;t hold up long.  He loves this one, the container holds water with a closed lid, the extended reach of the wand as compared to previous ones.  Mostly the power behind it. And you know, it even looks a little Stars Wars to me, like those guys in white. Cool! I&#x27;ve snuck in and used it a couple of times and plan to do more.  It&#x27;s totally invigorating.  Well worth the purchase and super quick (as always) with Amazon.  Get yours today!</li>
    <li> Nice, just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this Waterpik.  The machine is easy to use and clean.  It comes with a variety of tips....possibly a few more than is actually needed.  However the waterpik works great and doesn&#x27;t take any more time to use than flossing.  I would recommend this machine to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks and my mouth feels very clean.  My bride to be (can&#x27;t spell fiance) us now using it regularly and decided to buy the cordless model so we can take it with us on the road.  I will never go without our waterpik ultra water Flosser. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit for the sole purpose of getting rid of tonsil stones. I have had tonsil stones to one degree or another for several years now. I have tried Q-Tips, toothpicks, my finger, and lots of other methods and I just couldn&#x27;t quite get those deeper tonsil stones. I was finally fed up and so I did the following to get rid of my tonsil stones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Floss all my teeth very well&lt;br /&gt;2. Brush teeth with electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;3. Use tongue scraper to clean tongue&lt;br /&gt;4. This WaterPik to clean tonsils (short bursts on low power)&lt;br /&gt;5. Mouthwash to kill bacteria&lt;br /&gt;6. Gargle salt-water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, by keeping my mouth SUPER clean I was able to get rid of the tonsil stones. I was AMAZED at how many tonsil stones came out even when I thought my mouth was clean. I now have very fresh breath and no more tonsil stones. It is WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Use the lower settings and short bursts on the tonsils. If you have higher pressures for longer periods of time you can hurt the tonsils a bit (they will bleed but heal fine).</li>
    <li> The product I received does not produce the power even on the highest setting to properly clean teeth.  I plan to return unit for another which hopefully will work the way it should. I tested a unit in my dentist office and found a dramatic difference in power or force.</li>
    <li> I needed a new waterpik and bought something which cost less trying to save some money. Bad decision. I should have bought this first. Great attachments, powerful, and yes, I use mine with mouthwash and water in the water tank part of the unit. No problems! Love this device and have had great results at my dentist due to using this so it pays for itself!</li>
    <li> Looked at the reviews on the product before we bought it, most were good. So we decided to give it a try, all I can say is that we are very pleased with the purchase.  It really cleans your teeth and gums, we only use setting 5 and it seems to be more than enough. You will get stuff out of your teeth that you thought was not there, it is a little messy, but just hold over the sink.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to quickly floss there teeth.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best that I have used.  I like all the different attachments.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and clean. The water pressure dial makes it fun for every one to use.</li>
    <li> If I turn on the pressure switch and forget to hold down the push botton on the handle, water sprays all over.  A user friendly design would be more intuitive - push to spray (not push to stop spraying).  I also bought a Sonicare Flosser.  You push to spray and the pulsed spray works much better to get particles out.  Both products may not fully replace floss, because mechanical flossing massages the gums better.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim one night and am satisfied with it after a month of use.  The reservoir is big enough that it&#x27;ll last for about two minutes on setting 7 but seems to drain pretty quickly.  There are several attachments which are useful for various flossing/brushing actions combined with the water jet.  I&#x27;d buy this again if I had to</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and works great.  For the money, it&#x27;s good investment. The release works so well you need to be careful not to hit it with your thumb while you&#x27;re flossing or you&#x27;ll get your face washed!</li>
    <li> this water pik is much smaller than the old one i had. it works very well without too much vibration or noise. i have no idea what all the accessories are for, i just use the main one. the price was right too - amazon is much cheaper than BB&amp;B and even COSTCO</li>
    <li> Pleeased with this porchase AAA</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years now and I never really gave it much though, but the water that goes inside of the button to stop the water as well as the nozzle lets water sit inside of the handle and after time black-mold starts to grow! Just look at this picture: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/moX7OCGZOOKXFZ/B000GLRREU/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do sell a replacement nozzle which I would recommend every 6 months, but also another way to keep the inside of the handle clean is to soak it in a diluted bleach solution or even peroxide. A good method to do this is in a campaign glass.</li>
    <li> This machine works wonderful and my mouth has never felt cleaner. I only wish that I had purchased it sooner. It comes with several accessory pieces and even has its own storage container.</li>
    <li> Extremely durable. I still have it and it has never failed. A bit disappointed as my dentist said I still have to floss, though since using it i have never gotten any cavities between teeth</li>
    <li> I never was able to floss (small mouth? psychological barriers?)and have needed a half dozen root canals and 2 bridges over the years; recently I&#x27;ve been going to the hygenist every 3 mos to try to improve things.  In March she suggested I try a waterpic and I am amazed.  I use it for a minute at night, chase with 15 sec of Lavoris and am very inpressed.  So impressed that I was late to see my hygenist, who upon inspecting my mouth shared my enthusiasm, in spite of the potential impact on her business.  I asked her why she hadn&#x27;t recommended it earlier; she shrugged and said it works for some and not others.  It certainly seems to be working for me!!  (BTW, I&#x27;ve only used the standard pic. I bought some replacements, but havent used them yet (7 mos); not clear to me why they recommend replacements every 3 mos?)</li>
    <li> I really liked this water flosser and it worked well at removing plaque and nasty stuff around teeth. However, I only used it a few times a week, took good care of it, and it broke after just a couple of months. It no longer has any sort of pressure when the water comes out. It basically dribbles out.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I try a waterpik to help strengthen my gums. He told me it&#x27;s much more effective than flossing to clean between the teeth and along the gum line. And he recommended to get the plug-in versus the cordless because as the battery loses power, so does the water pressure - the plug-in remains constant. It shipped quickly with regular shipping! And I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day ever since. I love it! My teeth feel so much cleaner than before! I really see and feel the difference. It comes with a myriad of specialty heads that I most likely will never use. But I am so glad I took his recommendation. This is a great product - highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> If you are like me, you are probably not the best flosser. I have never been super great about it but having the water flosser is great. It works really well and it is pretty easy to use Pressure is good and the provided heads are great to stay on top of your hygiene. Only con is it would be better if it was a bit smaller or thinner; that way it can fit better behind a mirror or wherever you want to store it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Teeth are much better and healthier according to my dentist after years of use of this product.</li>
    <li> Really a good buy. This work to keep your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Works great, just needed to get used to turning the tip rather than having to twist my arm a little.</li>
    <li> Works as good an any or even better.  Smaller footprint on the counter than the last one I used. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I use my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser most every day, and I just love it.  I have a lot of crowns, which make traditional flossing difficult.  Sometimes floss gets stuck, and I have tried everything. In the past, floss has caused some crowns to come loose. The Water Flosser seems to be the best solution.  I still floss sometimes, but find it much less necessary.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these devices over the last 13-months.  At about the six-month interval, both units failed to perform, in that they simply stopped providing sufficient water pressure for the water to make it through the nozzle, even at the \\&quot;10\\&quot; setting level.  The motor becomes noticeably louder and perhaps the louder motor sound is the indication of imminent failure.  I have no complaints about the pressure at various settings and the unit&#x27;s ability to be a very competent teeth/gum cleaning device - while it is running properly.  While it is working, it is quite excellent at cleaning areas between teeth and the gum line, and after a few uses, it has a \\&quot;good-feel\\&quot; effect to the gums.  My usage was a schedule of every three days, or every two days, alternating the frequencies every week.  I always had the unit set to the highest value (10), in terms of the water pressure it would deliver.  My problem was it&#x27;s durability.  Enjoy the device while it runs, but if you purchase one, start saving for the next replacement purchase that will occur at a 6 or 7 month interval after commencing usage.</li>
    <li> I usually add a little mouth wash when I use Waterpik. I think, after several weeks of use, it started to clog the tube as the water pressure significantly lowered. Also, I having to press the button to stop the flow of water is very counter-intuitive. Hence, two stars off.</li>
    <li> I owned this product for years, this was a replacement. I love Waterpik, I never had a problem with gums and theets since I use it. My dentist is always amazed what wonderful gums and theet I have. Also it was less expensive on Amazon, love Amazon.</li>
    <li> Compared to threader floss or those specialty \\&quot;braces\\&quot; flossing harps, this waterpik is amazing.  If you&#x27;ve ever had to wear braces, you know what a monstrosity is to clean them after most foods, but some foods are just nightmares (nuts of any kind, rice, leafy greens, meat, broccoli, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes only a few seconds to fully floss and clean my mouth of all debris, and I use less than half of the water tank.  It&#x27;s pretty quiet, though obviously not silent.  Setting 7/8 is more than enough to jet troublesome bits from the hardest parts of the orthodontia (parts a toothbrush just can&#x27;t tackle well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried when my orthodontist gave me the option of a permanent bonded retainer instead the dorky kind you pop in at night because I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to floss my teeth around the bonded version: this device solves that problem. Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about losing a retainer nor losing the straight teeth I paid so much time and money to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The pause button helps to prevent you from spraying the room while moving the wand around, but it doesn&#x27;t fully seal (at least mine doesn&#x27;t, so it dribbles).</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a present to a friend who needed one according to his dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard only praises about the product,</li>
    <li> works ok, and will clean your bathroom walls if you point it in the wrong direction! i stopped using it because my perodontist said it tended to push food particles farther in between the tooth and gums.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the waterpik, I wish I had had one many years ago. Your teeth aren&#x27;t really clean until you use one.</li>
    <li> It only worked for one year. It stoped pumping water after a year. For the price, I expect it can last longer. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> works fine does the job.should use every day for perfect results.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, price was right and product worked as expected.</li>
    <li> An excellent product and a definite upgrade over the older models. Love it!</li>
    <li> Hard time flossing with tape or string.... Dentist gave me a clean bill of health without having to do a cleaning....No tarter deposits at last checkup!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s collecting dust. I used it several times in the beginning but the times which I have used it. Al the water SPLASHED all over my cloths.</li>
    <li> Great flossing ability !</li>
    <li> My dentist said there&#x27;s no replacement for flossing.  The crevices between the teeth are too tight for water to remove everything.</li>
    <li> I like it. Better than the one I had, which was smaller. No complantes</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This gets everything out of my teeth.  I hardly floss anymore!</li>
    <li> Does a good job. Easy to use</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I have braces and do not know what I would do without it. Excellent cleaning tool that I will continue to use after the braces are gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpik floss tool because I hate flossing my teeth with wax covered string. It actually feels like it jets the water between the teeth and gums. I like it. My teeth feel cleaner and I don&#x27;t have the pain I always got with wax string floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone should consider one of these if they don&#x27;t like to floss. Dentists always say we should floss, so this is a great option!</li>
    <li> My gum tissue improved within 2 months of using this as reported by my dentist. It&#x27;s very easy to use and there is one sitting right there on my dentist&#x27;s countertop.</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t used the WaterPik in years. Finally came back to the best there is for keeping your teeth and gums healthy!</li>
    <li> Excellent service from PharmaFrag, and we love this Waterpick Flosser!  Best ever!</li>
    <li> verry good! cool clearing..</li>
    <li> I have braces on my teeth and flossing is so awkward I bought the Waterpik to enhance my flossing efforts. The floss gets stuck in my brackets and is a pain to remove! After flossing I&#x27;ll use this wonderfully messy gadget and more gunk will wash out of my mouth. For the next two years my WaterPik and I will be best of buddies.</li>
    <li> This pic is easy to use, takes up very little space and leaves my mouth feeling dentist visit clean.</li>
    <li> works great a lot quiter then my old one comes with different picks for different uses witch is real nice</li>
    <li> I use this flosser every night. My hygienist was very appreciative at my six month cleaning after I started using this flosser. She recommended that I use the flosser after brushing instead of before and I have changed my routine slightly to make this change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser sits on the bathroom countertop in a corner and does not take up too much room. It is easy to fill and use. I had to play around with the attachments until I found one that suited me best. It also takes a little getting used to if you have not used a water flosser before. But once you get used to it, it becomes an easy part of your routine. I am almost thinking of getting the portable one for trips. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> very good and it really get the food particles out from between the teeth.  it is very easy to adjust the pressure.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is great for cleaning out left over food from your gums after brushing and flossing even though you think you did a good job.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is nice to have around for those like me are unable to keep track of any dental floss in their house. It holds quite a bit of water and the container&#x27;s lid doubles as an attachment container. The number of attachments aren&#x27;t all necessary but I guess it is good to have some variety. The pik delivers the water in pulsing jets with a dial to adjust the intensity from 1 &amp;#34;it tickles&amp;#34; to 10 &amp;#34;my gums are bleeding.&amp;#34; The button on the water dispenser stops the stream when pressed down and allows it when it is released to ease tension on the users hand I guess. Overall, great investment but my only regret is that the water jet stream isn&#x27;t narrower and the pik only is able to deliver the water in pulses. But aside from those minor grievances, I think that this item is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This waterpik was almost $15 less than ones at my local stores. It works as expected, and came with all the tips described. I have used a waterpik in the past, and I liked that this unit has a variable pressure dial. My first one only had 2 choices, low and high, so this is much easier to set for a variety of people. Since it was new, the only problems I worried about were the seller&#x27;s promptness and reliability if the product did not work, and the price. The unit was shipped promptly and I have not had any problems with it, so I would definitely recommend this product and seller again.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik. It&#x27;s so easy to use, and the instructions are very clear. It comes with so many tips! I&#x27;m excited to use them all.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Pump is a bit loud, overall design is kind of tired. Looks like something from the 1980&#x27;s. But it works so, no worries.</li>
    <li> My Gums are healed now in only three weeks. Dentists will not be screaming to again with my mouth wide open. Infact I won&#x27;t be seeing them that much often. Thanks Waterpik</li>
    <li> Product has surpassed my expectations. I will continue using it. I would recommend to people that they try it. Bye</li>
    <li> This device is my 5th Waterpik, and has once again, proven to be the master of this line of dental appliances.</li>
    <li> I love it, you can see the food particles in the sink as you use this Waterpik. My teeth feel cleaner than when I used to floss. I hated flossing but love using the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made for the family &#x3D;-)  Works great.  Easy to use.  ...it&#x27;s taken dental hygiene to a whole new, wonderful level!</li>
    <li> The best.  Came fast and packaged well.  I am pleased with my purchase and am very peased with customer support.</li>
    <li> Previously, I had the waterpick flosser that you could recharge. That one worked fine until the charge lasted long enough for one tooth! (After some research, I discovered that is a common problem and read of possible solutions.) But, as I have crowns on almost every tooth and 5 implants, including one bridge, I needed a flosser that worked, and I can say this one works great. It is easy to use and contains all the tips you could possibly need. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am really surprised how awkward this product was. Why the high reviews beats me. When I first tried it there was water all over the place. It was pretty awkward all around. I hope it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
    <li> happy with purchase. love the product.</li>
    <li> I thought this looked fine in photos and the incredible amount of reviews w/an overall score of about 4.5 stars indicated to me it was a good product.  Not.  Yes, it&#x27;s small and light - light like a toy.  Alright, let&#x27;s try it out.  Filled reservoir w/water and placed firmly in place.  Pulled the handle out to use for first time and the coiled tube would barely reach my mouth fully extended and unit directly to right of sink.  It could not be placed any closer to my mouth. I&#x27;m about 6&#x27; tall so this should not be an issue.  The thing is so light and the coiled tube so relatively stiff, I thought it might tip over.  Well, that&#x27;s great!  So then I check the negative reviews.  Did not actually see this mentioned anywhere, but then I went back to try again and the reservoir was empty and water all over my counter.  Then I read about the poorly designed handle w/o-ring that quickly/eventually leaks.  Unsure if that&#x27;s where mine leaked from, but reservoir was firmly in place.  Enough said, it went back to Amazon.  I&#x27;ve since discovered the Redibreeze is far simpler, efficient and effective.  Final point of contention: another cheaply made product unethically produced - you can almost guarantee as it&#x27;s \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; - in a sweat shop.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these in my home, my youngest son somehow managed to pilfer the first (thankfully). Great product, works awesome, I use it daily and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Used it for a week and so far it works fine. Much noisier than my older Waterpik though.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use and just the product I was looking for and highly I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> This product does everything described on the site. Its a solid buy for anyone looking for a little help to take better care of their teeth.</li>
    <li> Previously I had purchased a hand-held model because my local store did not have this unit in stock, but the hand-held is only good for use when traveling. This unit is powerful and has a water supply sufficient to cover your upper and lower jaws twice. Beware that using this unit becomes somewhat addictive because once you get used to the wonderful feeling that your teeth are completely clean, you want to go and use it immediately after each meal! A wonderful alternative to regular flossing. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> I was never a fan of the waterpick having used it years ago.  My dentist recommended this to me on my last visit.  I thought i would give it a try again and I am so pleased that I did.  Adding some mouth wash to the water leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Gave each of our 4 adult children one of these.  Excellent tool to help oral health.  We&#x27;ve had one for several years and recommend them.</li>
    <li> My teenage son is terrible about flossing with his braces on, so I got him this.  It is working wonders!  He uses this daily and the battle to get him to floss is over.  On his last checkup, his orthodontist noted that his flossing habits had become much better.</li>
    <li> I like it. I use it nearly every day. It has held up and done what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these I&#x27;ve had over the years.  They last about two years, then you replace them...</li>
    <li> I love the water pik. It does a good job and very quickly. I use it every day to keep my teeth clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> Highly recomended.... This is a MUCH better alternative to flossing and is actually a lot healthier for your gums as well and does a more thorough job. The pulsing water can actually work out food and bacteria that is unreachable with floss. I hope you found my review useful. :)</li>
    <li> Good device. Easy to use and clean. You do need to be careful of the spray and stay close to the sink and do not start using it at a high setting. Most importantly makes my dentist happy!</li>
    <li> For the money it does a really good job of cleaning your teeth. I am hooked because it keeps me away from the dentist. It does have a flaw though that others have commented on. The handle stops working. First time it happens if it is under warranty get a replacement handle. It won&#x27;t get better, trust me. I keep a second one on hand in case it happens again. One year warranty. But it is better than all the others out there and the cost is good so, this is the one to get, flaws and all.</li>
    <li> no wonder these lost favor- not enough pressure to really clean</li>
    <li> Love most things about it.  I have sprayed my bathroom with water quite often when I forgot the pause button.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dentist..seems to be doing a good job..prompt delivery..</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this machine.  I wasted money on this one.  One has to be careful with the setting. If the settings of the water stream are too high one can hurt the gums.  I read the instructions but I think there should be a warning.  I purchased this machine because I had braces and wanted to get all the food from in between my tooth. The water pik does remove the food from in between the teeth and that&#x27;s the only good thing about this machine. I think it works well enough but I should not have bought this machine. Overall I was disappointed with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Fantastic machine. Way better than my original Waterpik that finally died. Half the noise, much more powerful and better wand storage slot.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every single night!  He has tried several different kinds and this one is his favorite water pik,</li>
    <li> This little genius gets rid of everything that does not belong in your mouth.  Leaves the cleanest freshest feel ever..</li>
    <li> My kid has braces and this is making a HUGE difference in his oral care.  His gums are looking healthier and there&#x27;s not as much plague build-up.</li>
    <li> The dentist noticed the difference in my gun health once I starred using this.  Nice that it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  Only downside is the variety of brushes are worthless. Would prefer more of the same type of brushes so more of the family could use it.</li>
    <li> Works well, reservoir holds sufficient water to complete the job, dislodges lots of debris. Fairly noisy, has a button to shut the water off so it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place when you are finished.</li>
    <li> just arrived today - my other one just had hard and soft settings and there was not much difference between the 2,  this has 1-9 power settings and is perfect on one or two for my mouth.. i have mouth sores from  chemo and this does the job without out hurting my mouth.</li>
    <li> Excellent pressure range for a variety of cleaning surfaces. Plenty of water volume. Leaves my mouth feeling sparkling clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> Despite regular and almost religious flossing and brushing, periodontal disease has started to catch up with me. After a few heavy dental cleanings (and a *lot* of pain) my dentist recommended a &amp;#34;Water Pik&amp;#34; to improve my dental hygiene even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was completely skeptical about the Water Pik (I tend not to trust anything that looks like a gadget), but after some use, I have to to admit it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Water Pik in addition to regular flossing and sometimes it will pick up residue left behind by the dental floss. Also, the water jet is less painful than floss on sore gums (I have the tendency to &amp;#34;jam&amp;#34; the floss too hard, drawing blood at times). Mind you, the Water Pik will also hurt your gums if they&#x27;re sore, but not as much as floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water jet is pretty strong and the power is adjustable from 1 to 10. I use it on 5 and find the resulting power more than adequate for cleaning my teeth. The reservoir holds more water than you need, which is a good thing. I use warm water, as I find cold water sprayed into my gums uncomfortable. It takes a while to learn how to properly use it -- try it with an open mouth and you&#x27;ll splash water everywhere. So far, I see no signs of leakage in the handle as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
    <li> I bought this without my girlfriend&#x27;s knowledge, and when she saw it in our bathroom she was quite unhappy that I had purchased another &amp;#34;useless&amp;#34; gadget. Then she tried it, and it became her favorite thing ever and I&#x27;m stuck having to refill the water once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know this thing works? Because no matter how much I brush my teeth or what I&#x27;ve eaten on a given day, after I use this there&#x27;s a bunch of junk in the sink that has clearly come out of my mouth. I am glad that it is no longer in my mouth. Thanks, waterpik!</li>
    <li> i use it most every day. but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as the old model...it has 6 different attachments but only 1 of the kind that really seems to work.. and the plastic seems to need to be washed very frequently to avoid mildew.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, makes flossing much faster and overall more effective. Love the clean feeling after use and my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> I would love to hear why the people that don&#x27;t think t his has enough power think that.  As someone else asked - are you trying to remove paint from bricks?  A bunch of nozzles (all of which don&#x27;t fit in the places in the top), very adjustable pressure and for me a LOT of water capacity.  My Doctor also suggested these were good for removing ear wax and on the low setting I have to concur. And since no one is going to have insurance in the future, this is good for taking care of oneself!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been alternating using this device along with flossing.  It does a good job keeping plaque off my teeth and loosening stuff caught between them.</li>
    <li> This has helped me a ton with my teeth. I wish I bought one years ago.</li>
    <li> -Good little unit, smaller then I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cord has decent length; longer would of been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic seems okay, BPA free would of been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pretty loud at first, but you get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely powerful; as of now I can only get to setting 3 out of 10. Any higher and my gums bleed like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Be sure to use waterpik over sink; water tends to ricochet off your teeth and gums and get all over the place; cordless would of been an excellent idea so I could bring it in the shower with me and not have to worry about making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it gets the job done (why I give it 4 stars). Would recommend getting a wireless unit though.</li>
    <li> Fantastic if you don&#x27;t like to floss.  I use this about twice a week and have owned if for 2 years now.  It cleans out the old food from under your gums and stuck between teeth.</li>
    <li> I cleans my teeth well.  The periodontal tool gently flushes out pockets (Use it on it lowest setting for this tool).  Make sure it is supported from the back when you turn it on so it doesn&#x27;t flip over and spill water everywhere.</li>
    <li> good price and works as exspected !</li>
    <li> This works better than the string flossing.  It is a product that has a number of tips to use for all your oral needs.  I keep it plug so that i never forget to use it daily.</li>
    <li> This is a must for me --- as I don&#x27;t like flossing and this device really gets between you teeth</li>
    <li> I got this on recommendation from a friend. Worked well for a couple of weeks, but then the pause button would get stuck. I end up just using the On/Off button instead which will probably significantly reduce the life of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waterpik is a good idea, but the design could be better. The unit is not very stable and easy to knock over, aggravated by short overly springy cord. The water reservoir should be larger and have a lid that is more securely attached to the unit.</li>
    <li> Works well. It takes a little practice to get used to letting the water run out of your mouth. This really helps get the spaces between bridges cleaned up a bit.</li>
    <li> It is  great item. My wife loves it. We have had waterpiks for quite a few years and this one is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> cant stand up to daily use. very hard to get replacement tips. too expensive for an item that isnt made to last.</li>
    <li> Nice design, attractive.  Works well. Once you get used to using it so that you dont get water all over the place it&#x27;s great.  You have to try to keep your mouth closed a bit and keep your head over the sink while moving it around your gum line.</li>
    <li> This irrigator is one of the best things I have ever bought. 7 years on and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
    <li> This is a very good flosser.  We had one for a long time before the hose finally broke. It was probably at least 10 years old. Decided to just get a complete new machine.</li>
    <li> Bought for my kids - one who&#x27;s  10 and has braces, and the other who&#x27;s 8. After reading several RDH journal articles about the effectiveness of water picks compared to flossing, I picked this model for cost and accessories. Well worth the $.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but for the inconveniently placed on/off button.  Water pick itself works great though.  Love it. Definitely recommend. .... especially from someone who fatsl hates flossing! !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews but this product really deserved it. I really hate flossing, it&#x27;s a hassle having to put a string in between your teeth to dislodge build up... this thing does it without a hitch and much better I might add. The machine comes with a few different heads and the manual explains clearly how to use each one. Overall, I definitely recommend this product for anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> People should wake up to the possibility that a waterpik can prevent gum disease,&lt;br /&gt;as well as help prevent cavities. You can see this when you brush well, then use a waterpick&lt;br /&gt;and see alll the food particles that wash into the basin. Food particles that would stay below the gum line&lt;br /&gt;without the waterpik. I think it is more efffective than flossing.</li>
    <li> had to open up the hole on the one with the rubber on the end with a small drill bit (supply end)_ it works like the one at the dentist.  thanks wally</li>
    <li> Makes cleaning like to use so much easier.</li>
    <li> Best product for the Pearlie&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Wonderful buy, works fantastic.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a recognized brand and great quality. The price is good here as well. I&#x27;ve never had a problem.</li>
    <li> Using this water pik with Listerine (about 10% by volume) works well on the gums and makes a difference when the dental hygienist prob the teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for one month now and haven&#x27;t had any problem. The reservoir lasts 2-3 uses. There are different power settings, I use 4/10.</li>
    <li> Works the way it should but my kids refuse to use it. So I can&#x27;t give it a bad review. Just poor usage on our part! Works better than the one we had growing up. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Originally, I had a different water flosser to assist while I had braces.  It worked great...then I dropped it with the pik still intact and it was over. I decided to purchase a different type of water flosser (this one) and I could not believe how much this one did in terms of reaching tough places.  Now that my braces are gone, I still use this product.  My dental routine now include this little guy and honestly, it is not complete without this flosser.  I still floss using regular dental floss, but this flosser does help with tough places.  I also like all the attachments that came with the flosser.  I have not used them all but I love having a choice depending on what I am trying to achieve.</li>
    <li> Great for oral hygiene, when I actually use it.  It&#x27;s a good machine, but there is nothing like a good electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I use this right after I floss with traditional floss. It takes only 30 seconds and the well holds enough for that. It does get some junk that regular flossing doesn&#x27;t get, so I like that.</li>
    <li> Is really easy to use, and clean all the spots that not even the floss get.... I dont have to use the floss anymore !!!!!</li>
    <li> It makes me feel I&#x27;ve done a good job of cleaning my mouth.  It does the work efficiently and quietly.</li>
    <li> got it last week and only used it less than 6 times, the button on the handle now stuck and will not work..junk!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how clean my mouth feels after using the waterpik! Also, I had trouble cleaning under bridgework...this really helps. So far I have only used the regular tip and the little tip with the rubber pic. My husband and I both think it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is easy and convenient to use.  I feel it does the job given the particles it removes.  I have had the Waterpik over a month now and I&#x27;ll see how my follow-up appointment goes with the hyganist who recommended my using the product.</li>
    <li> I have a palet expander in right now and my orthodontist told me to look into this. Im Constantly getting junk stuck in my axpander when i eat (Which is gross) but this makes my mouth feel clean and fresher that regular floss. it comes with so many different piks that can be helpful with everything.</li>
    <li> i use this every morning, I mean which would you rather do, use that string floss and cut your gums up and waste time, or use this and clean your teeth in less than 30 seconds!  I choose this.  I would NOT recommend the battery operated one, though, between my husband and I, we used 3 in less than a year and you cannot replace the battery.  They are useless after approximately 6 months............  this one is much better.</li>
    <li> It leaks water from just below where you put the attachments on. It is so messy to clean up, that I&#x27;ve hardly used it.</li>
    <li> upon initial use the blue button on the handle would consistently get stuck in the pressed down position, rendering it useless. i struggled with this thing for almost an hour in a nonstop battle with this button. very annoyed. this product had so much promise. hopefully when i return this one and get its replacement the problem will cease. but after seeing first hand what happened the FIRST time i used it, i am doubtful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had different ones over the years but this one is the best so far.  It is very streamline for the countertop and is just the right size for cleaning my teeth and gums.  I love it.</li>
    <li> The water carrier is a little smaller than the previous water pk I owned but still has plenty of capacity.  Love the top stroage,  Much cleaner, more compact so doesnt take up as much counterspace and easy to use and adjust.  Received in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. (But I forgot that USA is 110v cf Australia 240v. Soon fixed though.)  Quiet and effective and compact. I can take it travelling.</li>
    <li> Far superior and quieter than the older model!!  Highly recommend!  Lot&#x27;s of nice extra accessories.  Has cleaner style of reservoir.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these after a particularly horrifying cleaning at the dentist during which I considered asking for a transfusion. My teeth had a lot of tartar and my puffy, inflamed gums weren&#x27;t doing much but running away and lining me up for dentures. Also, 30 minutes with the pick HURTS. A lot. Flossing did not help. I have a small jaw and 32 teeth, and even using super-thin tape floss daily was not making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist told me I had early stage gum disease, and recommended that either I undergo a costly laser procedure, or I try using a Waterpik. They sold them for $55 at the dentist (plus tax). I bought mine on Amazon for $36 with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it once a day (at night) the day I got it. Fill it with warm water (warmer than you would use to rinse after brushing. Shooting even lukewarm water at your teeth below the gumline is painfully cold) and start at 1. My gums were uncomfortable at first, and a little sore of the first 2-3 days, but my mouth felt amazingly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3-4 weeks, I had ramped up to 10 (max pressure) and was blasting my teeth daily. I kept it up every day, and at my next 6-month cleaning ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no gum disease. I had the pick for a total of 3 minutes, no bleeding, no pain, and she and the dentist made offhand comments about how unusually pink and health my gums were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year (now down to every other day) and my gums are still in great shape. Teeth are staying cleaner, my mouth is healthier, and getting a cleaning is now a pleasant experience. Might be the best, longest-lasting $36 I&#x27;ve ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself is simple to use and even simpler to clean. I was it out with dish soap once a month and cleaning the heads daily. Mine came with 5 or 6 different kinds, but I pretty much use the standard head exclusively. Pressure settings are great. You could use setting one on a child (don&#x27;t, unless the dentists say to, though), and by the time you reach 10, you&#x27;ll wish it went to 20.</li>
    <li> Stiff tubing is a drawback and also that you have to hold the button down to make the water stop flowing. Otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this product, it is very simple and easy to use. The price is amazing, worth buying. By</li>
    <li> I never realized how much food is left in your mouth after brushing until I bought this waterpik. It gets food between the teeth that normal brushing misses even though I use a sonicare. Leaves your mouth feeling cleaner! Should have bought one years ago and my mouth would have stayed healthier</li>
    <li> My old Waterpik finally died and I ordered this to replace it.  It is compact, works perfectly with different water speeds and really makes my teeth and gums feel clean.</li>
    <li> The water flosser does what it says it will do..  Like it very much.  Cleans between teeth very nicely.  like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik since I had braces at 11 years old (thats 46 years now). The connector hose on my most recent one finally broke, so I needed a new one. This one doesn&#x27;t push the water quite as hard (sometimes you just want the pain) and the water trough doesn&#x27;t hold as much water, but the new tools it comes with are a nice addition. Overall I gotta say if you&#x27;ve never tried one, its a great addition to your oral hygiene regime.</li>
    <li> I have had this waterpik for about 7 years. It has worked ok. A few things broke on it, like the plastic holder where you hang it up and the on/off button that turns it off in mid stream while the jet is flowing -- that stopped working after a year. The problem now is that green gunky mold like stuff is inside the end/tip and tubing where the water comes out and I can&#x27;t seem to clean it out. Also I took the tip off and inside where the water feeds into the tube, is all this black/green gunky moldy looking stuff. I have tried to clean it out but who knows what is lingering in the white corded tubing where the water flows into and then into the tip. Probably filled with mold. I may have to throw the thing away and get a new one. I have tried to run H202 through it to clean the \\&quot;mold\\&quot; out to no avail. I have also tried to get the mold out of the tip by soaking, etc. but it is still there. I guess it is time for a new one.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for about 10 days. I can already tell a big improvement in my gums. I use it sometimes with plain water and sometimes with a little hydrogen pyroxide. Its terrific.</li>
    <li> I would not be without my waterpik, for me the most important part of my dental care.  My old waterpik lasted for about ten years - I used it twice every day and I was disappointed when it finally stopped working.  Now that I have this new model I am glad to see that it is even an improved model.  It does a fantastic job of removing food debris even though I find it to have a more gentle water jet pressure.  I only have to use setting 5 to get great results.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WATERPIK PRODUCT TO ANYONE WITH CROWNS, BRIDGEWORK OR DENTURES - ALSO PEOPLE WITH PERFECT TEETH !!</li>
    <li> This came exactly as described and expected. The only con I can think of is that it is a little bit louder than I expected.  It gives you numerous different fittings to clean your teeth and works really well.  I would recommend it to anyone unless you are trying to use it in a library...</li>
    <li> After complaining about how my teeth doesn&#x27;t feel clean after brushing, I started using this WaterPik.  My dentist doesn&#x27;t suggest to use it as a main method of flossing because physically running the floss thread through the teeth is way more effective in getting particles out.  I was told those who struggle with manual flossing then the WaterPik is a great help.  I use it to supplement with my brushing.  After I manually floss and then brush my teeth, I use the Pik to squirt water through the teeth to give my teeth/mouth a refreshing feeling.  I actually like the feeling of squeakiness after I WaterPik.  Besides that clear squirt head you usually see on the cover, the equipment comes along with many more other kinds of heads to switch out for different uses.  One thing that kind of turns me off is the noise because I lived a roommate when I first used this machine and it would be considerate of me to use this in the bathroom while someone&#x27;s sleeping.  So yeahhhh, it&#x27;s not THAT quiet.  As you turn it on, there will be a high-pitched, pulsating sound.  The Pik has settings you can adjust for speed.  Overall, it is great to use when you cannot physically floss or want to go the extra length to taking care of your teeth on top of regular regimen.</li>
    <li> We reviewed all of the waterpiks on Amazon and the reviews pointed towards this product.  It did not disappoint.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and allows you to adjust the water flow rate for your personal comfort level.  It does come with many different attachments but I just use the regular one.  I&#x27;m a bit worried that over time there will be some build-up inside of the extension hose.  I disagree with other reviewers and I think this flosser is fairly noisy, but not enough to bother me.  The flexible hose and rotating tip make this product super easy to use.  My teeth and gums feel wonderful each time I use it.  I can tell that it&#x27;s reducing the amount of gum irritation I used to get.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I received it, but I was shocked when I read that it could not be used with more than 125 voltage as the voltage we use in Spain is 220, it was not possible to use it. I decided to return it and the shipping hadn´t been  refunded.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, a note should be added to electrical items saying that in Europe might not be possible to use it.</li>
    <li> If stars are not enough; please stop asking for my review. I could just as easily not do any of it and just delete your emails.</li>
    <li> I have some deep pockets on a couple of molars and even flossing and brushing doesn&#x27;t get all the junk out, but this pulsating jet clears out all debris that normally you need to go to the dentist to remove.  It has saved me from abscesses many times.  I even have a small traveling type that runs on rechargable batteries but nothing beats the Waterpik Ultra.</li>
    <li> Took some practice to learn how to use it but now I love it.  I soon will be buying one for my wife.</li>
    <li> I have wanted one of these for a while.  I was originally going to get the handheld one but this counter unit had better reviews.  I have used it a few times now and I can feel such a difference.  My mouth feels cleaner and my breath is actually fresher.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> well, technically it works pretty well. But my biggest issue with it is, after a while, like maybe a month, the first 5 seconds water tastes like..... shoes!  I change my water everyday, but it still tastes like shoes... even though it is fine after 5 secs, but makes me concerned, did it have mold in it ???</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended we get one of these since my daughter just got braces. It&#x27;s perfect...for the both of us!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for over 4 months now.  i love it.  have not had a problem yet.  i can&#x27;t believe what it flushes out even after brushing.  i don&#x27;t like to floss, and therefore don&#x27;t.  this is a good alternative.  its not as good as flossing, but definitely better than not flossing, for me at least.  i prefer to use very warm water as the cooler water bothers my teeth.  note:  if the reservoir is filled with water, but nothing is coming out of the tip it may be that the reservoir isn&#x27;t sitting &amp;#34;down&amp;#34; enough.  a gentle push down always starts up the flow.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dental hygiene tech to use.  I was skeptical at first but it actually cut down the amount of tartar, stains and plaque.  It works.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and it is great. I don&#x27;t use floss any more. My mouth smells great and fells it also</li>
    <li> We bought our waterpik the beginning of  January 2013 before both getting braces...We often wonder how someone with braces could possibly floss thoroughly without it, must be disgustingly half-azz cause there is no way it&#x27;s possible to do as good of a job as the water pik... Another thing is we bought an extra pick(not the entire water pick but a replacement pick $6.00) so that we don&#x27;t share the standard pick only because the regular pick Is far superior to the other 5 that comes with the waterpik , even when it comes to the pic that&#x27;s especially for braces... And me being the germs freak That I  am , as much as I love my husband I felt kinda gross sharing the same pick , it&#x27;s like sharing a toothbrush...&lt;br /&gt;  Three days ago (early May 2013 ) we bought another waterpik as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for our mom because she uses regular floss all the time, and the waterpik is Sooo much easier to use and does a better job ...its an excellent gift hands down!!!&lt;br /&gt;  The first few weeks of using it seems difficult and  you may use all the water up before finishing flossing and have to refill the jar but as you get better at it one jar of water is more than enough and flossing is much easier and not painful or makes your gums bleed as you may initially..... ( I think your gums gets healthier and tougher which is great)&lt;br /&gt;  So I highly recommend for any one that&#x27;s particular when it comes to there oral health best flosser hands down , we love it !!!  HIGHLY recommend with No issues at all...</li>
    <li> I have already written a review given 5 star to this product, but SOMEHOW amazonas didn&#x27;t like it, so I have to write it again.&lt;br /&gt;Great design, functionality, just perfect. Would definitely recommend to my friends and enemies too:).</li>
    <li> This water pix is fine.  I bought it after having part of the bottom of my tongue removed for oral cancer to keep my teeth and gums clean.  The only problem I have had is that the button you hold to prevent the water from shooting out after turning on the pix has stuck a couple times.</li>
    <li> great product compares its price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure I will buy one again when mine is gone bad: thank you so much</li>
    <li> I had this for about a year and only used it a few times.  I recently went to use it and it was dead.  Tried different outlets.  Tried everything I could think of, but no luck</li>
    <li> So much better than flossing.  Very easy to use but need to keep the setting low when you first use it.  Use it every night (cap of Listerine and water) and has made a huge difference in the health of my gums.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why people like this thing. Thank goodness for Costco and their return policy. Very messy! You have to be careful or the water will splash you. Plus, you have to have your head tilted down so the water splashes towards the sink and not in the mirror. But, when I like to floss, I like to look in the mirror to see how I am flossing. This thing makes no sense. Sometimes sticking with old school waxed thread is much easier.</li>
    <li> This is my second Water Pic and I must say this new style has several improvements that makes it much better than the last.  The cord is much easier to store, the pressure switch on the side really works well and the on-off button on the wand does make it much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Great for cleaning the hard to floss places between bridge work.  I use a solution of mouthwash and water in the tank.  The number setting gives you the ability for gentle or through cleaning the debris out between your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Get one of theses and use it a time or two during the day and your teeth and gums will thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this particularly for cleaning under a new bridge I got. The method and stuff the dental hygienist gave me was way too awkward to use. This thing is great. It seems to do a much better job in cleaning between the teeth, and is certainly a lot less of a gum irritant than traditional flossing. For as expensive as good floss is, this thing will pay for itself in savings in no time. It&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Amazon because my dentist recommended it.  It works great and everyone should have one in their family.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this product sooner. It is amazing what a super job the Waterpik does! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My gums were receding pretty badly.  I went to a dentist and he said he would rate my teeth an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;, but my gums a &amp;#34;C-&amp;#34;.  I have been using this product for about a month and my gums are growing back! I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work so I&#x27;m thrilled!  I use it with water, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda all mixed together.  I would recommend this to anyone before expensive cleanings.</li>
    <li> does exactly what i expect it to do.  WORKS PERFECT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND.  portable one does work little weak but that is to be expected from a battery</li>
    <li> Previous WP finally ran out of pressure; this version works much more efficiently but seems to be louder than predecessor</li>
    <li> This is a great water flosser. It come with many attachments, and was reasonably priced. We&#x27;ve used it for nearly 3-1/2 years.</li>
    <li> We got this for our son who has braces, he was not getting his teeth clean enough.  We thought this would help him out.  It has been great he actually looks forward to brushing his teeth in the morning and at night.  There is a special attachment for those with braces, so that was a nice bonus.  The other nice thing is my husband and I can use it since it has several attachments with it.  I like that it has the settings to make the pressure fast or slow as well.  Great investment!!</li>
    <li> Ever since I got one of these a year ago my visits to the dentist have been positive.  That being said, there are a couple things I didn&#x27;t like.  One is that there is no gravity stop on the hose such that if it drops off the holder on the unit, the entire water supply drains onto the floor.  And the plastic support for the hose breaks easily, as it did for the first one I bought.  Which is why I just bought another one.  Even with those flaws, it is a very useful product.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ok, I bought my 3rd one, this time from Walmart instead and so far no cracks in the holder. I wonder if the problem was fixed. Still no gravity feed block to prevent drainage.</li>
    <li> I recently began an extensive dental repair regimen and my periodontist strongly suggested I buy a good Waterpik.  Well, this is it!  I just received it today and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Very easy to use and extremely effective!</li>
    <li> First time I have ever used a waterpic and am in love with it.  I am classified as a clean nut and and feel that my gumline around the teeth are definitely improved. I have 4 bridges and the waterpic does an excellent job of cleaning under them.  I highly recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> This thing helped me a lot! I was able to reverse a serious gum condition (bleeding gums and deep gum pockets). While my goal was to use it daily, I  ended up using only 3-4 times a day while adding Listerine or peroxide. At my last periodontal evaluation I had no bleeding at all and many pocket measurements decreased from 4&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s (I even had some 6&#x27;s) down to 2s and 3s.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you&#x27;ll be amazed and disgusted by how much it will get out from between teeth and under the gums, even after thorough brushing and regular flossing. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love the device. It is so effective and I love it because I for the life of me can not floss properly. Great substitute. I ordered a second machine for my spouse.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I try a waterpik, so I purchased this one. I like that there is a trough and the adjustable pressure. Totally take your time increasing the pressure. I actually hurt my gums one day because it was too strong. I also recommend putting in warm water if you have sensitive teeth. I filled the trough with cold water once and my teeth were not too excited about it. I like all the attachments, but I really not sure what to do with all of them yet. I have only used the main tool so far. Thus, so far, so good. :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. Having been using this brand for over ten years, my dentist, tells me a have zero plaque.</li>
    <li> The name says it all... The company has been around forever and they have a great product here...my dental checkups have been a lot better and this machine will make those &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; smaller...</li>
    <li> My dentist reccomeded this product and I am very pleased with the results. My mouth feels so clean after using it. The dentist said he has seen results in his patients that use this system.</li>
    <li> I use this on the weekdays and it&#x27;s amazing. My first day of using it and my chompers has never felt cleaner and I&#x27;m not exaggerating, I highly recommend this flosser. You think your teeth are clean after a good brushing? No, no, try this, then you&#x27;ll know what I mean. I wish the electrical cord was longer though! I live in an old house and there are no outlets in my bathroom. :( I&#x27;m worried about some of the other reviews of there being mold so as a precaution, I detach the tip and shake the excess water from the handle out, then I let the handle hang upside down and hope gravity does the job.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended by my dentist and I am still very happy that I bought it. I love all the attachments as well</li>
    <li> I bought this water pik on the advice of my dentist. I love it and use it often during the day!  Once I saw how effective it is in cleaning my teeth I want to use it after eating anything! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product and with whole Amazon experience. Waterpik takes a little getting used to but works great. Recommend this model due to pause button, water reservoir, and attachments.</li>
    <li> Finally, my mouth feels truly clean.  The variety of piks really helps too. Has the flexibility to handle the job</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it incorrectly or something, but I find my regular dental floss much more effective. . . .</li>
    <li> This machine fits perfectly on my rather small sink. It is easy to fill and the top keeps out dust (which my old water pik did not have). The different speeds work well and I generally just use the standard sprayer head. Within a week you will see a difference in your gums. My gums tend to be sensitive and bleed easily but within a week that had all stopped. You will be amazed (and kind of grossed out) by the amount of food in your teeth even after a good brushing that your waterpik will find!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter who just got braces.&lt;br /&gt;She said it worked great.  That is high praise from her.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over a month, and use it every day.  It is small, quiet, and cleans very well.  I sometimes floss afterwards and I can&#x27;t find any food particles and my gums aren&#x27;t sensitive to the flossing either.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I Have used a similar product before. This functions as well as or better than those previously used.</li>
    <li> I had one before for a long time and after bending the cord so many times it frayed and blew up while I was using it but I&#x27;ll be more mindful of that now. I love the way my mouth feels after I use it. New users will always have bleeding gums and pain but it&#x27;s only temporary. Your gums get very strong and healthy!</li>
    <li> This one is pretty good that both my wife and me are used to using it every evening. &amp;#34;2 more words required.&amp;#34;??? I don&#x27;t like this for product review.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a water flosser.  I bought it to floss under bridges which I found impossible to do with traditional floss. It is easy to use and reaches food particles under bridges and else ware as you can see them fall into the sink. Water flossing for me is slightly messy so it is good to have a towel handy to wipe up around the sink area.  I can not comment on longevity as I have only had this for a few days.</li>
    <li> After a couple months of using this product I can say that I really like it. It does a good job of getting extra junk out of the crevices in my teeth that brushing leaves behind. I also feel that after continued regular use that the health of my gums has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had initially bought this because I have a filling that dental floss catches on; I was worried about yanking out the filling.  I thought the Waterpik would be a suitable replacement for flossing, but unfortunately, with my tight gaps I can&#x27;t get between the teeth like I can with regular floss. So I will continue to do both!</li>
    <li> I have used another product previously. This one is better and does a great job. I like the various speeds of the water flow.</li>
    <li> I used one of these when I had braces, many years ago, &amp; haven&#x27;t tried one since.  So far,&lt;br /&gt;I think this is great.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s smaller &amp; that it has a covered reservoir.  Whether&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s working for me or not remains to be seen, though.  My next dental appointment isn&#x27;t for a couple&lt;br /&gt;of months.</li>
    <li> This is the only water pik flosser I have ever used.  Gets teeth super clean, even after using dental floss.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping...Perfect Product...Use it Everyday...Clean Bill of Health at The Dentiest...Great for Healthy Gums and Gets Between your Teeth Where The Brush Misses...I Highly Recommend This...It Also Comes With Extra Attachments...A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I used it a few nights after I received it. it was my first time using this kind of device and it works so good. My mouth felt so clean and good afterwards, It just made a lil mess with splattering water.</li>
    <li> One advantage of the Waterpik that is seldom stressed is the extent to which it saves time. I&#x27;m sure I notice this more than most because I have to eat standing, because a spinal disease makes it painful to sit. However, I can&#x27;t stand for long because of a another disease.  By the time I am finished with the meal I&#x27;m already starting to hurt and want to lie down.  If I have only a toothbrush, it pushes some debris in while it is getting some out. So it is necessary to follow up with flossing to feel clean.  However, by then I already used up all my \\&quot;standing quota\\&quot; so I have to head for bed feeling uncomfortably unfinished. With the Waterpik I can get all the heavy and fine debris flushed out and feeling quite clean in no time. I can then take a break and finish off with a brush at my convenience.  The Waterpik is a huge advantage for anyone who, like me, measures time in seconds, not minutes.</li>
    <li> added this product to my oral hygiene regime. It helps keep my teeth cleaned and mouth fresh.  It is a nice complement to my electric tooth brush.  thanks,</li>
    <li> Love this product for flossing.  It gets food out between teeth &amp; just under gums better than string flosses.  Even bought one for my daughter&#x27;s house so when I visit, I can use it there.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday---very easy to use and does a great job........my husband now uses it also....told my dental hygienist that I took her advice and bought one....Joan</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;dinged&amp;#34; this one star because it is a little awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue is this: When you use this, you have to lean over the sink and hold the unit at an angle that keeps water from dripping on the controls and the unit itself. This is as I wrote in the title a learning curve that you have to negotiate. Once you figure out the optimal angle for the device and for your body, it is easy to use. You may end up spraying the mirror, yourself, or the immediate area with water before you master the use of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Water Flosser comes with a variety of tips. I found the tip with the smallest opening and the plaque remover tip the most useful for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with crowded or overlapping teeth may find this a much easier and more effective way to clean between teeth and to get down into the gum area. I have noticed a definite improvement in the state of my gums and the way my teeth feel after using this. The cost is nominal given the cost of deep gum cleaning and it makes my mouth feel very fresh.</li>
    <li> Our 11 year old recently got braces-was having trouble getting his teeth as clean as he needed to. Grandma to the rescue! She talked to one of her customers(she&#x27;s a sales rep for our local paper) and they told her that this Waterpik was a lifesaver for their grandson! Our son LOVES it-it&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job!</li>
    <li> Hard to get used to and to operate, and I&#x27;m not sure it does the job I bought it for.</li>
    <li> I think it is good product and seems effective in cleaning cavities. Operation wise push button should work in reverse mode like press button to start jet not otherwise.</li>
    <li> Crude but effective! The top container for attachments doesn&#x27;t lock and you have to be careful not to spill them as there are more attachments than spots for them, but that minor thing aside, this thing works like a charm. Really great! Gives you superbly clean and fresh feeling. Should have gotten it years ago! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 months twice a day and it works great. Especially the back deep pockets. I leave the water tank on the unit and have had no leaks. Also I run a bleach solution through it once a week to prevent any mold which a review described. For the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> After many years of my dentist trying to get me to floss daily, he said, &amp;#34;if you won’t floss everyday at least get a waterpik and see if you will use it&amp;#34;  Deciding that I like my teeth but knowing I’m not going to floss daily I made the purchase.  It’s easy to setup, but be prepared to soak everything in your bathroom the first week.  The key is to keep your mouth closed when it is spraying water, which sounds easy, but was not a quick habit for me to learn.  After 2 weeks I was a pro though, it’s one of those things where it is better to just get in a routine on how to use it and not try to think about how it works.  It’s been a month now and I don’t use it every day, but I never go more than 2 days without using it.  It makes your teeth and gums feel really clean and it is so quick and easy to use I find myself reaching for it without thinking.  I’m still amazed at the random objects that get dislodged from my teeth.  It is a little loud, but it is basically a miniature pressure washer.  The force it great, I doubt you will need it on high unless you want to spray someone across the room, which it will do easily!</li>
    <li> Ok, before I start I would like to mention that I just had my tooth extractions done about 2 weeks prior to this review. They had taken 4 tooths out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist tells me I needed to floss a lot more then I usually do, which was never. The closest to flossing was me picking my teeth. So today my waterpik came in and by this time I&#x27;ve been eating solid foods for a week. Within this week my tooth extraction site on my bottom left side had been gathering so much food particles in there that I would&#x27;ve never known without the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it was amazing to say the least. I fired this thing on and started flossing right away. I had manually floss a few hours before and the Waterpik was able to pick out some that I had missed. This indicated that I had already started liking this product. But what made me like this a lot more was when I had set it to the lowest setting so I can use it on my tooth extraction site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What came out of my bottom left site was so nasty and disgusting that this has now convinced me to water floss every morning and night from now on. I didn&#x27;t expect to have this happen because I tried my best not to get stuff trapped in there and if it did i would get it out. But this extraction site was too small for me to tell that there was something in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very grateful to have gotten this now, I didn&#x27;t have the intention to be using it to get stuff out of my extraction sites but for the readers out there I definitely recemmend this if you got your wisdom teeth removed and still have a tiny hole from the extraction. It will take so much crap out that it&#x27;ll amaze you.</li>
    <li> Love the waterpik  but hate the sound it makes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way too loud,so I have to use it before my husband goes to bed. Other than that,no complains.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these many years ago.  Today&#x27;s upgraded models are much improved.  Less counter space.  Shutoff on handle and self coiling hose to name a few.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have changed to this model a long time ago. I always used the rechargeable model for the convenience, but this one is so much better. Don&#x27;t have to refill multiple times and the strength of the water flow on the highest level is almost doubled. It looks like it would take up a lot of space on your counter, but it is more compact than it appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it with listerine type mouthwashes, it is Important to run it through with plain water afterwards or the mechanisms can get clogged.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is great. I just do not like to use it. I expected it to replace all other means of cleaning the teeth but it does not.</li>
    <li> Love the flosser. Arrived in good condition and on time. I have only used the Water Flosser for a few days but love it compared to the regular thread one. It cleans more thoroughly and I feel that gums are much better because of this.</li>
    <li> As I have gotton older, my teeth have developed spaces and food keeps getting caught inbetween. Even though I brush 3 times a day, use dental floss everyday, and rinse my mouth out, there is still some food caught in those spaces. My hygenist recommended using a Waterpik and when I saw the video on this product I decided to purchase it to see if it would make any difference. I am happy to report that I no longer have food stuck between the spaces of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;I have mine set on 6 because any higher and my gums hurt. I have had this product for almost a month and even took it with me on my 2 week vacation. I haven&#x27;t yet used any of the other attachments this comes with. The waterpik itself is all I really need.</li>
    <li> I heard about this for years, but not even thought about using it. Came back from dentist, my husband said he was recommended to use this. Bought right away. It is great! even my kids are joining us to use it every day... kids love it too..</li>
    <li> Dentist noticed my gums were Finally pink. I mix a little hydrogen peroxide in warm water. And floss....dont be lazy. You only get one set of teeth. Implants or partial&#x27;s are not the same. I know from experience!!! Take care of your teeth. Dental work is expensive and often a sham.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard for people with hand disabilities to use</li>
    <li> Works great, saved a few bucks on Amazon.  not quite the pressure I thought it would have, but I just put it high and it does the job !</li>
    <li> I was all excited about buying this Water Pik. I used it once a day. After 40 days I found the holder where you return the Pik to was cracked after normal use. The Pik wouldfall on the counter. I packed it up and paid the shipping cost (it was 10 days over Amazon&#x27;s reurn policy). Amazon did credit me for this purchase. I went on-line, read the reviews and decided on the Panasonic wireless water irrigator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two other water picks in the past. The first one was only so-so. I wound up throwing it away after a year and going back to floss. The second was was great and included a charging base for an electric toothbrush. Great product but it only lasted for about three years before the water hose crumbled into little pieces. I&#x27;ve read that this is a problem with all Waterpik products but I still bought another one. This machine is great. I never felt like the previous ones were cleaning good enough but this one, set at 10, could maybe blast your teeth away. I&#x27;m not brave enough to put it at that setting but at 6 it cured my gum problems after a week. At this price I don&#x27;t mind if I need to replace it again in a few years. But hopefully the next one will have a plastic hose that won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Just love the water pick.  My dentist recommended I get one, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Thanks, Jaclynn Reynolds</li>
    <li> After years of smoking, stained teeth and a threat from my dentist while holding a drill in her hands I ordered this to replace regular flossing to try and improve my gums health. So far the unit has worked and has not failed, plus my gums look much better and my dentist no longer waves a drill at me when I visit for checkups, I think that says it all.</li>
    <li> got braces. ortho said to waterpik. this really makes a difference in keeping my teeth clean. the ortho tip is great for getting in between thr wires. i even got one for my moms house so that i dont have to take this one when i travel</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 4 months now, and it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another for my parents.</li>
    <li> I got one of these a month ago and have enjoyed using it almost daily. It cleans my teeth and gums with a warm stream of water. I put medicated rinse in mine.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It seemed to work ok [ makes a loud noise ] with ordinary daily use until 1 week ago.  Then began to hesitate to start and finally stopped working.  No accident or abuse.  I am not hard on equipment and can fix most things.  Does not seem designed or built for durability.  I suspect this model has a high failure rate.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I have used this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for about a year now.  I had great success using this product with Periogen.  Due to the high cost of the Periogen, I stopped using it and switched to baking powder and water which has not worked out as well for me.  Nonetheless, the Waterpik itself is really quite awesome.  Certainly an excellent value for the money and much easier and fun to use than traditional dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple of suggestions though for the manufacturer based on my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I would recommend using a capacitive on/off switch rather than the mechanical switch and I would move that switch to the right side of the device.  Here is the reason why.  Most people, like me, are right handed.  We typically will have this product on the right side of our sink.  When we initially turn on the device, we will stick the tip in our mouth holding it with our right hand to avoid spraying the bathroom.  However, this requires doing a left handed cross over.  The physical switch takes some force.  In fact, I can push the device sometimes when I flip the switch.  If you use your left hand to hold the tip when turning it on, you do a right hand cross and you can cause the device to get pushed to the left or rotated.  If you had a capacitive on/off switch, the lightest touch would activate the device without having to worry about physically moving the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I would recommend adding a re-circulation loop to your device so that the fluid always has a place to move as opposed to being forced into a dead-end when the stop button in depressed.  I personally have had issues with the stop button disengaging when using your product.  I also don&#x27;t like the idea of forcing the pump to work against a dead leg.  If you had a pressurized loop with a Y, you could divert some of the fluid to the tip and have the rest of the fluid return to the vessel.  If you desire to momentarily stop the pump, all flow could be redirected back into the vessel.  It might also be useful to investigate using an electronic switch that would kill the pump.  Alternatively, by having that easy to flip on/off capacitive switch (as featured on the latest Kohler kitchen faucets) you might be able to just eliminate that physical button all together.  If you really wanted to get sophisticated, you might include an electronic switch on the tip handle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Increase the number of tips you include.  I don&#x27;t like spending extra money on shipping and high mark-up on accessories.  Just raise your price and add more tips to the box.  Give your customers enough tips to last 5 years.  It is little signs of good faith like this that make customers happy.  Just do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Buy out Periogen, more rationally price the Periogen product, and then go mainstream.  Make the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and Periogen the defacto method of stopping and reversing gingivitis and periodontal disease.  Back up every meeting with dentists, oral hygienist, and medical doctors with indisputable scientific evidence that your combined product portfolio is the best product on the market.  Fast, easy to use, and effective.  Bill Gates had a dream of putting a PC on every desk running his software.  Your dream ought to be to have a Waterpik Ultra Water Flossers sitting on every personal bathroom counter in the world and and using a steady supply of Periogen to compliment your great product.  Check out my review of Periogen for my criticism of their price gouging.  If you can&#x27;t do a buyout of Periogen, I highly, highly recommend that you start your own R&amp;D division to come up with your own patented formulation for dissolving tartar and washing away harmful gingivitis biofilm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this business with the proper R&amp;D and marketing could be a block buster hit.  We are learning so much from scientific literature about the dangers that oral bacterial poses to the rest of the body.  A Google search led me to WebMD and an article that mentions: \\&quot;To date, scientists have found associations between periodontal disease and a number of other problems, including: heart disease, diabetes, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, and premature birth.\\&quot;  Waterpik could do so much to help folks with their health.  I reference a couple of recent papers that are worth studying in my Periogen review.</li>
    <li> Turn it on water sprays everywere! You have to hould the button in to make it stop spraying!  You should press the button when you wont it to spray! What a mess![[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> The product works very well.  After my next dental appointment I shall find out if the claims that water flossing is so much more effective than thread flossing.</li>
    <li> I have used it for just twice ,and yet it doesn&#x27;t work now . I have used it for just twice ,and yet it doesn&#x27;t work now .</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik for years.  This model is the most compact and best designed yet.  The jet of water seems to be weaker than in the past models, but probably better for your gums.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the idea of this was a bit excessive; but just as an electric toothbrush gets your teeth cleaner than a manual one, the water flosser gets your teeth cleaner than regular flossing.  As other reviewers have suggested, I mix a bit of mouthwash in with the water in the reservoir and that seems to leave my mouth feeling extremely clean.  I recently had 2 temporary crowns put in and the dentist told me when flossing my teeth not to pull the floss down or the crowns might fall out.  Needless to say I&#x27;ve been apprehensive about using regular dental floss, but with the waterpik I am able to clean in between my teeth without the worry of my teeth falling out.  I would recommend this to people of all ages and all types of dental histories.</li>
    <li> I use this at least 2-3 times a day while I&#x27;m home.  Definitely morning and night. If you can&#x27;t floss because you can&#x27;t use your hands very well this is for you.  I could use only one hand when i bought it and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;fast forward 18 months since original purchase.  The unit worked beautifully except I had to throw it out and buy another but not because of the unit; it was the MOLD and moldy smell when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this pik.  About a month or so ago I smelled something moldy every time I used the pik which I use at least twice a day (see above).  I first bought it 18 months ago and no problem with the pik but with the smell when I used it.  I read somewhere on a review here that it is mold.  I even filled the tank with bleach and ran it through, then ran water through it several times after that, and still the mold smell.  I took off the reservoir and looked closely at it.  I took some tissues and wiped off the floor of the tank....YUKKK  All this brown stuff came off the bottom of the tank and here I was, thinking how could this be as I use it twice a day and use fresh water every time I use it?  I washed the whole thing down with bleach and still the mold smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer here said that if you have mold or a moldy smell coming from your unit, you probably have mold in the room.  YIKES!  So I got some of that mold killer which is a gel and sticks to surfaces, and cleaned every single surface I could see.  It worked great and when I used it on my fiberglass suround in my shower/tub, I could see mold where the seams came together and even under an overhang.  YUK.  I don&#x27;t know if the mold stained the fiberglass or I couldn&#x27;t kill it.  I now have a note into my landlord that I think I need the whole thing replaced.  I bet there&#x27;s a whole colony of mold growing behind this tub surround.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned moldy smell and where it could be coming from....she was right and I hopethis helps someone else who smells MOLD when using the unit near the face.</li>
    <li> I never flossed.I mean,never.Did it maybe 5 times my entire life,22 years!And even then,it was only when I had something stuck in my teeth and was in pain.Then,this past Christmas,I got a Target giftcard from my aunt.I was having a lot of tooth pain,especially since I had a molar removed and now can only chew on the right side of my mouth.Brushing didn&#x27;t help,and I thought I was going to have to go to the dentist,which I could not afford.So I Googled &#x27;easier ways to floss&#x27;,and found this waterpic.Looked at the reviews,and figured,heck,its less than $50,and lasts a few years?Okay,I&#x27;ll try it.Bought it from Target,and they price matched Amazon.com.Yay! Brought it home,and tried it out.I thought I might use it once a week,or so.But its so easy,I use it at least once a day,but usually twice!I actually floss once a week now,but never even have plaque or anything on the floss.My gums are so much happier!Saved me $1000&#x27;s at the dentist!I only use the regular tip,and have a battery powered toothbrush,so I use that to massage my gums instead of the tip that comes with the water pic.Oh,this is a tip for new users.Don&#x27;t use cold water!!Use warm water.I found that cold water hurts when it goes down into your gums.Warm is better.Course,maybe thats just because my teeth are sensitive from all the fillings:(&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,this is a great gift for the person who doesn&#x27;t need anymore stuff.Give it to your kid!Show them how to use it.I&#x27;ll bet they will use it more than floss!I wish I had this when I was a kid.Would&#x27;ve saved me from having fillings in every single one of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Bye!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and get rave reviews from my dental hygenist at my semi annual cleanings.  The amount of money saved in dental cost far exceeds the price of the product.</li>
    <li> I have an older model that seem heavier and possibly better made, but I didn&#x27;t use it as often as I should have because everything about it was awkward.  This model was well thought out and I&#x27;m using it daily because it&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> Excellent item; works far better than the competition.  Delivered fast.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It cleans areas that are not touched by floss, and is gentler on your gums than a tooth brush. Really get the whole gum around the tooth clean.</li>
    <li> Very quiet compared to the last water flossers that I have owned. I have worn out 2 of them over the last several years but both of them were very loud, nice to have have this quiet, just hope this one will last at least as long as the other2.</li>
    <li> I purchased this, my first Waterpik, on the advice of my dentist, but decided it was not the method I want to use to floss my teeth. I didn&#x27;t like the manufacturer&#x27;s designs and the fact that the attachment usage was not part of the instructions. I did not like the pause button feature. If anything, it should be for starting the water flow, not stopping it. I got tired of squirting myself and the mirror every time I turned it on! If they made blenders would they want you to pause it every time you wanted to stop it?? I called the manufacturer and asked them if other models were that way and the answer was yes, so I told them they&#x27;ve lost a customer and returned it to the place I bought it. They told me I need to have it in my mouth before I turned it on and I told them they are missing the point of my concern. I&#x27;ve been using conventional dental floss all my life and I&#x27;m going to continue with it.</li>
    <li> I love this machine- different pressures allowed me to start out gently and work up. I had read this machine moved, but I have had no problems. I also like the variety of tips.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik. I had one in the past that was not quite as good as this. I have been using it regularly. I had forgotten how great they are. My whole mouth feels so much cleaner! Warning, this package does not contain the tongue cleaner. I thought it did, and it doesn&#x27;t, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> I thought this water-based cleaner would replace the need for regular flossing but I was wrong. What I found over time was that, although I was using the product as designed, my gums were not effectively getting stronger. In fact, the first time I tried to use regular floss after a few months of using this water-based cleaner my gums bled like I had never flossed in my life before. I did not expect my gums to be so weak which would not have happened had I just continued flossing as usual. This product might be a good ADJUNCT to a regular flossing routine, but certainly cannot be used as a REPLACEMENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also their are some design issues that annoyed me. Firstly, the top cup which holds the water has a tendency to leak on your counters if you forget to FIRMLY snug it down on the base. Secondly, the lid to the top cup has places to hold the various tips that come with the unit. However, there are NOT enough places to hold ALL of the tips which come with the unit and even if there were the lid does NOT hold the tips without them sloshing around inside. Every time you open the lid you have to resort the mess that&#x27;s there. Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer currently using the unit because of these things...</li>
    <li> I used to have the older and basic version of this irrigator but this one beats it in every way. It take a small area and holds plenty of water to clean your mouth thoroughly. It comes with plenty of accessories for any possible ways of cleaning your mouth. The pressure is scary powerful. I have only used it to a bit more than half power and it tears anything between my teeth. I think that if I use it at full power it will probably tear off the flesh from my gums lol. I&#x27;m very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I had gotten deep pockets in my gums - I would floss twice a day and brush my teeth twice a day but they wouldn&#x27;t go away, nor would my the imflammation.  My dental hygienist suggested a Waterpik and  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and my gums are no longer inflamed.  The product is very easy to use and you can control the strength of the flow.  I prefer an 8.  Great quality product and so much better for your gums than flossing because it cleans better below the gum line.</li>
    <li> My kids had hard time with this. It&#x27;s ok for me and it usually takes the whole tank of water for me each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fine jet one, however, it is really hard to dry it when not in use.</li>
    <li> The only problem is the hose springs a leak--you can buy replacement hoses cheap and they are easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Mine seems to spring a leak about every 28 months but maybe I pull them out to far and often.</li>
    <li> Great, this is our second waterpik.  Our first one served us well and this one promises to be even better!</li>
    <li> This came as a gift.  The coiled tubing is too short and stiff. Water goes all over the place because you have to bend down to accommodate the machine instead of over the sink basin.  Ten settings, but you can&#x27;t use them.  After 3 or 4 on the dial the stream can tear your gums, even with healthy tissue.  Even if your gums could take it, the company says the higher pressure settings (10 of them altogether) will split the plastic coil and cause leaks, so you are warned not to use them. Ten settings, but you can use only 3, hmmmm.  So their claim of high flow at the highest setting is meaningless as a selling point, and misleading.  My tubing hardened past stiff and simply broke off one morning.  When I complained to the company they wrote back with a reprimand (which is how I found about how there are only three usable settings and planned obsolescence) but, not to worry, a link to buy more replacement parts!  How kind.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpik nightly for years and years. Always get top grades from my dental hygienist; very little plaque. I think this is the thrid machine I&#x27;ve purchased and is by far the most compact, quiet design yet.</li>
    <li> I love my pik its ok not as powerful as the old model and I dont like that it blasts on right away...takes two hand to operate. But I do like the design of it now the way it curls up and goes back into place nicely</li>
    <li> The button stuck and it quit working 4 months into it - would never purchase again.  It was great for a couple weeks and then the button would stick and the water would not come out.  It is too late to return so I am basically out of 40 something dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it.  Went with this model over the newer version based on other reviews that the newer one was not of the same quality.</li>
    <li> this one does not work good i sent it back and guess what yet no refund</li>
    <li> As this product was being delivered to Australia I believed it would have the correct voltage and wattage for use here, however, it is suitable for the USA.  This was not clearly stated at the time of purchase and not written in the specifications.  Also, my order originated from the Amazon Au site and was transferred to Amazon.com to place my order.  Therefore I am very unhappy with my purchase because it does not work here in Australia or I now have to purchase a power converter unit to be able to use.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works very well. I am a dental assistant and this was recommended by a workmate.  It is easy to use and very adjustable, depending on your comfort level.  The Waterpik is used for gum problems, deep pockets that are hard to clean.  It works as described.</li>
    <li> at least my teeth feels alot cleaner and it is so much more convenient that flossing multiple times in a day; although i have been recommended by my dentist to floss at least once daily evening with the waterpik since either one alone is not considered sufficient by itself</li>
    <li> Purchased this after this particular model had good reviews and price was reasonable compared to other versions. Very helpful in keeping my gums clean, especially since I just had braces put on. One tip: use lukewarm water as suggested in manual. If you&#x27;re not used to the pressure, cold water hurts!</li>
    <li> My dentist on the last visit tried to sell me an $800 treatment for what he called the beginnings of periodontal disease.  I bought this water pic from Amazon for $44 and cured the problem myself.  It works very well; cleans between the teeth very effectively, and saved me a lot of money and grief to boot.</li>
    <li> I used to love my Waterpick but after a couple of years it died.  As a satisfied customer, I ordered 3 more for my sons and one for me.  What a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine goes from #2 to #9 or 10, I don&#x27;t remember but it doesnt matter because the only speed that makes sense and that barely would clean your teeth is the highest one, the 9 or 10.  My question to the manufacturer.  Why bother with numbering the speeds when you know very well that the highest is the only speed that would barely clean the debris between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime next week I must return two.  I asked my son not to bother to open it and I am returning mine. What a disappointment....I used to love my old Waterpik, unfortunately the manufacturer is cutting corners and they have lost this faithful customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azulic</li>
    <li> The tube that runs from the base of the body of the product  and allows pulsating water to reach the handle and tip snapped. Upon writing the company they basically said the product is out of warranty, too bad. I hadn&#x27;t used the product that often. That is, in my opinion, bad customer service of a company that has failed to stand behind it&#x27;s product past the warranty period. Of course, there is no legal obligation on this after the warranty period, but still . . .</li>
    <li> I liked the first one so well that when it failed after five years of continuous usage, I bought another one just like it.  My dentist always tells me &amp;#34;You get an A on your teeth but you get an A+ on your gums&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t go to bed at night unless I have used my Waterpik. It leaves your mouth totally clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disgusted by the junk this thing seems to find that my toothbrush and regular floss missed!  Haven&#x27;t had it long but so far it is working great.  I do have the pressure jacked up to 10 (it doesn&#x27;t go to 11) and occasionally it is a bit too much pressure.  The button to stop water flow is great.  It says you can mix in fluoride to clean your teeth, but the need to completely flush the system out afterwards makes it pointless.  Just clean your teeth with the water then gurgle some mouthwash afterwards.  So far my only wish is that the hose was a little longer.</li>
    <li> I never had a waterpik before. It feels good to massage your gums! The product works as expected. I like the fact that it has a pause button, so you can take breaks without having to turn the whole unit off. I also like the fact that you can adjust the water pressure.</li>
    <li> My teeth are close together and it&#x27;s hard to get the water to go between them, but if I put it on the highest setting, it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very effective. I recommend mainly if you have implants or protheses that are hard to reach with dental floss</li>
    <li> my family and I are all like this tool.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite powerful but adjustable. After using it, I feel much cleaner than just brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> I had to buy another waterpik because my previous from 15 yrs ago went caput! this one is just as good -- it cleans in between my teeth beautifully and I like the plaque fighting head the best</li>
    <li> I have several bridges in my mouth and I needed this product. I use it every day and  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Best item I purchased so far...better than floss or having to use a tooth pick in a pinch...outstanding product; would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The waterpik arrived with it&#x27;s shipping box bent in a few places. The waterpik works fine, equipted with several tips, but no two tips the same, making sharing this device a little creepy. Waterpik needs to provide  multiple same-style tips for multiple users, as this is more important for the average household than numerous &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; tips that no &amp;#34;one-person&amp;#34; will never use.</li>
    <li> I bought this Waterpik to replace one that I had for over 20 years. This is just as good or better than the one I replaced. Works just as they promised.</li>
    <li> cleaner teeth and healthier gums for sure</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a  water-pik to help me keep my teeth clean. I choose this model and have been very pleased with it. My teeth are cleaner, my dentist has noticed less tartar build up between my teeth and I hope to avoid any visits to the periodontist!</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth feel so clean after using the waterpik.  Although the tongue scraper is not the best it is still a good product. :)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works like a charm, quieter than the Interplak it replaced.  Easy to turn on &amp; off, good pressure to clean at gums and remove food particles in between teeth.</li>
    <li> When I bought it, I had to buy the full set for the machine. But normally you only need half of the set. However, it works really well, it doesn&#x27;t hurt like real floss and it cleans out bad smell like no other machine</li>
    <li> Item came quick, great price! It was exactly what we wanted!  My wife thought this was a $200 item... It was recommended by her dentist... But not on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I hate flossing but this makes it easy. I really only use the standard tip and that is all that is really needed.&lt;br /&gt;No more gum bleeding for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these throughout the years and always loved them. This particular one, however, seemed a bit more difficult to use and I finally realized the cord leading to the toothbrush is not lined up correctly. Had I noticed this right away, I would have returned it requesting another one.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist, and it has proved to be easy to use and just what my teeth/mouth needed.</li>
    <li> I love this water pic!  It is much better than my previous battery operated unit.  High tank capacity and lots of pressure.</li>
    <li> Works ok, but flossing will always work better. Kind of pulsates instead of a steady stream (like at the dentist). I&#x27;d still buy it again, if I were to do it over.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my dentist recommended. Easy to use. Only problem is that I wish I used it more often. Not a mechanical problem, it&#x27;s a user problem.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband he uses it every day and loves it</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible. Prepare to get soaked and make a huge mess of your bathroom. Not only that, but it&#x27;s loud. You will be frustrated with this purchase. I returned mine within a week. This also has too many parts. Good luck. Buyer beware, you&#x27;re in for a scare! Read my other reviews. I rate most things highly... Not this though.</li>
    <li> This unit is just the right size.  I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t really big to sit on one side of my Victorian sink and it is perfect.  The pressure is fully adjustable for sensitive areas and the tips it comes with offer everything you could possibly need.  I got it specifically for cleaning around and under a permanent bridge and it does a very good job</li>
    <li> My dentist kept on insisting that I start using the water pick but I held off for almost 6 months. After I bought the Pi. And used it I realized I should have listened to him much earlier!</li>
    <li> This makes me WANT to floss a couple times a day. The lid storage is a bit obnoxious, but overall get yourself a water flosser like this one. Your teeth deserve it.</li>
    <li> I am using it everyday to floss my teeth. Very easy to use and easy to clean. Nice product and will recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used it for several months now, and I have no complaints. This is second Waterpik I&#x27;ve owned. Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work not sure I can send back...I will try only worked for 2 weeks when it did work I liked it.I am very disappointed .</li>
    <li> I have never used this type of product.  I rinsed my mouth with water like crazy, then brushed my teeth very well with sonicare.  Then, I used the waterpik feeling curious if I was going to see any debris from my mouth.  Well I did.  Not a lot, but enough to make me feel that my mouth was not completely clean, and this could have caused cavity or bad breath.  I don&#x27;t know how long the product will last, but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Fortunately I purchased this from Amazon with their no hassle return policy. The handle holding the flosser cracked and broke within a short time. Figuring I got a fluke I purchased another. Within a few months it cracked in the same place. When I phoned Waterpik the rep told me I must be doing something wrong that is not possible to have a product defect. They want to inspect it before replacement. Not only is the product defective, but their customer service is as well.</li>
    <li> For me it was a complete waste of money, my hygienist suggested I get one so on her recommendation I purchased this one. With the control set to max it didn&#x27;t do much. So going to see if I can return it but even that will be a hassle I&#x27;m not sure I want to undertake.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended that my wife use this daily as she has some bridges and other dental work that requires cleaning tahta toothbrush or floss cannot get to.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with it is that the cord going from the waterpik to the base is a bit short. I&#x27;ve accidentally knocked it off of my counter a couple of times just because I tried to stretch too far. The top doesn&#x27;t really lock on to the water tank, so when that happened, my bathroom ended up soaked. Other than that, the product is great. I really only regularly use 1 or 2 tips, but they seem pretty nice overall.</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;it works well. it helps remove small food things between tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Have a good chance to use</li>
    <li> I chose this unit based on the manufactures name and have been completely satisfied with the unit and the supplier. It removes bits &amp; pieces better than floss and leaves my mouth feeling fresher.</li>
    <li> I like using this better than flossing and my teeth and mouth feel much cleaner than with flossing.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The water pressure is strong and it&#x27;s able to dislodge most food particles that are stuck between my teeth.  I don&#x27;t use it often but when I do, it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Made room for thing on the counter top where space is scarce. Put  a cap full of mouthwash in the water and away you go. Even after flossing and brushing with a sonic brush this thing still blows chunks out of the pockets.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested this, since I don&#x27;t floss on a regular basis.  Made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a little wet, but I use it before I put my makeup on.</li>
    <li> This was our first time getting a Waterpik and we like it very much.  The pieces fit well in the holder above the water tank, although it seems like it&#x27;s missing a spot for one of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water pressure is good and the item feels like it&#x27;s well made.  We&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but so far it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
    <li> does a great job of cleaning teeth but it makes a lot of mess especially when putting the handle away</li>
    <li> Love the &#x27;pause&#x27; button on the wand. Don&#x27;t know why the noise should bother anyone since you cannot get good pressure without good, sturdy, mechanisms that inevitably make noise. Cord and tips storage is handled nicely too.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Water Flosser when used with regular flossing nearly eliminates the need for 6 month cleaning.  After using the Waterpik daily, I skipped my routine cleaning for nearly 2 years and had less tarter buildup than I normally had with my 4 month scheduled cleaning.</li>
    <li> it did everything it advertised it would. it does a really good job. I would recommend this to all ages</li>
    <li> If, like me, you find flossing to be an unpleasant hassle then a Waterpik can be a welcome alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the unit for a week or so and it performs as expected and does a good job cleaning your teeth.  Particularly welcome is the ability to adjust the intensity of the stream.  While far from silent it is not quite as loud as some older models were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said the unit feels like it is as cheaply built as it is possible for them to make it.  The whole thing screams flimsy and shoddy workmanship and design.  My parents had a waterpik way back in the day and even then the units were not exactly marvels of fine workmanship, fit and finish but it is very apparent that the company has cut just about every corner possible when building this product and still managing to work.  Every time I use it I expect a flimsy knob to fall off or the motor to stop working or the hose to spring a leak or the pik connector to fail.  Felt like that right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I would gladly pay more for a better built, quieter and better looking unit but I could find no such alternatives.  As long as this works though it does the job pretty well.</li>
    <li> Love to floss with this flossed found it removes more derby than floss.</li>
    <li> For me it was quite a hassle to use this. It&#x27;s loud and my husband sleeps later than I do... so it always woke him up.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me my teeth and gums look better.  I love how it just takes out all the food between your teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know way I wait to much time looking for this, is really good I have one big and one for traveling</li>
    <li> This product leaked at the handle so I returned it but I have heard other people really liked it and didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I tried the portable first but could not stand holding all that noise in my hand. this machine works well enough to use, is quieter than the item above. and I think my dentist will love me now. I use it with warm water, or mix in a little baking soda. the reservoir is large enough for about 3 coffee cups full of water so take your time. some folks say these devices push plaque under the gum line. well, maybe, maybe not. what goes up must come down especially when you using a power rinse... good customer service folks.</li>
    <li> Been using almost a week and have to say I wish I had purchased years ago.  Amazing how easy it is to use and how clean my teeth feel.  So much better than using string floss. A little messy when you forget to lean over sink but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I use my Waterpik water flosser twice a day---once in the morning and once at night before I go to sleep!!! It&#x27;s a wonderful little machine. I get plack as apposed to cavities and this tool really helps a LOT!!!! I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Makes oral hygeine faster. So much easier than flossing. Easy to use. I recommend it to anyone that has a hard time flossing</li>
    <li> i bought it for a recomendatios from my odhontologist but as son as i get it become to be used by the whole family members. we all love it-</li>
    <li> It was suggested by my hygenist that I get a water flosser.  I don&#x27;t see the difference using this vs. rinsing my mouth out with water.  Is it just me?</li>
    <li> I think this works great, good pressure. I just wish i didn&#x27;t have to fill the water tank so often.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  It has a very good selection of jet pressure, and is super easy to keep clean.  I particularly like the covered reservoir (the cover has an integral attachment case - I thought that would be useful, but it turns out to not be needed.  Maybe if you share the pik, but otherwise not so much.  That&#x27;s just a nit, and in no way detracts fro the five star rating.</li>
    <li> Works great. Better than the old unit I had from waterpik which I had for years but finally gave up</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son with braces. It works well and is easy to use.  Good quality and helps him keep his braces clean.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous way to floss your teeth.  I just got braces and can&#x27;t stand to have food between my teeth.  The waterpik works great.  After meals I just blast the food out in very little time and feels very clean.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Well, doctor says don&#x27;t use too strong of setting and not recommended immediately after surgery but my hubby loved it and insist on showing me the food bits he gets out after each meal.  Gross but i&#x27;m glad he enjoyed it...and used it frequently which may or may not help but he didn&#x27;t get any infection so, I suppose it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; is between your teeth that the Waterpik is able to easily dislodge. My hygienist recommended the Waterpik and I guess with good reason, it works. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that the various piks are stored in the container that is atop the water tank so it has to be lifted off to add water...not a big deal (it&#x27;s good that there is a built-in storage place on the device for the piks).</li>
    <li> I gave this a 4 out of 5 rating because it does a good job at what&#x27;s designed to do, clean between your teeth and gums.  Use warm water and either ur favorite mouth wash or hydrogen peroxide and it really helps in giving a good cleaning.  However, I&#x27;ve owned 4 of these so far.  4 or over the last 12 years.  It&#x27;s motor breaks down after about 3 years of daily use.  It&#x27;s short life span is why I won&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Bathroom has never been washed as often as when I first started to learn how to lean over the sink as I used this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik for myself, because I have several dental crowns that make my gum sore when I use traditional floss.  I was told that my pockets around my dental crowns were deep.  This works perfectly and noticed that the gums around my crowns no longer bleed and appear stronger.  Waiting for my next dental checkup to see if the dentist will notice the change.</li>
    <li> Love this product....works well if you hate flossing the regular way:-)</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Feels cheaply made. I tried putting it on the highest pressure to see how it can hold. Unfortunately, it just start squirting water bit by bits out. It&#x27;s not like a constant stream like you see in the commercials. Any pressure higher than 4 would cause the handle to shake and makes it hard to hold. Water also started leaking out from the handle. The water in the container won&#x27;t last more than 10 seconds if you don&#x27;t put it on the lowest pressure. The lower pressures don&#x27;t even seem to make any difference..,might as well just throw some water in your mouth. For returns, they charge $10 and up. Overall, not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love to use it :) thanks</li>
    <li> we use it several times a day&amp;#60; once you do&amp;#60; your teeth don&#x27;t feel clean without it</li>
    <li> Okay, read the reviews and I ended up replacing an older Water Pik with this one based on the reviews and the price. When I received the first one (you know where this is heading...) the Power On button did nothing... NA-DA, zero.  I said okay what did I do wrong... read the instructions again and it turns out I actually followed them. I tried pressing down harder on the Power On button and felt a little vibration. I pressed down really hard on it and it turned on. Well, it&#x27;s hard to water-pik your teeth when one hand is pushing down really hard to get the Power On button to actually work. The only way the thing would work was to press down really hard on the Power button. I went back to Amazon, l described my problem, ordered a replacement, printed out their UPS label, took it to the UPS store and my replacement came in like 2 or 3 days (before my old unit got to them. I was amazed at how fast I received the replacement. I tried the replacement and it seems to work fine.  The 5 stars is for Amazon&#x27;s replacement policy. So far this replacement is working fine. I will update this posting if this replacement Water-Pik gives me any trouble. Amazon will charge you for the price of the replacement as well as the original if you don&#x27;t return the first item back in 30 days... but that is to be expected... outstanding replacement service!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  I remember using one to shoot water around the bathroom as a kid (who doesn&#x27;t?!).  This works as expected and hoped, my dentist is off my back and my gums are massaged.  Another good purchase on Amazon :)</li>
    <li> I bought this but I seldom use it. I think I would have used the larger unit. I can only cleanse half my mouth with this. So it is quicker to floss.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily at night after dinner, and it does wonders to clean my teeth of the particles that are missed by my brush. I love using it, and I will continue to use it. Since using it daily I no longer need to spend lots of money on deep cleanings and other gum treatments. It&#x27;s very easy to use and works very well. Get this now!</li>
    <li> This is well worth the money. It&#x27;s not a subtle machine, (in fact it&#x27;s pretty loud) but it really makes a positive impact on the health of my teeth and gums. Now when I floss, I have very little bleeding, if any. Highly recommended if you know you should be flossing but can never do so consistently. It will make your mouth feel healthier.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. It was report a replacement of another one just like it</li>
    <li> I really like it, but it unfortunately hasn&#x27;t slowed down the decay in my mouth.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This product changed my dental hygiene for the better and is more important than brushing IMO. I literally had stuff come out my mouth AFTER I brushed that made me wonder what I have been leaving in my mouth all those past years. I literally would not be without the product and Amazon shipped in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I just got it today and I think its an impressive little water pump.The only thing bothering me about it right now is a little OCD. 6 tips with storage for 4+1 in the handle of the unit. Be sure to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! I tried using it with cold tap water and subsequently made my teeth hurt, plus gave myself a massive headache. Always use lukewarm water.</li>
    <li> works well, multiple settings for water speed. Water reservoir could stand to be a bit larger. I usually runout of water before I&#x27;m ready. Feels great on teeth. and gums. Leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a really good job. After brushing  I use the water pik and there is always little bits of something flushed out from between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Water does seem to run off your hand so be sure to lean over the sink.  Also use the pause button until unit is in the mouth or water will be everywhere.</li>
    <li> It has performed very well, and instructions were very good. I liked the product&lt;br /&gt;so far and my dentist will should be happy too.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED WATERPIK FLOSSERS SINCE THEY WERE FIRST PUT ON THE MARKET BOTH HERE AND AT OUR SECOND HOME IN SWEDEN.  IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  I DO NOT GIVE IT THE 5TH STAR BECAUSE THE WATER TANK IS SMALLER THAN THE PRIOR MODEL.  IF IT WERE INCREASED TO THE BIGGER CAPACITY THEN IT COULD BE A LONGER AND THUS BETTER FLOSS.  GENE WOLVER</li>
    <li> good system much quieter than previous versions wish water container was a little larger water pik has kept me from needing dental surgery now for 7 years</li>
    <li> I purchased this appliance on the recommendation of my Hygienist.  It seems well built and functions as it should.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Product works as described and does a great job.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  My Dad has been using his for years and loves it!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd. order on this product. The first was for my mother and now I have one.  Why order here? because the price was the best.  This is a quality product and with free shipping it didn&#x27;t pay to drive all over.  Saved big time.  Best one for the buck-it has items I don&#x27;t use but the best for the price.</li>
    <li> I have run through two of the cheaper Waterpik models and another one from a different brand.  This one is still going strong with no problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this Waterpik for my husband and he really likes it.  I like the compact style that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the bathroom sink.  It does a great job!</li>
    <li> I bought this Waterpik for my adult son, who loves it.  I have had the same one for awhile now and really like it.  You are able to turn the water pressure to your desired pressure.  You can also push a button so that the water stops temporarily.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels great after a water flossing.  I put mouthwash into the fill bucket so that my teeth and gums get a thorough cleaning</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik , the first one lasted 5 years. I use mine three times a day every day. It was still working when I replaced it with a new one. I had broken the holder for the handle, a few times putting in back, used super glue, finally it was time to replace. The new one was on sale at a special price , less than my first one 5 years ago. The new warterpik has a few more attachments, works the same, very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works and is convenient to use. Does not make a mess in the bathroom. Keeps my gums clean. OK.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpiks for years and should have updated my device a long time ago.  This one is much more versatile and has some interesting \\&quot;tools\\&quot; to use.  It&#x27;s such a smart step for anyone who wants to take good care of their teeth, expecially if they have a bridge.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know that Waterpik devices were still around, but when I recently started orthodontic treatment as an adult, it was highly recommended that I use a Waterpik daily.  Nowadays I tend to look on Amazon first for anything I need, and I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised to find Waterpik units here.  This one appeared to be at or near the top of the line, and seemed like just the ticket.  It also appears that the company has incorporated a number of nice improvements over the years, and I think it&#x27;s worth getting this high-end model to take advantage of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with a selection of different interchangeable tips.  I have used only the orthodontic tip, which has a little stiff brush on it, and the plain tip, which simply has a plain nozzle.  The instruction booklet is not especially clear about the specific uses of some of the tips, and it is left to the user to experiment with them.  I have decided that the plain tip works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a 10-position dial to select the strength of the water jet that pulses out of the nozzle.  The manufacturer states quite firmly that a new user should start at a low setting (1 or 2) and gradually work up.  This is basically a question of the gums getting used to the blasts of water, which can feel rather needle-like at the highest settings.  I was gratified to discover that I could move up the setting levels fairly quickly, and now use the unit set on 10 regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer also recommends that lukewarm water be used to fill the reservoir.  This is a good suggestion, because cold water can be uncomfortable on sensitive teeth.  A full reservoir lasts a good couple of minutes, it seems to me, which is time enough to cover all the teeth pretty well.  I can feel the water spraying through spaces in my teeth near the gum line and hitting my tongue when the nozzle is aimed squarely between the teeth.  The orthodontics are spreading my teeth around somewhat, which increases the space for the water to come through, so this effect has increased as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice feature on this higher-end unit is the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button on the handle.  Pressing this button interrupts the flow of water, so what the end can be brought to the mouth without water spraying everywhere.  I discovered that when the unit is first turned on, it is best to let the nozzle spray into the sink for 5 to 10 seconds in order to clear the residual water in the hose, prior to pressing the pause button and bringing the head to one&#x27;s mouth.  This is because the residual water will be relatively cold.  Letting it drain first means that the lukewarm water will reach the head once it is brought to the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir top hinges open to reveal a compartment that holds a selection of nozzle tips -- most of which I probably will not use.  I suppose I should try them someday, but for now I&#x27;m happy with the plain nozzle tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I should mention is that this unit is not particularly quiet when it&#x27;s running; it sounds like a miniature air compressor.  It&#x27;s not the thing to use in the middle of the night when the whole household is asleep.  It&#x27;s not as though you need earplugs or anything; it&#x27;s the sound of the reciprocating pump shooting out something like 20 pulses per second of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am impressed with how well it works.  I can see bits of food that this unit has knocked loose down in the sink.  Somewhat to my surprise, the manufacturer recommends using this unit first, before brushing, which explains why I&#x27;m seeing those bits of food.  In any event, I&#x27;m pleased with this unit and have not run into any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my gums and tartar build up.  I&#x27;ve had two very good dental check-ups since I purchased the flosser.  I use it morning and night along with my electric toothbrush.  Even my dentist commented on how good my gums looked and that I had no cavities.  I was so happy with this one that I bought the battery charged ones for when I travel.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product in the States only to find it didn&#x27;t work here because of the voltage.  Purchased another one in England but have to use it in the kitchen because you can&#x27;t use a shaver plug, won&#x27;t go into an extension lead, over here you cannot have a mains point in the bathroom as they do in the States.  Love the product, please help.</li>
    <li> so fun to use, and your mouth feels so clean. It is a good idea to use Scope or something similar beforehand to kill all the germs and then use this water flosser to wash it all out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to go into a long diatribe about what this thing does.  Its a Waterpik.  It shoots water out of a spout to simulate flossing, that&#x27;s it.  I thought about buying one for years but always put it off as a luxury item.  After my fiance and I got our tax refund this year we decided that we could splurge a bit and buy ourselves a gift.  He got a 55\\&quot; TV. I got a Waterpik.  Now that I have it, I have to say I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.  If you don&#x27;t floss regularly (and, let&#x27;s face it, none of us do) you NEED a Waterpik.  Everyone should have one.  I suggest putting a little mouthwash and peroxide in with the water.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a week and my teeth are already whiter, and my mouth is clean and happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a water flosser before so I really have nothing to compare it to but I am finding it very useful.  I just had a fixed bridge done which requires that extra cleaning be done around and under it.  The water flosser has been great for getting around and under it easily.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Works quite well to clenup hidden food particals between difficult to reatch areas. The settings for pressusre are good. I normally use around 6. Full force setting 10 is little bit too much. Needs some practice to use this device, since water splashes around sink if not position mouth correctly. There is a soft piece to hold water in the removable tank which connects it to the pump in the device. Some times water drips from this valve. This is not big deal because onece tank sites in its place everythig works with no water leak.  For travelling this is little big item to carry in tooth brush pouch. But for home use quite good, does not take much space on the counter. I have used this device for about a month and don&#x27;t know how durable this machine is. To improve dental and gum helth this is very good equipment.</li>
    <li> This is my first water flosser. It is easy to use and has adequate accessaries. Note - Making sure the liquid containiner is seated tightly is important for proper use.</li>
    <li> First off this product is simply awesome. I don&#x27;t floss hardly at all. Even knowing the advantages and disadvantages of flossing I just don&#x27;t have the time. In addition, when using normal floss, I can only get to the teeth in the front of my mouth. When I try to floss the back teeth, I either can&#x27;t get my fingers all the way back there or when I do the floss seems to break or fray VERY easily. Then I found the Waterpik. This machine makes me want to floss. I can EASILY get to every single tooth in my mouth and it has mulitiple attachments for various usage. I wish I was introduced to this product years ago!!! Overall, flossing is an essential factor in maintaining oral health and there isn&#x27;t a better way to utilize that than the Waterpik. I would recommend to anyone and everyone even thinking about buying! Trust me you won&#x27;t regret :)</li>
    <li> This is my first Waterpik.  I guess I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting - my hygenist recommended it because my cleanings are pretty painful - I have gum issues.  But it hasn&#x27;t exactly blown my mind in any way, and I can&#x27;t see that the effect is much different from swishing a little water around in my mouth, which can be done without taking up so much precious bathroom storage space.</li>
    <li> I found my original WaterPik product through a friend. Then I spoke to my dentist, who was a member of a national dental research group, about the product. He couldn&#x27;t say enough good about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossing doesn&#x27;t clean your gums or flush out the impurities under your gums that the WaterPik does. I fill the bottom section of this unit with Listerine, then add a little salt (for healing) then add warm water. It has been proven that the WaterPik will heal \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; that form in your gums. No painful surgery is required. I&#x27;m a living example of that. The WaterPik heals your gums in a different way than the SonicCare does, which is a great product that I also use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe, that adding the benefits of Listerine and the healing properties of salt to the WaterPik, that it then becomes a valuable part of a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I highly recommend it to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TaosGuy 3/3/2012</li>
    <li> I was born with my teeth just too close together, consequently food particles wedge themselves in between them with stubborn tenacity.  No amount of the conventional use of toothpicks, dental floss, or even those niftly plastic things with the floss on one end and a flexible pick on the other will do the job.  But fill the Waterpik with warm water and wahoo!  Aim those pulsating jets of water at the culprits and out they come and down the drain.  Use it after brushing your teeth and your mouth is fresh and clean, what a good feeling!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this product works well,as advertised. I use it once or twice everyday and it does a great job of flushung out food from between the teeth. I am not sure how far it goes down below the gum line. My dentist likes the idea of me using the Waterpick, because I am very bad about flossing. However, my dentist warned that I still need to floss because flossing does a better job of breaking up the tarter that builds up the on teeth than just a pulsing stream of water. So I TRY to get a good flossing in a couple time a week.</li>
    <li> This unit feels cheap the moment you remove it from the box. The water pulse is strong but the unit is unwieldy and very difficult to use effectively, and even when used properly leaves plenty of plaque and bits of food between teeth. The water flosser it replaced (an Oral Breeze) didn&#x27;t work very well either, but at least it was cheap and easy to use, convenient, and didn&#x27;t require daily cleaning or severe caution in using a pump motor with a full tank of water near an electrical outlet. Forget letting your kids use this thing -- it&#x27;d be dangerous. And whose bonehead decision was it to make the unit pump water freely as the default action, with a button needing to be pressed to stop the flow? I&#x27;ve made so many messes because of that lunacy and I&#x27;ve only had this thing a week. Pity there&#x27;s no money back guarantee, because even though I almost never take companies up on those, this is one instance where I would. This Waterpik sucks.</li>
    <li> This replaced a 3 yr old Braun water jet.  Even at max pressure the Braun was not quite as powerful as I would like.  This Waterpik unit is so powerful that I usually run it at 8/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jul 13 update - still working strong</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone with braces! My teeth feel like I just had a dental cleaning once I am finished.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome dental device.  I have the beginning stages of periodontal gum disease and not interested in spending money on costly and preventative dental procedures.  I brush with an Oral B Triumph electric tooth brush that I like but it cant do what this tool has done for me in just a couple days of using it.  I felt like a tooth was loosening, so I ordered this and used with a water and a few drops of Wild Oregano oil solution.  I already have no problem chewing on that side of my mouth already.I use it twice a day with two tank fulls.  I will use this everyday from now on and cant wait to see how my next check up goes, I expect to hear of improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have to mix an extra container of solution to pour in the tank because the tank is small, not that big of a deal for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tubing is short that goes to the waterpik so you have to have it close to the sink and bend down, again the pros outweigh the two cons,for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely recommend it to everyone with teeth and gums :-)</li>
    <li> Leaves my mouth feeling super clean and like i just got a cleaning from the dentist &#x3D;) In less than a week of use the sensitive spots feel way better!</li>
    <li> We are in our 60&#x27;s. My husband has brittle teeth, and I have gum disease \\&quot;pockets\\&quot;. Our dentist told us to purchase whatever tools we would use to get our teeth and gums clean. I like the dial that lets you change the pressure of the water. There is a special tip that is supposed to help clean gum pockets, but you must use it on the lowest pressure only. I find that the regular tip is what I use most often, along with old-fashioned flossing. Even a WaterPik can&#x27;t reach between the teeth on the sides if they are tight. The unit is easy to use, easy to keep clean, and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on the sink counter. We have bought a second unit to use that stays at our vacation home.</li>
    <li> Our dental hygienist is impressed with the results!  It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with a nice assortment of attachments.</li>
    <li> Even my husband who does not like to floss has been using this Waterpik twice a day already and with a few water reservoir refill each time. He is a true believer that the Waterpik is very effective in cleaning his teeth just like receiving a deep cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. For me, it is way better than getting a 30 minutes cleaning at the dentist with a fraction of the time and half the cost!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic, I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it. My son has braces and rather than trying to negotiate the flossing through his braces, he uses this. His dentist is very pleased with the results and that&#x27;s the best I can ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has a pause button, unlike the old waterpiks that just sprayed everyone and everything until you could shut it off!</li>
    <li> The product is well presented and packaged, the design is pleasant and functional. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser does what it is expected to do and I would give it 4 stars if it was not for a few minor aspects that could and should be improved. First of all the water reservoir is to small, it only last a minute or so, thus requiring the user to stop, refill and continue with the cleaning. A tank with at least 1.5 to 2 times the present capacity is required in order to complete the cleaning of a normal 32 teeth mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the 10 different settings pressure control dial, when actually you are really only using the top pressures (from 7 to 10), all the other lower ones are not producing enough pressure to clean your teeth and effectively remove food residuals. I understand that some people might have sensitive gums or some kind of condition that forbids them to use higher pressure, but maybe if you have these kind of problems shouldn&#x27;t be using this kind of flosser and resort to other less invasive methods to get the best result.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir cover has also a very useful tip storage compartment, the only problem is that it only holds 4 of the 6 tips you are given. Even if you keep one of the tip on the handle, you have no storage space left for the sixth tip. It also tends to slip and fall into the reservoir when you are moving it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally the coiled semi-rigid tube connecting the handle to the unit is not the ideal type of connection, it&#x27;s to short and thus restricting your movements to much, it tends to get in the way of your hand holding the handle and it starts to collect some of the water dripping from your mouth on to the handle and spills it outside the sink area. The rigidity of the tube facilitate its auto-folding back into storage position, but at the same time it is not practical when flossing and not very ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;Now even with all the minor problems described above I recommend this product as I found it is a very good tool to improve one&#x27;s oral hygiene, at a very good price for the quality you get and in every aspect much better than any other flossing method.</li>
    <li> Extremely effective (when used in conjunction with regular teeth brushing) in keeping my teeth and gums clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be much more pleasant and effective than flossing, hence I am able to do use the Waterpik every night, whereas with regular flossing I had to force myself with many skipped days being the result. Using the Waterpik has actually been enjoyable for me. It&#x27;s also much easier on the fingers too, as there are no more cuts in my fingers due to abrasive nature of regular dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the Waterpik, all of my gum probings are now at normal or better than normal depth, 2 to 3 mm. My dentist, since I started using the Waterpik, now says I am one of his most meticulous patients when it comes to dental hygiene and he has been extremely happy with the results as my gums are now in great condition with my periodontal disease reversed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading more on the internet about this product, I have been using the Water-Pik at a lower pressure setting. For me at least, I find that a lower setting is sufficient to keep my gums and teeth sparkling clean, while avoiding any risk that a high pressure setting might have in damaging my gums or teeth (Due to periodontal problems in the past, I have gum recession with the softer lower portions (the dentin) of my teeth below the enamel exposed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik has revolutionized my dental hygiene. My gums are not in great shape and I haven&#x27;t had any cavities either since I started using this device.</li>
    <li> I have never used a WaterPik before and wonder why not- this is a great product! Since I am not coordinated enough to do a good job with regular floss, this is perfect for me. I seriously am getting addicted to using this thing. The price is right and it is well worth it to maintain good dental health. Love it!</li>
    <li> The CEO went to the dentist and said that the dentist suggested one of these tooth power washers.  So, I ordered this Dentist recommended one for her.  She has been very pleased with it and continues to be very excited about it. I&#x27;m going to build her a special shelf to set it on one of these days.  I&#x27;m old school, so I generally rely on my power toothbrush and one of those little plastic floss tools that looks like a miniature banjo.  But to each his own.  She insisted that I try it and assigned me the blue colored plastic attachment instruments.  She prepared the solutions and installed it in the retaining bowl and then gave me brief instructions on how to operate.  It works good, but DON&#x27;T take the wand out of your mouth while it is running.  You could put out an eye.  My only other complaint was that that is a lot of water to drink at one time.  She gave me supplemental instructions, and has since corrected that issue.  I think this baby would be great to shoot the ear wax out of your ears, but I&#x27;m sure there is a warning label against that somewhere.  I didn&#x27;t read the safety warnings.</li>
    <li> After having some laser gum work, I purchased a Waterpik and glad I did. It has more than made a difference in my oral health. My gums have never been more healthy. I only wish I&#x27;d found this miracle sooner. What&#x27;s really cool is that when I go to have my teeth cleaned it feels the same (not like before when I could feel the dramatic difference). It feels the same because the Waterpik is working so well. Recommend, recommend, recommend!</li>
    <li> Good performance, a new experience for me. Almost as good as an electric brush. However it does leak and drip water in the wrong places.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter because she has braces. So far so good. She actually enjoys using the water pik and adds a cap of mouth wash to each batch of water.</li>
    <li> Noisy, Leaky attachment(s), Good power. Does the job. Price was fair. Had an earlier model which failed after approx. two years.</li>
    <li> If you want a better return on your investment, try flushing your money down the toilet or setting it on fire. I would award this zero stars if I could. The device jams up nearly every night. Essentially, no water comes out, and no amount of toying, coaxing, or wiggling will get it to work. Many nights, after 10 minutes of trying, I just give up on seeking healthy gums. I could get better results with an ice pick.</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago and am totally hooked. I brush regularly but I&#x27;m very lax about flossing. At my last dental cleaning, the hygeinist recommended a Waterpik and I bought one soon after.  Love the massaging action on my gums and my teeth feel much cleaner than with brushing alone.</li>
    <li> The Flossser works as well as expected.  It has all the accessories required. Since the tips are rather delicate , packaging is important.  Some small flaws: it could have shipped with color coded tips so that more than one person could easily use it. Or may be , a complete second set of tips as an option.  Also, in international shipping, a 220 V model would have been more useful. This was not evident from its description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who takes pride in their oral hygenie, I use it 3 times a day my gums and teeth look beautiful, not to mention my dentist will be proud!!!!</li>
    <li> I had to return this because it did not work properly.  I had an excellent experience with the return and re-ordered a new one that I am sure will be just fine.  This is my 3rd Waterpik and I like the product very much.</li>
    <li> I bought this in April 2013 ( after initial replacement because the switch stuck on which I want to add occurred with no problem, great customer service) and I love this device. It is used every single day by 2 adults and 1 child and it works great. Dentist commented on noticeable improvement of gums and teeth so it is doing exactly what it is supposed to. Would recommend to a friend. Great product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t go rambo with this thing right out box. Max setting with high pressure nozzle will actually cut your gums. I only use the high power setting to clean stuff around my sink and clean my toothbrush. Will blast out pieces of food that are stuck in your teeth.</li>
    <li> Nice flosser to help keep the chompers and gums healthy.  I find there to be plenty of setting and attachements to find a comfortable combination.  I&#x27;ll be needing this even more with an implant that has just been put in.  This flosser will be good to keep any crud out of the nooks and crannies.</li>
    <li> We ordered this Waterpik a couple of weeks ago and I just LOVE it!!  I do brush my teeth at least twice daily but have added the Waterpik to my routine.  I can&#x27;t believe the particles that are left between your teeth after brushing that the waterpik cleans out.  I often use it once or twice through out the day just to get that \\&quot;fresh clean\\&quot; feeling in my mouth.  I add a small amount of mouth wash to the water.  If you want clean teeth and a fresh feeling, get this product.  It is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the WP100 and she was so right. Flossing is fine but the WP100 is SUPER flossing. It comes with several piks-of which a few remain a mystery.</li>
    <li> received on time; we use this flosser every day. find it helps in keeping teeth looking good. best time to floss is at night time be for going to bed.</li>
    <li> I feel like I just came from having my teeth cleaned by the dentist every time I use it.  A little messy until you get the hang of it but once you do it is a breeze.  Will always have one from now on.</li>
    <li> I had ginivitis. I have regular dental visits to remove plaque buildup, and the dental hygienist told me that I had to floss and brush my teeth twice a day between teeth cleanings. I bought this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and a Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  This water flosser makes it easy to get between your teeth and down around your gum line (front &amp; back). It is much easier to get behind your back teeth than trying to use the string floss. I also started brushing, not just the top surface of my teeth, but the sides down to the gum line (front &amp; back) and my tongue and roof of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this recommendation for vitamins to help build strong teeth &amp; bones from a nurse.(I had taking most of these vitamins in the past - just not a large enough dose of the chelated kind)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Amount I take twice a day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3000mg time-release vitamin C (for collagen) ,&lt;br /&gt;  2000 IU vitamin D3 (body needs it to absorb calcium and magnesium),&lt;br /&gt;  Chelated calcium 500mg/ 250 Magnesium (Cheleted - Body Absorbs Better)&lt;br /&gt;  plus Magnesium 250mg more (chelated or citrate)&lt;br /&gt;  making total magnesium &#x3D;  total calcium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started some of my teeth were getting loose. Now in about a year they have tightened up. I no longer have ginivitis, but I continue the processes, to keep from having future problems. Who wants false teeth! Both the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and a Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush are good tools. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, it works great. My teeth are very close together, flossing for me is a pain. I usually break about 3 lines of floss each time, I feel like I&#x27;m going to chip a tooth, it&#x27;s sometimes painful. That&#x27;s why I bought the waterpik and its been exactly what I was hoping for. I&#x27;ve yet to even change the tip or the setting, it has been working great. My teeth feel very clean and my mouth fresh. I would recommend this to anyone. Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, packaging was good, price was right. It was a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> When I got braces and complained about flossing the traditional way to my hygienist, she recommended getting one of these. It wasn&#x27;t hard to convince me because flossing is the worst. Flossing with braces is even worst-er.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this device.&lt;br /&gt;-The Waterpik is easy to maneuver around dental brackets and the attachments that are included make it easy to clean the gum line and other areas of need.&lt;br /&gt;-The water pressure can be adjusted easily using the dial on the base and you can gradually increase it as your get accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;-This has been a huge time saver and I&#x27;m able to do it multiple times a day without the frustration of using dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anybody, especially anyone with braces.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the effectiveness of this tool has been proven as I aced my most recent dental check-up.</li>
    <li> Works great.  After I brushed my teeth the first time I used the pic and was shocked to see additional food particles coming out.  I will let you know just how good it is in 6 months when I go back to the dentist and my measurements change.</li>
    <li> I have always dreaded having my teeth cleaned due to warnings about needing gum surgery and hating to floss. After finally having gum surgery I decided there had to be a better way so I bought the portable Water Pik.  I have been using that on a daily basis for a few years.  Unfortunately I dropped it and broke it and replaced it with this one.  This one is even better than my portable.  The best news is I just had a cleaning and for the first time in years I have no issue with gum disease. When the dentist was checking and kept calling out 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s I was stunned as I have always heard them calling 4&#x27;s which was not so good.</li>
    <li> and it also comes with a toothbrush so nicely developed to use with the waterpik. great product!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a relative, per his request, and was well received.  It is easy to use, does a great job and is easy to store and keep clean.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Works really well with water flossing for stuck food debris.  It helped with bad breath</li>
    <li> This waterpik works great with no problems at all.  I have had it a couple weeks and I use it twice a day.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My dentist prescribed me Water Flosser, and I want to say this thing really works. I&#x27;d been using previous model (not ultra) for half a year, but then decided to buy this one, and I don&#x27;t regret. Ultra Water Flosser is really better.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is very easy to use. It floss better and cleaner than the flossing strings.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to anyone to use.</li>
    <li> Every year I go to the dentist and every year they tell me to floss more. I bought this waterpik and have used it everyday for 6 months and I just had my first dental checkup ever where they told me that I had no cavities and my teeth looked perfect. I have to use this product on its highest setting but my wife uses it at the middle setting.</li>
    <li> Well at least I thought this will be great for my 7-year-old to clean her braces and it was recommended to us by her orthodontist, however, my husband thought I was crazy to seriously put this into the hands of our 7-year-old and reachable for our 5-year-old who likes to figure out how everything works. So I returned it to prevent water &#x27;gun&#x27; fights in our kids bathroom. When they are older and my daughter will need her second stage of braces though, I am pretty sure I will give this a try again.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by my Periodontal Hygenist and has met all of my expectations. Very pleased with this product and the transaction.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. Worth every penny. You&#x27;ll be glad you made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This Waterpix is EXCELLENT and I would highly recommend this model if you are considering purchasing a Waterpik for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Pros/Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- it really works well at its task and is actually fun to use&lt;br /&gt;- it holds a generous amount of water&lt;br /&gt;- not too loud&lt;br /&gt;- has great storage compartment in the lid&lt;br /&gt;- the cord to the handle recoils back to the same shape and tucks back in just like the picture if you don&#x27;t over stretch it&lt;br /&gt;- nice aesthetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- it can be messy until you can get the hang of how to let the water drool out of your mouth and into the sink&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s a bummer if you don&#x27;t finish your routine before the water runs out. After a few uses you get into a pattern of how to clean your teeth fast enough then do retouching with the water that is left over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend keeping a plastic 1 to 2 quart water bottle filled with water in the bathroom where you use it instead of detaching the blue reservoir for a commute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH! and after your done, rinse with mouth wash for an aggressive clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found that this product doesn&#x27;t replace flossing all together because it can&#x27;t really get between the teeth when the teeth are touching BUT IS MUCH BETTER AT GETTING BELOW THE GUM LINE COMPARED TO FLOSSING ALONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a breakthrough in flossing more when I found the new REACH ACCESS FLOSSER! Regular floss is hard to work with in your hands especially if you have big hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Reach-Access-Flosser/dp/B0017TU2HE/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_1</li>
    <li> Everyone who want s to maintain their teeth through adulthood should have this item.... I had a scaling procedure once ...wouldn&#x27;t want that again .. With the help of the waterpik my dental hygene and gums are TOPS</li>
    <li> This is the sixth or seventh Waterpik flosser I have purchased over several years. I use it almost every night just before bed. If everyone used these things, the dental profession would be selling used cars! If you don&#x27;t have one, what are you waiting for?</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist told me that my teeth looked great the last visit I had. I complete blame the waterpik. Excellent product, and I suggest getting the pik with the round bristles on it. I have sensitive teeth, so I use lukewarm water which helps on that score.</li>
    <li> When your kid gets braces you think the huge orthodontic bill is the end of it, but it isn&#x27;t; you have to buy all sorts of stuff like this thing (and specialty toothbrushes, specialty orthodontic rinse, etc.) Honestly, you&#x27;d be better off marrying someone with better teeth next time.  But if you don&#x27;t, this water flosser works great.</li>
    <li> looks good, works well. the top has a storage box for extra bits which can fall out when you fill it. other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> A Water Pik is is essential to prevent gum disease and remove loose debris.  As a dentist for 30 years I always advised the use of water irrigation around the teeth.  It removes so much more than brushing.  Flossing is good too but this is so much easier and just as effective in my opinion.  This particular model has a small footprint on your counter which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help with the deep pockets on my gumline and since using this it has made a difference and the pockets have gotten smaller.</li>
    <li> It is my 1st purchase of a product like this. I have owned a Sonic toothbrush in the past but I have 3 permanent bridges in my mouth and this item is a Godsend. I highly recommend. It is really powerful and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Inferior to the older model with square water holder. Why was it abandoned? It should be brought back. The redesign is not better.</li>
    <li> I love all the different tips and how powerful it is!  Seems to hold just the right amount of water!</li>
    <li> it was gift for my mom&lt;br /&gt;she is so happy with this</li>
    <li> This is the best thing that has happened to my gums! No more bleeding gums after I started using it. I have braces and this makes it so much easier to have clean teeth! I can&#x27;t live without it now, 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. My dentist told me to floss regularly or go to a waterpik. I did a little research, bought this unit and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I don&#x27;t mind using the water pik every night.. My wife suggested mixing mouthwash with Luke warm water in the waterpik and it works great. I guess she use to do this when she had braces.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like flossing so this is a great product to replace flossing. Sometimes it is difficult for floss to get between my teeth. The water pick removes food that is stuck between my teeth. It also cleans food that gets under my dental bridge.</li>
    <li> This product has helped the gum disease that i have. It makes your mouth feel extra clean &amp; is very easy to use. I would recommend this product to most anyone with gum disease &amp; to maintain healthy gums &amp; teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a water flosser and I really like it, it is easy to use and my 6 &amp; 7 year old children also use it with ease.  It does not leak as some reviews say.  I only gave 4 stars because I would prefer the coil to be a little longer, we have to hunch over to use it instead of standing up straight.</li>
    <li> I like this machine a lot and only have a couple of things to complain about.  While the variety of tips is interesting, one was missing and I doubt that I will use most of what is included.  Secondly, it is a bit difficult to remove the reservoir to fill it and I am concerned that the gasket will wear out quickly.</li>
    <li> I love waterpik water flossers, and this one a great buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, great power and good results.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> This water flosser is a great product for not only myself but for my three children who all have braces.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for someone that constantly flosses. Ironically, they were not interested in even trying the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. Needless to say I received it back new &amp; unused. I decided to keep it for myself and I am so very glad I did. I love the way my mouth feels after a cleansing. The more I use it I&#x27;ve gotten better at not splashing the water spray. I believe if you are considering this product you can&#x27;t go wrong. This is one gift I was happy to regift to myself!</li>
    <li> It get in between teeth and with braces which I have it&#x27;s hard to floss! I&#x27;m gonna recommend this to anyone who wants really clean teeth!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and so far so good.  My mother is enjoying this product.  She said it has great pressure and works well.</li>
    <li> This machine is great for cleaning those hard to reach places especially under my bridge. The only problem I have is turning it on and making sure that the spray jet is in my mouth first, otherwise, I get a shower from it.</li>
    <li> Not quite as powerful as the older models, but the extra attachments make it a good value. Resevoir could be bigger</li>
    <li> Yes, it is as described. I like it.</li>
    <li> This model Waterpik is an improvement over the previous model.  The handle alone is much nicer to use as you don&#x27;t have to fight inserting and removing the tips.  It is quieter than the previous model and the appearance is much improved.  My only complaint is the size of the reservoir.  It&#x27;s about 650 milliliter when I use about 900 milliliters for flossing.  I have to stop and add a glass of water when flossing and find that to be somewhat annoying.  Other than the reservoir, I&#x27;m happy with this Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Love it. works great.</li>
    <li> great customer service, item as described</li>
    <li> We use it everyday! Only complaint would be sometimes the button you push down to stop the water gets stuck, but it  pops back out when you turn it off so no biggie.  Works extremely well, we love it.</li>
    <li> a bit noisy and vibrates. Depending upon your water hardness, it must be cleaned regularly. Wish there was an attachment for cleaning ear wax.</li>
    <li> The most amazing thing ever........</li>
    <li> works great. feels so clean</li>
    <li> If you have braces this will not substitute in any way for flossing</li>
    <li> Works great and instructions were very easy to understand. Easy to store and to clean.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My gums and teeth are really clean thanks to this. The box isn&#x27;t kidding when it says that you may bleed... because I completely did but only because i tried ti on max power the first day. Work your way up gradually and it is a great tool.</li>
    <li> Be careful with the pressure. I put the pressure on medium and it literally cut off the papilla tissue in between my three front teeth.</li>
    <li> it does what a toothpick can&#x27;t.. push out the nasty food/leftovers between your teeth and clean out your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;caution, at high setting, it will cause your gums to bleed. but this may be from lack of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: VERY VERY LOUD.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Has an ok look on the counter (not ugly).  Does a fantastic job cleaning teeth.  Comes with a variety of nozzles and pressure settings.</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to do. The best of what we tried.</li>
    <li> Very good water flossier, i used it every day.</li>
    <li> great cleaning sensation</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s like power washing your teeth! Your gums and teeth will love you for it! Using this steps up your oral hygiene routine buko!!!!</li>
    <li> Gets what the toothbrush misses</li>
    <li> I got braces and my orthodontist recommended this product! I totally see the difference. My husband who doesn&#x27;t have braces is using it too and his gums are in better condition than before!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, works fine</li>
    <li> Only lasted me like 4months total, the handle (pause button) stopped working after that and eventually had to throw it out. I&#x27;m sure if they fix this design flaw this flosser would be the best out there! Oh well off to go look for another brand that doesn&#x27;t break within a few weeks of normal use...adios waterpik!</li>
    <li> This is a decent waterpik. I have used this for a few months and it has been working well. I like the adjustable water speed and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it is leaking only in 2 weeks of use and it was trashed in 3 months, what a disappointment and waste of money</li>
    <li> Simply a must have item Improved from older models ... Empties in a few seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must have in your arsenal to keep mouth Clean</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my 8 and 11 year old got braces, at the same time! The waterpik is great for them to use on their own to get debris from their braces. They use it with ease. They have a small bathroom and little counter space. Waterpik fits in the corner of the counter. My 8 yr old uses the regular pik and my 11 yr old uses the orthodontic pik. I looked online about purchasing another orthodontic pik but wanted to make sure they liked using the product before purchasing extra piks. I looked at other waterpiks online, but this one had the best reviews, and it&#x27;s easy to operate. Would recommend this product to anyone dealing with braces!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS WATERPIK!  THE DENTIST WAS SELLING IT FOR 20 BUCKS MORE.  WALMART WAS SELLING IT FOR 10 BUCKS MORE.  AMAZON HAS IT PRICED JUST RIGHT.  IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  IT CLEANS YOUR TEETH AND MOUTH LIKE YOU JUST GOT BACK FROM THE DENTIST.  THIS WATERPIK GETS EVERYTHING YOUR TOOTHBRUSH DOESN&#x27;T REACH.  USING THIS AFTER BRUSHING IS THE BEST CLEANING YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR TEETH AND MOUTH.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This device is alright, does the job and has good water pressure to clean between the teeth.  I would recommend it if you prefer not to use floss.  It also comes with several tips.</li>
    <li> I bought the waterpik in 2007 and never used it much.  My previous visit to the dentist didn&#x27;t go so well and I knew I should be taking better care of my teeth.  I set a goal to floss daily, but after a few days, I thought why am I flossing when I could be using my waterpik?  So, I started using the waterpik everyday and my dentist noticed at my last cleaning.  He told me that I take very good care of my teeth and couldn&#x27;t believe that my last cleaning had been six months ago, he thought it was much more recent.  He had never been very nice and hadn&#x27;t said much more then a few words to me but this time he was practically gushing at how easy my cleaning was.  I am sold, hook line and sinker.  My teeth feel so much cleaner after using the waterpik.  It is part of my daily routine.  I fill the reservoir halfway with tepid water and floss around each tooth front and back, it takes about a minute. I recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Ordered and received on time.  My old one quit on me after about ten years.  Sprung a leak.  Ten years is about right for these.  I have been using the Waterpik for over 20 years maybe 30.  This is my third or fourth one.  It seems like they get a little better each time I buy one.  They are great for popcorn husks or other foodstuff that gets caught in your teeth.  I almost never use a toothpick.  You still need to brush and floss like your dentist tells you though.</li>
    <li> I used to hate flossing.  I&#x27;ve used regular floss, the sword floss things, the little brush to push between your teeth.  Nothing works as well and as painlessly as this Waterpik.  My hygenist was also very happy to know I had this and was using this.  She expecting to not have to work so hard removing plaque on my next vist.  I highly recommend this device.</li>
    <li> I try to use my water flosser every night.  It is a bit messy in that it isn&#x27;t possible to avoid at least some spritzing onto the bathroom sink.  But I love the feel of my mouth each time I use it.  I&#x27;m trying to hang onto my 64 year old teeth forever, and removing the plaque each night should bring me a great report on my next semi-annual checkup and cleaning.  The only drawback to Waterpik&#x27;s standard bearer is its bulk.  I can&#x27;t take it camping or even to visit because its not exactly portable and must be plugged in.  Of course that&#x27;s also why it does such a good job.  That lack of true portability, however, is not justification for anything less than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have used a water pik for over 30 years. This model is the best yet.  The prior models had only one type of tip whereas the new model has 6 tips that perform a variety of functions. I primarily use the plaque tip which is very effective in cleaning debris from my gums and teeth. I highly recommend this model. Use of it leaves your mouth feeling very clean. It was also recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> When I got braces, my husband told me I needed to get a Waterpik.  He used one back when he had braces, and he thought I really needed one.  I wasn&#x27;t convinced.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after a month of flossing all the time, I decided to go ahead and buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goodness, I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Waterpik works great.  Now I rarely floss at all; I just use this once or twice every day.  It&#x27;s so easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple complaints:&lt;br /&gt;- The placement of the off/on button.  We have a pedestal sink, and my Waterpik is balanced on the side, in a spot where a soap dish could go.  It fits just perfectly, but there isn&#x27;t any extra room.  Sometimes it gets a little too close to falling into the sink, and if I quickly reach out to push it back, I usually hit the off/on button, spraying myself accidentally.  It seems like there are so many other places I could grab, why grab that spot, but I think it has to do with the height, and the fact that it is on the left side of our sink.  Anyhow, this will probably not be a problem for most people, since I would guess that most people have a little more space.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t think this actually works quite as well as flossing, because when I floss after I use this, I usually still get some stuff.  Not much, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve been using this for six months or so, and it&#x27;s one of the products I am most grateful for.  I am interested to see whether I still like it as much when I&#x27;m done wearing braces.  My guess is that I probably still will, since I think my orthodontist is giving me permanent retainers, which will probably still make flossing a pain.  Even if I lose interest in this once my braces are gone, it will have been well worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with braces.  Or, if you know someone who is getting braces, you could give this as a gift, and you would be giving the most thoughtful, useful gift that could possibly be given to someone getting braces.ibly be given to someone getting braces.</li>
    <li> Excellent design and performance. Purchased with extra tips for my wife. Used it for 4 months every day twice a day (2 persons) &#x3D; 4 times a day. I went to teeth cleaning last week and for the first time the gums were not bleeding. I would still recommend to use floss once a week to scrape extra stuff.</li>
    <li> It is a total bargain! glad I could buy it cheaper than retail price.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it works fine. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. (:</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. It makes my teeth feel much cleaner and my breath smell better on the days I use it.</li>
    <li> My waterpik Ultra Flosser was purchased to replace an aging older model that had a leaking handle. The new model is much more pleasing to the eye and definitely much quiter. The power of the water stream seems comparable to the old model, but the reservoir holds 600ml of water vs. 1000ml for the old model. That isn&#x27;t quite enough water for the way I use the flosser necessitating a refill. I would have rated the unit five stars except for the water capacity issue.</li>
    <li> This item is relatively small so it&#x27;s not an issue to keep on counter top for daily use. Setup is easy and use is too. My wife said it does not seem to have strong enough pressure for her liking but I found it sufficient on setting 6 or 8. I&#x27;m not cleaning pavement here, just flossing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 80 year old dad who has a difficult time brushing his teeth.  He had a stroke and its hard for him to reach his back teeth.  The waterpik has made it a lot easier for him!</li>
    <li> Big dissapointment.  Bought it to replace older Waterpik model. Looks nice but does not have enough force to be effective, even when using the tip with the smallest orifice.  Not only does it lack the power, but water reservoir is too small.  Maybe that&#x27;s why it is quieter than previous models.  Looks better, and is smaller than previous Waterpik flossers, but does not do as good of a job, and the previous models were only average products with a lot of reliability issues. Waterpik never seems to be able to get it all together even though they have had years of experience with flossers.  If there was ever an opportunity for a good competitor, water flossers is one.</li>
    <li> One of friend recommended me the product for the gum. I did some research before I decided to get it. When it came to me, it was so beautiful and I could not wait to try it. It cleaned my teeth very well. I love it and it is worthful.</li>
    <li> Since I live in the country that is using 220V instead of 110V,&lt;br /&gt;I still cannot use this product yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite disappointed to find out that this product is using 110V, no information of this fact in the product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Amazon, please specify this information for all electricity-related products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this product last fall when I got braces. I use it prior to brushing and flossing. It gets all the bits of food out of my braces! The pressure is adjustable, which is very nice. There are multiple tips, which I use to help dislodge food. There is also a button where your thumb is to push and stop the water flow. This has been the best device for my braces. I had purchased a different brand first and it was loud without adjustments.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this waterpik for me for my birthday. I had it on my wish list. Well, a couple weeks later I had the bright idea to put a plug in glade deodorizer above it in my bathroom. Apparently it leaked and dripped the oil onto the top of the water pik and into the blue resorvior - which it melted.  I liked it so much I ordered a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Waterpik to order a new resorvior because my husband decided he would like to have one. Even though it was my fault they sent me a new resorvior and top where the attachments were kept and did not charge me a dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both really like the way the Waterpik works and the many attachments for total mouth care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe that you can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this item from this company.  I am really pleased.</li>
    <li> Not much to say apart from echo all the good statements this product has received.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t do without it now.</li>
    <li> My mouth never felt so clean. It&#x27;s a little messy to use since your mouth fills up with water over and over, but adding mouthwash is a really refreshing alternative to flossing which typically left my gums aching for hours.</li>
    <li> This is so much nicer than the old type waterpik. It is more hygenic and easier to set up and looks so much better.</li>
    <li> This waterpick does a great job. I found an ad from one of the local stores for a slightly better price but considering the convenience of shippining to you house, I don&#x27;t mind</li>
    <li> after 5 uses the on button will not work. Have to unplug to get it to turn off. Of course all the original packaging was thrown away because it worked fine for a short period</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace the WP60.  It is much more compact andeasier to use.  It also has more tips although those on the old one cannot be used.</li>
    <li> A very good product, except that the housing is very thin plastic.  It needs to be handled with care. It does everything as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is my third Waterpik. The first two lasted a long time, but the maximum water pressure has seemed to diminish with each successive unit. My current Waterpik isn&#x27;t as efficient at blasting away food particles, and the downsized water reservoir is half the capacity of the old units, necessitating the drawing of additional warm water to refill. I&#x27;m actually so dissatisfied about my current Waterpik, that I&#x27;m thinking of returning it and buying a different brand. Waterpik, you&#x27;ve really disappointed me.</li>
    <li> I used this twice. The third time, I turned it on. it did nothing, made no sound. It was completely dead. No way to fix it so sent it back. Got a refund.</li>
    <li> OMG! Where does all that crud come from? Seriously, this is going to keep me from having cavities and fillings!</li>
    <li> I really love this waterpik it gets right into the tight spaces the toothbrush can&#x27;t reach..... So I am very pleased</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik.  Worked alright.  It has a little stopped button, that will stop the continuous jet of water that comes out, but it still dribbles out even with that button held down.  Came with a lot of attachments, I played around with em, but landed right back with the first one, the basic one that gives the fine jet of water to get between gums.  I do like the intensity setting on it, so I can turn it down and blast the back of my throat (tonsil stones)  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was my first Waterpik and I was pleasantly surprised. My dentist recommended this model and I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks now. It works almost as well as regular flossing, just not as effective if you have something tightly wedged between your teeth. For 95% of the time it really works as well.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik is an excellent tool for my teeth! I enjoy using it and knowing that my teeth are healthier because of it. It does take some getting used to using, but it is very helpful in keeping teeth and gums healthy. I highly recommend others to get this product.</li>
    <li> We got this on Oct 24th 2011 and for the first 6 months it was good. In the last 6 months the button on flosser you press and hold to stop water flow was getting stuck sometimes.. but it used to work if you press around the button and get it back out. I should have contacted this company to see if they would have done something about it. It finally died last week (exactly like a year, so I suppose I am out of the standard warranty). I will still try to contact them and see if they can help since it is just like 1 year 1 month apprx... will update this review if they are willing to do something about my dead unit.</li>
    <li> This was recommened by my dentist because my gums bled every day. He said this was from a plaque buildup. Since I had my teeth cleaned and use this almost daily, they do not bleed anymore. The reservoir holds enough water for multiple uses even when using for 1 minute of cleaning. I use it on 3/10 for cleaning. It gets really powerful if you want that. It does take up a little space on the counter, but Id rather have plenty of water in the reservoir instead of refilling. I would recommend to anyone who wants to clean their teeth thoroughly!</li>
    <li> Primarily used by 2 people.  Ordered more flosser tips to have on hand.  This product really helps your mouth feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable water pressure is great for different users.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric toothbrush for a while (Braun) and I love the clean tooth feeling.  I tried a waterpik recently and was amazed (and disgusted) what came out from between my teeth after brushing.  I&#x27;ve always been too lazy to floss, so this is great.  I can absolutely tell that it is making a difference.  If you are like me and too lazy to floss, get a waterpik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with multiple regular heads instead of the mostly useless variety pack of heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure dial goes from very soft to holy %^&amp;* hard.  I would warn people to be careful putting the dial past the halfway mark. You can do some damage.</li>
    <li> I love it! I just wonder why didn&#x27;t I find it earlier.  Warning: you need to have an outlet close to the sink.</li>
    <li> After being in my doctors office I saw this item being spoken of in the Dr. Oz show, and I asked my doctor and he said it was worth while getting because it removes 98% of tarter and plaque build up.</li>
    <li> for my daughter.  She thinks it&#x27;s great.he word maximum on this is rediculous.  Don&#x27;t feel like ever filling these out again</li>
    <li> My mom really likes this item. She was looking for something to help her keep her teeth clean between dental visits because she does not go as often as she used to and she really wanted to make sure she was keeping her teeth as clean as possible until she goes back to the dentist and she is really pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> In my family, we like this model of Waterpik the best....compact, great performance, sturdy.  It is the one that gets our highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> After going back and forth on where to buy and if I should purchase a waterpik product, I was compelled to snag one from Tar-jet a week or so ago. The price was very reasonable also with no shipping. However, I credit the thousands of reviews here on Amazon for helping me decide. Since my purchase the whole family has fallen in love with it. I like that there are extra tips available so everyone gets their own. Also we did our own comparison between actual dental floss and then using the waterflosser. It&#x27;s crazy how much junk is missed with traditional floss! I am now suggesting my extended family members pick one up. Since registering the product I noticed a new dual brush &amp; flosser unit called Waterpik Complete Care. There are definitely benefits to having one unit with one plug in when needed instead of two separate units. This would surely simplify things. However, the price is 2 to 3 times what I paid for just the waterflosser ultra and since this unit had rave reviews I figure an oldy but goody is where I&#x27;d spend my money. So if you are on a budget but still looking to make improvements in your or your family&#x27;s oral care this is the product for you. Oan... I had very sensitive gums and an issue with soreness around a filling before I started using this unit which has been resolved.  I am so impressed with the truly long-lasting clean feeling and brightness I get afterward.</li>
    <li> If this saves you from an extra trip to the dentist, it’s well worth it! Although the directions specify using it with only water, I have used it with Listerine and /or peroxide whenever I had a local gum problem or an inflamed periodontal pocket with good effect.  If your gums are in bad shape, the highest-pressure settings may cause superficial bleeding; continued use will eventually make this less of a problem. In any event, don’t rely on my advice, your dentist is probably the last word…but not free…</li>
    <li> For me, it makes more of a mess than it does clean my teeth. It wasn&#x27;t worth it, even though I thought the product was cool.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  We had an older model that fell apart (handle separated).  The older one had storage posts for keeping the different adaptors on and a handle for holding the reservoir.  The way that the adaptors are released from the handle is an A+ compared to the older model.  Probably less chance for the handle splitting.  This one works fine.</li>
    <li> It meets all expectations that I expected even after using a hand pick and then using the water pick and getting more residue from my teeth I was very pleased</li>
    <li> It works well with my braces. It can rinse out the food stuck between my braces. The pressure is good. I am just use the middle ones. I like it.</li>
    <li> At the fist it was perfect. But after one month there is a leak  from the hose ,and water come out  from side before it go to your mouth</li>
    <li> The first one didn&#x27;t have any water pressure, which is the whole point to these! This second purchase was much better and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Waterpik. I had not realized how much was left behind in my line flossing until I used the Waterpik. An amazing amount of tiny pieces of food  came floating out. It is a little messy, but is worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff to get food out between a troublesome filling.  Also good for getting food like popcorn seeds out from between my gums and teeth.  Doesn&#x27;t make a mess either.</li>
    <li> This was replacement for a very old model.  I&#x27;m happy with it though it had too many non-basic attachments and I suspect if you really reinstalled all the pieces after moving it would stay wet.  I leave it apart until it is dry.  They could also make the tank smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works well and I&#x27;m staisfied.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, comfortable and with a lot of fun. I think it is a very good way to clean tooth. However, I wish the water container could be larger.</li>
    <li> I had very crowded teeth before I got braces, and then I had the difficulty of flossing around  braces. This saved me a lot of time and aggravation in both phases. Sometimes I fill it with warm water and use it as a gum massage device. I don&#x27;t really use the other attachments that came with it, just change the pressure and temperature of the water and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an approx 5 yr old Conair Interplak that was damaged in travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Interplak, this unit is flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it high marks for design, and the way the instruments fit into the holder.  The storage of the instruments in the cap to the reservoir is novel and ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the unit shakes when working, it seems to strain on output, and the pump appears not to be as strong as the 5 year old Interplak... which feels like an appliance.  This feels like a toy.  I do not consider this item to be of sufficient build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not returned it, as it is marginally acceptable, and I will keep it as a spare, however, knowing what I know now, I would not buy this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did spend $5 ordering a new tank for the Interplak, and it remains my primary water flossing equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this item on balance?  No.</li>
    <li> When you fill the container with water, the water runs out the bottom, leaving a mess from the sink to the water flosser.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises at a reasonable price. I strongly endorse and recommend to family and friends. My dentist substantiates the manufacturers claim.,</li>
    <li> This water pike works great .I use it every morning I add a little bit of mouthwash in it my breath and teeth feel so clean .Would buy again I love it</li>
    <li> I actually use this more for my nose and it works great with the adapter you can find online. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used several Waterpics over many years.  They are a great help for keeping your teeth and gums healthy.  I love that the Waterpic and find and remove food particles even after you have brushed and flossed!  I recommend this appliance for everyone in the family that needs to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> my dentist thinks i&#x27;m and avid flosser, but my waterpik totally fooled them. really cleans in between the teeth and strengthens gums</li>
    <li> I hate to floss. I know it has to be done after each meal but it&#x27;s so annoying. I ask my dentist if it was a good idea to buy a Waterpik. He says &amp;#34;absolutely&amp;#34;. I ordered it from Amazon at a very reasonable pice. I got it very fast. I read the instructions and voil&amp;agrave;, I was ready to use it. It&#x27;s way better than flossing in MHO. It&#x27;s set up quickly. The jet is very powerful. You can set it up to be less strong. My mouth feels so clean after using it. It reaches places that flossing itself can&#x27;t. I absolutely recommend the Warwepik.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned three waterpiks over the last ten years,  two in the last year.  The build quality of these has gone way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 9 months ago I purchased one through amazon and was pleased for about three months.  Then the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button jammed while running and required turning the machine off to reset, as it continued to do during each use (very annoying).  At the same time the valve from the tank to the body started leaking, requiring reaching in and manually pushing it down before filling (unsanitary).  I lived with this for a couple of weeks and then decided to purchase a replacement at the local department store.  After about 5 months the new machine was doing the same thing.  I&#x27;d think water quality, but with an excellent whole house filter, I don&#x27;t believe that this is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because I think that the waterpik is a necessary device in maintaining dental health. I&#x27;ve tried other water flossers and have not been as impressed by their abilities to clean as well as the waterpik.</li>
    <li> I like the idea but the handle brook the hold botton is stuck inside the handle and i cant use it . I contacted them for replacment wish i kept the box so i could have returned it . The water pressure is not very good and if you use the higher setting you run out of water .</li>
    <li> The blue button on the handle does not work--it got permanently stuck within a couple of weeks after my purchase.  We have tried various instruments to get it to work.  Eventually you can get it unstuck for one time use (place a few heavy books on top of the handle, get an able-bodied person to hold down the handle and get a neurosurgeon to insert tweezers).  But you will need to repeat this operation every time you want to use it.  It is not only tedious, but it means that you teeth will get neglected because a 1 minute procedure is now a 15 minute procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were a physicist perhaps I could explain the workings of this refractory machine; if the button actually worked it might be a great thing to have.  As it is, it&#x27;s a daily reproach to my foolishness in making the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  I got my Mother to get one and I use one.  I only wish I had know about them years ago.  It would have lowered my dental bills. It works great.  I have had mine for 4 years now.  The tray with assorted attachments goes unused.  We just use the basic water pic attachment.  I was sold the first day I used mine.  I did my usual routine of flossing, and brushing as best as I could.  Then I used the water pik and was amazed at what was till left in my teeth that it got out.  Now when I go to sleep at night I know my teeth and gums really are clean.  I like this model because you don&#x27;t have to pay extra for the electric tooth brush.  With so many battery operated tooth brushes out there I did not think I wanted a flosser with the tooth brush.  I like that you can find some replacement parts for this model.  I bought a couple of parts for my old one, not because anything broke, but I love my waterpik so much I don&#x27;t want to be without it if something does need replacing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my grandson who has having dental problems at the age of 8 &amp; he really liked using this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Doubt if I&#x27;d have my teeth without a water pick.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my dentist told me to.  I use it to clean under the gum line.  Since I can&#x27;t see under my gum line, I have no idea whether it&#x27;s working, or not, but it sure feels good using it!</li>
    <li> This will keep your teeth clean and your gums healthy.  I am sure it is tooth fairy approved.  We actually have one in each bathroom.</li>
    <li> I just bought this recently, and really love using it - it is incredibly efficient, effective and makes my mouth feel fantastic!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love flossing all that much but with this I floss twice a day when I&#x27;m home and I have fun doing it. Now I&#x27;m going to buy a portable one for the office.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised.  Would purchase again.  We have another similar unit that is approximately 5 years old and still works well.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended water flossing for my 4 crown bridge. This model is super easy to use, holds plenty of water, isn&#x27;t messy... (Some regular flossing is necessary  for close set teeth.)  I am very happy with this purchase, and hopefully my teeth will be too.</li>
    <li> there is a black rubber stopper piece that starts to corrode and leak. in addition to having to push it back in constantly to stop the leaking then it starts dripping black dye into the tank. i removed it but have to hold my finger over the hole every time i fill it up. disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used nightly for almost 2 years now, it gets the meat packings out from between the teeth (that which I couldn&#x27;t get it out with floss).</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on flossers prior to purchasing one and I ended up choosing this one based on the amount of water it holds, the different attachments it comes with and the price. There is a debate on whether water flossers work better than the traditional flossing method and from what I can tell, they are pretty equal. This particular water flosser has settings that range from 1 to 10. I don&#x27;t know who would use anything above 4 and for what, but I can&#x27;t personally use it past 2. The settings are very intense and I have pretty healthy gums that are not prone to bleeding. That being said, I have tried using this many times and then going behind it with regular floss and I have not had a problem with having &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; left behind. Therefore, I would say that this is sufficient if used properly and regularly. However, traditional flossing would be more appropriate to get out the tough stuff such as popcorn. The intensity one would need from the Waterpik may damage your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Waterpik that does its job and a wonderful price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month before my bi-annual cleaning and my doctor said that my teeth looked great as opposed to the cleaning 6months earlier. It has several cleaning tools even a tongue attachment, works very good!</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpic for years. It has saved my y saved my teeth and gums. They last for years.</li>
    <li> Waterpick should be in your weekly, if not daily routine for your oral health needs.  Working in the oral care industry and having experience working with toothpaste, this is definitely a must for a complete oral care package.  You won&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s nice sometimes put some mouthwash mixed with water so it cleans deep in the gums.</li>
    <li> This is great waterpik, cleans wells and I can control the pressure of water.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there is smaller version of this to take to travel.&lt;br /&gt;One for the travel by the Waterpik is too small of water holding.</li>
    <li> I thought these things would be cost prohibitive to own. In the old days a machine this well put together would have been so expensive to own. I love mine and use it at least weekly when home. I was using it nightly right before I had two teeth extracted. That was why I purchased it when I did. These were recommended to me by the dentist and his hygienist last year and so I looked on Amazon!  Wow!  Just in time... kept me from being in pain and I found that it was was easy to use and easy to clean. Keeping it in a cabinet in my kitchen and dragging it out when I need it... a tip from the dental hygienist that was. I do recommend these to anyone who finds it hard to clean those gum lines and who doesn&#x27;t like flossing all that much. Great machine, good price.</li>
    <li> Works excellent.  quite a few different tips to choose from and use.  It does a thorough job of cleaning and is way better than flossing. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I noticed a negative comment and picture about mold build up in the handle of the waterpik.  This is what I do to avoid mold.&lt;br /&gt;When storing the handle, I turn it upside down and take out the pik so all the water in it totally drains out, and it is left to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime you leave water in the appliance, it is going to mold....especially in a wet climate. Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT VERY MUCH BECAUSE AFTER BRUSHING WITH AN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AND FLOSSING, THE WATER PIC GETS RID OF ANY FOOD PARTICLES IN YOUR MOUTH.  MY MOUTH FEELS SO CLEAN, I&#x27;M A HAPPY CAMPER.&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY THING THAT CAN BE ANNOYING IS TO CONTROL THE WATER AS IT POURS OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.</li>
    <li> OK, so I feel a little picky when I use it. But if this is a bad product, I&#x27;m all wet!!!</li>
    <li> my dentist recommend to me. it is very powerful to clean all unreachable place in my cavity ! keep my gum and teeth healthy!</li>
    <li> Works great! Gave it 4 stars because it does not have a tool for each family member. It has tools for different types of jobs.</li>
    <li> This is the best Waterpik I have had. Cleans and refreshens the mouth great.  I would recommend this Waterpik to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This is a necessary part of good oral care especially if you have any bridges or implants. Even after brushing and flossing, the waterpik will flush out food trapped under the gums. You will have a super clean mouth after using it.</li>
    <li> Very nice and good looking.  I would like the directions to be more useful, for example to include some tips for using it.  It is easy to get water all over yourself.  Also, the tip comes forward too easily while using it; this is a real problem! I was concerned that the top has a compartment for more kinds of tips, but it fits nicely and easily.  However, there should be another regular tip in it, or a place to put another tip on the outside. Otherwise, this becomes a unit for one person. I know that you can buy another set of regular tips, but that means another thing on the counter, and it&#x27;s silly to have the combo when you only need one more.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Varying tips and speed ensure teeth are cleaned well.  Churns throuh the water quickly so if a deep clean is needed you need to refill mid-clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative is it is very loud but I would recommend it as a good value for money purchase.</li>
    <li> I did not know anything like this existed a month ago or so.  I heard it from my dental hygienist.  It works so great.  I like it tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Loved this waterpik!! It was compact, great for small spaces. Powerful, but quiet. I had other models before, but this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> It takes a few times to get using this down. It&#x27;s kind of messay but my dentist recommended it so I bought it. Can&#x27;t say whether it works or not until I go back to the dentist.</li>
    <li> My husband has had one of these for quite some time now. The hose  eventually weakened and had a hole in it so we purchased the same one. Good product!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended I floss better or get a Waterpik. I love this thing and my last visit proved that it was worth the buy. My teeth and gums are much cleaner and no more bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> I have gone through three previous Waterpiks -- the type that have a large (1000ml) reservoir. I was attracted to the WP-100 because it appeared to have a smaller footprint, an important factor in regards to my limited bathroom counter top space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the footprint was smaller, the negative aspects of this unit caused me to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary reason I returned the unit is that the wand hose is, in my opinion, ridiculously short -- I had difficulty getting a good angle with the wand without going through major contortions. I invariably wound up with water running down my arm because of the awkward angles necessitated by the shorter wand hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is about half that of my previous unit which is not enough for my needs. This alone would not have caused me to return the unit but it is an annoying inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump pressure is adequate but definitely less than my previous Waterpiks. The pump in this unit is much lighter weight than the pumps in my previous Waterpiks and that makes me wonder if it&#x27;s going to be as durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it appears that Waterpik has made it easier to replace the wand and hose assembly when the hose begins to split and leak, as it inevitably will eventually do. Too bad they didn&#x27;t go one step further and make it possible to replace just the hose rather than the wand and hose.</li>
    <li> I got this as Christmas gift.  Just spent an hour trying to figure out how to use the thing.  I hear the motor buzzing, but there is absolutely no water flow.  Guess it&#x27;s just a defective unit.  I have heard people recommending waterpik, but I think they are too cheap and unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;Update - it turns out the valve on the bottom of the tank was upside down.  It came like that.  Unacceptable Q/C.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dentist that I needed to take my flossing more frequently but I hate to stick my fingers in my mouth; this was my solution!  I love using it and it comes with fantastic attachments to get your entire mouth feeling cleaner than ever!</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with peridontal disease and this thing keeps the pockets cleaned out, even just using the regular attachment.  Love the tongue cleaner too.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I buy this because of a pocket within my gum. I was skeptical at first but after using this for a few days the pocket started to finally heal up. I use it regularly every day and it makes my mouth feel great.</li>
    <li> I used this WaterPik for 6 months without any issues, and then it stopped working.  The motor ran, but no water came out.  I tried different tips, and the tip was not clogged.  I got so frustrated that I took the whole thing apart, and there were no clogs in the line or tank valves. I let a vinegar-water mixture soak through the pump unit, and that seems to have helped, but I would prefer that this issue be addressed in the user&#x27;s manual (it is not) or that WaterPik provide some easier way to keep the unit running longer than 6 months.  I&#x27;m on city water, so I assume that my water is not \\&quot;hard,\\&quot; but who knows...I can&#x27;t imagine I should be buying bottled water for this thing?!?</li>
    <li> This item works very well as to my expectations. I bought the portable rechargeable one originally and was not that pleased as the pressure was not enough and could not be adjusted. This has an adjustment knob as well as several different attachments</li>
    <li> I bought it for my kids when they got braces, since it so hard to floss with all the brackets, works excellent, when my daughter was done with her braces 18 months later, we went for a checkup, no cavities</li>
    <li> The removal of my wisdom teeth left deep pockets at the back of my mouth where food collects (gross), but this water pik works like a charm. I also use it around my permanent retainer and this is the only thing that can really get in there and clean. I flossed after using this the other day and found NOTHING on my floss. Definitely cleans and refreshes the mouth well.</li>
    <li> This is one awesome little flosser. I&#x27;m impressed, and I&#x27;m in the dental field. Note that it does not make up for regular string flossing, but with clear adult braces, well, food gets stuck and one minute with the Waterpik, I&#x27;m in heaven with clean teeth again. A little loud, and a little shakey, but it packs a punch and does its job! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> We have one that I have used for years. My husband finally asked me for one of his own, so I got him another one for Christmas. We both use them every day and they really do the job of getting out the bacteria and other stuff you don&#x27;t want in your mouth attacking your teeth.</li>
    <li> A co-worker referred me to the Waterpik and I have to say that I works great. My dentist was amazed at the difference</li>
    <li> I love the water pik, i would not use it to totally replace manual flossing after talking to my dentist, but is great to add to the routine and after spicy meals is good to do quick cleaning.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a simple object, uncomplicated, easy to use, quick to use, easy to clean with the final result that my teeth feel cleaner after</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the coiled tube as it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to straighten out easily for use and the lid (which houses the tips) is always falling into the reservoir when I try to put it back on after filling it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> The only issue is there aren&#x27;t replacement main flosser tubes included.  It has more attachments than necessary for most folks.</li>
    <li> This was a terrific model and the power settings and capacity were great.  However the hand held control died shortly after purchase and the rest died within a year.</li>
    <li> I have had a Waterpik for years.  I like this model because it has some features my old one didn&#x27;t. The dental tech said I had the gums of a teen-ager!</li>
    <li> Very nice design. I really like how the tube connecting the handle to the base coils back up out of the way after each use. The Pik works great. Your mouth feels so clean, it&#x27;s almost addictive! I find myself wishing I had it with me all day.</li>
    <li> This works very well and my dentist even commented on how clean my teeth were.  I purchased one because my mom has one and loves it.  Definitely recommend this waterpik!</li>
    <li> This is the first oral irrigator I have purchased.  I have been using it every night for the last two months.  It is extremely easy to use and the directions are very simple.  I read the reviews before making this purchase.  I &#x27;prime&#x27; it every time before use, as per another reviewers suggestion.  I think it is a good idea to do that. The directions to prime it are really easy and it only takes a few seconds each time.&lt;br /&gt;  The results of the irrigator have been wonderful. Any slight gum sensitivity I had was completely gone in the first week or two of use.  I use one and a half containers of water each time. So, I do have to refill the water in the middle of the irrigation.  This is not a big deal to me, but some people may not like that.  I dump out any excess water that I don&#x27;t use before unplugging the machine every night. I have not had any problems or leaks at all with this irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s a great buy. You will be happy with this purchase. I am.</li>
    <li> i bought this item&lt;br /&gt;I like this. This is Very good price &amp; Very Good Quality&lt;br /&gt;My wife also like this.</li>
    <li> this new water pik is not has powerful as my last one.  Water Pik admits changing the product. It is not as effective as it once was.</li>
    <li> My daughter recently got braces and this is the perfect water flosser to help with oral hygiene. It was easy for her to use and even came with an orthodontic tip.  You can adjust the water intensity and pause the water flow.  It has a bigger handle then the older style and is much quieter.  It has a separate water basin that makes it easy to fill and empty.  Definitely met my expectations and is user friendly.</li>
    <li> The product works good and does the job. I was skeptical at first because of all the bad reviews but I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it. The only think i would advise is don&#x27;t put mouth wash in with the water. I don&#x27;t use the product everyday so the mouth wash makes it taste moldy so I think the cords are getting icky from the mouth wash. I washed and sanitized it and it cleans up very well just wont ever use mouth wash with it again.</li>
    <li> GReat for your teeth and lives you with a great fresh and clean denture, very good price for a great product</li>
    <li> Easy to use, leaves my gums feeling fresh and clean. I have implants, so dental hygiene is critical. This little gadget helps me keep my teeth and gums in great shape. My dentist recommended getting a Waterpik, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally took her advice. Delivery on this was prompt, and the machine is simple to operate and easy to set up.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, great deal, got here on time and I&#x27;m so happy to be Prime customer it saves me time and money</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is easy to use, it&#x27;s compact with a convenient resevoir for the water and easy to reach water adjustments. This is so much better than the older model which was hard to adjust the water force, and had an awkward water resevoir, so was more difficult to store as compactly. This one also has several piks conveniently stored under the lid for easy access. Since there are 2 of the same pik, 2 or more people can use the same unit.</li>
    <li> This comes with a bunch of attachements and it really easy to use. The water reservoir comes right off for filling without having to do any work. The actual pic stores right on the front and the cord falls neatly into the housing. Several pressures make it easy to get the one you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit bulky to have on our counter, but we have limited space.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement...this is an upgrade from the one I had.  Great price...much higher at other websites.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome...Works just like I wanted it to work. My wife and I use it everyday and its so easy to set up and use.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra water flosser has great speed as well as good tools to clean your teeth. However there should be a way to open the tooth brush handle in order to get the water out and clean the inside of the equipment so that the water won&#x27;t sit there for long for good hygiene.</li>
    <li> Waterpik was recommended to me, and I wanted to try it - this one is just what I had hoped for, with a quick delivery also.</li>
    <li> My old Waterpik needed to be replaced last fall.  The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser was the closest and updated version of my old one.  I checked several different flossers for features, functionality and durability.  This had the features I liked and had good reviews.  It is very easy to make ready for use and to use.  It has several different tip options.  Overall, I&#x27;ve used it since beginning of December and it works very well.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This review is in two parts. The brief version at the top is for people who want a very quick overview, and the longer version is for people who love to read and learn as much as the can someone else&#x27;s experience of a product. In the longer version I will share numerous tips on how to get the most out of your Waterpik and from your dental routine in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - &amp;lt;&amp;lt; IN BRIEF &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To revolutionise your dental health, use a water flosser. Add in the suggestions I make below and you might be saying goodbye to your dentist. I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using a water flosser. I only have experience with the Waterpik device, but I am sure some of the other brands are just as excellent (in terms of results) if one is not currently water flossing. However, my research indicated Waterpik was the best one to get for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Waterpik for a few years. I had one fault with my Waterpik in that time, and the guarantee was honoured in a timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a clean, fresh mouth and healthy gums, go for it. I am sure you&#x27;ll be happy with the decision. I literally can&#x27;t imagine being without one of these devices. When I travel the #1 thing I miss is my water flosser!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;lt;&amp;lt; MY FULL REVIEW AND INFORMATION &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been into flossing (with the various types of floss tape and strings, etc.) because I have ALWAYS found it would make my gums bleed. I also found it messy (splattering on the mirror when trying to get the floss unstuck from the tight clearance between some of my teeth), time consuming, and not particularly enjoyable. What&#x27;s more, my mouth never felt any cleaner - - I just had to assume it was making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Waterpik that changes completely. My mouth feels fantastic, fresh, and clean after I use the Waterpik. My gums are noticeably healthier, even after less than a week of using it daily the results were noticeable. After less than 7 days, brushing and even traditional flossing ceased to make them bleed. My gums had receded somewhat over the years, and I can&#x27;t yet say whether Water flossing has stopped or is reversing that. But they certainly feel much healthier and happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact the head swivels independent of the handle. This makes it easy to maneuverer around the back of the teeth and from one direction to the next (as you move from one side of the jaw to the other, or from upper to lower behind the teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some reviews saying it comes with 8 tips. Mine came with 6, and that&#x27;s what the product description says it should come with. They are: 2 Classic Jet Tip, Plaque Seeker Tip, Orthodontic Tip, Pik Pocket Tip and Toothbrush Tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the toothbrush tip as I have a Oral-B orbital brush. Even without that, I doubt I&#x27;d use the Waterpik brush. It&#x27;s small and circular, and I think it would be a nuisance to use effectively. The various Oral-B (manual) toothbrushes (the [[ASIN:B00763LZWQ Oral-B Pro-Health Clinical Pro-Flex ]] for instance) have been clinically shown to be superior to most standard brushes, so I&#x27;d go with one of those if manually brushing. I can see how the orthodontic tip would be very useful for someone with braces. A must have, I&#x27;d say. The Pik Pocket tip is great for getting in under the gum-line, especially if you want to deliver medicaments there (like herb extracts, or [[ASIN:B0048IGBD0 Periogen Deep Cleaning Tartar Dissolving Oral Rinse]], etc.) I see on reviewer said it was not much use, but that&#x27;s not been my experience. I have to turn the pressure down to 1 (usually I have it at 10) because it&#x27;s very pointy and powerful. My gums will hurt if using the Pik Pocket tip at more than 2 or 3 pressure setting, because it really gets in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other tips might be handy, although I don&#x27;t use them at all. Let&#x27;s just say, there are plenty of options to suit pretty much every water flossing requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; WATER RESERVOIR &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is plenty large enough. When filled to the top, and using the flosser on the 10 setting (which gets through the water quite quick) I have enough time to give my teeth and gums a thorough going over. If you want to use essential oils in your flosser, note that they will likely damage the plastic (see my \\&quot;Warning\\&quot; below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; NOISE &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not tried any other brand of water flosser. I can say, however, that this device is not loud. I have quite sensitive hearing, and have no issues with the low amount of noise it produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; MAJOR ISSUE (RESOLVED) &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one issue with this device. There is a button on the handle which is intended to stop the flow of water (temporarily, whilst depressed). After a few months the action of the button went stiff and spongey. It kind of locked in place, and water would not come out. It was quickly replaced under warranty, without question. So no complaints there, just a minor inconvenience being without my water flosser for a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; MINOR ISSUES &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the lid to be a bad design. The many tips are stored in the lid, and I think it would have been better to not do it that way. The lid knocks off easily. It also doesn&#x27;t have enough slots for all the tips they provide, which seems silly. As I never use a few of the tips, I just store them elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the coil plastic hose less than optimal. It is rather short so I find I have to bend over more than I would prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; SUGGESTIONS FOR HEALTHY TEETH &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my favourite thing about water flossing is I can use it to delivery various goodies to my teeth and gums. For plaque reduction I suggest trying out [[ASIN:B0048IGBD0 Periogen Deep Cleaning Tartar Dissolving Oral Rinse]]. It will likely save you trips to the dentist. It has a money back guarantee, so there is nothing to loose. I have used it and can say it worked for my beloved and I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things I add to the water, individually or in various combinations are:&lt;br /&gt;- Baking soda (neutralises acids from the gums and teeth)&lt;br /&gt;- Baking soda and ascorbic acid (Ratio of 1:2. Vitamin C is reported to be great for gum health. Mixing it with baking soda buffers it [brings it to a neutral pH], and makes it fizz.)&lt;br /&gt;- Unrefined sea salt (1/2 teaspoon dissolved in warm water. Cleansing and a potential source of ionic minerals)&lt;br /&gt;- Atomodine (recommended by Edgar Cayce for gum health) - [[ASIN:B000WUDNCK Heritage Store Atomidine, 2 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;- 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide - [[ASIN:B0050DS18U 35% H2o2 Hydrogen Peroxide Food Grade]] (for example)&lt;br /&gt;- Cayenne extract (source of vitamin c, and stimulates blood circulation in the gums) - [[ASIN:B000N38PLU Cayenne Extract (200,000 h.u.) 1 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; OTHER DIY DENTAL HEALTH SUGGESTIONS &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are keen to take your dental health into your own hands here are a few suggestions. These are based on the research I have done into DIY dental health over the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;1) If you don&#x27;t already have an electric toothbrush, I HIGHLY recommend it. The one I am using is a [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional 5000]] (made by Braun). As far as I can tell, ANY model of Oral-B electric toothbrush will be an oral hygiene revolution for someone who brushes manually. Each model up in the line simply adds more bells and whistles. Buy whichever model you can afford. I&#x27;ve gone from being a resistant once or twice a day brusher, to an enthusiastic 3x a day brusher. I almost can&#x27;t get enough of it!! As a said... a revolution. See my Oral-B Professional 5000 review for more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) If you&#x27;re super serous about DIY dental health (and relatively competent), I recommend spending $30 on a basic dental tool kit such as this: [[ASIN:B004GGA7BG Dental Tartar Scraper and Remover Set, SS]]. With the mirror and pick you can keep an eye on the your teeth and check on cavities (whether the are appearing, disappearing, or staying as is). The plaque scrapper is great for clearing away any plaque that is resistant to the water flosser and brushing (especially around the gum line, which is where it typically builds up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  [[ASIN:B000I4C074 Dr John Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth+Gum Powder]] is wonderful. I brush with it once a day, and use various other substances the other two times a day. It makes the mouth and gums feel amazing. My partner and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; WARNINGS &gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re heavily into DIY health routines, you may be tempted to put essential oils into the water. For instance, I know many people who love to use Thieve&#x27;s Oil as part of the dental routine. Be warned that many essential oils (especially [[ASIN:B000OUY8MC Thieves Essential Oil]]) will damage the plastic of the water holder, and may also damage the plastics elsewhere in the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oregano, cinnamon, and clove oil will all do this. All three are great for dental health, but not via the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; CONCLUSION &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion please start water flossing. With this brand or another, just go for it. I am certain most people will just love water flossing. For me it has been revolutionary. Waterpik seems like a great brand based on my experience and what I have read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the few minor ways it could be improved, I happily give this product a full 5 STARS *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all the best of health,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Evatt&lt;br /&gt;- Traditional Naturopath, health consultant, and award-winning author of Peace, Power, and Presence.ther things I add to the water, individually or in various combinations are:&lt;br /&gt;- Baking soda (neutralises acids from the gums and teeth)&lt;br /&gt;- Baking soda and ascorbic acid (Ratio of 1:2.

    <li> Love it!  Never used a waterpik before and could not believe the amount of food comes out during using it.  Plus it does not irritate my gums like regular string floss, and cleans out food pockets much quicker.  Only wish I could take it on my hunting trips.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 Stars only because I don&#x27;t know if there is something better out there, but I love it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my waterpik, I recently just got my &amp;#34;beartraps&amp;#34; (braces) on, and flossing is a pain in my poootay. When my ortho told me to floss I gave her that look like she&#x27;s crazy I dont have the time for that. I came across this on amazon and couldnt pass it up. For those of you who are too lazy to floss, this waterpik is your partner in crime!</li>
    <li> As a grown adult on my second go-round with braces, I wanted to make an effort to take better care of my teeth. A friend suggested I get a Waterpik. I guess I had always considered them an unnecessary mess on the bathroom counter. I took the plunge, bought this sweet little number and I LOVE it! I&#x27;m addicted to this thing. I brush my teeth after I eat a bite of anything and use the Waterpik as often as I can when home. Even after thorough brushing I&#x27;m amazed at what I&#x27;ve missed that the Waterpik gets. E[...] I think it&#x27;s the best looking one I&#x27;ve ever noticed and just the right size. It has quite a few different attachments, but I have only used the orthodontics brush so far. It makes my teeth feel so clean and my gums look so much healthier now. I will continue to use it when the braces come off. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one month and I love it. After paying my dentist $400 for a deep cleaning, I decided to purchase this Water Pik.  I love the multiple attachments. I am convinced that regular use of this water pik is going to save me money going forward.</li>
    <li> I went to the dentist to get a regular check up and clean up and was advised by the doctor to regularly floss my teeth as I have a few bottom teeth that are a little crooked and food can get easily stuck in there. The doctor told me that I have good teeth otherwise. So I was looking online for good floss products ( I&#x27;ve used Dentek before and I hate when my gums bled while flossing ). I was looking if there are any other possible options for flossing where I came across someone suggesting waterfloss. I went on Amazon and saw the reviews and immideately ordered it. Used it for the first time and boy i was impressed by the immense water pressure, the shape of the tips and ease of use. Will come back to write an final word on this after I use it may be for a month..</li>
    <li> I bought one 3 years ago, and this one I just bought seems to be lighter, but works just as well. Also the button on the brush of this new unit seems to work better than the old one (ease of push and stop the water). Great product.</li>
    <li> One of the best water picks I have bought and a good price</li>
    <li> obsessed with my teeth. great for oral hygiene and water fights around the house. Will shoot over 20 feet accurately.</li>
    <li> sooo much better then flossing</li>
    <li> Does the job.  My teeth feel dentist-clean after I use this.</li>
    <li> I play a wind instrument and always clean my mouth before playing.  I manually brush, string floss, electric brush, and then use the Waterpik.  I almost always get at least a small amount of food particles with the Waterpik even after doing all the other cleaning.  I think it&#x27;s a good product; had it about a year now.</li>
    <li> Well packaged and quick response. Good Product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product!!!! Keeps teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I got it because I thought it would help me floss more often, and it did for about a month or two.  Flossing is quicker and more convenient for me.  The product itself worked pretty well though, there were a couple minor leaks from the base.</li>
    <li> Cleans good but leaks at the handle</li>
    <li> Weak pump pressure, then the entire thing failed within about 40 uses.</li>
    <li> This unit works Great!! It really gets the stuff that is stuck between the teeth and gums. Start off using a lower setting then increase it as your mouth tolerates it. I find that &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; is good for me.</li>
    <li> so far so good as it seems to clean where my electric brush can&#x27;t,  Time will tell more,</li>
    <li> Works great. Very powerful.</li>
    <li> We had a Waterpik for several years and loved it.  It finally wore out so I immediately ordered another.  The replacement never has had the power of the original and now, after only four months, it has completely stopped.  Of course &#x27;return period&#x27; was only for one month so we are out of luck.  Will look for another brand.</li>
    <li> have to admit I saw one cheaper at my local member store that starts with a C for not only less money but a lot more stuff: Like a carrying case, this waterpik, in addition to a travel size one. I was like, hey I could have got a carrying case? I like more bang for the buck! So really that&#x27;s the only reason I give this a lower rating. I shop on amazon because it usually means I&#x27;ve managed to pay the least, in this case not true. Still I love how the waterpik makes my mouth feel. my dentist told me to go to my local warehouse member store and buy an air pik or air floss? but I researched on amazon and they have a lot of reviews that said they broke so I bought this. My dentist thought I should have bought the other because it&#x27;s less money and then said he hopes his at home doesn&#x27;t break like the other reviewers had mentioned. I don&#x27;t know, it is messy, but what are you going to do? cavities are expensive!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because she wanted it. She loves it. She uses it twice a day to address some reoccurring plaque on her bottom row. Now she says, &amp;#34;Look at my teeth! See-it&#x27;s gone now.&amp;#34; Also, the machine doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space (which was my concern). Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect item to improve your oral health, I have bought 5 of them, one for each adult child and one for my husband and I</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and had to return it. I read good reviews but didn&#x27;t know what to expect from it. I thought it was too messy and couldn&#x27;t see myself using it regularly. Water was all over after first use and I didn&#x27;t find it user friendly.</li>
    <li> This improved the health of my gums immensely. I seldom use the multiple attachments. I would have been better off to buy a less expensive model and order the pocket pik accessory separately. I am a little puzzled as to why the hose developed a crack. The good news is, you can replace the head with the hose.</li>
    <li> I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I&#x27;ve never had the batteries last for two years. Some don&#x27;t make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don&#x27;t want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way. My teeth feel super clean even 12  hours after using this wonderful machine. Well made with quality materials.</li>
    <li> Great product. Price is right.I just need to use it more! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> The concept is a good one for sure and if you are not already using some sort of mechanism to get food and debris from between your teeth, this works.  But it&#x27;s a bit hard to control and we often find that we spray water all over the room and mirror if we loose one second of concentration.  Barring all that stuff requiring one to walk and chew gum at the same time, the product does the job.</li>
    <li> My wife and I do not enjoy flossing.  With the waterpik we have been much better at maintaining our teeth.</li>
    <li> I floss every night, but heard some great reviews on this.  The machine is so simple to use and seems to do a great job on the teeth.  I use the highest setting and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt the gums at all.  It does make a little bit of a mess because you have to be bent over with your mouth slightly open to use.  You do this so the water can get out of your mouth and you can keep cleaning.  So between you moving this over your teeth and your mouth being slightly open bent over your sink water tends to squirt out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really enjoy it.  I even put a little sea salt or essential oil in the water to mix things up.</li>
    <li> The best &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; I have acquired in years. First brush then &amp;#34;Pik&amp;#34; with a cap full of mouthwash added to the reservoir. I look forward to returning to the hygienist who suggested I get the Pik. I&#x27;m certain my gum health report card will improve.</li>
    <li> I have used the Waterpik for several months and am delighted with it.  One of the obscure features that I think represents good engineering is that the coil of tubing can be reinserted in the base with just one hand. The flow of water recently slowed down but all that was required was to remove the plug at the bottom of the tank, scrub it clean (less than a minute) and it is fine again.</li>
    <li> I have a tiny bathroom so this tiny appliance works for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily and have no complaints - it does the job!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an off brand purchased some time back which did not fit the Waterpik accessories.  Works great with choice of pressure and tip.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care how much you brush, when you use the Waterpik afterwards, you are amazed to find all the additional junk that is blasted away from between your teeth and into the sink.  This is a real hide and seek tool and my mouth and breath feel great afterwards.  Waterpik has been around for years, but this new one has the gusto I really like.  My wife likes is a bit softer so she moves the dial to where she feels comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lenny Baby</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened up the second one I bought. But the first one is very good after 2 years.. This one is for our other home.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Better than my last Waterpik that lasted 10 or 12 years.  Didn&#x27;t think it could be better but it is smooth and easy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this unit -  waterpik water flosser ultra wp100. I replaced a Conair interplak which was wonderful while it lasted...but very short lived, just a little over a year and on the hunt again for another. I&#x27;ve had the waterpik wp100 for about a month and used it daily. I love the pressure it has. I keep it at about 5/6 of 10 and the pressure feels good enough to say I&#x27;ve flossed, gotten out the food from between my teeth and feel clean. I like the jetting action of the waterpik, it also comes with extra pieces. The water container is just the right size so I don&#x27;t need to refill it. It sits nicely on my sink counter....it works wonderfully, just hoping it last much longer than my previous Conair....purchased the extended warranty for 2 yrs, just in case ;) love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this model in 2008 from Amazon.  After three years of careful use and only one user (me), the hose cracked.  I then researched other options but decided to give the same model Waterpic a second chance and bought another one.  We&#x27;ll see if the hose cracks again next year (2014).  Based on the way it looks now, I don&#x27;t think long term longevity is this unit&#x27;s strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem, as other reviewers have mentioned, is that water flossing can be messy even if you are careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik advertising as stated above at the time of writing this review says \\&quot;Water jet is clinically proven to be up to 93-percent more effective than flossing.\\&quot;  My dentist and several dental hygienists I&#x27;ve talked to strongly disagree.  They always tell me that I need to floss in addition to using the Waterpic.  That&#x27;s too bad because I hate flossing and was hoping I could just get by using the Waterpic (and regular brushing, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, based on my dentists and hygienists comments since I got the Waterpic, my gums are in better condition than they were before I started using it.  So I recommend this unit if: 1) used along with regular flossing, 2) if you don&#x27;t mind occasionally getting yourself and your bathroom wet, and 3) if you don&#x27;t mind replacing the unit every 3 years or so.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works great. It was recently recommended to me by my dentist. I purchased some extra tips for my husband and twin five-year-olds to use. So far everybody loves using it. Our teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
    <li> Why isn&#x27;t there an option to leave zero stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I put water into the tank, it started to leak.  How do I know this?  I had walked out of the bathroom for no more than 20 minutes and came back to find a puddle of water on the counter.  The culprit?  The bottom of the wand.  Drip....Drip....Drip.  I never even used the thing (I did follow the directions to prime it) so I have no idea how well it works to actually clean teeth.  However, I can assume that it cleans teeth about as well as it holds water.  Oh wait!?  It doesn&#x27;t even do that!</li>
    <li> Well, I had never even thought of buying a WaterPik but my dentist recommended it recently.  My goodness, I love this gadget.  It cleans so well.  You can brush and brush, then use regular floss but still the WaterPik will bring out particles from gumline that you would have never known was there.  Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Broke my arm and could not use floss.  This was a great alternative and I am happy I bought it.  The arm is now healed, but this is preferable, so I continue to use it instead of the string floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;  Easy to use  Cons:  Water pours out of your mouth in a steady stream so it is kind of messy.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for another waterpik.  I have been so satisfied with the performance of any waterpik product I have owned.</li>
    <li> His teeth are very close together and quite crooked in the back.  He cannot floss because he can&#x27;t get the floss between his teeth. We got him this Waterpik, and he loves it!  The last time he went to the dentist, the dentist was very pleased and made a comment that he was doing something different than before.  The dentist told him to keep using the Waterpik because it&#x27;s working!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this about 3 years ago. It has been through two kids and their braces. I would always hear the orthodontist tell some of the other clients that they needed to do a better job cleaning. She always commented on how well my kids kept their teeth clean.</li>
    <li> easy to use -can adjust pressure like the storage area that is located in the top lid that holds the extra use tips</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO REMOVE FOOD FROM YOUR TEETH, ALONG WITH FLOSSING OF COURSE....AMAZING TO SEE HOW MUCH STILL COMES OUT FROM BETWEEN YOUR TEETH EVEN AFTER BRUSHING, AND WE USE A SONICARE. OUR DENTIST SAYS OUR TEETH ARE GREAT, SO MUST BE A BENEFIT.</li>
    <li> I used Waterpik many years ago as recommended by my dentist.  At the time, I was beginning to show evidence of periodontal disease, and the use of the Waterpik along with an ultrasonic toothbrush reversed it.  I quit using it when it gave out and didn&#x27;t replace it with this one for many years.  Again, I was seeing periodontal disease - worse this time.  In the month or so I&#x27;ve had it, the progress has already reversed and I&#x27;m very, very happy about that.</li>
    <li> This is a most-have device. Cleans deeper than brushing and flossing together!!! I would recommend it for those who love or need really clean teeth.</li>
    <li> What an improvement over the last water pik I used for the past several years.  I constanly had trouble getting the water to flow and was hesitant to try another one.  Glad i did.  It works great, the water flows instantly and consistantly.  I love the way the cord stores inside the little pocket on the side.</li>
    <li> I love it and my dentist and hygienist loves it also.  My dentist promotes this item as one of the better ones.  Easy to use and has interchangeable heads for various uses.</li>
    <li> I have been so pleased with the results of my waterpik, that I am purchasing one for my parents! I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as my older twenty five year model.&lt;br /&gt;Does not perform to level of my older waterpik, but does an OK job.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I never floss and my dentist said I better or my teeth will fall out of my mouth. So, I bought this and it has helped keep my mouth and teeth extra clean. However, I still floss before I use this because I do not think it cleans as deep as floss can.</li>
    <li> Seriously, you need to buy this. I will never go back to simply brushing my teeth (well, unless I&#x27;m going somewhere and I can&#x27;t take it with me). Honestly, that&#x27;s the only downside to this. Not travel-friendly. Otherwise, I love it! I&#x27;m sure you will too.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product because i have sensitive gums and it reduces my plague buildup making my next dentist appointment less painful. I still floss so this does not replace flossing whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This has been so great for me.  the only thing I have trouble with is the little hose keeps getting in my way when I try to put it away.</li>
    <li> I dislike using string floss but the water flosser is really great.  I&#x27;ve used the battery operated flossers but have been dissatisfied with the batteries holding up.  I have had 3 of the battery operated flossers and still have one that is doing ok and another that is a bit weak.  The Ultra Water Flosser plugs into the 120V outlet and is really great.  If I pay attention to my flossing instead of daydreaming while I&#x27;m flossing, the water reservoir is adequate for a complete flossing job.  Of course, if you floss fast then there is more than enough water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product when it was new. After a few month it became a huge noise maker. I think all the accessories were just eye candy, I never found they were really useful. It would make more sense for the manufacturere to use that cost to improve the overall quality. I&#x27;m looking for a new water flosser, but not this one.</li>
    <li> its a few less dollars then at the stores around my town. i bought my kid one for her braces, so she can have a cleaner mouth and works very well because she hates flossing, so i guess this is an easy way to go about it for her. but i bought this one for me, and i have have braces too, it seems very strange to me to use it, its a bit messy, but it works well, still i was hoping for a cleaner feel for me, but i still have to brush with my regular toothbrush after. but it does get all the food out my braces, and together with this and brushing,  the dentist says my gums look healthier, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> This is very compact, sturdy and useful. It took a while for it&#x27;s first run as it needed to build pressure, but after that, this is awesome product. Cleans between teeth and you can literally feel that..</li>
    <li> Have been using the one we had for the lasy 6 years, and it finally gave out after all the use. We love ours and will always have one. They work great.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a cordless flosser but reading the reviews changed my mind. The Waterpik Ultra was a good choice -- it comes with a variety of tips but I use only two.  The others may be useful for people with braces but not for most users.  The price of $45 plus free shipping is still a steal as this model is a cut above in both quality and design.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik model has more power and finer pressure control than earlier models.  It is also easier to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I had a hydro floss and when it finally quit, I knew I couldn&#x27;t be without a flosser.  Tried the Waterpik because of the difference in price.  I love everything about this flosser.  We travel full time in our RV &amp; it&#x27;s size is much better for the small space we have than the Hydrofloss.  It also has much more control over the force of the water.  I have only had it for about a month but so far no complaints.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This machine works as described by mfg. It is a quality machine.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is an unbelievable adjunct to oral health.  Used after brushing, it leaves teeth clean, gums healthy, and breath fresh for hours.  This is my second unit, and the original one I purchased, lasted a good 5-6 years.  There is no mess when used correctly.  You will be amazed at the job it does, and how easy it is to use,  Enjoy all the benefits it has to offer.  Ron</li>
    <li> It met all expectations.  Had been recommended by our dentist.</li>
    <li> As a dentist, I prefer it over all other similar appliances. I use it 2-3 times a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this Waterpik in a plan to supplement my flossing. Keep in mind that you should still floss and not replace flossing with a Waterpik. This is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: The handle that expels the water is a firm plastic and feels like it could last for many years. I have not had any issues with faulty parts or breaking pieces  in the year that I have owned it. I will be sure to update again once I start to see any noticeable wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: For the most part I was pleased with how this waterpik cleaned between my teeth. I will say that at times I do wish it went a little faster. The pressure when I first started using it seemed to be adequate, but as time went on I seem to have gotten more use to the pressure and needed an extra boost. Now I cannot say if this is from me getting use to the pressure or the device not working as well. Something to keep an eye on for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This is a great little tool to keep your mouth clean and your dollars out of dentists hands. I would note for those that have used many waterpiks that this one does not having amazing pressure. You might want to look elsewhere if you really like to be blasted. I give it 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: For the best results put a little mouthwash and salt mixed into the water tank. This will help to kill germs that water and pressure cannot kill alone. Plus you can use it on your tongue to get minty fresh breath!</li>
    <li> More cheap crap from China.  I foolishly trusted the Waterpik name and purchased this.  The wand leaks no matter if you hold the button or not, it as at the very least constantly dribbling.  The coiled plastic tubing that connects the wand to the container is too short,  stiff and unforgiving, does not lend itself to ease of use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My WP-100 broke at the hose after several years of use. That was a good Water Pik. I ordered the Waterflosser Ultra to replace my WP-100 model which broke at the hose after several years of reliable use. While the Ultra model looks much the same as the WP-100, it runs very, very loud. It is so loud that I have actually resorted to wearing ear protectors like those jackhammer operators wear when using the Ultra. I called Amazon with this complaint. Fortunately, they have provided me a shipping label for the return and processed a refund.</li>
    <li> Its great!  Use with 2 tablespoon hydrogen peroxide with your favorite mouthwash plus water.  I use it kind of in a gross way but it works and you dont waste solution.  I put the whole device in the sink, spray my mouth and let solution run out of my mouth back into the reservoir and keep going.  Saves solution and you can continue for prolonged periods of time.</li>
    <li> I was amazed the first time I used this Waterpik.  The sheer amount of crap it flushed out from between my teeth and under the gums was incredible.  The signs of its effectiveness was visible in the sink and my arm hair afterwards (disgusting but true).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a minty fresh clean feeling so I fill about 1/4 of the reservoir with a generic clear mouthwash (mint in my case) and the remaining 3/4 with very warm but not burning hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing makes quite a mess.  Doing it over a sink at a minimum is a must.  Clean off the counter because nothing is safe.  Ideally you could do this in the shower but this thing is electric so... no.  Use your lips to catch some of the splatter off the surface of your teeth.  This helps.  Let the liquid drain out one side of your mouth and into the sink.  Try to not let it run down your hand that&#x27;s holding up the wand if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re done rinse the reservoir out, add hot water and flush the line.  I let the reservoir sit cross ways on the base overnight so that it can dry out.  Rinse the wand under the sink and curly hose too.  There are reports that the guts inside the wand can mold.  This is why you wash the crud out and try not to get crud into it to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is an effective tool.  You have to brush and floss first for this style of pik according to my dentist.  It&#x27;s not a substitute for either.  It works very well though.</li>
    <li> Excellent for mouth health.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Gums feel great.  Pockets cleaned out.</li>
    <li> Fanastic product have been using since deep cleaning at dentist - my last checkup was amazing - This is by far the most important ingredient to excellent, near perfect, gums, clean teeth and overall dental health I&#x27;ve found. My dentist was extremely impressed with improvement in areas with deep pockets and, gum reattatchment after deep cleaning - this was was beyond expectatiions.  Be sure everytime you use it or change tools you follow the instructions on turning it to high and letting it run for a few seconds - then turn the dial to the desired strenghth after it is &amp;#34;warmed up&amp;#34; - I also find that it helps to keep a mug at the sink to refill the resevoir before it completely empties - that way you can continuously use without completely stopping and starting. I refill about 3-4 times during each use - very easy to push the pause button, fill mug with water (I also add a bit of hydrogen peroxide to the mug) then pour it into the resevoir and release the pause button on handle to continue.  Someone also said they had a probem with water pooling under the unit  - I set the unit on a small towel or washcloth while using to prevent this and leave it until all residual water has drained. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> works better than flossing.  I floss and then use this you wouldn&#x27;t believe what is left after flossing!  If you hate flossing this is definitely for you!</li>
    <li> Wow. very powerful. I really like using it and makes me want to floss more often</li>
    <li> Seems to do its job well.  like the adjustment for power.  Have not used all the attachments that came with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my dentist, and it&#x27;s great.  Easy to use, and my teeth feel and look cleaner even before I reach for my toothbrush.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone else looking for a water flosser.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Adjustable pressure works very well.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this waterpik. I like both the pressure control knob and the button that temporarily stalls it while I change positions in my mouth. It&#x27;s relatively compact and sits on my countertop without getting in the way.</li>
    <li> The product matched expectations. And the deadline was met.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this store to all</li>
    <li> It is a little noisy but I heard all water like are noisy.</li>
    <li> Powerful enough to blast those uneeded bits of leftovers from the tiniest places in your mouth.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st time I purchased a waterpik &amp; find it to be doing a great job!  It&#x27;s also easy to operate &amp; stores nicely with minimal space.</li>
    <li> Used this for well over a year now. I think it&#x27;s awesome! I&#x27;m amazed by how it can get small food particles between your gums and teeth out.&lt;br /&gt;I put a capfull of hydrogen peroxide with each use (Filter the hydrogen peroxide after each use by adding more water and letting it run for a little.) Don&#x27;t let it run without water in the reservoir. I always leave a little bit of water on water reservoir so it keeps the rubber piece on the bottom from drying (basically helps it last longer).&lt;br /&gt;Mine still works perfectly fine as long as you take the time to maintain it.</li>
    <li> A real piece of junk.  Fine out of the box.  But within a month the handle began leaking from the side, slowly at first, the growing to a steady drip.  Unimaginable that a company can continue to sell such a shabby product.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product and I am very happy with it.  I have had an older version for many years and find this new one a great improvement.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I did not expect that the water will be splashing out everywhere once you turn on the machine. And it has this like &amp;#34;little generator sound&amp;#34;. i guess because of the water coming through the small reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;I still believe that flossing is flossing. And that this water flosser is not exactly replacing the silk floss.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for a relatively short time now. It was recommended to me by my dental hygienist because I have a bridge which appeared to require more than regular brushing and flossing and I have not been disappointed with my purchase. I purchased this product for my son who recently got braces.</li>
    <li> I wish I purchased this years ago. For me it works much better than sting floss.</li>
    <li> I was having some gum issues that concerned my dentist, and their office suggested I try a Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have flossed on a daily basis for many years. I can tell when I skip flossing for a few days; my gums feel not-quite-right. I&#x27;m married to Mr. Never Flosses, and I have one son who flosses and one who doesn&#x27;t (and has horrible gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. NF and I are complete converts. I use the Waterpik twice a day, and he uses it once a day and says he can feel a big difference. Bonus: his teeth are whiter, and mine feel like I just had a professional cleaning every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our flossing son is still flossing, but we got a Waterpik for our son with the bad gums. He reports using it and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a return visit to the dentist, they were thrilled to hear of our good results. They love to have great stories to tell other patients. They even rewarded my results with a Starbucks card. Another bonus!</li>
    <li> I like this product, it does what I expected.  It is a little messy, you need to keep over the sink , as the water goes everywhere.  Don&#x27;t forget to push the off button when you open your mouth to empty it, several times.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik for years and wanted something that was a little smaller than my 1979 version (which still works by the way). This new one is compact and easy to wipe clean. I use it every night without fail! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I like this Waterpik.  Lots of head options.  One reviewer said it didn&#x27;t come with 2 &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; heads, but mine did.  It seems very similar to the product my family had in the 70s.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> everyone should have one of these</li>
    <li> This is one of my important thing in my life, I use it every night even I travel. Now my most concern I will travel outside the country, the one I have properly is not working with me.</li>
    <li> This pick has many replacements and different brushes.  Nice to be able to adjust speed.  Nice to have a lid which the kid version has none of the above.  Super easy to use...</li>
    <li> Problem with deep &#x27;pockets&#x27; which my electric toothbrush couldn&#x27;t reach.  My dentist recommended a Waterpik and after reading all the reviews on Amazon I decided to the Waterpik Ultra. I am so please with this product, and surprised at just how much &#x27;junk&#x27; the Waterpik dislodges even after brushing.  My deep pockets are still there, but are not getting worse;  my gums and teeth feel good, and noticeably cleaner. My dentist suggested adding a small amount of Hydrogen Peroxide to warm water, which I do but always rinse out the Waterpik with plain water afterward. Works for me, and I am happy to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My last Waterpik broke. This one is quieter and works well. I like that all of the attachments are stored covered in the lid.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected, takes some getting used to with water running out of your mouth constantly-- keep lots of towels around for the first few tries (you&#x27;ll forget where the water is coming from as you adjust things etc).&lt;br /&gt;Reservoir may be small for people that use it on a higher setting &amp; move it slowly over each tooth like I do: I just keep my toothbrushing cup out to refill it with warm water once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;We may consider purchasing the &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34; version of this if this one ever fizzles out- would probably be easier to use this in a shower where the mess is more controlled.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried any of the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; tips, but the standard one works well for me on a 8 or 9 setting.</li>
    <li> As a long-time periodontic patient, I have stuggled with a build up of plaque for many years. For the past year, my new dental hygienist has suggested at each of my three-month checkups that I buy a water flosser as I have admitted that I don&#x27;t like to floss my teeth with the string floss.  I finally decided to buy this product after my last check-up.  Today, I had my first three month visit after purchasing this item, and the hygienist - for the first time ever - remarked at  how good my teeth and gums looked.  I did not tell her what I had done differently until the end of my cleaning.  When I finally told her what I had done, she was elated.  The cleaning, by the way, took half the time that she normally would have spent.  Too bad she didn&#x27;t reduce the price of the cleaning by half!  I have no complaints about this product other than one has to be careful not to spray the entire bathroom conter top and mirror when using it.  It does take some practice to contain all of the water within one&#x27;s mouth, but it obviously does make a difference. I will continue using it and will probably buy a portable one to take with me when traveling.  My good \\&quot;report card\\&quot; has made me a believer.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday.  It hads helped to restore heath to my gums and is as routine as brushing every night.</li>
    <li> have had PERFECT checkups since I started using this - After flossing and brushing - My nighttime teeth cleaning routine now takes 30 minutes - but tis worth the extra time since my teeth &amp; gums are in great condition from all the cleaning</li>
    <li> The Waterpik is a decent adjunct to brushing one&#x27;s teeth.  If I had used it when I was younger, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have had to buy the Toothtemp product.  It could benefit by having a more forceful flow of water, comparable to the Crystal Pond Waterfall Pump I recently purchased.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviews about how poorly made this product was and how quickly it breaks.  Bought it for my daughter when she got her braces on and it worked well for 6 months and then died.  My advice is to pass this one by and keep shopping.</li>
    <li> Does as promised (actually a bit more then promised, watch the settings). Only negative, messy.... But with practice the mess is controllable.</li>
    <li> This device is fantastic - it has helped my gums and teeth sooo much.  I use it 2x daily and have noticed that my gums are healthier and my teeth are brighter.  It gets food particles out of your teeth, even after brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended the Waterpik to anyone that is having trouble with plaque, gingivitis, or gum problems.</li>
    <li> Love this machine. cleans great like having a professional cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is the best Waterpik.  Small, doesn&#x27;t take up too much room, is very powerful and works great.</li>
    <li> Ordered this item per dentist&#x27;s suggestion.  Works great!  Very simple to operate.  Nice to have storage for tips in lid.  Pause button comes in handy.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I already submitted a review. It&#x27;s just what I expected why must I submit more words. this is very contrived</li>
    <li> The product itself, if it works, is great! I just got braces, and this is a godsend. I will never go back to regular floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said this, I must have received a lemon... After purchasing a waterpik for myself, I bought one for a friend of mine (which works perfectly), then another one for my parents. The one I bought for my parents was a total lemon, a dud... there is no power behind the water pulse - I even moved around the rubber piece that connects the water tank to the machine, wiggled it around so that the crosses match up, but only saw a slight improvement. My parents of course didn&#x27;t know how powerful the water jet was supposed to be, so it went unnoticed until I used it myself recently. Now it&#x27;s too late to return and it&#x27;s pretty much useless now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when you purchase this item -- the water should be very powerful when it&#x27;s set to the highest setting. Test it out and return it when you can.</li>
    <li> I had a previous water pic and when it was turned up high it seemed as though the force of the water was stronger in the previous one!</li>
    <li> I had a waterpik 30 years ago.  Nice upgrade, works well, I am glad I bought it.  Tip, keep it on the lower settings.</li>
    <li> I have had this unit for a little over a month now and I like it.  I hate using tooth floss and this helps me get to my nooks and crannies with out having to go through that dreaded process.  I feel like the range of power 1-10 is more than enough.  Some teeth are more sensitive, so I do tend to turn it down based on the part of my mouth I am spraying down.  A lot of people on here said that this Water Pik makes a big mess...well, that is expected when you have a tiny little spray gun in a small indoor space.  My tip is to partially close your mouth and let the water run out the opposite side of the spraying action.  So, do I like it?  Yes.  Is it a groundbreaking device that helps does miracles to your mouth? No.  It&#x27;s a nice, strong, steady stream of water that does what it says it&#x27;s going to do- clean your teeth and the spaces in between.  One word of advice- do not use cold water when filling the chamber.  Your teeth and nerves will thank you for it.  But I do enjoy adding a splash of mouth wash to the water just to add a little jolt of refreshment.  My mouth has never felt so clean.  :D</li>
    <li> It actually works better than I expected. I thought it&#x27;d be a fancy miniature hose (which, it still is I guess), but it&#x27;s a very effective one. I&#x27;m a semi-regular flosser, and the first time I used the Waterpik, I had already flossed. &#x27;Leftovers&#x27; still came out. Kind of gross, but great proof to me that it works. Having gotten braces recently, I can also say that this is a major time-saver compared to traditional flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t bother with any of the attachments except the standard one, so while others might make use of them, I think they&#x27;re a bit excessive. The cords are both plenty long enough, and my only complaint about the system is that, no mater how careful I am, I seem to get water everywhere. Maybe a few more weeks of practice will help. The reservoir is not overly large, and I never drain a full one in one go.&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews here about the main handle accumulating mold and mildew, which I don&#x27;t question since water does get everywhere. However, if you take the attachment out, you can fit a q-tip down the shaft to help dry things out, and a quick pat with a towel on the outside solves matters there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I absolutely hate to floss.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of dental work done, and the spaces in between my teeth are pretty tight sometimes because of fillings.  Well, I just got back from the dentist after using this product for about 5 weeks, and he couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how much my dental health had improved.  He told that in his opinion, traditional flossing was better than using the waterpik, but at the same time he couldn&#x27;t stop gushing over the improvement I&#x27;d made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone, it was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, one trick I learned to motivate myself to take better care of my teeth is putting some music on as I brush my teeth and not listening to it when I&#x27;m not.  Makes it a lot less &#x27;boring&#x27; to brush and waterpik my teeth thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Never tried this before.  Much easier than flossing ! Do it&lt;br /&gt;They said I needed 9 more words on my review so here they are.</li>
    <li> Love using this cleaner. If you use and then don&#x27;t have access to it, you really miss using it for sure!!</li>
    <li> I like the product, but it&#x27;s a little tricky keeping the water all in your mouth, and not having it leak a bit. I think it&#x27;s a technique that needs practice. I would still recommend the product.</li>
    <li> it worked great until it broke down yesterday, blowing a fuse in the house at the same time. I used it twice a day, everyday.</li>
    <li> My parents have one, then a couple months later my brother got one, and now I have one. It&#x27;s family trusted for me and that&#x27;s all I needed to try it myself. A+ product.</li>
    <li> It was suppose to work, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get the hard lodged items in the mouth out.  Wasn&#x27;t that the purpose of this? To replace floss?</li>
    <li> i really recommend this, it helped heal pocketing ive had using the smallest accessory which is called the &amp;#34;pikpocket&amp;#34; attachment. the other heads work good as well, but this is especially good at cleaning out small areas. i mixed in some dilluted peroxide with water, and this thing will heal your gums over time.</li>
    <li> By far the best water pick yet developed.  Very convenient, smaller footprint, center tube location, quietness, tool assortment and general overall appearance make it excellent.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Cleans perfect and is easy to use.  Buying another for my father to use since he has had gum problems.</li>
    <li> I recently had dental implants put in to support my lower dentures.  I bought the Waterpick because the doctor warned that I had to keep the implants clean because they could fail just as natural teeth could if they were not taken care of.  He recommended the Waterpik.  So far, so good!  The Waterpik works great to keep the gum tissue surrounding the implants clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AA,&lt;br /&gt;Port St. Lucie, FL</li>
    <li> Never have used one of these but after having serious gum issues i thought i would give it a try.Very easy to use and comes with impressive array of instruments.Flexable sellings allow for a deep cleaning of gums.It even comes with a tongue cleaner,all neatly&lt;br /&gt;placed in small compartment on the unit.I think this is a great tool for oral hygene,espesialy if ,like me you have problems with your gums.By the way,i have very sensative gums,and the settings allow me to use the multiple instruments without discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;A solid five star product and at a decent price.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I just have to use it on a more regular basis. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of my dentist, in addition to a sonic toothbrush, I use a Waterpik Water Flosser to aid my gums.  I use warm water and 2 capfuls of Listerine (C).  I was shocked at the particles that I saw in the sink after the first few uses.  After use, I run a little clear fresh water to clear the Listerine out of the line to reduce effect on the machine. I still get a shower when I&#x27;m working the back of my upper teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advice: did you ever close your mouth when the suction device is in at the dentist office and it feels like your eyes are being sucked in?  Well a water flosser is the opposite..... close your mouth and you become an instant cartoon.  There&#x27;s a lot of water coming out !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this device at least once a day EVERY day and most days twice ! I love it !</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and it was recommended by my hygienist.  Just have to learn to keep mouth closed more so I don&#x27;t get a bath too.</li>
    <li> If you have the space on your counter top, it sure beats flossing!  It has an intensity setting from 1-10. The most I can stand is an 8. Debris is dislodged that earlier brushing misses. Hopefully the price of the Waterpik will pay for itself will lower dental bills.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Compact. Most importantly great pressure that is easily controlled. Lots of attachments for different types of cleaning.</li>
    <li> it meets my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to use, and it is effective. Will recommend to friends in the future.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this waterpik.  I guess it does a pretty good job, works as advertised and has the attachments that I need, but it is a little messy to use.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is very good for washing teeth.  After using waterpik you don&#x27;t have bad breath.  I bought 3 of them.</li>
    <li> bought this for my gf she has braces works amazing highly recommend I use it sometimes works perfect its small but I love it</li>
    <li> for the most part.  I cannot leave the plug in or water in the basin as it leaks if left sitting.  Other than that, I simply rinse out the tub when I&#x27;m done and refill it upon next use and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a visible difference in my gums and teeth since starting to use this product.</li>
    <li> We purchased this when our much older waterpik died.  I read reviews and decided on this style and version.  I really like the job it does.  The ability to set the intensity is useful.  I started out with it at a pressure that was too high and it actually made my gums a little sore.  Gradually, I increased it and tolerate it just fine.  My only negative comment is I think it is a bit &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; to use. The instructions say to keep your mouth slightly open to allow the water to run out while using.  Well, doing so just seems to make a splashy mess that requires a little tidying up afterwards.  Also our older model was cordless so getting used to being &amp;#34;tethered&amp;#34; to the machine takes a little getting used to as well.  I may be doing something wrong but it does not diminish the usefulness and quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price with very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I do not like the fact when you turn this on you have to make sure your holding the button down, it should be the opposite on the handle. it keeps cutting off and on. There is a short some where. Driving me crazy.</li>
    <li> It works well! A little bulky but the storage of the supply line is a good improvement on previous models.&lt;br /&gt;No regrets!</li>
    <li> This is our 3rd Waterpik flosser, so I am pretty familiar with their product line. The first one \\&quot;broke\\&quot; because I didn&#x27;t know you had to flush the unit after using mouth wash. We replaced it with a WP-65 which I recently broke trying to eliminate the mold in the unit. I now know better that it&#x27;s not just flush the unit with regular water, but we now use a white vinegar flush that is 4% acidic. We buy the huge white vinegar from one of those popular warehouse clubs. So let me break the issues down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- this pertains to all Waterpik units. I am a horrible flosser and when I did floss, it never was as thorough as the Waterpik. Don&#x27;t believe all those reports that flossing is better than these Waterpiks. When I started regularly flossing, I was struggling for years to get my gums healthy. According to my dentist, red, as in not pinkish-white, gums are actually infected with bacteria and plaque. The bacteria is actually considered an infection which is why your gums will bleed if you don&#x27;t floss or use the Waterpik often. Pinkish-white gums are healthy gums and do not bleed. When I was flossing and trying to make my gums healthier, I would even massage them with my toothbrush I tried to get them healthy with flossing, but to no avail. I then got braces so I knew I would hate flossing that and I bought my first Waterpik. My next dental check, with braces, got rave reviews from my dentist and he said whatever I&#x27;m doing, keep it up. My gums are so healthy now, my dentist says I am one of his best oral hygiene patients! He always repeats that too at every check up.&lt;br /&gt;- this pertains to all Waterpik units, too: I saw a write up that said that flossing was cheaper than the Waterpik saying that flossing costs $5 while the Waterpik costs $60. Well, my last unit was $36 and lasted 3 years, so that&#x27;s $12/year. I had a filling fall out last month that was at my gum line. The dentist drilled a little more and then commented that because my gums are sohealthy, they are not bleeding. He said normally, fillings in this position are hard to avoid hitting the gum line a little and in most patients, it causes so much bleeding that the filling can&#x27;t go in and instead they have to do a crown... a crown vs. a filling? I easily saved $1000 because of my extremely healthy gums, no bleeding, just needed a filling not a crown. No review of Waterpiks vs. flossing that I have ever seen takes this issue into consideration and never did my flossing ever produce these healthy gums, even with my massaging of the gums too, as recommended by my dentist at the time I was flossing. I still had gums that bled a little which meant they still had bacteria and plaque. The Waterpik blows flossing away in my opinion. It can&#x27;t get all the plaque, that&#x27;s true, but by in large flossing seriously didn&#x27;t either. My gums are pinkish-white and don&#x27;t bleed. You do the math.&lt;br /&gt;- I picked up this unit as a replacement to the WP-65 that I broke trying to get rid of the mold (I whacked the handle a bit too much). Even though we always flushed the unit with a reservoir of water after using the unit with mostly water and just a cap full of Listerine to floss, it still grew mold. Lesson learned and we now flush this unit with 4% white vinegar. For this unit, I like the fact that it&#x27;s jet was a bit stronger than the WP-65 and that it has special attachments like the orthodontic one for me and the bridge one for my husband. We will continue to rinse out the mouthwash with the white vinegar to keep the mold away. All units are subject to the mold problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Irritatingly, the amount of water it can hold is about 1/2 of what the WP-65 holds. I have to have a huge cup with water and a cap full of Listerine on stand-by to keep refilling the resevoir.&lt;br /&gt;- Although it takes up less room on the sink, which is not an issue for us, it&#x27;s rubber feet absolutely do not hold the unit in place and the switch is different; it&#x27;s awkward so when you try to turn it off, the whole unit slides and you can no longer turn the unit off with one hand, you have to use 2 hands which is hard to do because your hands are also wet and the Waterpik is still shooting out the water... unlike the WP-65 which has a sliding switch that was easy to slide on and off and the unit itself never slid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the only thing I like about this unit is the stronger jet and the special flossing attachments, the latter of which we could have bought separately. I saw a guide on I think Waterpik&#x27;s website that compared all the current units. It said that both this unit and the WP-65 had 900s of water flossing. Way not true. I&#x27;m thinking of contacting Amazon to see if I can return this unit and buy another WP-65.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost 3 years using it but still work great</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I purchase this waterpik.  I was not getting rid of all the flack in my gums which could lead to further trouble.  I am really glad I got this waterpik and have already noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I floss , also use the brush and other tools.  I had one before and, very useful and my dentist appointment&lt;br /&gt;for cleaning twice year are always good.  Last twelve years I have been suing sonic toothbrush and electric flosser.,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the video that the person made about how to operate the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;What a GREAT product !!!! Wasn&#x27;t going to order a new one,but my old waterpik the hose broke and couldn&#x27;t see how to replace it. But this one is so muc quieter and has afew more things on it then the one I had. Know when I go to the dentist he can tell that I have been using a water flosser and he is glad I am using one.&lt;br /&gt; Again really enjoy using this !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger&lt;br /&gt;Minnesota</li>
    <li> Disappointed that this Waterpik Flosser has less water pressure than the original Waterpik this one replaced.  Works great otherwise.  Not sure why Waterpik chose to cut the water pressure but if you owned an original Waterpik be prepared to make an adjustment with this one.</li>
    <li> I wish the coiled cord was a bit longer. Otherwise, I was shocked by two things when I used it:&lt;br /&gt;1. I had brushed my teeth before using it and was surprised by the food that still came out as I used it. This will be a really good tool since I have some pocket problems.&lt;br /&gt;2. How the blazes do I keep it from splattering all over the counter? What a mess I made. It doesn&#x27;t splatter as bad if I keep my other hand near my mouth as a splash guard.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great tool. I am going to rig up a mirror in the shower so I can actually see what I&#x27;m doing and then place it just outside the shower door. Then I won&#x27;t mind the splatter, but I do feel it&#x27;s important that I see just where and how I am aiming the water flow.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dental hygienist.  Got the best price here on Amazon vs the store she gave me a coupon for and I have really liked using this device.  I&#x27;ve also used a battery operated Panasonic which was limited to two speeds and one tip so this was a huge, like night and day, difference. It has many tips, a large tank, range of speeds, and the cool curled tube that keeps things neat by going right back into place when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a while now and my hygienist sees an improvement in areas where she was concerned.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik does the job, has sufficient water tank to clean your teeth.  The adjustable switch for water pressure is good to have and on/off switch on the handle to stop the water so you can rinse is great.  It is quiet and with the rubber feet does not wander all over the counter top.</li>
    <li> waterpik is great and exactly what I needed and wanted...easy to shop, affordable and works great....thank you amazon for making shopping a pleasure....</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works well in removing food caught in ones teeth. It though, is not a substitute for flossing. My recommendation is to first use the Waterpik, then proceed to floss, which removes the white plaque the Waterpik doesn&#x27;t do. I have many years using this unit. The only problem I have had, is to replace the hose a few times, as it split. The plastic used on the hose, is a bit too rigid. A more flexible type of plastic / rubber should be used instead. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is great for my son who just got his braces.  Now if I can just get him to floss ...</li>
    <li> I purchased one about 6 months and bought second as a gift for parents.  Does what is suppose to do.  Only thing is, it would be nice to have some information on how to clean it.</li>
    <li> Much easier and less painful than traditional flossing.  I loved it so much, that I bought two more for my parents, and they love it more than I do!</li>
    <li> I have so many crowns I though I was going to have to brush my teeth with Tidy Bowl. It is very hard even with floss to get inbetween the teeth because of the crowns sitting on the original tooth. With over 20 crowns the Waterpick is the only to get everything clean before brushing. I&#x27;d like to keep what I have for as long as I can so this does a great job.  My dentist is pleased and who wants to spend much time at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> After much research on this product, I decided it was my best solution..  Received it, read manual only to find  people taking anti-coagulants should not use the machine.  I understand the logic but wish that had been stated online or on the box itself.</li>
    <li> When I turn it on, it trips the GFI on the end of the hair dryer.  But, white gleaming teeth it does clean well.  No more evening or morning flossing.  I only floss at work where the other guys get grossed out.  Ha,ha.</li>
    <li> Had a Waterpik many years ago, but it was not recommended by my dentist, maybe because it might be perceived as substituting for flossing and brushing.  But I&#x27;m a daily flosser and like the additional check of clean teeth provided by the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this machine. I have what I consider to be pretty white teeth, but close to the gum lines there are stains from being a habitual soda drinker. Each time I go to the dentist, they tell me to floss more, and the staining will go away. I despise flossing, and figured I could use the Waterpik instead of making a mess with floss. I&#x27;ll admit, at first I thought it was &amp;#34;so-so.&amp;#34; There is a small learning curve associated with the Waterpik. I did end up soaking the counter and splashing the mirror a couple of times because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to maneuver the handle. However, after my first week of use, I can tell you I have figured out the controls, and the staining on my teeth has almost disappeared. My teeth feel much cleaner as well. I find myself using it multiple times a day! It usually has enough water in the reservoir to last a good 90 seconds. (depending on which level you use) You will be very satisfied with this product. For the people who are skeptical because they don&#x27;t think this machine is powerful enough, I would have to say that I have not yet found a reason to go past setting 6-7, unless of course I want to spray it across the room. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Just buy it!!!</li>
    <li> It is a lightweight tool, which great water pressure to clean out even the most stubborn piece of food. It works quite well to remove plaque!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to get the crud out that gets lodged between the teeth. I use it every day and have found it to be easy to use and I am getting better dental check ups.</li>
    <li> The waterpik works well and I am very satisified.  I would reccomend this to a friend.  The price was the best I could find.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in an effort to improve my gum health. Along with my Sonicare toothbrush and standard flossing, this product has made my mouth extra clean and my gums are no longer bleeding. It&#x27;s easy to use and there are several heads for a different waterpik experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the water container would click and secure in place as it easily can fall off the unit and make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy my Dad one of these.</li>
    <li> The waterpik Ultra was better than I expected. I does a good job at cleaning between teeth and I don&#x27;t have to use floss which I hate.</li>
    <li> I have braces and it is very had to get a good floss in.  This product is amazing for braces and everyday use.</li>
    <li> The flosser cleans my teeth very well, the water pressure can be varied and the appliance is streamlined so it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  I Am fortunate to have purchased it.</li>
    <li> Per our dentist, this will help prevent gingivitis.  We use it every day and found it easy to adjust to.</li>
    <li> The waterpik I purchased totally does a good job flossing.  My teeth feel really clean and I feel it makes my teeth look cleaner.</li>
    <li> Set on 4 so one does not get inflamed gums!!! I use this as a part of my braces cleaning regime. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This model is much easier to use than old model, more compact. I would have liked to have more water capacity.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you HATE flossing.  Well, this is your answer to that problem.  Since I received my Waterpik, I&#x27;ve been so excited to floss.  The first day I made a huge mess only because I didn&#x27;t read the manual before using it.  So please do read the manual before trying the product so you don&#x27;t make a huge mess like I did.</li>
    <li> Was working fine in the beginning.  Now, the button that you release to allow the water to flow in your mouth gets stuck at times.  Getting annoyed at this purchase.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommend waterpik; researched all kinds but used amazon recommendations; works well; need to get use to how it works but practice makes perfect; cord is neatly coiled but after use it becomes messy. Gets food out that flossing does not.</li>
    <li> Have never use water flossers until dentist recommended same.  The water pick was fantastic immediately stopped gum soreness and cleaned between teeth great.&lt;br /&gt;Dave Thomas</li>
    <li> Our family has been using the waterpik for more than 3 months and the results are more than worth the price and the extra time it takes to use it. It is an excellent treatment and preventative of gingivitis. It&#x27;s deep cleaning action is amazing - after getting crowns on two front teeth, one of them continued to have pain and sensitivity for many months and looked like it was never going to get back to normal. Within a week or two of using the waterpik regularly after meals, along with the usual brushing and flossing, the problem has cleared up.....Gums are healthy and breath fresh too. In my opinion a waterpik is an essential part of dental hygiene and every household should have one. Detachable cleaning heads for individual users makes it economical to share one unit.</li>
    <li> I love my new water pik. I use it daily and my mouth feels clean. Goodbye to plaque. I am happy I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and love it!  Even my 5-year-old daughter can use it.  The pressure can really get strong so I would recommend starting low and building up to avoid sore gums.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and they love it! Works very well, not very loud, and easy to use</li>
    <li> I had very serious gum problem for many years. After using this water flosser for 3 months, I noticed my gum felt considerably better. No more bleeding after brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> for those with difficulty with their hands this is an excellent substitute for flossing. I have had deep pockets in my gums for 12 years and using this twice a day has avoided them getting deeper.</li>
    <li> COMPACT, EASY TO USE, MANY ATTACHMENTS. HAS IMPROVED MY GUM HEALTH ALREADY IN LESS THAN A MONTH AS CONFIRMED WITH MY DENTIST.</li>
    <li> This device provides a welcome addition to my Dental hygiene regimen. flossing can only remove so much from between your teeth. this waterpik will remove food from below the gum line to promote better dental hygiene.The price is the best i could find on the inter net and in Stores.</li>
    <li> If you have crowns or bridge work this product is a must have.&lt;br /&gt;The water blasts under and around the crown/bridge work.</li>
    <li> I just got my wisdom teeth removed. I had 2 holes where my teeth were taken out (2 lowers) and it was gross. There was sooo much food stuck there. I went to see the dentist for a follow up visit and he gave me a plastic syringe to use to clean food out of the holes. I thought I was doing a good job until I got this waterpik. Man, it shot out so much stuff, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. And, it works as a great floss to boot! I shot out all sorts of nasty out of my wisdom teeth holes. Food that was there for weeks... I mean foul stuff. With the Ultra Waterpik, I can adjust the strength. It holds lots of water. It comes with many attachments. Long story short, if you just got wisdom teeth removed, go get this waterpik. Not the small one, not the travel one, this one. Your mouth, breath, and gums will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Also arrived ontime and as described.</li>
    <li> This works really well especially around my crown. My crown area was always getting sore because food was stuck in it. Flossing just seemed to irritate it more. This product not only cleaned well around my crown, but around all of my teeth so much better than flossing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hold my breath while using it set on 6 to clean around the back of my throat. Helps eliminate my stinky breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this Waterpik and wished I had gotten one years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it along with a Sonicare Ultra White toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years as my mouth feels very clean after I use it.  I highly recommend it and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This item came with many different heads.  Like that everything is contained in one unit, but it could be a little quieter and hold more water.</li>
    <li> This replaced a $300 unit sold me by a dentist many years ago. There is no comparison. The new model is so far superior to the old school originals, like a Model T to a Hybrid. There is a head for every conceivable need, the unit makes almost no noise when in use, it cleans completely, does what it says it will do, takes up a minimum of space on the vanity, has a very long cord, looks smart and is same colors as the Britta Pitchers FYI. I don&#x27;t why I waited so long to get a new one-- I thought I was in for another $300 outlay-- but these are extremely affordable, easy to set up and understand, and do the job as well as my dental hygienist does, sorry Nancy :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of flossing, but this machine gets the job done and makes the process a whole lot less painful and messy.</li>
    <li> Diabetics have to be careful with gum problems among a thousand other things. The Waterpik WP 100 Ultra Dental Water Jet is ideal to help keep gums healthy. I add a big splash of Listerine into the reservoir with the water to clean my gums. My water jet works perfectly and is a lot more fun than flossing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how to review this since it&#x27;s my first time purchasing a waterpik. All I can say is that it does it&#x27;s job well and my teeth feel cleaner and my gums are feeling better too.</li>
    <li> I have used this unit for a few months now and as they say here in New England it&#x27;s \\&quot;wicked\\&quot; nice.     Pros:    It has a  powerful jet, or a very mild jet, according to where the dial is set.  It has an off button on the nozzle handle,  which works very easily.  It is very easy to keep clean.    The unit has an optional tongue scraper head, which is pivotal in oral hygiene.  You&#x27;ll know what I mean after you use a tongue scaper water unit for the first time.      It&#x27;s compact quiet, and the little hose is pretty easy to keep from getting snarled up in itself.    I only use plain water in the unit.  This is a nicely made unit for a good price.    Cons:  a little pricey, but for me, the power of this unit is well worth it.    Follow up:  This stopped working after one year.  I think it should have lasted a lot longer than one year!</li>
    <li> 1. The Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet looks good: aqua color on white, shape of tank pleasing, and layout convenient. &lt;br /&gt;2. It does the job well (when it works). The jet pressure is excellent and can be adjusted with a dial for your gum comfort. Food particles in deep gum crevices are cleaned out thoroughly. My gums are healthier than when I used the manual floss. I&#x27;d in particular recommend this type of jet irrigation for people with braces. &lt;br /&gt;3. The number of tips provided is adequate, but the rest (tongue blade, etc) is largely cosmetic and non-functional. &lt;br /&gt;4. Amazon&#x27;s service is good. When my fist unit failed after about 2 weeks, Amazon sent me a replacement unit without waiting for me to return the first unit. &lt;br /&gt;5. That leads to the last, but most important point. I am surprised reading through the reviews that few other people reported the same problem I&#x27;ve experienced with the jet handle for this unit. As mentioned above, the handle on my first Waterpik failed: water just pouring out at the tip insertion point, after about 2 weeks of 2 person&#x27;s daily use. Amazon, however, kindly replaced this unit with an identical Waterpik. The handle on the second unit again failed after about 7 weeks of 2 person&#x27;s daily use. This time the handle failed to hold the tip in place. I don&#x27;t know if I should contact Amazon again, which seems tacky, or Waterpik, or just buy another unit, resigning to the fact that spending $60 every two months for a new Waterpik is just a necessary expense to keep my teeth clean. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I got this waterpik because my old one stopped working, and my dental hygienist told me to use one. I probably should have started using one long ago, but hopefully now that I am, I will be better off than I was. I am learning to control the amount of pressure so I have more control of it, and still have enough pressure to do the job. I like it, and I think over time it will help. And just like with brushing and flossing, the earlier you start, the better your results will be. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like very much about the product, far away from my expectation. I would like to recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t flossed since buying this over a year ago.  Dental Hygienist at last checkup couldn&#x27;t believe it, always stressed flossing.  You do need to be conscientious when using this instead of floss.  I usually use the entire container of water each time.  It comes with a multitude of attachments but only really use only one.</li>
    <li> Model WP-100 &lt;br /&gt;Had it for about 3 months, and then the seal failed in the handset. Water pressure at the tip dropped and most of the water leaks out of the hand set. Became very difficult to insert tip into handle. &lt;br /&gt;Being a mechanical design engineer I did a \\&quot;post mortem\\&quot; and discovered an o-ring that had become dislodged from its seat in the handle, bunching up down inside. This caused a blockage and a leak path. Since the handle is not designed to be opened after assembly (had to break it to get inside), I can&#x27;t see a way to repair this, although it would be a simple thing to re-seat the o-ring in it&#x27;s proper place. The entire hand set appears to be replaceable however. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For $60 it isn&#x27;t worth my time to try to work out a repair/replacement, so I just bought another. I&#x27;ve been a Wpik user for about 15 years and it is the one tool that keeps my gum situation in good order. No matter how thorough I am brushing/flossing, the pik does a much better job, faster and easier.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a small amount of mouthwash mixed in the water for added effect. It may be, that causes some sort of chemical change to the o-ring, compromising it&#x27;s function but that&#x27;s just a guess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the overall design and quiet motor, but if this happens again, I guess I&#x27;ll buy the cheaper model next time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;_</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this, so I got them for my kids that have braces.  So much better than regular flossers.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would actually use them,  but they use the water flossers every night.  We&#x27;ll see if it makes a difference at dental check up time.</li>
    <li> Works as described and gives extra space for storage of some of the extra items.  Has been working well for 2 months so far.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist recommended he use the Waterpik to prevent potential gum disease, so I gave it to him for Christmas.  We both use the machine, and feel that it is doing a very good job of cleaning where no toothbrush has gone before. It is easy to use and maintain. We think this product is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had an older model for years which finally gave out. So far so good with the WP-100.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit along with the recommended WaterPik NA2 Nasal Sinus Rinse Tip, which was advertised as being \\&quot;Compatible with ALL WaterPik oral cleaning systems\\&quot;.  There has been some debate regarding the compatibility of the WaterPik NA2 Nasal Sinus Rinse Tip with the Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet.    I contacted customer support at WaterPik and asked them if the WaterPik NA2 Nasal Sinus Rinse Tip was compatible with the Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet (since I bought both to use together), I&#x27;ll post their reply in its entirety below:    [...]    Thank you for your inquiry regarding Water Pik, Inc. products. The  NA-2 tip is not compatible with the WP-100 unit. We are aware of the  confusion and are working on correcting this information.    For expedited service, please ensure your response includes all  previous e-mail correspondence.    Thank you for visiting our Website.    [...]    It&#x27;s official. The WaterPik NA2 Nasal Sinus Rinse Tip is NOT compatible with the Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet, so don&#x27;t buy the WaterPik NA2 Nasal Sinus Rinse Tip with the expectation of using it with the Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet as I did.</li>
    <li> I just got back from a late afternoon orthodontic appointment.  The Dr. said, \\&quot;Wow!  Your teeth are really clean!  Cleanest I&#x27;ve seen all day.\\&quot;  She THANKED me for doing such a thorough job of cleaning my teeth and braces.  I thank Waterpik.  Flossing around braces got old in a hurry.  Using a proxabrush isn&#x27;t much better.  The Waterpik is much faster, easier, more comfortable - and apparently very effective.   &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that the PikPocket tips don&#x27;t last very long.  The rubber tip splits, rendering it useless.  Order several replacements when you order your machine, because they are not available in any stores, as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> I have used waterpiks, ever since I had braces many years ago and have always thought their products were excellent. They have only gotten better over the years. I would recommend this product very high.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is much bettter (and easier) than flossing, and it feel so clean afterwards. I use it before I go to bed. I used to feel my month dirty everyday when I wake up, but not any more after I start using it!</li>
    <li> I loved mine so much that I purchased a second one for my husband. They work great and so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been with different Waterpiks from the very beginning.  The mixture that I use with water is just baking soda (Microbes can&#x27;t take that abrupt PH change).  If I need a little more strength (to correct slight gum bleed), I add salt and/or Hydrogen Peroxide). I always make sure the mixture is dissolved into slightly above body temperature solution to avoid wear in the pump.   This new model has design improvements over the former models.   The pressure control is now back on the body,   The reservoir is guided into the body thus eliminating accidental dumping of a filled container.  The unit is much quieter and easier to use  I have all my teeth and my gums have remained healthy despite having deep pockets from my youth. My Waterpik power control is at the maximum, and I have no bleeding.  I try to floss and Waterpik every night.   Waterpik was a good invention. I would recommend the newest model over the older ones. (Big difference in my rating system)</li>
    <li> Great product. I had an older waterpik with one speed. The new model has 10  and makes quick order of removing food between teeth. It literally blows the stuff out! The gum pocket attachment seems to work well. I expect to have much less tartar on my next exam. I have a lot of exposed root and I need something to keep up with the plaque. I&#x27;m hoping this will do the trick. I have no regrets purchasing the product.</li>
    <li> My dental hygenist recommended that I use a waterpik since I have gum resession and pockets that acumulate debris.  She recommended that I get the cheapest model I could find, but after reading the reviews of the lower priced models, I decided that I didn&#x27;t want a waterpick that easily tipped over when full of water, had a problem storing the different heads, or finding a place to put the handle and its cord.  This model eliminates all of these problems.  I have been using the WP-100 for about 2 weeks and have nothing but good things to say about it.  The noise level generated does not seem at all loud to me.  It definitely removes particles that would otherwise have remained between my teeth and gums, and produce colonies of bacteria which would cause plaque and worsen my gum recession.         Update 8/14/07---- I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik W-100 twice a day for about 7 weeks now, and am very happy with the model.  I have had no problems with it, and my mouth feels much cleaner.  My wife was just told by her dentist that she has some gum recession, so I&#x27;m buying the same model for her. I concur with the reviewer that said that you should not abandon flossing if you use the waterpik --  This is what my dental hygenist told me, too.</li>
    <li> I do like this little machine.  It works very well.  The swivel finger screw is very convenient so you aren&#x27;t moving and maneuvering your hands all around your head.  It&#x27;s sleek looking.  The attachments make it very appealing, although I&#x27;ve only used the tongue scraper and pick attachment so far.  There s a top to the reservoir that holds the extra tips while maintaining the integrity of the reservoir.  Having a choice of so many speeds is very nice.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t really use this feature too often, but I find that under certain circumstances I am fine tuning each use! You can add mouthwash, etc. which is a nice feature.  The price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons would be that it&#x27;s noisy.  I&#x27;m not sure one can truly find a \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; water pick.  The water reservoir is on the smallish side.  I wish it came in different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed with this choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Have had this for 1/2 year or so.  The Pause button sticks making use of this machine frustrating.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik is fabulous.  I got it for my daughter who just got braces put on.  She loves it.  It gets her teeth clean with no problems.  They have come a long way in technology and innovation. I had a Waterpik when I had braces but that was 32 years ago.  This is a must if you have braces.</li>
    <li> I had it for several months and it is working fine. I like the dial on the main body instead of on the handle and I like the lid.</li>
    <li> The waterject failed to operate after a few times (less than 10). The engine is dead, no water came out.</li>
    <li> this is a replacement of my last one that lasted 3 years, I like how is flosses better. I do put some listerine in the base prior&lt;br /&gt;to using.  i did discover that the container needs to be 3/4 full for the flosser to eject water.&lt;br /&gt;very pleased</li>
    <li> The only reasons I did not give this product 5 stars is because the reservoir cover is designed poorly. Not only does the lid to the cover not snap into place in order to keep the extra piks stored inside from falling out when moved, it is also hard to place the reservoir cover on top of the reservoir without it falling into the reservoir. Too bad, because the actual appliance operates well.</li>
    <li> Our dentist has been recommending this product to us for awhile.  Have tried it a few times but not to impressed so far.</li>
    <li> I saw the mixed reviews before purchase but bought the product anyway. Nothing wrong with mine. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> After much research on this type of product, this one had the most features and power for the price range we were working within. Dependablity, reliability, and product name recognition also helped. We&#x27;ve owned several of their products over the years, and this one has all the best improvements so far. Would like to see a larger water supply basin though. Product performs as listed by Manufacturer, and does an excellent job. Love the assortment of water-pik heads and the storage cap too.</li>
    <li> This is our second dental water jet.  The first one I bought for my son was a different brand and we were really pleased with how it worked.  After about 2 years the lid broke and the reservoir became very hard to take off so my son asked for a new one.  I decided after reading reviews to give this one a try.  He is very happy with it and I have started using it too.  I have no complaints so far.  The water pressure is great and the reservoir is plenty big for me. It not only gets between and under the gums but my teeth feel cleaner that when just brushing.</li>
    <li> If you are contemplating getting this- go for it!!! It cleans up all the hard to reach places effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer said they put mouthwash in their water tank, I started doing it too and love the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure who thought of the button system on this, but the minute you turn the switch on it starts spraying, it will only stop if you continually hold down the flosser&#x27;s handheld button or shut it off. I wish they had made it so when you turn it on and hold down the button it sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**New users: start on the lowest setting so you don&#x27;t tear up your mouth!!</li>
    <li> The jet stream is strong. Easy to use.  One thing is when it is running, the base unit is vibrating too much.  Hopefully it is something to improve for the next gen product.  It works well.</li>
    <li> My first try at WaterPik. Takes some getting used to, coordinating the flow control button while directing the flow inside the mouth.  First few days I got water on my shirt and up my nose, but after 3rd day I got better.  Been using it now for 3 weeks and am very happy with it.  Anxious to hear from my dentist that it is better then flossing as supposed.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this product and I am glad I got it.  My teeth and mouth feel so clean every time after using it.  I made a little mess for the first time I used it but I got hang of it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and easy to clean.  The reservoir holds enough water to do a thorough cleaning.  The water jet does an excellent job cleaning around and between teeth.  I would highly recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is an excellent choice.  It have several attachments, and is great for someone with braces.  You can control not only the water use but also the water pressure with a quick turn of the dial.</li>
    <li> I owned a Water Pik years ago when I had TMJ surgery and had to have all of my teeth capped or crowned. I later lost it or misplaced it on one of many distant journeys. Years later I began to have all sorts of problems with my teeth involving the spaces between them. Fortunately I remembered the advice of my dentist many years ago and ordered the new Waterpik W-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet. What a revelelation! Now I don&#x27;t worry about what&#x27;s hiding between my teeth. I just use my Pik 3 times day. It&#x27;s great and I advise anyone who has extensive and expensive dental work invest in one now.</li>
    <li> The overall looks of this Waterpik are great, it is very quiet compared to earlier models, and the tip removal release is great.  The tips, however, are not the same size as previous models, and the \\&quot;jet\\&quot; power is not quite as strong.  Overall, a good product.</li>
    <li> I love it. Have always hated to floss. With this I feel like I have flossed after all.</li>
    <li> I found the pressure on the Waterpik to be much higher than the Braun I owned. It get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to replace my old Waterpik which was at least 10 years old.  The old one had a cover that you turned upside down to become the water reservoir.  After all those years, it started leaking somewhere inside.    I like this unit much better.  They put a lot of thought into the design.  The implements fit nicely under the fold-up lid and the water reservoir is dedicated to that purpose.  No more waiting for the reservoir to dry before putting the thing back together and stowing it away.    The only downside is that this unit is not as powerful as my old one; however, you have more precise control over the intensity of the water stream.    UPDATE (7/6/09) - Well, the power switch no longer works.  Didn&#x27;t even last 2 years this time. I would change it to 2 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work but I am totaly sold. I use this and the Phillips Sonic care and my teeth are better than ever. I don&#x27;t use whitner strips, mouthwash, or floss any more. Once in a great while I will check with floss but I don&#x27;t need to. Old habbit.     Very easy to use. Small and quick. It only takes a minute and your done.</li>
    <li> Love this new Waterpik.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  The reservoir could be a little bigger but it is easy to refill.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the Rolls Royce of water-jet tooth-cleaning appliances.  We tried others before, but should have gotten this one in the first place.</li>
    <li> I found this model of Waterpik, while attractive in style, lacked the power of my previous one, despite having a multitude of power adjustments. However it does do the job.Therefore I rate it 4 out of a possible 5.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking that it will be a great way to quickly and thoroughly rinse mouth. However, the reservoir is too small for me. I have to fill it up a couple of times during each usage. So, I end up spending much more time than I had imagined.  I am really satisfied with the way it removes food particles from hard to reach places. It is not as gentle on the gums as I had expected, but not too bad.</li>
    <li> Does everything I wanted it to do. It really works great with bridgework. It is easy to use and easy to clean up. It really makes your mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  People who have trouble using this product or have problems with water \\&quot;leaking\\&quot; must have been dropped on their head as children.  Throw away the floss and use this instead.</li>
    <li> I bought the ultra because I couldn&#x27;t find water jets for my old model.  I have been using waterpik&#x27;s for 30 years and have owned several models.  Although, this model is compact and has lots of jet options it does not have the force of my other models.  It seems to do the job and I like the small profile even thought it does not hold as much water as my other models.  All in all I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it very well.  I like the compact footprint and the power - if cranked you can pressure wash your driveway with this thing.  Wish it had a little more reservoir, I sometimes run out of water with just a few chompers left to go.  But all in all a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best dental product for healthy gums and teeth.  Easy to use!</li>
    <li> My daughter just got braces and the orthodontist recommended a waterpik.  So after research and price comparison, I found a good deal here at Amazon.  It does a great job getting around the braces and I have even used it myself and feel that my teeth are much cleaner.  I would recommend for everyone.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this and we are very happy with it. Amazon shipped it quickly and from the get go it has been a great addition to our dental hygeine.</li>
    <li> It really does a great job cleaning, better than the oral-b electronic tooth brush and floss. But it broke after less than three months of usage. The water leaks from the button on the handle, so the water pressure becomes way too low to clean the teeth. I am kind of addicted to the product, because it cleans your teeth very well, but the price would be too high if I had to buy a new one every three months.</li>
    <li> This waterpik does all I want it to do.  I first tried the sonic toothbrushes but couldn&#x27;t stand them.  This removed a lot of hidden food still there after a good brushing.  It feels good on my gums and since I have caps and bridges I&#x27;m glad I found this.  It is kind of messy so you have to use it right over the sink. I think it&#x27;ll save money on dental expenses plus it makes my mouth feel really clean.  I like it.</li>
    <li> This was an Amazon reccommendation.  It is a compact, really efficient product.  It makes every day feel as if you had just been to the dentist to have your teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> It has exceeded my epectations. I&#x27;ve used one for years and love the new improved model - especially the cover on top that stores all the tips. The water reservoir is much easier to use than the older models and I like the overall design.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is easy to use, easy to clean, and was reasonable in price.  It was delivered quickly and I have no problems with it.  I have used waterpiks for years since I suffer from peri-dontal disease, and this helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a very useful addition to my dental routine. While I brush and floss thoroughly at the end of the day I am amazed some times at the number of food particles that this also washes from between my teeth and below my gums. While I so not believe that this is a replacement for flossing I do see it as a great addition to it. Members of my family also find it to be extremely beneficial for the additional cleaning around their braces.</li>
    <li> It shoots water where directed, pretty much just like I thought it would be.  Less of a mess if I keep my mouth shut during use, if I look in the mirror when I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s no big surprise it bounces off my teeth onto the counter.</li>
    <li> I rate this as a good buy and am pleased with it in all but one respect. I believe that the line (hose) transporting the water to the hand-held nozzle is a bit on the short side. That having been said, I would not let this lone short-coming prevent me from buying this product again unless Waterpik or a competitor came up with a better product.</li>
    <li> My waterpik worked great for the first few months of use. Shortly after about 3 months, the button that pauses water flow started sticking. Now, after almost one year, it is leaking from the button that ejects the attachment. The leak is so severe that there is no water pressure coming from the attachment itself. There is no way to fix the problem which makes it completely useless now. I am very disappointed that this happened. I thought waterpik was a good brand. I will be buying from a different company next time.</li>
    <li> Not to be gross, but with some spaces between a few of my teeth and a mouthful of caps, regular brushing and dental floss don&#x27;t always do the trick.  It always amazes me that AFTER I use those products, the Waterpik can still push out those particles that get stuck between teeth.  Don&#x27;t be in too much of a hurry -- using for the proper amount of time with each tooth will help with a full cleaning, and it almost feels like a massage for your gums.  Sounds weird, but it feels great.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Waterpik Ultra in November of 2007. In as little as two months of use the handle is leaking and does not allow for continued use. I have been unable to contact their Customer Service department through their website or by phone. Apparently there is no Customer service. Another American company that has failed to provide a product that will last more than 2 weeks. I have reviewed many customer complaints on this product and I find that my leaking problem seems to be the main complaint from everyone. Oh, did I mention that they sell extra handles for $5.50? And the stock seems to be out at this moment. I would not recommend this product or any product from this company this.</li>
    <li> We made the mistake of buying 2. Both leaked at about 3 months. I ordered a replacment hose a month ago. It never came. Called again and was on hold for 2 hours. Wrote letter. No response. You will be wasting your money if you buy this one.</li>
    <li> This is my first waterpik and I really like it so far.  As an adult with braces, the orthodontic attachment really helps get between the brackets.  Flossing with braces is very time consuming and I think the waterpik saves a lot of time and is very effective.    I am curious though, it seems like the device generates a lot of noise.  I am not sure if this is normal or if mine is defective.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product, especially if you have braces.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for a few weeks now and it seems to work well.  I have braces and I am able to clean my teeth much better than with brushing alone.  The water tank is sufficient and it has plenty of pressure (I use it on 5).  While the water pik is not huge, it is a little big for me to leave on the counter so I stash it under the sink.  Not a big deal.  It is easy enough to pull out and use.</li>
    <li> Great product. My dentist recommended the model. I only use one attachment, the pick.     I read the reviews on Amazon b4 purchasing. I found the tips, suggestions, criticisms &amp; work-around so helpful.</li>
    <li> My son was having such a hard time getting his teeth clean after he got braces. This waterpik was a lifesaver! It is simple to use. He can set it up and even empties it and sets it on a towel to air dry when done. It has a lot of different attachments making it more versatile. The adjustable water pressure makes it possible for him to adjust to his comfort level. Great product!</li>
    <li> Back in the 60&#x27;s my parents bought a Waterpik because it was a fad and/or it recommended by our dentist...I don&#x27;t remember.  In any case, it worked.  I went to college and I don&#x27;t know what happened to the thing but when my dentist recommended the purchase of a new one recently I bought one without hesitation.     As in the 60&#x27;s the new one works just as I remembered.  It was priced accordingly and does exactly what it claims to do to.  People at Maytag, Saturn and other manufacturing facilities should learn this concept.    My only issue with the purchase is that I had it shipped without cost using the Amazon free shipping program which in this case was the USPS.  As I tracked the package I noticed it went from Georgia to Illinois where it was received.  Then it was received again at the same location in Illinois a few days later.  After that it went back to Georgia where it must have gone into a \\&quot;Black Hole.\\&quot;    I called Amazon Customer Service and attempted to talk to someone, somewhere who almost could speak English.  What a nightmare.  Needless to say the conversation was quite frustrating at best.  After about one half hour of attempting to communicate with this person on the other end of the phone, he did manage to tell me that a replacement Waterpik would be sent immediately...which it was using UPS.      To summarize, the product is well worth the money.  Amazon prices its products well.  The USPS leaves a lot to be desired when it come to using its services to send packages through the mail.  Amazon&#x27;s Customer Service needs to employee people who can speak the same language as its customers.</li>
    <li> The new waterpik ultra is not as good as the older model! First problem is that it is hard to trun off. When you push on the off switch - with wet hands - the waterpik is so lite that it moves accross the sink and in order to turn it off you have to put down the hose and hold the waterpik with two hands! Then the other problem is that the plastic tank that holds the water can&#x27;t be used to cover the waterpik. You can put it on top of the waterpik but it falls off and always onto the floor. The way that this new waterpik is made is such that any dirt or bugs (fly or nat) in the room can land into the deep well and it is not easy to clean it all out and it is not very healthy to leave the waterpik well uncovered. When you flush a toilet, any airborne germs can and will land into this waterpik. It was a very big disaportment to me. The company that sold it was fine, it&#x27;s just a very poor modle. Plus it has  much less power than the older model.    Jonathan Galente, long time waterpik user!</li>
    <li> This unit, the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet, is more compact than my original Waterpik.  It is not as powerful though.  However, anyone looking for a device of this type will not be disappointed.  It is very good for the gums.</li>
    <li> Purchased this unit after having the hand-held unit.  Much better, as it can hold water for 2 sessions.  Great for kids who don&#x27;t want to floss.  Be prepared for the water mess it leaves around the basin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who has kids.</li>
    <li> I love it and would recommend product to everyone. Powerful enough to get out all food matter. was wonderful purchased</li>
    <li> I have add waterpik flossers before and this model is super because the reservoir is easy to remove and the actual handle and pik is more flexible than past models.  I was a little concerned at first because I got two of one kind of tip and no tongue brush but then I read the enclosure that not every package has every tool, so I&#x27;m fine.  I suppose the real test will be in 4 months when I see my dentist for a cleaning.</li>
    <li> Forget dental floss! The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet is terrific. Easy, feels good, what more could you ask for? Just don&#x27;t take the pik out of your mouth while the jet is still running.....</li>
    <li> Works like a champ!    I just wish that they come up with an AutoVolt power input coz I have to use a step down transformer everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> I love my new Waterpik (had it for about a month now). I use it after every meal when possible. My teeth have never felt cleaner!     It seems to clean just as well as brushing, and I&#x27;m almost addicted to the clean feeling.     I so prefer it to flossing. Much easier, more convenient, and cleaner.     Only downside is the water reservoir is kinda small (takes almost a full fill for a good cleaning). However, its probably better to use fresh water every time anyway.     I might even buy the portable version to take to work, etc.     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - A++++</li>
    <li> My dentist told me that my teeth gum is slashing up by brush around 10 years ago but never told what do with it.  Finally dentist refilled with something between teeth and gum for 4 sections.  I have suppose fix more sections. It was even covered with insurance but not cheap.   I started research on website then found water pick.  I took my best shot.  I am very happy to have water pick in these days.  It takes me three weeks to see my teeth gum is not sagging look anymore.  I have to have an extra time to use water pick but I learned if I don&#x27;t take care of my teeth well then I will suffer later more.</li>
    <li> Works good, no problems with unit.  Even after brushing, I still got stuff out with this waterpic.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time.  I have a hard time using it but thats just me, she loves it.</li>
    <li> This product saved my gums from the bleeding and pain I usually experience with flossing. I bought it recently, therefore I am not yet able to  fully assess the effects on the health of my gums and teeth, but things seem to have improved a lot already, so I have high hopes of reducing the number of trips to the dentist in future.</li>
    <li> This water pik is excellent.  I read about some previous problems with other models and my husband and I have not experienced any of them.  It is small, efficient, does not leak, works extremely well and cleans even after brushing and flossing.  Could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I purchased the water pik for my husband to use during his cancer treatments for tonsil cancer. Several of the physicians recommended use to help keep his mouth flushed out while he is unable to open up his jaw. It&#x27;s great to have purchased a product priced well and perfectly suited to his medical needs. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I will return this unit as it stopped working altogether shortly after getting it. Before that it had another defect; the one button on the handle that stops water from squirting all over your bathroom often got stuck, so I had to use it without taking it out of my mouth when switching sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, that this product (when working properly) is awesome! Your mouth feels so clean after flossing with this thing that you will never stop using it. So I tell you to get it, and if you get unlucky, return it for a working unit at no cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----Update----&lt;br /&gt;After trying to return the product to WaterPik I realized it tripped the electrical circuit in our bathroom, so it just needed to be reset and the unit was again working perfectly, except the \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button that tends to get stuck. However they sent me a new handle in the mail, so now all of this is water under the bridge! I will still not give 5 stars as it was a little hassle, and I have been without my beloved water flosser for a while because of it. Remember to reset electrical outlets and circuits if your unit stops working, it might not be the unit... Great customer service at WaterPik! Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well and I haven&#x27;t had a problem draining the reservoir in one use.  I usually get two full uses before that happens.  Gets the ick out and makes your mouth feel clean.    My issues with it are that the button on the handle is for turning it off instead of on.  My instinct is to press it to turn it on and releasing it should turn it off.  So, that is something I  will need to get use to.  Also, if someone turns the unit on while the handle is on the base, water is going to shoot out everywhere.  If you have kids in the house, this will be a fun activity for all but the housekeeper (aka me.) It would have been nice to have the button be the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch and have a dial on the handle to turn the pressure up and down.  Oh well, can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik ultra.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has dental problems.  After 6 months,  the handset on my waterpik is leaking to the point that it is almost unusable.  I called their toll-free number at 1-866-205-7802,  and they took the serial number from the bottom and are sending me a new handset without charge.  I hope it comes soon,  because I can&#x27;t live without this product!  The two-year warrenty is a necessity.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to use it!</li>
    <li> The machine does as it advertises to give you healthier teeth/gums than if you were using floss.    To those of you having trouble with the pause button sticking and not coming back up, try running a 1:4 vinegar:water solution through the reservoir, all the while repeatedly pushing the pause button.  Mine was starting to stick, so I read something about running vinegar solution through.  After one run with the solution, the pause button very nearly stopped sticking altogether.</li>
    <li> Waterpik&#x27;s Ultra Dental Water Jet is a quality product with several nice features.  The water container is a bit small but I suspect that&#x27;s for a reason.  This model is an improvement over my last Waterpik.  I&#x27;d buy another one!</li>
    <li> Bought this product even though some of the reviews were not that great and I can see why.  When using this product if the water well is not securely on (sometimes you need to hold it down) it will not work.  For the price I thought this product should work properly.  I would not recommend this product it is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Whoever hates doing floss MUST try this product. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve never flossed in my life, never visited a dentist ever (not until last 6 months ) and I don&#x27;t have a single cavity. So when I visited the dentist for the first time, he said that i needed to regularly floss them. I tried and hated every bit of it. Then I came across this thing and bought it in a heart beat.  Been using it since and it works great. I generally do this just before going to bed. So not only do I have a clean mouth while sleeping but I don&#x27;t even have any foul breath when I wake up in the morning. It&#x27;s all clear and fresh.</li>
    <li> BAD DESIGN AND IT IS VERY LOUD,MESSY,AND THE HOSE IS ALWAYS TANGLING UP. DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Waterpiks in the past but this streamlined model is really well made. The pik has only one thing I wish they would have modified...when you turn on the unit the water automatically starts to shoot out. One must push the &#x27;trigger&#x27; or button to get it to stop. It takes a couple of time getting shot in the face to get adjusted but after that it is really convenient to use.  Small for a bathroom to leave out, the hose recoils right back to its original position and the level of pressure is amazing!  You won&#x27;t be sorry...very strong and well built.</li>
    <li> Product works just as described. Very good capacity and many attachments come with the unit. Great price too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Wish I had used this years ago!!!  It cleans out all the crevices and nooks and crannies between the teeth and gums.  I recommend it to people who have bridges in their teeth.  It cleans out where the floss can&#x27;t reach, and you know it won&#x27;t embed any food particles--it gets rid of them all.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one in January of 2008 and have kept it at home. I was using a portable Waterpik when I traveled and the portable can not compare to this unit for satisfaction. When  I saw the price promo Amazon was running about a month ago I bought this one for when I am out of town. Great product. I highly recommend it. My dentist is very pleased with the improvement in my dental care and this product makes care easy &amp; effective.</li>
    <li> Despite reading reviews that say the WaterPik has a short life span, I decided to buy it.  So far it is great.  You get that clean, just-left-the-dentist feeling all over your mouth.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a month.  The item is outstanding.  The water tank is just the right size to get a complete cleaing in and the variety of attachments is a nice feature.  If you are looking for a water pik, you just found it.</li>
    <li> I purchased \\&quot;Waterpik Ultra Dental Jet 100WP\\&quot; in Sept. I used the small toothbrush that came w/it one time when 1st got it, put it aside, then several weeks later I decided to use it again..As I used it The small bristles came out in my mouth, the toothbrush had broken into 2 pieces,one large piece &amp; one small section. I was concerned that was a definite HEALTH HAZARD, I emailed the company with my concerns they didn&#x27;t respond so I called the company spoke to a Secretary she said will pass it along to her superior \\&quot;if he is concerned he will contact me\\&quot; He NEVER returned my call I would NOT/do-NOT recommend this product &amp; to add to that it leaks. Am satisified that it does preform well but the health hazard &amp; lack of concern of the company bigwig bothers me greatly.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very awkward to use. The lid is not attached so you have to completely remove it to fill the unit with water so you can &amp;#34;water floss&amp;#34;. The lid usually falls as i try to remove it and makes this unit frustrating to use. The company needs to add a hinge to the lid to remedy this annoying problem. As well, if you eat something like meat you will need to haul out your floss to actually get it out from between your teeth if it lodges there! I&#x27;m very disappointed in this unit.</li>
    <li> even after flossing the Waterpik can still get stuff out of your teeth.  The oxygen in the water is GREAT for your gums and it feels amazing.  What are you waiting for...best money ever spent on daily health care.</li>
    <li> This product has helped us keep our teeth clean and healthy. Has so many different attachments. Using this product for almost 3 years now. it has really helped reduce cavity.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is functioning very well. I used a Waterpick 30 years ago when I had braces. At a recent trip to the dentist the waterpik was recommended to me again--probably because I hate flossing. The waterpik is probably more effective than flossing in cleaning teeth and gums. It also leaves my gums feeling as if they have been massaged. I expect that my dental hygenist will have less work to do at the next appointment. The coiled tube from the pump to the jet nozzle is adequate length. If I could change one thing I would make the water reservoir a little larger, but it is still adequate.     The turnaround and shipping time by Amazon on this purchase was excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Upon request of my dentist, I purchased a Waterpik. I simply love the device. It is easier than flossing and leaves your mouth feeling cleaner. When I first started using it, I had to use a lower pressure setting. Now that my gums are a bit tougher, I use it at the 60-70% setting and it really does the trick. You can feel the stream of water hitting your tongue after it goes through your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month, twice a day and it&#x27;s working 100%.  But it took me two days to remember to turn it on AFTER it&#x27;s in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Waterpik was recommended by hygenist.  I have a problem with plaque and she felt that flossing and brushing were not enough.    Additional food particles are washed away after the normal floss and brush routine so I know it is doing a good job.    I found the water tank to be a bit too small and it seems to vibrate on the higher settings.</li>
    <li> Bought this upon a recommendation of my dental hygienist. Use if after flossing and brushing and it still manages to remove debris from between your teeth. A bit noisy but its excellent for massaging your gums where they should be tight against your teeth.</li>
    <li> HELLO ALL, IF YOU WANT TO SAVE DENTIST BILLS, THIS IS THE PRODUCT YOU SHOULD HAVE.</li>
    <li> Compared to other water flossers, this is the best. I would recommend this product to everyone. Makes your whole mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Outstanding performance and construction.  Much better than the previous model I owned.  The pulsing action is stronger and easier to control.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the Waterpik and it cleans well and is easy to use.  The bowl is more than adequate and the adjustable power is a good feature.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got any hardware in  your mouth; you know some things are hard to get at.  This takes care of that.  I have not compared this brand to any other though.  I keep the setting low &amp; that does fine.  Also, travels well; not too bulky to pack.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me.  It took some getting used to, but once I got the hang of it, it is my go to after I brush my teeth every night.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. At first I was slightly skeptical at its efficiency and after actually using it, I was able to see the difference. Combined with Listerine mouth rinse, flossing will not only keep your mouth healthy, but encourage healthy gums around your teeth. Prior to purchase I found a few studies which revealed that the Waterpik removed more plaque than its counterpart, the sonic flosser. This product was also recommended to me by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I had a waterpik for many years but it finally gave out. As it got older, it took a longer time to use but this one works fast and does the job. My gums feel healthier already. Definitely a great water flosser and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for over a week now and so far I love it. It comes highly recommended by dentists so I&#x27;m sure I will soon see improve in my gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always seen these in the stores and never really considered purchasing one. My dental hygienist suggested getting one to enhance the flossing process. So on to Amazon.com and ordered one. Amazon had the best price and the delivery time was faster than anticipated. It was packaged well. Took it out of the box, read the simple instructions and within 15 minutes I was using it. I never owned something like this before so it took a short learning curve to get it down. Buy the third use I was using it like I owned one forever. With ten jet settings, multiple tips, ease of use, well known company and great price from Amazon you should do yourself a favor and buy one.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as recommended by my dental hygentist.  Had it a couple of months and so far the only complaint I have is it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
    <li> Product is what I was looking for in a flosser. I dislike the noisy pump and the wrong power supply voltage.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. It&#x27;s so incredibly powerful that I feel I cannot adequately express its power without the following: Imagine, if you will, that plaque and food debris asked out this Waterpik&#x27;s sister and wined &amp; dined her. Let&#x27;s pretend that plaque and food debris deflowered said sister and never called her again. Now, envision that Waterpik is ready to kick ass with righteous indignation and unrepentant rage. This what it feels like when you turn this thing all the way up to &#x27;10&#x27;. A bleeding gum line is merely collateral damage to this beast of an oral hygiene machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, don&#x27;t go to 10.  It does a great job at 7.  Oddly enough, I actually look forward to using this machine and I&#x27;ve flossed fewer than 20 times in my life.  I don&#x27;t really find a need for the tips other than the standard one but it&#x27;s nice that they provide two of them so you and your significant other can kiss comfortably with the knowledge that you both have pristine teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update if anything goes awry.</li>
    <li> Used one of these years ago but didn&#x27;t replace it when it started to leak all over the countertop.  Recently was advised by my dental provider that I needed the flushing action and gum massage associated with the Waterpik and have been pleasantly surprised with the total cleaning action of the latest version.  I am well pleased with the product and have been making it a consistent step in my tooth cleaning regimen.  I would recommend the Waterpik to anyone, especially anyone who has the tightly spaced teeth that I have which are extremely difficult to floss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suppose there is any way to keep the spray entirely within your mouth, except by practicing.  I would like a little more guidance  on which tip to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that the on/off switch is in an awkward position and is difficult to manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product is GREAT (it will be even better if my hygienist notices a difference).</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at 1st but I love it. The 1st time I used it my mouth was bleeding that&#x27;s how much deep cleaning it did. It stopped after a while and now my teach feel a lot cleaner than they used to.</li>
    <li> Several months into use by multiple adults, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I was a bit worried about the leaking issue reported by other reviewers, but can&#x27;t claim to have run into it.  I like the compartment on the top that store the various attachments in, and the plug in the water tank the doesn&#x27;t leak when pulling the tank from the base.  No moans or groans from the motor inside, and it looks like this unit will be working well into the future.</li>
    <li> my husband bought this and he is very happy with the way it works..he is been using it for almost 6 months and so far not complaints.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my 3rd waterpik in 3 years..Works great until the plastic tube attached to the handle cracks..this last time I opened the handle and attempted to connect the tube.Unsuccessful..You would think this could be corrected..Unless planned obsolescence is a corporate objective[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> Works well when it works. This was my first Waterpik and the idea is solid. Really does what it claims for your teeth, gums etc&lt;br /&gt;*HOWEVER* The button that turns the water on and off  has been &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; from the get go. Now it&#x27;s just stuck on. Bad design for an important component!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend but figured I&#x27;d still use it.  We used it every day for the first few weeks but then lost interest in it.  I think my teeth get way cleaner by using regular floss.  He just stopped using it because I stopped.  I would use it as directed and then floss right after to see what would happen and I would still get food out of my teeth.  Some reviewers mention they can see the food flowing out of their mouth while using the waterpik but I do not experience this.  I guess it may work for some (maybe if your teeth have spaces inbetween???) while others it may not.  My teeth are not so tight that floss gets stuck/shredded but they are tight enough that the waterpik doesn&#x27;t seem to get between them, even on the highest flow setting.</li>
    <li> Cleaning power is great but.....the blue button on the handle is sticking. And we have only had this product a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I really use this thing.  It cleans your teeth so much better than floss.  it is amazing how much stuff comes out from between your teeth even after brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> My dental hygenest recommended and my dentist likes my checkups. Took a while for me to begin using routeenly every day but now won&#x27;t miss an evening flossing with this device.</li>
    <li> I am so glad my dentist recommended the Waterpik. My gum health has improved markedly. Inflammation and tenderness is gone. I use the waterpik at least every other day. I fill the reservoir with warm water and run on a setting is 6 until it is empty. It is a pleasant addition to my routine. For those that have lots of plaque, there are powders you can add to the water for additional benefit.</li>
    <li> Adjustable water pressure flow is important and this unit does a great job of adjusting.  Furthermore, I would highly recommend using WARM water in this unit.  I unwittingly used cool tap water and just about shot through the roof from the shock.  WARM WATER ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had one of these units for over a year and it works just as good today as it did a year ago.  I wont be without one if it ever does die.  I bought replacement tips from Amazon, so my wife could start using it as well.  You can make the pressure strong enough to make your gums bleed (which isnt always a bad thing) or to where it barely removes the food packed between the teeth.  I no longer reach for dental floss or a toothpick. I wait until I can use the Waterpik.  Great product !</li>
    <li> Having used water flossers for many years, I was delighted when the Waterpic Ultra Water Flosser arrived and saw that it was accompanied by several more types of pics in addition to the regular flosser pic.  This is a water flosser for persons who are interested in caring for each and every tooth.  Besides the regular tooth brush, there are 5 other types of pics.  Believe me, you will spend a happy time taking care of your teeth and deciding which of the pics to use each time or, what the heck, why not use all of them all of the time.</li>
    <li> I got one for myself and had trouble getting it to fit onto my apartment sink so I gave it to my mom.  She loved it!!  Now that I am not in an apartment, I am ordering another for myself</li>
    <li> This one replaced an older unit that gave up the ghost.  My wife and I could live without it, but we have two favorite &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; and the other 6 seldom get used.  Nice to have, but not necessary for most of us.</li>
    <li> This Water Flosser is just what I was looking for.  Some days I use it several times to make sure there is no food stuck between my teeth.  I&#x27;m sure when I go to the dentist, they will see a big difference in my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> If you want gums that look and feel good, buy this and use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist sells these for more money</li>
    <li> this is a really good water pik  now it is a lil loud but i don&#x27;t mind that it works great i have braces and i use it in between brushings nice price too and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Great performance. All I expected. I recommend it. Water pick is reliable and should be used for all those who need a special cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have one very similar.  Wanted my son to have one also.  He loves this one and so does his dentist!  She has seen improvement in his gums and general oral hygiene.  Buy one.  You will never go back to your old ways.</li>
    <li> Messy!  But it does the job and is easy enough to use by younger kids.  Love all the attachments, the pause button on wand, and the 10 levels of water pressure.  Very easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> Handy, easy to use, fits nicely in bathroom space, a bit noisy. Different heads are effective for intended use. OK</li>
    <li> I love using my Waterpik. I have a bridge and I just broke my tooth so it makes it so convenient for me to just spray my mouth after every time I eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has all the different tools to use. It makes my kids actually want to brush.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my teenage son who wears braces - what an improvement! Gets all the food particles out and makes his life a bit easier. I also use this, and absolutely love it. Makes keeping your teeth clean a whole lot easier. Love that it comes with different attachments.</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful cleaning device! Clean looking and easy to use. Would recomend to anyone. Better than models from previous years. I was pleasNtly surprised with all the extra tools</li>
    <li> I had never really thought about using a Waterpik but after I heard several friends and family members talk about it so I decided to give it a try and I am so glad that I did.  It does an excellent job of getting those bits of food that your brush misses.  My mouth and gums feel so much better.  I definitely would recommend this as a part of your overall dental regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik.  It works great all of my top teeth are capped and a couple have always given me a problem.  But using this item will prolong the life of those problem teeth.  It really cleans the gum and between the teeth.  I love it and use mouthwash a capful to keep my mouth feeling cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works very well. adjustable water pressure and comes with several tips.</li>
    <li> He loved it, said he felt like he had just been to the dentist, minus the bill :)  Now I need one for myself.</li>
    <li> A couple years later and this flosser is still going strong.  It&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on the counter.  The accessories are nice and store inside the unit nicely</li>
    <li> I purchased this flosser when the line on my braun combination flosser and brush began to leak after several years.  The brush was still going strong so I opted to keep the old unit and just buy the flosser.  Turned out to be a great decision.  The Waterpik unit is small and doesn&#x27;t take up much room next to the combo unit.  It is considerably cheaper to buy the units separately so when the brush dies I&#x27;ll simply purchase the brush independently.  A plus is that I find the Waterpik far superior to the Braun for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Just filling in this block to be able to post. This thing peels paint!!! Seriously, It is awesome.  that is all</li>
    <li> Excellent waterpik. Updated design that is very easy to use. Would recommend this to anyone who wishes a super clean mouth!</li>
    <li> Broke within 6 mos.  Before the handle stopped allowing water through, it was very good.  I wish they&#x27;d make this product better.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by our dentist. We love it and wish we had tried it earlier. Easy to use and clean. Great product. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Very loud for sure. Pause button is breaking after only a few months like other people say. I like the different pulse settings. I can&#x27;t get above the second one..my BF turns it all the way up. Dentist recommended it and we like it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this flosser, so much so that I ordered one for my daughter as well.  It cleans between your teeth very well.</li>
    <li> This is great!  I use it nightly after brushing, before mouthwash.  I does a terrific job of reaching all the molars and gum lines, much better than the older models.</li>
    <li> Sometimes requires suction to start the flow of water through the tube</li>
    <li> At the beginning was good, thought it was good quality. But after about 2 years, all the hose fell apart. I think they use biodegradable plastic. So totally useless after.</li>
    <li> since i never floss, having this instead is really great. believe me it really works like after brushing your teeth you use it and you still see stuff like food and so on left on your teeth that goes off. I super recommend it</li>
    <li> A great investment.  Very happy with this.  Gets stuff out that brushing misses.  More than enough pressure.  Will make my gums bleed if too strong.  I use with warm water as regular tap is to cold for my teeth. Seems to have stopped my gums from swelling with infection as this item gets the food out deep between teeth and gums.  UPDATE:  My waterpik stopped working about 5 months ago. I called Waterpik and gave them my serial number and said it is still under warranty!!  They shipped me a new one in about 10 work days. Very happy with support from WaterPIK.</li>
    <li> Takes up too much room and it&#x27;s very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;It is not forceful enough to remove food in between your teeth.</li>
    <li> that was i expecting for!, it&#x27;s ok, I recommend it the brand good product, good service, every think is Ok</li>
    <li> I ordered this waterpik to replace my old one (same basic model) which wore out from long useage. The new model has some enhancements (better fit for tips and better rotation of tip to get at all four quadrants) which i really appreciate.</li>
    <li> Did you know Amazon staff gave $116,000.00 to Barack Obama&#x27;s re-election campaign?  I sure didn&#x27;t.  This will be my last Amazon order.  On to the review.  This product is superior to flossing in every way.  Has great power, and multiple tips.  The top is a little clumsy, and long term reliability is a question mark.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This product is not the most expensive on the market and its not the worst. It does not really put have the water pressure needed to make it a product I would by again, but it works.</li>
    <li> I love using this water pike.  My mouth feels really clean and healthy after using this.  I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The water tubing of the first one broke excatly after two years. The broken part would have been easy to replace, if a replacement part were available.&lt;br /&gt;I use the flosser three times a day. It may have lasted longer with less frequent use..</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 months ago, and it works very good!&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not strong as the one I have before.</li>
    <li> Very effective and reliable</li>
    <li> Received the Waterpik as a gift and love it.  Bought one for my daughter.  The only concern is another review I saw that showed mildew inside the shaft of the waterpik.  I guess it is a design flaw, and did not like the idea of mold inside the unit.  I smelled something musty and finally figured it was the waterpik. So, I mixed a solution of 50/50 bleach and water and ran it through the waterpik several times, then flushed the unit clear.  I do this every week or so, and have not had the musty smell again.  Afraid to think of what the inside looks like, but hopefully the bleach solution will do the trick.  If anyone else has ideas, I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
    <li> Got it and have been using it since, Its a way easier to floss then using the flossing pick. Wanna hear good review from dentist!</li>
    <li> I was on vacation so that I had to try this product after I got home.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure I followed the manual right but it doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;since the possible return date has passed so I am keeping one not using.&lt;br /&gt;but the other one (I bought two) works just fine....&lt;br /&gt;I want it get repaired of something. nowhere to contact tho.</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever bought. Wish I would have started this year ago. At first a little intimidating with having to control the water squirting but quickly perfected it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and works well. My teeth are cleaner and my gums are more firm.</li>
    <li> Its really perfect but I have only one concert that it make a lot of vibration, otherwize its perfecr in general:)</li>
    <li> This water pik works great! My 12 year old us able to use it to clean her braces and it is easy to use.  We swear by it. It is also easy to set up and to clean.</li>
    <li> I rate the water flosser with 5 stars. It&#x27;s very useful and powerful on cleaning my teeth. I can also use it to massage my gum. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had owned another brand which gave up shortly after it&#x27;s warranty. I had it turned all the way up to provide enough pressure. Not with the Ultra Water Flosser from Waterpik. I&#x27;m not sure I could use it turned all the way up! Plenty of pressure, plus all of those specialty tips are great.</li>
    <li> When I use that product I save a lot of dental charge because no more dental visit to clean my teeth. I had space between my teeth and always it’s filed of food so with that product no more food between my teeth and no more bad breath.</li>
    <li> Had one before, still think it&#x27;s an essential part of dental health. Makes keeping my teeth and mouth clean easy.</li>
    <li> My last dental checkup the hygenist commented on how healthy my gums are.  I often make smoothies with kale and spinach, dressings with poppy seeds.  Brushing can&#x27;t get rid of all this good stuff.  One swipe around with the Waterpik and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Simple to operate, love the extra clean feeling. Best proactive oral care out there!</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Loud, sounds like Barbie handling a concrete drill.&lt;br /&gt;Constantly sprays. The spraying, doesn&#x27;t stop unless you press the blue button. To me, that&#x27;s backwards. It should turn on when I press the handle button, but the real on button is on the side. However, you get used to it quick after you sprayed water everywhere a few times :D.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t replace flossing (unfortunately you&#x27;d need a sandblaster to replace string flossing, and that would be painful.)&lt;br /&gt;Your mouth will fill with water quickly, so you have to spit multiple times (really not a big deal but took time to get used to.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Your mouth feels dentist clean!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun in a gadgety way.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to setup. The coil on the handle NEVER tangles.&lt;br /&gt;Has many head options for different cleaning needs.&lt;br /&gt;Will get things in your teeth you didn&#x27;t even know was there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get bored easily and honestly, it thrills me to use this :D Love it! Try it!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I purchased. Simple &amp; excellent design + very easy to install &amp; use...Every family should own one for their teeth health!!</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the cord from the machine to waterpik was longer. I&#x27;m tall and could use an extra foot of cord. Read the instructions before using or you might put out an eye. LOL</li>
    <li> Very good moneys worth easy to use and it works it really cleaned the gums and removed Tatar from them</li>
    <li> My dentist and dental hygentist recommended this water flosser.  I have a number of crowns and they said this is an additional way to clean around the margins of my teeth.  I also floss.  There are a number of attachments. So if you have braces, partials, implants there is a special attachment for each.</li>
    <li> I just got braces and flossing was difficult - then I found this water flosser and it has made my life so much easier - this is a compact little machine - does not take much space on the counter-top, but delivers all it promises. Comes with a full range of different heads. And you can adjust the strength of the jet.</li>
    <li> after I turn on the flosser, this machine made noise for a few seconds and then stop. I realized that my power is 220V. I am sorry I can&#x27;t tell my view on this product. If the manufacturer can put warning on the plug, or something that can stop me from plugging this product on 220V power, I can give a satisfied rating</li>
    <li> Old one I had for 30 years,Hope this is as good. More compact and strong pulse (as before). it works and becomes habit forming.</li>
    <li> Works great! It&#x27;s a very nice unit compared to my old original one but still does a great job on my teeth getting to places where my tooth brush can&#x27;t get to.</li>
    <li> This product is great for braces&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this product is that the button to release pik is very sensitive</li>
    <li> Well designed for counter-top convenience and thorough cleaning. Seems to be made of quality materials. Quit, adjustable, a variety of tools, settings, etc. I&#x27;d highly recommend for price, quality, performance and convenience!</li>
    <li> Have been using waterpik for a number of years now.  I usually replace the machine every 18 to 24 months.</li>
    <li> This is a compact model compared with a waterpik that I owned decades ago. It is much quieter than the previous model and it comes with an assortment of heads for a variety of uses. All the heads are of the same color except one for the main tip.This model comes with a water pressure regulator, so you can choose a harder or more delicate pulsating jet of water, suiting it to your preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works as expected and satisfied all my expectations but one: I wanted to share it with my family and was misled by the picture showing the different tips. As it is a great product, I would purchase it again BUT I would buy a set of replacement tips to come along with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  We had a water pik that was several years old.  The technology has sure increased.  Love the new one.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to assemble. I was able to assemble and use it right away. It takes a couple of tries to get accustomed to using it without soaking yourself and the sink. But once you get the hang of it, it does a good job. It leaves the mouth really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at 6th pressure setting. I have been using all of the tips provided. The holder for tips is also a great idea. It has a little footprint too.</li>
    <li> I have always hated flossing.  This water pik is almost fun to use.  Once your gums toughen up you will never floss again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what it looks thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;Better than a flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Just add water and you&#x27;re teeth will thank you</li>
    <li> The Waterpic works very well, far  better than the last one I bought. It is very well designed. I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of material it removes from my teeth even though mu mouth feels clean.</li>
    <li> takes a little getting use to.  that jet stream is a little disconcerting until you get the hang of it,  I told my dental assistant that i bought one and she said, &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; and gave me a $5 rebate coupon.</li>
    <li> Having arthritis in my hands made it difficult for me to use regular floss, using the WaterPik is a breeze.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought this product.</li>
    <li> My only three quibbles with the design are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. That the tank should have probably been round so that the lid doesn&#x27;t fall in it occasionally after filling (think of a manhole cover).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The nozzle attachments don&#x27;t have a lock so they swivel any which way, sometimes with messy results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The button to stop the pumping has to be held to not spray, I think it should be the other way around.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this waterpik!  It sure does the job and is very easy to use.  It is very compact.</li>
    <li> This works very well with implants and crowns and has made the dentist visit much more fun.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it says it is!</li>
    <li> Perfect, Kids use it every day</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this works. I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> I bought this one over the brand new model based on a couple of really detailed reviews comparing the two.  I&#x27;m happy with this model and I don&#x27;t think it looks too &amp;#34;out-dated&amp;#34; or anything.  The newer model looks a little better in appearance, but I see now what one person said about the wand and cable keeper being better on this model.  Just by looking at the picture of the newer model, it does appear to not be as secure, which would have driven me crazy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this Water Pik for a few days so this review only covers the vendor and my first impressions.  I&#x27;ll update it after a couple of months to address performance and any early failures.  The vendor shipped within hours of the order and it arrived very well packed in less than two days (Amazon Prime).  The Pik was in perfect new condition with all parts, in its original sealed package.  Set up was obvious and the provided instructions were clear. The Pik works great, with a wide range of operating power and a variety of tips.  It certainly does a better job of flossing than regular floss and I can see and feel the difference in my gums.  One note; the operation must be done over a sink and the hose length requires the unit to be placed within six inches of the sink edge.  The power cable is 48 inches, so you&#x27;ll need an outlet within four feet of your sink.  So far I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;ll update this after more use.</li>
    <li> Get one.  Seriously.  If you do, and you use it once a day, you will give a lot less money over the course of your lifetime on your dentist.  Maybe his kids won&#x27;t get Cadillacs for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have both the cordless and this one. I purchased them due to tonsil stones. The portable was just to strong for cleaning my tonsils. So I purchased this one let me tell you every single time I have used it it has tipped over once it hits about half full and gets lighter. Water goes everywhere and all the utensils go flying. They really need to re think that. If this should continue the bucket and lid will break. Im pretty handy and have put suction cups for feet on it but its kinda hokey not for the money they cost</li>
    <li> This product worked well and as advertised.  I have suggestions as to how it could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found information on how to use the pik beyond sticking the end in your mouth and turning it on.  Is it best to run the tip along the gumline?  Hold it out a quarter inch?  Angle it a specific way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with several tips but little information on what they would be used for.  And only one standard tip.  Surely a high number of households could use a tip per person, at a small price to the makers.  Maybe they are counting on added sales of tips for households of more than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On initial startup the water had so much plastic taste that it bothered me for a while afterwards.  Surely with all the new concerns over plastic that is a Bad Thing, maybe worse for health than teeth not being water flossed.  Now I empty and rinse the tank, not just add water, and run water through the hose before using.  But I am still concerned about how much plastic I am getting.</li>
    <li> I loved it and it is a lot better than the regular flossing</li>
    <li> I was disappointed, it can make quite a mess if you are not careful, and with all the pressure its hard to tell if you are hitting the right spot. takes a bit of practice, but i find myself not using it much more often than I do.</li>
    <li> So far so good!!  Think COSTCO has the same one for almost twice the price!  So far I have been using it everyday and no problem!</li>
    <li> I thought flossing and the greatest electric toothbrush was getting my teeth clean.. not so.... The water pik still finds particles to remove.. If you have tight teeth, bridges, implants , or braces the water pin is a must.&lt;br /&gt;The basin is small but just right . You will want to use fresh warm water every time anyway. The various tips are an interesting addition but I use the basic one --until I come across,  a situation to try one of the others.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter asked me last week that if I could change things about my past that I wish I had done-- health wise ?--- I would have used a water pik and saved alot of money and some teeth..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it. I hate flossing and was told by a dentist I would never need to floss the traditional way ever again if I used a water flosser. I like the assortment of tips, specifically the toothbrush tip.</li>
    <li> Compact unit. Works very well. They should have made the hose longer, though.</li>
    <li> After a year of operation with no problems, the hold button ceased to work, making it impossible to pause the operation.  This did not prove to be an unsurmountable problem since all I had to do was to turn it on and off via the main switch.  Then a month ago, while operating the device, it just stopped working altogether, rendering it a piece of junk, which I threw in the trash.  I do not recommend this item, nor do I recommend the concept, which puts undue strain on a mechanical process which is bound to fail sooner or later.  Don&#x27;t buy into this.  Stick to flossing.</li>
    <li> Perfect. High water output or less depending on the setting. Comes with multiple attachments so I can change things up.</li>
    <li> Husband love&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m not sure if I do as of now but I&#x27;m working on it............</li>
    <li> I loved the newer design Waterpik flosser so much that I then got one for a friend.</li>
    <li> For my daughter, I purchased this to remove some debris between teeth. But, I stopped using it after several months. If you are diligent enough to continuously use this, you may purchase this.</li>
    <li> I really like my new Waterpik, it is much lighter weight and runs quieter than the old one that I replaced.</li>
    <li> The button on my handle is permanently stuck.  So it is broken.  Bummer.  Lasted only 9 months.</li>
    <li> Lasted three months.  The stop flow button got stuck and blocked the water flow.  Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very good for flossing. I have used this for a while now. Had no issue so far.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this water flosser. Some of my teeth are very close together and it is difficult to floss between them. This is where the Waterpik really shines. I have also received better dental checkups.</li>
    <li> Works as described, I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t have enough pressure but I don&#x27;t think you would want it on it&#x27;s highest power, not in your mouth anyway unless for some reason you get paint on your teeth, I know, unlikely. LOL&lt;br /&gt;Quality product, many extra tips for various uses.</li>
    <li> This is something every house should have if you value your teeth.  Its much more effective and quicker than floss or other dental tools.  I use a cap full of mouthwash and water.  It blows out anything stuck between the teeth and keeps the gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik brand for over 30 years.  I have owned 4 in that time.  Boy, has this product gone downhill.  This first one lasted over 20 years.  The third one broke after a year.  Of the 2 my husband and I just ordered, 1 has very little water pressure, even on the highest setting, and the reservoir empties 4 times faster than the last one we&#x27;d purchased a year ago.  It does not last long enough for me to clean all my teeth.  The second one is only a little better.  I will never buy this product again.  I can understand an occasional \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;, but we ordered 2 and neither one works well.  So disappointing after being a lifelong fan.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my son, who recently has gotten braces.  After his first month check-up, the tech stated that his teeth were really not being properly flossed.  His teeth hurt a lot and are very close together, the wires on the braces make it virtually impossible to floss back teeth.  The Waterpick Ultra Flooser, came quickly (Thanks Amazon), it was easy to prime and set-up.  After getting the hang of it, my son said \\&quot;my teeth feel so much better\\&quot;.  Needless to say, we just had another check-up and his teeth were 95% improved, as far as the flossing aspect.  I do, however, still make him brush after using the flosser for extra cleaning.  One other thing, I like that once the dispenser is emptied he has completed a little over a minute of flossing, which is good!!  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Waterpik for 4 years, and it still works great.  It takes a while to get used to the device (as you have to play around with the pressure setting and practice your technique), but it is a wonderful device.  I&#x27;m a tall guy, so I found the coiling cord on the handset to be a bit short, but that is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I had used waterpik a number of years ago and liked it, but started to use an electric brush.  Can&#x27;t compare waterpik with any brush!  It cleans great, has a number of pics you can use.  I&#x27;m staying with this product.</li>
    <li> I use it every night.  Haven&#x27;t been to the hygienist since starting yet.  But, I can tell my gums are healthier.  You do have to be careful about waving the wand around while the unit is running.  Best to be leaning over the sink with the wand in your mouth when switching it on.  Try the tips that come with it first before buying additional wands.</li>
    <li> Husband says it works quite well.  Does make a heck of a noise, however.</li>
    <li> This water floss machine has 10 power choices and many brush options.  It is easy to use and clean. It works!  I have used other water pic machines and they don&#x27;t water floss like this one. Good price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, who is ten and just got braces, plus a mouthful of plastic and metal on the inside to help expand her jaw.  If your kids have this, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about.  The entire rig makes it hard for her to floss and brush, so we bought her this on recommendation of her orthodontist.  She LOVES using it and her teeth are really clean.  There&#x27;s several tools that you can attach to the tip, including a water flosser, which she loves since she can&#x27;t use tape floss.  This thing is great - I may even buy one for myself!</li>
    <li> It cleans pretty well. I will certainly recommend this. My dentist already saw the changes when I went visit last time.</li>
    <li> I used to suffer from bleeding gums. Coupled with an electric Oral-B toothbrush that I bought from Amazon as well, my teeth feel and look much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months and it still feels great and gives you plenty of power to floss your teeth in hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing but great things to say about this product, and you especially can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices and service.</li>
    <li> This is a great invention,  Saves time and if the product literature is to be believed it gets rid of periodontal pockets.  Last time I had one of these my gum health improved dramatically.</li>
    <li> I replace completely the dental floss string with this amazing product.I feel my mouth cleaner and my gums healthier.Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This water pick does a good job of removing food between the teeth.  However, as in the past, it is messy.  You have to be very careful.  If you can tolerate the mess, go for it.  Shipping was even faster than expected.  Good job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit a little over three months, and have had no problems whatsoever.  It replaces an older model Waterpik which finally gave up the ghost, and I am very happy with this one.  It is easy to use, attractive, and its smaller footprint leaves more room on the counter top.  The water container is smaller than my old model, but that hasn&#x27;t really been a problem.  Worst case scenario, I could refill the container and continue cleaning, though I haven&#x27;t actually had to do that yet.</li>
    <li> First Day i used it made it look like I went to the dentist. Teeth came out really clean and cleaned out my gums</li>
    <li> The base unit is too light and moves around when you try to use the pic.  Otherwise it does the job well.  Inexpensive but good.</li>
    <li> If you have implants. The water pick will keep the gum under the implant clean and healthy. It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
    <li> At my first cleaning of the year, I had pockets in my gums that were 4&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s (unhealthy). 6 months later, at my 2nd annual cleaning, all of my gums had pockets that were 2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s (which are healthy). I find it amazing how much of an improvement my gums had by using this product mostly because I didn&#x27;t use the waterpik religiously every day - I would use it 2 to 3 days a week and some weeks I&#x27;d be too lazy to floss at all even with a Waterpik...This is a good product to invest in to prevent gum disease.</li>
    <li> Waterpik water flosser is now equipped with a newer pump resulting in adjustible stronger spray&#x27;s to teeth and gums. Use your 360 degree tip spray head to avoid twisting (and stressing) the water line.</li>
    <li> i am a chinese girl, this machine is not quite fit for our voltage, but i think it is good</li>
    <li> It works but the cord from the machine connecting the instrument is too short to reach my mouth with the machine on the edge of the sink and my head almost in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were they thinking?</li>
    <li> This unit is a replacement for an identical one that &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after about 2 years of intermittent use, due to the fact that the water tubing to the hand-held device broke off. But long before that happened, it was frustrating to get the water to pulse due to a failure to reliably prime the water pump. You had to hold the hald-held lower than the unit multiple times, allowing air bubbles to work their way through the system. Often it was necesssary to remove the reservoir and replace, which helped to remove the air bubbles that left the unit &amp;#34;churning&amp;#34;. But eventually (typically within 30-60 seconds) it would work correctly and does a good job of dislodging food debris, especially from under a bridge.&lt;br /&gt;  But while it took the better part of a year for those issues to develop on the first unit, my second unit developed these &amp;#34;churning&amp;#34; problems within a month or two of receipt. Things are not quite as bad yet, but I can see the trajectory. Had I known of an alternative, I might have tried another brand, but I was hoping a new unit would not be afflicted in this way. I&#x27;m hoping the tubing doesn&#x27;t break off of this one; the tubing problem on the first unit didn&#x27;t appear to be reparable, so I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommend  the Ultra Water Flosser. He had a display in his office  and showed me how to use it. The next day I went online to Amazon.com and ordered the waterpik. It arrived two days later. I use it every day and I love it. It weights less then two pounds, easy to store and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Good health and fresh clean gums. woohoo!!!...I am smiling!!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> its really perfect to my daughters using like good complement of teeth cleaning, excellent  choose, easy to use, secure, and easy to clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Waterpiks in the past.  And have always gone back to dental floss for the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;I had shoulder surgery six months ago...arm in a sling with limited movement and I couldn&#x27;t use dental floss (takes two hands...the single handed flossers didn&#x27;t work for me).  So, I got a Waterpik to use one handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really well to get the gums clean and keep them healthy.  I like the adjustable power dial and use it on the five setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had two dental check ups since getting this Waterpik and both have been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously still use dental floss when I&#x27;m not home, but only use the Waterpik when it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used a Waterpik. My teeth are very close together and along with that I have two bridges that make flossing beneath them extremely difficult. The Waterpik is the ideal \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; and I see the company is now using this in its marketing. Recently my old Waterpik Ultra broke (the hose was brittle and it literally snapped off) necessitating my buying a new one. I made the mistake of ordering the Waterpik Flosser Cordless (see my review of that product) only to realize after several attempts that it simply did not have the qualities that make the Ultra so desirable. And what are those qualities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- An ample-sized water reservoir. When this is filled with warm water, you can do an adequate job of irrigating your mouth and teeth without having to stop to refill it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Power. There are ten settings (not two like the Cordless) ranging from a soft stream to a very intense one approximating the water tool used by the dentist. Plaque, bacteria, tartar and lodged food particles do not stand a chance as you ramp up the power setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Tools. It comes with a variety of tools from the regular water pik, to one for braces and one specially designed to remove plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Storage. The Ultra&#x27;s lid allows you to store your unused tools within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look... I&#x27;ve used both and there really is no comparison. If you are serious about your teeth and gums, THIS is the Waterpik to get. It does not take much counter space, cleans up with a simple wipe of a hand towel and is reasonably attractive. You won&#x27;t be sorry, I can guarantee it. Just go easy at first with the settings. Begin with a low number (i.e. 3) and after a few cleanings slowly increase the intensity. Discover the tingling feeling of a mouth that is perfectly clean... dental hygienist clean. (aside: you can add a small amount of mouth wash to the reservoir periodically - just be sure to run water through following the session to clear out the water hose)</li>
    <li> Best Product Since Sliced Bread. I Never Flossed Before With String Because It Was Annoying And Hard. Waterpik Is Fun And Easy. There Is Something Satifying About Seein Chunks Of Food Come Flying Out Of Your Mouth. I Would Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave it five stars because I love it even though it&#x27;s a bit noisy. I&#x27;m getting great reviews from my dental hygienist for my flossing and gum health. This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The first one I used for five years and would probably still be using but the connector hose got a kink in it and split. So I&#x27;m guessing that is a good estimate for a lifespan.</li>
    <li> It works much better than the old one I replaced!  Initially I thought I would be fragile, and bought the smaller version of Waterpik  which was a disaster.  The reservoir on the small version isn&#x27;t nearly big enough without having to refill it several times during use.  The Ultra Water Flosser  I got does a superb job without interruption.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations and was delivered on time. It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> This is just what the dentist ordered! I am delighted with how fresh and clean my mouth and teeth feel after using it.</li>
    <li> for someone who rarely flossed and needs to floss, I found this thing amazing. now yes, if you do not know how to control it [like me], it will be a bit messy but I was quick to understand it. I enjoy how this works compared to just flossing, and it really does what it is supposed to, without as much pain as flossing. it is a bit loud but I can deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have easily flossed like 5 times just because I enjoyed how it felt and how clean it left my mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will update in about a month or so to see how it&#x27;s doing :)</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik. I am a dental hygienist and love to recommend to my patients. I personally have one and use often. this waterpik comes with several attachments ... The attachment  can help around bridges, implants , Ortho and much more ... It is another thing to use, but , if you want to have health gums and don&#x27;t mind the extra step ... this will definitely help :)&lt;br /&gt;I have mine for over 6 months and still working great.</li>
    <li> I really expect things like this to last more than a year.  Which is what this lasted. A year and one month.  I had just bought new heads for it and it quit. Of course it is out of warranty. My electric toothbrush has been with me so long I am surprised I can still get replacement heads for it and I use it two to three times a day. This was once a day when I wasn&#x27;t traveling.  Will be looking at another brand :(</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner.  The product is high quality and has been working wonders on my gums.  It feels amazing and is super simple to use.  If you have not tried this before, I am warning you, you will never want to manually floss again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t plan on using it while anyone else in the neighborhood is sleeping it sounds like a gas station air compressor when you run it. Cumbersome to refill and pressure seems lower than I expected.</li>
    <li> Love it...I actually look forward to flossing now!  I am buying a few as Christmas gifts...I highly recommend it...buy it!</li>
    <li> This is the flosser ever. Had one for 3 years that just broke. Got another as soon as possible. Perfect. Even the kids love it!</li>
    <li> This makes your teeth feel so clean, and I love all of the different settings! Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Ultra for a couple years now - and have been very disappointed with the water pressure.  But I figured there was a reason for it.  Then the other night I went to use the Pik and the card from the water reservoir and the water flosser just broke.  It was like it was cut - right by the hand device.  Also, there is always a bit of water retained somewhere from the reservoir to the flooser device...and after a while it becomes a bit rancid.  It&#x27;s OK - but I can&#x27;t decide if I want to buy another one or not.</li>
    <li> great wish I had gotten it years ago</li>
    <li> Love it! I hate flossing but this is so much better and my hygienist is so very pleased with how much my gums have improved. No messy nasty dental floss and pieces of food flying where it shouldn&#x27;t. It all falls right down the drain.</li>
    <li> Works very well for removing food particles as part of dental hygiene. Not a substitute for flossing with floss, applying fluoride gel, or brushing the teeth. Will break or lose performance and become ineffective after a year or two due to compromises in its design and manufacture.</li>
    <li> After extensive dental work including a seven tooth upper implant, I found flossing impracticable. My dentist suggested using this unit twice a day, and after two months it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little tricky learning to start it in my mouth and then letting the water drizzle out without splattering, but time and habit solved everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just had my three month checkup and everything was sparkling clean around both the implant and my remaining teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small amusement: the carrying case has holders for four tips but the unit comes with six. Luckily the fifth wheel, as it were, fits in the carrying case even though there is no slot for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swish and pik away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;January 2015</li>
    <li> Works exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> The pause switch  spring  very weak</li>
    <li> This the second Water pick i have purchased.  Performs exceptionally well...dependable and trouble free.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for less than a week and it is performing as advertized.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> For the first time in a decade my annual clean was next to nothing, recommend putting some mouthwash in the water to boost your clean!</li>
    <li> I use it every day for over 2 years-works great and the price was much less than other stores.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Works like a champ. Comes with a good assortment of tools and stuff, but I find myself using the classic one the most often.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I have periodontal problems. This definitely helps with that too.</li>
    <li> Got rid of it..and got the Soniccare Airfloss instead.</li>
    <li> Great for flossing my teeth with braces. I am happy with it and it is very helpful and a great investment. I wish i would of known about this a long time ago. :-) The only flaw is that if you don&#x27;t have control it squirts out like crazy and if laying down it starts to drip out the water from the whole. However it cleans the gums and foods that get stuck very well. I highly and strongly recommend people with braces and even without to buy one for a better overall clean for the mouth.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik waterflosser that I owned, and is great for maintaining &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34; health.  Water carrying hose of the first one broke after several years of use, and I had to get this one.  Easy to use, great water tips, and functions well to massage &amp; floss gum.  I would highly recommend this to anyone for oral health.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! Nothing can hide from it.</li>
    <li> Never used one before, and I love the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth...</li>
    <li> This device works much better than flossing by hand.</li>
    <li> My recent purchase of a Water Pik is giving me great satisfaction.  It works very well indeed and is simple to operate. The various speeds are easy to adjust, and it is good looking.  I have gaps in my teeth which are difficult to clean with floss, but the Pik does the job well.  I am 95 and still have all my teeth except for a small bridge. Using the Pik leaves nothing behind to rot my teeth whilc I sleep.!!  Best of all, it also makes my dentist happy.  At least he says it does.  But how can it - he makes no money for doing expensive fillings. T de G</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet]]  Unit is very-well designed and easy to use in spite of it&#x27;s many attachments and settings.  It exceeded my expectations based on the  product description.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this for me.  I&#x27;ve been flossing for over 10 years and once you use this waterpik you&#x27;ll understand why the dental floss won&#x27;t do no more....  This is truly a wonderful product.  It&#x27;s so good I bought a second one for my sister-in-law for her birthday. Now she is in love with it.</li>
    <li> Really cleans all areas between teeth and under bridges.  A great tool for oral health.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Does a good job of getting into all the crevices of my teeth.  I had the same one before but after a year the cord from the unit to the handle cracked and then water came pouring out so I had to toss it.  Hope that doesn&#x27;t happen again.  I suggest wiping down the handle and container after each use to keep it looking like new.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING EVER. Way better than the portable versions.  This waterpik will clean your brains dry without ever trying.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my first waterpik.  However, the Waterpik Ultra Water Jet is a superior product.  When I clean my teeth and gums with the Waterpik Ultra, my mouth feels fresh for hours.  My dentist wants me to floss but I get better results using the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for about a month and use it everyday. I got it because it was recommended by a friend and I was not dissapointed. Prior to using this my upper right teeth were very sensitive due some periodontal disease. I had some initial bleeding - I started on #2 - and worked up to #4. Within a few days the bleeding had subsided and I could gargle cool mouthwash without the sensitivity to temperature. I was impressed. I was also looking at having 2 teeth pulled because of the pain and a recent gum infection in the exposed area. I&#x27;ll be postponing that now. This makes it so much easier, because I hated to floss, so using it daily isn&#x27;t a chore. I&#x27;m going to try diluting the water with some mouthwash to get it under the gums. (and maybe try turning it up a little). My only con: it could use a little bigger water tank. The higher you turn it up the faster it drains, so the healthier your teeth get the more you have to fill it. What a trade off.</li>
    <li> I Bought this for myself and i love that how clean my teeth feel after I use it on them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who was having gum problems.  He said the pik used fine and it seems to be helping his redness.</li>
    <li> I had one of these and it lasted for years so when I saw it for sale on Amazon, considerably cheaper than the one I purchased in the store, I decided to order it. It works great, just like the other one I had-same model. However, this one is soooooo loud. It sounds like a pc. of machinery when you turn it on. Not the quiet humm motor that my other one had. Other than the loudness (don&#x27;t use when someone is sleeping), it works great.If it was not so noisy I&#x27;d give it a 5 star. These really get and keep your teeth and gums in shape. I love Waterpiks, not too happy about the loudness though.Maybe that is why it was so much cheaper?</li>
    <li> Was told by my Dentist to get one I did and like the way my teeth and cleaned of Plaque</li>
    <li> Good buy.  This holds enough liquid to thoroughly claen your teeth, and has every attachment conceivable</li>
    <li> We hate using dental floss for many reasons.  This product solves the reasons we hate flossing.  I would suggest using the \\&quot;room-temperature\\&quot; water since the cold water would hurt the sensitive gum and teeth.    You can expect to see the result in two weeks.  It really improves my gum.  You should expect to see bleeding the first few times you use it.  The container is big enough to hold enough water.  You can also adjust the water pressure.  Overall the product serves the purposes.  I bought it in July, 2007 and after 2 years of using it, it is still running without any issue.</li>
    <li> I went with this Waterpik flosser over cordless models because it had the best reviews. I have only had this for a couple of weeks but I have not any problems with this Waterpik.</li>
    <li> but I hate this regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended me to use floss but I don&#x27;t like to use it.&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended me this water flosser and I use it every day because I like it. The feeling is very comfortable and the handling, too.</li>
    <li> The device sprayed water all over the bathroom sink -- with very little spray actually impacting my teeth.  I would like to return it, however, can&#x27;t seem to figure the return policy of Amazon.  A successful return would encourage me to try Amazon again  --  however if we are unable to return the device we will never consider an amazon purchase again.  Bill Michaels</li>
    <li> Hydro Floss irrigator is the way to go. I&#x27;ve had one for years with no problems. The Waterpik is less expensive, but you&#x27;ll pay over time in hassle. Read the reviews. The Pik falls apart....... BTW my periodontist recommended Hydro Floss. Stated that he&#x27;d tested all the leading models and found HF to be best.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GOOD PRODUCT, BUT I DON&#x27;T LIKE. YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS GREAT IN THE MOVIE, BUT WHEN YOU USE IT, IT&#x27;S UNDER YOUR EXPECTATION, SO I HAVE TO SAY IT&#x27;S JUST OK.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get one, and he didn&#x27;t much care which one, so I went by the Amazon ratings, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month, and I can really tell a difference in my teeth and gums (I did floss before, and I&#x27;m now alternating floss days with Waterpik days).  Takes a little getting used to, mainly that you have to put the device in your mouth and THEN turn it on; you can pause it from the handset.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an old one (more than 10 years old) that had a broken water hose. This model works fine but I would prefer the &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; model for two reasons. First, this model has several tips, but they are each for a different function. I would prefer several of the normal tips so that the unit can be shared. Second. This unit takes up more space and has less water capacity than the older one where the reservoir is inverted for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything works fine and it was delivered (sort of)on time. Although it was supposed to be sent by UPS, the UPS people took it to the Post Office who brought it to my house. This was a 3-day delay, probably due to the bad weather we have had. I guess I can&#x27;t fault the merchant for the lack of service by UPS.</li>
    <li> I rated this product w/5 stars.  From an adjustable mild flow to a powerful blast that will remove food particles that just plain brushing will never be able to do.  The &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button is a great feature which allows you to adjust your treatment while flossing. The multiple attachments, ( that are included), will accomplish anything you would need to have done just like sitting in your Dentist chair. In fact, by using this product on a daily basis, it will keep you OUT of the Dentist chair more frequently. Great product and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT item for anyone to have in their bathroom.  After brushing, I use the Waterik and am amazed at that particles of food still come out from my gums.  By using he Waterpik, I have improved the health of my mouth.  I would recommend this Waterpik even to children who are old enough to handle it.</li>
    <li> This item was brand new and works great.  It was priced lower here than anywhere I&#x27;ve looked.  I still use it on occasion and is still fully functional.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I would rather have it spray a consistent steady  water stream. The way it sputters when it sprays makes water go all over place.</li>
    <li> The perfect tool for my teenage daughter with braces. She uses it everyday and it makes flossing much much easier.</li>
    <li> This water flosser is very powerful and clears out my mouth in no time. I can thank this flosser for keeping my gums so healthy.</li>
    <li> When I received my Water flosser, I could not believe how many food particles were removed from between my teeth.  I think it is even better than flossing.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I received my order on time, and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. I was told that dentists recommend this waterflosser over any other kind of flosser. My sister bought one and was really surprised at how well it worked. My teeth are in good shape for a 62-year-old and I want them to stay that way, so I bought one. It really is amazing! I flossed first and then used the waterflosser. More came out with the waterflosser. I&#x27;m a believer! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Highly worth your money. It&#x27;s the easiest way to clean you teeth. I always wash out food debris after using my tooth toothbrush. You will be shocked that how many food debris still left in your mouth after using toothbrush.</li>
    <li> SUPERB product here. The problem I encountered is after 8 months the waterpik refuses to start. Nothing has changed either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore...3 stars.</li>
    <li> The idea behind the waterpik is great, too bad the device is poorly thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipe for electrical disaster. Very lightweight device with the water reservoir perched on top and the stiff coiled cord feeding the nozzle on the bottom of the device. Start it up, pull the nozzle toward your mouth and the whole thing tips over spilling water everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you clean up from that little mess. Crouching down low over the sink lest you upend the whole unstable mess again you&#x27;ll find the button on the nozzle works exactly backwards from the way you&#x27;d expect. Pressing the button doesn&#x27;t start it, it&#x27;s spraying wide open unless you press the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who designed this calamity? Useless.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick shipping. I have a loss of dexterity that makes flossing difficult and I dislike the little floss holder gadgets. I already own a Waterpik &amp;#34;hummingbird&amp;#34; flosser (love it) but I wanted a water flosser as an adjunct to the hummingbird. My gums are healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The water flosser is messy--a lot of water.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift and she liked it very much. It is very useful and practical, even you could forget you have a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Waterpik . This contraption did my teeth / gums , a whole lot good  !!! I was having problems with periodontal pockets , and with the help of the Waterpik , I experienced SIGNIFICANT improvement . No more risk of my teeth loosing , and requiring more extensive work  . This is a great maintenance tool !</li>
    <li> Love this waterpik flosser. Does a great job of removing food particles stuck in between and cleaning gum pockets. My dentist recommend this as a prevention of gum loss and periodontist. Should of bought this long ago. Money we&#x27;ll spent to prevent gingivitis.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the kids&#x27; orthodontist to keep their teeth from discoloring and removing gunk that gets caught in between the metal braces and the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids no longer have braces and still no cavities -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought one for the master bathroom and noticed how much cleaner our teeth are and we even see debris floating out after carefully flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to start with low pressure and building up to higher pressure over time is a nice plus. Everyone has their level of comfort and this machine delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our teeth remain tartar-free a lot longer between office visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family of four recommended.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my grandfather and he absolutely love it! He is a grown up person and always needed to clean his teeth working more than he could, now it&#x27;s as easy as put water in the Waterpik and use it as floss!</li>
    <li> When my Cordless Plus died after 15 months, I switched to a Cordless Recharger and to my disappointment it lasted less than a year. So, I decided to give this water flosser a try. I imagine it&#x27;ll last much longer since there is no battery to worry about. So far so good, the only thing annoying is the location of the on/off switch, it really should be located on the right side because regardless of whether a user puts this thing on the right side or left side of his bathroom sink, it&#x27;s easier for anyone to turn on or off if the switch is located on the right side of the flosser.</li>
    <li> Works well enough, but not nearly long enough. It has a very strong spray if you want it and it gets the job done, but for $50 it should last longer than this. There is some kind of gasket leak on the piece you hold in your hand and it has left the unit with very little pressure.</li>
    <li> Saving my teeth with this \\&quot;oral irrigator\\&quot; for years, and nothing else works as well.  If you have places between you teeth that just brushing can&#x27;t get clean .. or flossing is too difficult to do, this product is for you.  This latest model is even better because the pressure settings are more precise and the pause button on the handle is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proof of it&#x27;s ability is seen in the sink every time. As you use it and the water spills out of your mouth, you can see bits and pieces missed after brushing or &#x27;toothpickin&#x27; and those would have caused plaque.  And I have one impossible &#x27;pocket&#x27; that can only be cleaned by flushing it out this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wanted to know the exact footprint this model will make (space on my crowded bathroom sink area is tight) I called WaterPik and asked.  Every time I needed to ask anything over the many years I&#x27;ve had one, their customer service person gave me 5-star responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other makers of these devices, but none do it all as Waterpik.  Without a doubt, I have kept my real teeth because of using it.  My dentist insists I use it often and I do. This is a great product from a great company and I&#x27;ll never be without one.</li>
    <li> I have had several models over the years, but this one is the best by far. My dentist recommended I get a waterpic as flossing wasn&#x27;t getting the job done effectively for me as I have several bridges and tight spots where it is difficult to clean. Not as messy or difficult to use as the older models. This model has the power and the attachments that make cleaning easy and effective. My dental hygenist was impressed with my results. Great product!</li>
    <li> the top of the water container also serves as a storage compartment for utensils rarely used. when you lift the container top the storage compartment easily opens exposing the utensils and in some cases, they fall out. if you keep the container lid on after use; it must be 100% dry or black mold starts growing particularly around the rubber stopper. the rubber container stopper slowly disintegrates and gradually falls apart or splits causing the container to leak. i think the container encorages bacteria. i needed to replace the brushes several times&lt;br /&gt; this is my first water pic and it certainly is a plus for oral hygiene... if the average life expentancy for a water pic is 12-18 months then this item is average.&lt;br /&gt;the pic pulls an enormous amount of debris from your teeth and gums , even after a rigorous brushing... use a screen over your sink drain as there are enough sizable particles over time to clog your drain.</li>
    <li> First off this thing is awesome!! You&#x27;ll never have to floss again, but the extra heads are kind of hit or miss.... most of them miss haha i only use the original jet type head which works perfectly so no complaints there. But if you are buying this version for the added heads only i feel you will be dissapointed buy this thing because of the size of the water tank. I can&#x27;t imagine how annoying it would be to have to refill the smaller ones atleast 3 times per use sometimes with this one i will use 2 tanks 1 water and 1 water and mouth wash mix works good. Another common complaint i hear about this thing is its loud i was very impressed when i got this about how quit it was compared to what people had said. Some people even claimed you couldnt use this at night because you would \\&quot;wake up the kids\\&quot; completly not true. This is about as noisy as an electric toothbrush Buy It!!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik flosser works well but does not replace good old manual flossing. I have flossed after using the Waterpik and removed food particles that were left behind.</li>
    <li> There is absolutely nothing better for your teeth and gums than a Waterpik. Plaque is a thing of the past. I have never been a good flosser and this works better anyway. I simply don&#x27;t understand why dentists don&#x27;t just rave about it. That said, I am disappointed when they quit working after a year&#x27;s usage. Maybe it is the hard water of Florida, but the pressure just gives up after awhile.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra is an exceptional value. It does the job for many different requirements. The pik eliminates the need for flossing and leaves a clean set of teeth. Enough pik heads are included so that more than one person can find the device useful. It is compact and looks smart on the counter. It was on sale and the best but was at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is very easy to use and has multiple tips for different purposes. It is clearly stated in the instructions that you can use it with your favorite mouthwash product and that&#x27;s why I like it so much! Two birds, one stone!</li>
    <li> My new dentist recommended a water pic. I checked reviews and decided to try this one. My husband got one also. We both love this. Should have gotten one years ago. We feel our teeth and gums are so much healthier.  Just the right pressure. It does the job. No more flossing.</li>
    <li> Bought this the week the Orthodontist installed braces on my eight year old daughter.  Braces make flossing very tricky, especially for a child. Turns out she didn&#x27;t like it from first try: too much water; too difficult to avoid messing the bathroom.  Her twin brother on the other hand, who we often suspected was not doing the best job flossing or brushing (without braces), absolutely loves it and this product we are sure is enabling far greater maintenance.  I am using it as well; alternating daily (with dental hygienist approval) between this and traditional floss.  I am certain it is doing a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only minor nit is our bathroom has two sinks, each near their own electrical outlet. We move the base unit between the two sinks.  A minor tweak to the design would ease the portability of the base.  In current design, a child (or an adult with wet hands) can not safely move the base to where it&#x27;s desired.</li>
    <li> For the first couple of months it was great. Then the button on the handle stopped working (it would stick ON or OFF), and I eventually got used to having to start and stop the flow with the power switch. Then just recently, the handle started to leak and I can&#x27;t use it without dribbling water all over. I think it&#x27;s too late to get a replacement so I am pretty much stuck with a messy, inconvenient machine that will sit on my sink until I figure out what to do with it :S</li>
    <li> Good follow up to brushing and flossing. Really irrigates gum line and great for flushing under bridges and around crowns</li>
    <li> I am a very long term user of a Waterpik. Started using about 1968. Still have all but one molar (at 82), I think largely due to Waterpik. Was recommended by my dentist back then though I believe some dentists do not like because it might drive bacteria under the gum line. Don&#x27;t think this happened with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design is weird looking like an alien but is much quieter than old model. Old model started leaking from hose. In my experience, the mode of failure on an old unit. I only use only the standard spout provided as it does the job perfectly. Never tried the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill with a small glass of warm tap water and run at full speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A necessity for tooth and gum health at a low price.</li>
    <li> I will rate it with five stars. I have to learn how to use it without making a mess on my face. It really does get stuff out from between your teeth. Having braces is rough enough. Now that I can use my Waterpik Ultra, my regimen for cleaning my teeth is cut in half. Time is Precious and you should not spend it all trying to clean between brackets. This is my new Best Friend. Thank you, Ty</li>
    <li> Good product, I like this product, would by another one if this one was broken.  l really ove my waterpick.</li>
    <li> I used this product once, carefully following the directions for initial use.  After this initial setup,&lt;br /&gt;I  proceeded to use the basic gum attachment and it worked fine this one time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to use it again before bed time, and nothing happened when I hit the power button.&lt;br /&gt;Tried  moving it to a another outlet with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I returned this the next day and am very reluctant to try this brand again.  A shame since this product has been around for 20 years.</li>
    <li> The water pic unit does not prime its small pump very well. One must push down on the plastic water container to get the flow started. The pressure settings are set too low. On my old unit the setting that worked for me was two. The new unit requires a six setting to equal the old unit&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> but then I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to!  Seems to be a little weak with the water stream, and a little tempermental.  However, my gums have improved!</li>
    <li> It continues to amaze us how many particles are not removed from our teeth by brushing.  Waterpik has provided the needed care.  A bit messy but necessary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these. They worked great for about a year, then a plastic washer fails inside the wand and water sprays everywhere.</li>
    <li> Do not buy from this seller.  We received this water pic used and not working.  The evidence of mineral deposits on the pic and opened packaging where a disgusting surprise. After contacting the vender they wanted a video of evidence.  We will not use this vender again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what we needed to help our son clean around his braces.  It is the perfect size and works beautifully.</li>
    <li> It has replaced dental floss for me. I am wearing braces and this is a life saver. My dentist and orthodontist have both commented on how clean my teeth and gums are. For me it could stand to have more pressure in order to remove stains.</li>
    <li> This item was bought for a friend and she loves it. All the features are just what she wanted. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I used many years ago - and some reason I lost it - forgot about it until now, and found that this latest version is even better than the original ones. Bought it and started to use on a daily basis. First time back to dentist for cleaning, and lots of compliments. Before that, was always &amp;#34;you have to improve your brush, must floss every day, etc&amp;#34; - after using it, changed completely. Now not only I feel my mouth is clean, the dentist also confirmed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Waterpik for a few week, and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful water pick.  It has enough adjustments and power.  So far so good.  Have used it about two weeks now. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This is a most enjoyable appliance.  My dentist recommended it and I&#x27;ve noticed less irritating scraping of plaque on my my last visit thanks to using the Pik.</li>
    <li> Beats flossing, especially with braces. So much junk gets stuck in the wires and brackets that I can&#x27;t imagine trying to get it out with floss and tooth brush and rinse alone. This is a time saver and hopefully improves my overall oral health since I tend to hate flossing and get lazy with it.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for six months.  I hated flossing, but I tried repeatedly to make it a habit.  Since purchasing this item, I use it at least 4 times a week which is much better than once in a blue moon.  Easy to use.  I just purchased this one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Had my waterpik ultra water flosser for just under 2 years of light usage but, now it doesn&#x27;t work.  Worked well until it suddenly stopped working.  Unit turns on and vibrates normally but, no water comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted customer service who advised me to flush it with white vinegar but, that didn&#x27;t work.  So they replaced the handset and everything&#x27;s fine once again.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to floss.  Since I started using my Waterpik my checks and cleaning are very positive.</li>
    <li> This is my second WP-100 flosser.  I liked the first one and as advertised, this one is even better.  After the first week of use I had my original flosser dial up to full force.  I&#x27;ve been using this new one for several weeks and the dial is set at about half pressure.  The pulse speed is also faster and the machine is noticeably quieter.  You can still hear it, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction from my first WP-100.  My dentist noticed a marked improvement in my teeth and gums after I began using a Waterpik and I can&#x27;t think of reverting back to my former standard of oral care.  When this one breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another Waterpik.  Hopefully the WP-100 or something like it will still be on the market.</li>
    <li> Functions well, really cleans the areas between the teeth . Have it set on &amp;#34;7&amp;#34; for a good cleaning, use it every night as recommended by my dentist . It really flushed some food out the first time , now it is just keeping food particles clear, I do floss after waterpik &amp; will find a little debris left over .I had it for 4 weeks or so , I can&#x27;t speak to durability , overall good product. Only negative I could say is pause on the handle doesn&#x27;t do a good job of shutting down the water flow . I found I need to have the off button close &amp; use that.</li>
    <li> This is about my 5th Waterpik flosser in the last 38 years.  They are a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The connection where the tips and the handle met on my old Waterpik began leaking too much, so I replaced it, keeping the old model for use when traveling.  This new model is much quieter, and I like the location of the flow adjustment on this model.  Waterpiks are great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum line, especially around dental implants or permanent bridges, while also remembering to brush well and occasionally use dental floss as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find any water flosser will eventually get a slipery build up from stagnant water that collects between the bottom side of the tub and the body of the flosser where the tub rests.  This can be easily cleaned away, but it will also build up inside the handle, since connections between the tips and the handle cannot always remain completly watertight, and some water will collect and get trapped inside the handle itself.  To avoid this problem, I simply drill two small holes in the handle, one somewhere near the top and one at the bottom near the water inlet tube, being very careful not to damage any parts inside the handle when drilling the holes.  However, I always wait until after the warranty has expired to do that modification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Waterpik flossers to my friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> This iconic oral health tool does precisely what it supposed to do, comfortably and thoroughly.  You cannot improve on the original.</li>
    <li> Excellent addition to flossing.  Makes gums feel clean.  Not a substitute for flossing but easier to get the kids to use this than dental floss.</li>
    <li> I love this flosser.  When I first got it I thought what a pain having to plug it in every night, but after using it, I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about it needing a charge just as I&#x27;m getting ready to use it.  I love that I can adjust the water pressure.  It does a great job cleaning around my dental work.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> For me, I have been using a cordless (non Waterpik brand) and while it has helped my gums, I wanted to step my gum treatment up a few notches so I purchased this Waterpik. It is TOTALLY AMAZING how well my gums are responding to this treatment. Here is a list below of the MANY PROS of this unit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Effectiveness with my gums, teeth and mouth: After using this just a short time, my gums are getting more of that lighter pink and healthy look I need for my gum health. And they feel so clean after each use. In addition, my teeth even look cleaner! Love the fact that this has 10 different intensity levels. The one – five are very, very gentle on gums (great if you have tender or swollen gums or if you are new to Waterpik). However, I am up to power 8 on this and will be up to a 10 soon) and this intensity works wonderfully on my gums. They actually enjoy their beauty treatment so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Pause Button on the handle – This saves the day for me as when I want to pause, the button is at my fingertips and this helps me not to spray water all around my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Ease of filling and cleaning - This unit is easy to fill, clean and empty and I like the fact that it is stationery in my bathroom and does not take much counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Attachments and what is included – This comes with 6 attachments: Classic Jet Tip, Toothbrush Tip, Tongue Cleaner, Pik Pocket Tip (my favorite attachment as it is really helping my gums), Plaque Seeker Tip, and Orthodontic Tip.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the attachments, there is a Quick Start sheet to show you how to setup the Waterpik and also there is a small owner’s manual that has much information on how to use each attachment and how to overall use the Waterpik with pictures and step by steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Quality and Sound: This unit is almost whisper quiet as the motor is very smooth yet heavy duty at the same time. This is a very superbly made Waterpik!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this for gum health. For me, it has made all the difference in the world on my gums, and allover dental health.For me, it has made all the difference in the world on my gums, and allover dental health.</li>
    <li> Fantastic item. Every household should have one.I purchased one for my grandson and one for my daughter as Christmas gifts and they loved them, too. I have permanent bridges and it really does a thorough job getting into tight spaces.</li>
    <li> What a great way to clean dental work.  Dental work is a drag but this makes it a bit easier.</li>
    <li> This really gets the gunk out from between your teeth.  It has plenty of pressure, controlled at a dial, that leaves my mouth feeling clean.  Flossing, after using this, rarely turns up any &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who has a mouthful of metal right now to fix his overbite. It works wonderfully!  He uses it several times a day and it does a great job of getting to all the nooks and crannies where food gets stuck.</li>
    <li> Waterpik replaced this Ultra with a new model, the WP-300...it has the same features of the old Ultra but the added feature of the Aquarius; namely, an On/Off switch instead of just a Pause button.  It has the substantial feel of the old Ultra, not lighter like the smaller Aquarius.  The combo package, available cheaper at Costco, includes the new Ultra plus the Traveler flosser called Nano.  The only disadvantage of these two over the Aquarius model is that these can only be used in North America.  They won&#x27;t work in Europe we&#x27;re told.</li>
    <li> How convenient, this product has a 1-year warranty, and just after 1 year the top portion of the attachment release breaks. It no longer stays put, meaning there&#x27;s a slight gap where water drools and sprays out of the gap and a loss of water pressure firing through the waterpik. It can&#x27;t be from tinkering with the attachment release button too much because I&#x27;ve been using the same attachment for a over a year. I&#x27;ve tried all attachments just to be sure. This product would&#x27;ve been better if it had a screw-on attachment changer rather than a cheaply made release button.</li>
    <li> An easy to use tool for the teeth and gums as well as cleaning in tight spaces. I used hot salt water and this Waterpik to clean the nooks and crannies in a mechanical cup lid as well as the usual oral care. It is quite a handy little thing to have around the house!</li>
    <li> This machine works, wish I had found this years ago, flossing does not work the way this does, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I was amazed to see just how much is left between your teeth after eating a meal. This unit flushes everything out from between the teeth. Perhaps I was getting most out but the debris was concealed by the toothpaste. Best to use WARM water if your teeth are sensitive to cold water, per the instructions. Wide range of pressure settings and attachments.</li>
    <li> It has several different tips that are easily inserted and removed.Besides the on amd off controls it has a pause button and several settings to adjust pressure.  The tip swivels making it easy to get to all parts of your mouth without having to take it out of your mouth to adjust.</li>
    <li> I love it. Although I have to admit I am quite messy. I have water marks all over my mirror. ha! ha! I need to perfect my technique. The easy pause button helps you to avoid messes, if you use it. It&#x27;s light and not so big so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the sink.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I saw it on Tim Ferriss&#x27; blog. It is awesome when I&#x27;m motivated to actually use it...</li>
    <li> The waterpik was recommended by my dentist to use after brushing my teeth to make sure my gums and teeth were really clean.</li>
    <li> goodbye floss, hello water floss. it simply works no issues after 1 month use. a bit noisy especially if you are flossing late in the night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik on and off for some 20 years. Since my retirement I&#x27;ve been able to be far more &#x27;religious&#x27; about employing it, and my dentist tells me it has helped my oral health immensely.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 years ago, and developed no cavaties for once,  but machine then stopped working. It&#x27;s been elevated to a necessity</li>
    <li> Easy to use in the shower. Will know more how well it works at my dentist Appoinment ;-)</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but is a little noisy. Seems like an evolved, well thought out product. And it&#x27;s more fun than flossing.</li>
    <li> I wore my other one out.  This one is identical to my 5 year old flosser in every way. (except it comes with more attachments - that i will never use)  Why change perfection?</li>
    <li> Everything as described and very fair price with all contents new and perfect. Already makes a difference how my mouth feels!</li>
    <li> I have used a Waterpik for years - My old one still works but the thing that holds the wand broke so I gave it to my son (he can duct tape it) and treated myself to a new one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a Christmas gift and was very happy with the timing that it was delivered in.  Exactly what we wanted!</li>
    <li> Product works well . as recommended by my dental hygienist. Should have had one a long time ago. Happy with product</li>
    <li> After getting several cavities between my teeth it was time to get serious about flossing.  I had resisted the traditional waxed string floss because it made my gums bleed and took lots of time.  After some research I settled on this unit because of its good reputation and the fact I could do the whole routine on one tank of water.  It makes flossing a breeze.  On my last visit to the dentist my gums were much better and there was much less scraping between the teeth.  This was a second unit I had purchased for my teenage son.</li>
    <li> What the voltage for this model? Dose it work with 240V ?</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser has become an important part of my daily dental care routine.  After I became used to utilizing its various tools,  the machine was quite simple to operate.</li>
    <li> My dentist basically told me to get one, and I&#x27;m learning to use it. My mouth feels different compared to normal flossing.</li>
    <li> This works great. I bought this on a recommendation from my dentist. I have very little teeth in a small mouth so I have some very hard places to get too with floss. All the little attachments are awesome. My teeth feel so clean after using this and I got rave reviews for my dentist for flossing woot woot.</li>
    <li> i love this product, i use it daily and would recommend it to anyone it helps with my sensitive gums</li>
    <li> Quite effective, but tends to get water everywhere. My dentist highly recommended.the unit. Seems many-fold more effective than floss.The unit is sturdy and of high quality.</li>
    <li> I have had gum problems and lost more teeth than is comfortable for me. So I purchased this waterpik to improve my dental health. The pik often irritated my gums and the water ran down the handle. I decided to floss after using the waterpik and found that debris remained between the teeth after use of the pik which I removed by flossing. As a result, I have discarded the waterpik and now floss instead.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Waterpik Flosser and this newer design over my previous one is attractive and works better than ever.  The pressure has been improved and I would recommend it highly to anyone that uses a flosser.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist and I would recommend it to EVERYONE.. I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments but am very satisfied with it so far and I have had great improvement at the dentist appointment!! A must for all who care about their dental health!!! You will be pleased!!!</li>
    <li> This is just what my dentist wanted me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price but found cheaper in target on sale.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well...should have researched more!</li>
    <li> Love how this machine cleans.  I have braces and its an absolute must have.  Using regular floss, or picks helps but this machine makes flossing so much easier.  I have owned this product for over a year and it still works great.  Its a little loud but worth it.</li>
    <li> The hose is a little too short, have to kneel the sink to use it properly. Other than that it works fine</li>
    <li> I love this Water Pik - it&#x27;s fantastic &amp; I use it several times a day!!! I&#x27;m sure my hygienist &amp; dentist recommended getting a water pik years ago &amp; I&#x27;m sorry I ever waited!</li>
    <li> This was a great product, my first purchase of this kind due to dentist recommendations. No complaints and seems to clean my teeth better than brushing alone or regular flossing.</li>
    <li> This works better than string floss, feels better on the gums, and is fun to use. Would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> unit appears much simplier and smaller than I expected. One container-full is barely enough for one time use. Pressure is not as strong as needed for a thorough clean even it is set at the highest &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; reading.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully but if not pressed down for even one second , the flosser will spray everywhere.  It&#x27;s worth the money but you&#x27;ve gotta be quick and ready for it when you do it! Five stars if it wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for a gift for my brother who said it is great.  He gives it five stars and highly recommends it!  Should have asked for it many birthdays ago!</li>
    <li> I always find that after I have flossed that this water flossed gets out more particles. I travel with this item even though there are more portable flosses. This one has several different attachments.</li>
    <li> Works great to clean all those spaces and nooks and crannies caused when your teen has braces. I bought this because our Orthodontist recommended it, especially if you feel your teen won&#x27;t floss as they need to. Our son uses it all the time and the price here was much better than what they were selling it for at Ortho&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews complained of leakage. Its not the case with the one that I received.&lt;br /&gt;What a massage. The interplak that I had before does not hold a candle to this waterpik The delivery was unbelievable. I placed my order on a friday and received it the following monday. At this point I&#x27;ve been always pleased with all my purchases from Amazon</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  My teeth are clean and my growing endodontic problem is reversing.  Buying it through Amazon made the process simpler and cheaper after my dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Works as expected and with easy to use controls has fit well into our daily routine. We like the smaller, compact size and it is not as noisy as the previous one.</li>
    <li> I got this to help clear food out of my braces. I also have impacted wisdom teeth that have emerged and trap food often. This is the only this that helps clear the food debris out! It make my mouth feel so clean each time. I used to use it everyday but I currently only used it as needed. The machine itself it kinda bulky but its not too bad. I haven&#x27;t had any problems since I purchased it 2 years ago, its still very powerful and effect.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This flosser works great and corrects some problems of prior model such as the reservoir when filled would cause the wand to overflow.  The tip release is better and you can swivel the tip rather than twisting your hand when moving around your mouth.  Good product.</li>
    <li> After having over $22,000 Dental bill with multiple crowns for deterioration of old fillings (of 20-40 years), I decided I needed to add to my Dental care routine.  With my Dentist&#x27;s approval I started using the Water Pik, and am well pleased with it&#x27;s overall benefits.  The instructions were easy to follow for a first timer.  The unit is compact and fits well on my Bathroom counter.  The multiple level settings make it easy to find the setting for my use.  The capacity of the tank is adequate to allow total rinse of entire mouth without refilling.  Only dislikes I have is the unit is somewhat loud when turned on, and the cord could be about 12&amp;#34; longer, to remove feeling of restriction in use.  The price was acceptable to my budget.</li>
    <li> I use this every day for my braces, and it has never let me down! I love this product. :)</li>
    <li> this OEM product was exactly as described, was delivered in good shape and on time. It works exactly as expected.What more can I say?</li>
    <li> This is so much better than using floss. I love using it and my dentist was impressed that I didn&#x27;t have hardly any plaque. I use it once a day. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the holder part on the front is not very sturdy and half of it broke off after about a year. They should try and redesign that part of it.</li>
    <li> this is the best investment in dental  health.since i bought this i have been using it regularly&lt;br /&gt;it is much easier and more effective than regular flossing.i think every body should use it</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  Brushing and flossing just do not do the necessary job for me.  This irrigator dislodges particles from between my teeth that otherwise would remain there and cause problems.  I have use various Water Pik products for many years and have been very pleased with each.</li>
    <li> After trying a couple of other water flossers, this one works really well. I use it two times daily post implant surgery. A functional and useful tool. Keep a firm grip on the wand or one can spray the bathroom mirror!</li>
    <li> Works great cleaning around my tooth implant and cleaning the gum line. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting a deep cleaning of teeth and has issues with repeat cavities like myself.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and we both love it . Cleans teeth better than floss</li>
    <li> Not much to say here.. They are a perfect fit for my waterpik, which is quite an amazing device in itself... And the price was excellent compared to some retail locations.</li>
    <li> Found out you only need to use one of these if you have space between your teeth, like the football commentator on fox.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product does what it says it will do. GREAT for people with braces and other oral fixtures.  Cleans between teeth no need for traditional floss any more.  It&#x27;s strong and powerful. A great investment for any family. It will promote better dental health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet for nearly a month and am quite happy with it. I chose this model because it has a smaller footprint than most of the others and looks attractive on the bathroom counter. But it works great, also. Even though I floss daily, the Waterpik removes particles of food the floss just can&#x27;t reach. I highly recommend this machine!</li>
    <li> Have really enjoyed using the waterflosser.  No more bleeding gums from dental tape/floss.  It is noisy I will tell you that but it does a nice job of cleaning your gums; a touch of mouthwash in the water also is nice.. Hope it will last a long time...</li>
    <li> I bought this after my dentist kept complaining to me that I need to floss more (even though I floss and brush about 3 times a day).  I&#x27;ll see what the dentists says in six months after using this every day.  I have been feeling a better clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> The newer model works better in the on-off switching of the finger control.  Gets out what floss can&#x27;t ... Great for keeping gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Both me and my wife love this product. Water flosser has so much more particles to remove *after* one does regular flossing. You will believe it once you start using it. Given the costs associated with cavity treatments, I personally think this is a worthwhile investment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great plenty of pressure ,  but unfortunately does not come with a lounge scraper like pictured instead you get two regular pics.</li>
    <li> This does a pretty good job and comes with extra attachments. I only wish the cord was longer and it had a better on off switch. It will drain the reservoir quickly on high.</li>
    <li> This takes up a very small amount of space on the counter and holds more than enough water, the only downfall I can actually come up with is it&#x27;s quite messy when using it but that is inherent of this type of product and I don&#x27;t see any way around that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this twice a day and basically use a tank full of water with 1 capful of listerine added to it and honestly my mouth feels just as clean as it would leaving the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
    <li> After many years, my old Waterpik finally died. The design of the new one is unfortunate.&lt;br /&gt;Worse:&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is recessed 1&amp;#34; making it difficult to judge the water level.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is blue rather than clear making the amber mouth wash look disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir cover doubles as a storage case making it unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 6 tips, but space for 5 (4 storage slots in the cover and one space in the handle).&lt;br /&gt;My old Waterpik had enough Classic Jet Tips for my whole family; this one does not. Rather it has specialty tips that we don&#x27;t want.&lt;br /&gt;Changing the different Classic Jet Tips is more cumbersome than it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Better: The new off/on switch is an improvement.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and has been better than any other water flosser I have used so far.</li>
    <li> I use this before I brush my teeth after eating breakfast and dinner. It was sso easy to use. I didn&#x27;t get the tongue cleaner attachment, but I got 2 regukar tip for flossing.It was alittle load but it doesnt bother me .It was so helpful for me cuz I have braces and it was hard to floss with brackets and wires on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of traditional floss, primarily because I find that this does a better job and I&#x27;m much more likely to use than floss. My dentist has commented on the health of my gums since I started using this and he approves of its use. It may not be faster but it really works for those of us who don&#x27;t like to floss. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> kaput ! very very soon !!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous.  It cleans plaque from the gum line and in between teeth quite well.  I like the assortment of tips.  My wife and I get to have our own which is nice. Pressure is plenty sufficient. I bought my parents one for christmas and they love it.  Makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it every day, twice a day. It really makes my teeth feel clean after every use. I would highly recommend. no complaints</li>
    <li> this is great. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Love the Waterpik.  Recently had a dental bridge put in and was very concerned about keeping it clean.  The dentist took me through how to use floss and thread it through using a loop thing.  That didn&#x27;t impress me.  Did a little research on Waterpik&#x27;s and settled on getting the Ultra.  It does everything I want and has multiple settings for water pressure.  The dentist cautioned me not to use it above 7 which works just fine.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product for keeping a good health of teeth. I use it twice everyday and it really helped me solve my teethe problem</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; I believe a pretty good price. I bought it a couple months ago &amp; it holds up well.</li>
    <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Easy to set up and it certainly does the job.  Recommend it highly.  Fast shipping as always. Seems powerful and a cinch to keep clean.</li>
    <li> After using the flosser, I find that it cleans the gunk from between my teeth very well and massages my gums. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how the water gets all over my hand when using it. Also, there&#x27;s no gum bleeding like when I used a thread flosser. Maybe Waterpik can design a new flosser that angles the handle and/or tool so that the water doesn&#x27;t go all over your hand? Maybe extending the tool further from the handle would help too? Or just maybe I&#x27;m incorrectly holding it?</li>
    <li> MY WIFE IS SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED, IT REALLY WORKS IN CLEANING THE TEETH THAT THE TOOTHBRUSH CAN&#x27;T REACHED. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Just could not master the use of techniques, given before the review is incorrect.This product can be between the teeth in the meat dishes at the end with water rushed out.5 minutes, if the maximum power to calculate, with two boxes of half water, enough for two teeth.</li>
    <li> It is a good water pik.  It is a bit loud and gets your bathroom messy if your not careful. Do need to refil with warm water before each use because the cold water seems colder when it is sprayed on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Works nicely.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this about 2 or 3 times--as a gum stimulator it is excellent, but it&#x27;s quality as a flosser is questionable.  i flossed after using this product and still found pieces of food stuck to the floss.  i bought this because it was getting quite difficult to floss my teeth after getting braces installed.  using this is better than not flossing, but this product is NOT a replacement for regular old flossing with good technique.</li>
    <li> After five uses within five days, the On-Off switch went \\&quot;Pop\\&quot; and the unit was dead.  Anyway the maximum setting gives only the minimum power to dislodge food from between teeth.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for us.  We&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it has not leaked or given us any problems.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Really feel my mouth is refreshed after using.  Surprising the amount of food particlles flushed out!!!  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son due to the plaque build up on his braces. He first thought it was weird but soon used it everyday, cause he liked the end result. The dentist also noticed the big difference after two weeks.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend others buying this product. Really useful and helpful. There are multiple brushes with it. It does help my teeth.</li>
    <li> Great conceptual product, amazing results, there is no words to describe it, you need to use the product to feel the great effect.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is small and fits on the side of my vanity.  It is powerful and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my gums since I have started using it.  Works well and is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The best flosser I&#x27;ve ever used. You can change the speed of water by adjusting the dial. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I must have one of the smallest bathrooms in NYC...it does not have a sink. The only sink is in the kitchen.  Now, if I was in a normal house I don&#x27;t think it would be an issue, but there is only one plug that is somewhat near a water source.  In the bathroom, near the tub.  Event though the room is small, it doesn&#x27;t reach far enough for me to be comfortable using it...so I do not use it as often as I&#x27;d like because it gets water all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it though, it&#x27;s great.  It gets things out of my gums that brushing didn&#x27;t do, nor do I think flossing would find.  Maybe someday when I move to a new place, I will use it more diligently. I guess I&#x27;d better shop for a good extension cord in the meantime. Until then, I reserve it for when I eat something that I know will get stuck in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since most people have normal bathrooms, I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in my hands and string flossing was getting harder to do.  The Waterpik does a better job and it&#x27;s easy to handle.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I use a water flosser, because I&#x27;m not consistent with my regular flossing, and it does a good job. Only wish it was a little more powerful. Make sure you use lukewarm water, because using ice cold water out of the tap makes you cringe!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect water flosser.  Right price, great product.  And best of all it provides great results.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 36 year old daughter who has extremely beautiful teeth (she had braces twice) and has never had a cavity!  It was her favorite Christmas gift.  Great price, quick service, quality product!</li>
    <li> It works well. I brush and floss but I am &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; and have started to develop gum disease. Had I known that this could be an important tool keep my teeth and gums healthy, I would have bought one a long time ago. So now I floss, brush and then use the Waterpik. This is just in addition to your regular routine. It feels good when you use it.</li>
    <li> I love the Waterpik.  I have gotten great reports from my hygenist and dentist since I have been using it.  Flossing has never been a thing I love to do so the Waterpik solves that problem.  My issue has been with the unit itself.  I first purchased a Waterpik water flosser in February, 2011.  It began to leak at the bottom after a year and a half of use so I purchased the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  When it arrived, it had a defective switch.  I contacted Amazon and a replacement one was sent to me and I returned the defective one.  I notice now that the rubber stopper at the bottom of the tank does not seal completely when the tank is not on the unit.  Will now have to address that issue.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE:  I spoke to a representative at Waterpik about the leak.  She sent me another stopper and that has solved the problem.  I also think it is helpful to not push the tank completely down into the unit when it is stored so the stopper will not retain its \\&quot;open\\&quot; position and possibly begin leaking.</li>
    <li> O melhor produto que comprei nos últimos tempos!&lt;br /&gt;Sinto que realmente meus dentes estão perfeitamente limpos!&lt;br /&gt;Minha família também adorou!</li>
    <li> The first &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; had to be replaced within a couple of weeks because it leaked, (Waterpik replaced at no charge) but the subsequent one has worked fine. I wish it had more tips like the old ones -- the set up is a little awkward and hard to turn on/off/adjust with one hand.</li>
    <li> This water flosser has all the bells and whistles. My old one burned out and I&#x27;m glad it did. Waterpics have greatly improved since the last one I purchaced years ago. Very ergonomic.</li>
    <li> Unusual purchase as I did not buy this for personal use but used at work to clean small items.  Worked well for it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product , compact , great water pressure , works wonders on gums , teeth and tongue . Superior model to my previous,older version of  Waterpic .</li>
    <li> I have numerous crowns and have some issues with stuff getting stuck so the dental assistant recommended that I get a waterpik and I love it! my gums and mouth feel so clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> This works really well, but after I told my doctor that i was using this instead of flossing he advised me against it.  Apparently it does not get the bio film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have to do more research, but I stopped using it because my goal is to not have to floss and if this doesn&#x27;t make that happen its just another step.</li>
    <li> Estou muito satisfeito pelo atendimento, pela entrega rápida e confiável e pelo produto em si. Comprei para minha filha que usa aparelho ortodôntico. Recomendo. Sou do Brasil,comprei a partir daqui via internet e uma pessoa minha recebeu nos EUA e trouxe quando voltou pra cá.</li>
    <li> To be fair, this is more a review of the product description than the product itself. I hate it when I buy something online trusting the product to be as it is described and/or pictured and it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik pictured shows different colored bands around the various tips, and the item is described in the ad copy as coming with six COLOR CODED tips; an important feature if you have a family and wanted to assign each person a different colored tip to use. The tips are not in fact different colors. They&#x27;re all blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Waterpik model comparison grid on the product page lists The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser as having the following: 2 Classic Jet Tips, 1 Pik Pocket Tip, 1 Plaque Seeker Tip, 1 Orthodontic Tip, and 1 Toothbrush Tip. There is actually only 1 Classic Jet Tip, and then a Tongue Cleaner Tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it is advertised as coming with &amp;#34;an in-lid tip storage compartment.&amp;#34; Although it comes with 6 tips, there is only storage for 4 tips in the storage compartment. Even if you constantly store one of the tips on the unit itself (out where it can get dusty, etc), you can only conveniently store 4 out of the remaining 5 tips. I guess the other one has to live in the toothpaste drawer. Maybe they expect you to immediately lose one of the tips. This isn&#x27;t life-shattering, but it&#x27;s a ridiculous oversight by the design department and I&#x27;d expect better from a company that&#x27;s been around so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these</li>
    <li> Very disappointing performance, needs more pressure to do an adequate job between teeth, and under bridges. My old model, same brand, is better.</li>
    <li> This works great.  Got it for my wife, then she talked me into using it.  We still floss every evening, but use the Waterpik after eating.  A little sloppy but easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I like the battery powered flosser better but it doesn&#x27;t last that long.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like stronger water pressure.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this for me...and now i&#x27;m recommending it for everyone, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few different Waterpiks but i&#x27;d suggest this one. The basin is just big enough to hold enough water&lt;br /&gt;for each use. Some of the other ones are more compact but you&#x27;d need to refill the water while using it,&lt;br /&gt;which just takes more time.&lt;br /&gt;After brushing with a sonic toothbrush, which i&#x27;d also super highly recommend, and using an interdental brush, the Waterpik removes all particles of food that remain between the teeth and gumline. It is very efficient and also kinda fun to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had difficulty with traditional flossing but this makes it very easy to floss my sensitive teeth. Just be sure to use warm water.</li>
    <li> We all know that flossing by any means that doesn&#x27;t scratch teeth of draw blood is healthier than not. And we&#x27;ve all lied when the dentist asked, \\&quot;Do you floss regularly?\\&quot; Somehow, sawing between our teeth with string (technically known as floss) is not something we like to do. We&#x27;ve tried it and we&#x27;re not idiots. Flossing with floss is about as technologically advanced as straightening your teeth with a ball peen hammer. What&#x27;s the modern alternative? The electrically powered squirt gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you might ask, how hard is it to make an electric powered squirt gun that&#x27;s small enough to fit in one&#x27;s mouth? Apparently very hard because Waterpik has been improving its entries in the field for about fifty years. You have to admit, that&#x27;s a long time to figure out a squirt gun. Have they finally gotten it done to a commercial science?  Sorta yes, sorta no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A water squirter, such as the Waterpik Ultra, is less annoying to floss with than string floss, or in the vernacular, floss. But then most things are less annoying to use, such as driving into a tree, pulling barbed wire through your ears, or getting caught with the check at Manhattan Italian restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik Ultra&#x27;s instructions tell you to not turn it on unless the spout is pointed into your mouth or in a sink. So Waterpik clearly assumes at least a few idiots will use the product. Thus, we can assume they&#x27;ve made it safe for idiots -- even though electricity and water are both involved! I admire the moxie for trying and the accomplishment. You rarely hear about death by water flossing -- a few drownings perhaps but not electrocutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation is simple: plug in (you&#x27;d be surprised how many forget this all-important step), add water, put in mouth (no, the other part), turn on, move it around like the diagram shows -- Yes there are pictures included in case you might have a problem navigating inside your own mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what could be simpler? Okay, flossingwith floss is simpler. But this is less annoying to the user. To the innocent bystanders it might be more annoying because, of the noise, but you can&#x27;t please everybody, especially when water is involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of noise, this model is a bit quieter than the racket-works of old, say, last year&#x27;s model. But not a lot quieter. It&#x27;s not quiet enough to talk while it&#x27;s running, but then you&#x27;ve got your mouth full of water so what&#x27;s the problem? Otoh, one thing you can say for using floss to floss is that you can do it in private behind a closed door. Floss with a Waterpik and anyone sentient in the house will know. It doesn&#x27;t need to be this way but the competitive state of the art is to avoid using sound insulation in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank is way too small. You have to be in a real hurry to cover all your ivories before the tank runs dry. The tank is made to accommodate those that want to to say they did without any real commitment to the activity. It could easily be two or three times as large. So, if you&#x27;re not afraid to commit, have a pitcher of lukewarm water on hand to save time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik has a reputation for making moderately durable goods in a field where many make impermanent goods. So it&#x27;s got that going for it. And based on the warranty, Waterpik is betting that most units will last three years. So put the receipt in a safe place you&#x27;ll remember three years from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s virtually impossible to fully dry out the the inside of the tube and hand held portion of the device. So, run some alcohol or Listerine through it into the sink now and then to clean it out. Or run it into your mouth is you choose a nice single malt--but a full tank is going to tell poorly in your behavior -- even if you&#x27;ve managed, so far, not to run the Waterpik pointed at the mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought the original WaterPik about 30 years ago and loved it.  Easy to use, easy to store, turn on and off while using it, manipulate as I was using it, etc.  This one has more bells &amp; whistles but I find it clumsy to operate.  There&#x27;s a bunch of attachments, but only designed for one person to use, whereas the original came as a 4 person set.  But alas, the original finally wore out and I just can&#x27;t seem to do without a water pik now.  It does the job and I&#x27;m trying to reprogram myself to make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> it  is perfect.it  is perfect.it  is perfect.but it is too expensive.but it is too expensive.but it is too expensive.but it is too expensive</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a water pick.  It was the best deal online that I could get from any local store.</li>
    <li> Very good while it lasted.  My husband discovered that if we push down on  the rubber piece inside the water cup, we can get it to work.</li>
    <li> I love that I can use this as a backup to flossing.  I use water with some mouth wash added.</li>
    <li> It lived up to the description.  The pause is really nice.  My old cordless one would lose power too quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband bought one a few months ago for us. We love it, we use it every day and are very happy with the cleaness of our teeth . One time I traveled and  realized that I really missed using it, then I ordered the second one. Now we have one at home and one to take with us whenever we travel.</li>
    <li> Been using waterpik water flossers for years, which keeps my gums healthy.  It is better than flossing by hand, and definitely keeps gum disease at bay.  I wish the container was larger, to hold more water, because I often have to refill it and continue flossing.  Even though the plastic container seems a bit flimsey, it is the only product that irrigates the gums completely.  A stronger jet of water would make this even more useful.</li>
    <li> It is amazing what comes out using this. Side benefit, my four year old thinks it is fun. Anything that gets a four year old to clean their teeth is excellent. Just have to remember to turn the pressure down for him.</li>
    <li> A top notch product that really does its job.  it is high quality &amp; well-made, and significantly contributes to dental health.</li>
    <li> After years of using several different water pics with loud pumping noise this new one is so quiet I love it .. Eighty-four years and still have most of my teeth</li>
    <li> I almost said \\&quot;No\\&quot; to recommending this product but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know weather or not it is effective. At first I was excited about hoping not to have to floss anymore but after using, it&#x27;s really hard to tell whether or not the ultra flosser is actually doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of review on this and kinda liked what I read. I ordered it in Jan and got it promptly. I have been using it for over one month now and I had timed its purchase to give me a month of usage before I visited my scheduled dentist appointment as that would be the real test. Today I got back from the dentist and got full marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik is an excellent product. I have been flossing and brushing (or trying to) twice a day. But it was a chore. Since I got the Waterpik I have used it twice daily and sometimes 4 times per day. I love the convenience and the feeling of real clean. But the real bonus was that it removed all debris and really helped stop the plaque build up. It works as advertised and it took me less than a week to figure out all the attachments and technique. I have a bridge and an implant and this product is wonderful for it. I am also a new cigar smoker (very light) and I have no stains or tar build up. My hygienist was not too happy that I was not using the floss, but after her exam, she was very surprised and gave me a very good review on the condition of my mouth. I just wish that I had discovered this earlier and am going to order another one for my son.</li>
    <li> To make a long story short. The waterpik cleans well in between my teeth. My teeth are very tight and I can not get floss in between them with out cutting my gums. The Waterpik has solved this problem. Easy to use and has several attachments. I use the one with the brush on the end. It also has adj. pressure control. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, once you get used to not taking it out of your mouth wo either pushing the stop button or turning it off.  I did spray the bathroom a couple times.  Powerful and efficient.  Doing what it is supposed to do for me.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used waterpik water flossers for the last few years but I noticed that their quality has been declining. It seems that every new model is made more cheaply than the one before. This new one I have been using for about two months now has a button that sticks about 90% of the time. You can easily turn it on, but you can&#x27;t turn it off unless you press on the button really hard. I don&#x27;t think this model will last long because its overall quality is lacking.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it does a good job for me, because I have several teeth very close together, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get in there.</li>
    <li> I really like this but I think the water container should be larger. Sometimes I have to fill in twice.</li>
    <li> I like this version of my water pik better than my first one.  The only problem I have with this one is that when I put my mouthwash in the water holder it drips out on my counter of the sink and I lose some of the mouthwash.  Otherwise I really like my water pik.</li>
    <li> This machine is tiny, taking up little counter space. The tools store in the lids so that&#x27;s good. You have to be careful when putting it together or it will fly apart under the pressure and you&#x27;ll have a big mess. It has a dial for the pressure but I find that difficult to change once I&#x27;ve committed to begin. The on off switch is hard to turn off with one hand and that&#x27;s necessary as the other hand is holding the wand. It&#x27;s awkward.it does do a good job but you must not use too high a pressure as gums are sensitive and the water jets out under quite a bit of pressure. I don&#x27;t think I would buy another of these without being able to see it and check it out in person.</li>
    <li> It does the job and does make my teeth feel clean. It is one of those products you buy, expecting to use everyday, but it just sits there. They give you one more tip than they give you storage for, so you end up with a tip floating around in a drawer. The machine is also messy if you are not careful. It will spray water all over your face and clothes if you get complacent. Be sure to maintain it also or it will get moldy on the inside.</li>
    <li> This product performs as expected. I like the ability to vary the pressure of the wash incrementally. Pretty much once you dial in to the pressure you desire, you leave it at that setting and never adjust unless you perhaps decide to use one of the other specific heads that can be fit onto the unit.  Those that have not used a waterpick because you thought it would be quite messy, I found it quite controllable.</li>
    <li> Love the waterpik.  I purchased the waterpik since I have two children with braces.  It&#x27;s hard for them to floss correctly.  This works great for them.  I also use it (purchased extra replacement tips) and love how easy it is to use and that you can add mouthwash to the water for extra gum health.</li>
    <li> Decent price and prompt delivery. Waterpik works well removing debris that flossing and brushing do not.This model is more compact and more stable than older units due to the smaller reservoir.The reservoir contains a sufficient amount to thoroughly clean one user&amp;#34;s teeth/gums.</li>
    <li> Bought this in October, 2012 for my husband.  He uses it once a night.It has been 4 months and last night it quit pumping water.  Up until now it was a nice machine- worked well, good pressure and cleaned well.  Four months is too short of a time for usage.  Would not recommend purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this Waterpik.  It does what it says it will do, it has many different types of implements, and it is compact in design so that it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on my vanity.  Great choice!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t always been the most dedicated to dental hygiene. I mean I brush twice a day and a quick floss at night but after a recent round of dental problems I&#x27;ve gotten more thorough. I brush thoroughly, floss thoroughly and use the gum pick. Should be pretty clean, right? Not so. I started using the Waterpik and was totally amazed at how much debris I flushed out even after all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like, d**n, where was this stuff hiding? I am now a dedicated, card-carrying, hardcore Waterpik user.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist. Everyone should have one of these. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have one that I bought two years ago.  Since I began using it, my gums feel much healthier.  I personally think of this little machine as &#x27;medicine for my mouth&#x27;, it absolutely reversed my gum problems with regular use.  I&#x27;ve bought this same model as a gift for several friends and family members.  Anyway, having used it for two years (just me) it is now breaking down and needs replacement.  The hose, which is permanently curly to save space, has developed a few leaks and now water is spraying all over the bathroom from the hose holes.  Of course, less pressure is making it to the tip.  Also, one other problem I&#x27;ve had since I first bought it:  When I place the filled water tank into the machine, the two parts don&#x27;t always sit right.  i.e. they don&#x27;t lock together, so the motor will run but no water is coming out. My counter gets totally soaked from water that spills when I have to tug the filled tank out of the machine and re-set it several times.  It&#x27;s incredibly annoying.  But, I still love this machine, warts and all.  And a two year life isn&#x27;t all that bad for a machine that works as hard as this one does.  I plan to stick with the Ultra Waterpic, and will reorder. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll get a model without this connecting flaw and a hose that doesn&#x27;t split and crack.  I can&#x27;t stand having a wet countertop in the bathroom, but I&#x27;m getting it from two separate flaws.</li>
    <li> It does a good job and not hard to use. I may have liked it better if the arm was not attached.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for proper care of your teeth. Nice to have it all in one handy unit.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser&lt;br /&gt;i can not say enough how happy my mouth and gums feel in oct i go to the dentist for my check up i&#x27;ll report back</li>
    <li> I used this with my husband every time after meal. It really cleans our gums and teeth. I will continue use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes I use high pressure and my gums bleed a little. So be careful when choose pressure. Anyway, my husband and I love this!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the performance of this product.  Much improved over the older \\&quot;water-pics\\&quot;.  Easy to use and multiple pressure settings can be varied during use.  Will replace when needed with the same unit if available.</li>
    <li> We got this WaterPik about 10 months ago and I started using it about 3 or 4 days a week. When I went for a dental cleaning 4 months after I started using it, ny hygienist and dentist both said there was a huge improvement in the condition of my gums and mouth in general. SO, I happily continued using it at about the same frequency until 3 weeks ago, when it just stopped working. who knows why, but I am extremely frustrated that it didn&#x27;t even last a year - in fact, it barely made it to 10 months! I know it wasn&#x27;t horribly expensive, but I am tired of this \\&quot;throwaway\\&quot; state we seem to be in where appliances are produced with a very short term of built-in obsolescence.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the one I had, but finally wore out. I use it regularly with a little mouthwash and peroxide (mouthwash capful of each) and my dentist and hygienist say my gums are in great shape. Hygienist said she would have to cut me to get gums to bleed. This newer model seems to use less water than my old one because I get more repetitions with the amount in the reservoir even though it holds the same amount as my old one. Love the Water Pik.</li>
    <li> I love this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. It is easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Your mouth feels very clean, and is pretty quiet.[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
    <li> Per my dentists recommendation - she knows I&#x27;m a lazy flosser, I ordered this one and my teeth and gums are happier now. I have a bridge on my lower right side and its a pain to floss it with those specialized floss sticks so this is a good purchase and my dentist couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> As good as over 6000 4+ reviews would make you think. I have been going crazy for a while now with a large space between a natural tooth and a cap - large pieces of food (large for your teeth) getting stuck and floss really just making it worse because you&#x27;re pushing floss up between the teeth and therefore pushing up the stuck food. I used an old Interplak that&#x27;s been in the bathroom cabinet for years and it could not dislodge the food on its highest setting (clearly why it&#x27;s been sitting unused in the cabinet all this time).  The Waterpik blew it right out the other side, first shot and I didn&#x27;t use the highest presssure.  My mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this clean since the last time I went to the dentist.  Having the extra tips enclosed in the lid is a nice neat design feature. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this for two months now and could not be happier. Well made, quiet, easy to use and look after. Only complaint would be that they give you too MANY Water Pic heads. You will never have to floss again. In fact, I think for most, your need for getting your teeth cleaned will no longer be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moderate a Health blog and have told my readers that one of these is a MUST. No more gum problems and most people don&#x27;t floss well without one.</li>
    <li> The water reaches places that floss doesn&#x27;t always reach.  I bought one for each of us.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Item was mentioned by a friend after his dentist suggested it to him. I tried it and am extremely pleased with the results. I recently had a cleaning and the hygienist saw an improvement from last cleaning and had only used it a couple of weeks. Definitely gets the particles out much better than regular flossing. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yes floss is inexpensive but man is it a pain in the butt. I&#x27;ve had this waterpik for over 2 months now and use it more frequently than I did floss. It was such an mundane task but not anymore. Hopefully my dentist notices the difference!</li>
    <li> Product cleans teeth very good.  It is easy to use and does not create a mess.  Can be used with mouthwash.  Highly recommend for dental care.</li>
    <li> Remember how, after your third VHS machine, you finally recognized that the device at hand (ALL of them) were not going to live forever? That after a limited amount of months, they WOULD die?  Well, here we go again...with this type of appliance.  Mine lived for 9 months then, as others have experienced, the on-off switch \\&quot;Didn&#x27;t Work.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying another and hope for a longer span.</li>
    <li> I just use it no more than two minutes every day and usually at scale 5-8. I thought I could use it at least half year when I first got it but just go failure days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good quality. The body is made of cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The design is not bad and it is convenient to use. I will give it five stars if it could last one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I am still contact waterpik Inc. about the warranty issue.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent water flosser , clean what you don&#x27;t see between your teeth, make flossing is easy and simple, it is easy to control, save you time and frustration using other method of flossing.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter when she had braces and loves it. She still uses even after the braces came off and has taken it off to college with her.</li>
    <li> It took me several days to get the hang of this water flosser. I&#x27;ve never used one before, and there was a lot of splashing at first. But it works great, especially with a about 1/3 Listerine in the tank. Just make sure you rinse and run a cycle with just water afterwards to clean out the plumbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this flosser daily for about a month, my dentist noticed a major difference. They also advised me to use string floss at least once a week, but they said it&#x27;s really just a formality.</li>
    <li> I have used it only for about 30 days so far and it seems to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered the flosser, it arrived defective, the on-off switch did not operate but I quickly received a replacement unit. The seller communicated with me on a weekend and assured me that a replacement would be sent the following Monday am, which it was.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product twice and I have found that the hose is way to short for me and the hose is unruly, it&#x27;s not flexible and soft like it should be. I bought this unit strictly for the Pic Pocket attachment and when I use it I have to hold the entire unit up towards me so I have enough hose, serious pain in the butt. I can tell that this product will do what it is suppose to and I will be happier when I make some hose modifications.</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend everyone to use this product!!  So easy to use as well... Would definitely give it a 5*!!  Certainly great as part of your gum and tooth care!!!...</li>
    <li> What a terrific product.  I&#x27;m actually considering purchasing a second, as I have up-stairs, downstairs, setup. Easy to use, refreshing, not an eye sore.  Yup!  It&#x27;s good to go.  Over 2600 reviewers agree.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. Set up instructions were easy to follow.  It is very easy to fill and I like the stop control button on the handle. The jet power is just right for blasting leftover food from between my teeth. I have had similar waterpiks before, but this one is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the quality of this machine.  It comes with many attachments that all store in the lid.  It has a dial for water pressure 1-10.  It also has a button on the flosser to start and stop the flow of water for mess free use.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  Easy to operate, convenient to store, many different uses ....including a tooth brush!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item retail from amazon at the recommendation of my dentist because I had some fairly serious gum disease.  I use this about every 1-3 days at night.  I purchased this item in May of 2012.  I wanted to write a good review on an item that has treated me well.&lt;br /&gt;It has performed without leaks, hiccups, manufacturing defecting, or issues of any kind.  I have used this item regularly for about 6 months.  I am happy with my purchase.  If I had to make a gripe, I would go so far as to say that the cord is a bit short.  Because of this, I can&#x27;t use this item in the shower, and when this the water pick is going full blast, there is quite a bit of what I would call \\&quot;collateral damage.\\&quot;  The water going full force, bouncing off of your teeth and gums will get on the sink, the mirror, the floor.  So I really would have wanted to be able to bring this item into the shower instead.  Even if it&#x27;s without the shower actually running.  However, I am sure there are shock/electrical issues involved in my gripe so I will let it go.  I will still give this item a full 5 stars because it hasn&#x27;t broken down/had any mechanical issues, and it does what is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> I bought the new model a couple months ago and it is much improved. The quietest one I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> If you do not like to floss, this can be part of a plan to floss a few times a week instead of twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still need to floss, even though this does part of the job of flossing.  The Waterpik still does not mechanically remove as much stuff as string floss, but it gets out a lot of stuff that brushing alone will not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY TIPS !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - hold the handle in your right hand, keep your left thumb on the on off switch.  the button on the handle is not that great. turn it off once your mouth gets full of water so you can spit out the water in peace.  this thing can be a real mess if you are not careful !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - remove the lid and throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - remove the tank after each use so the parts can dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - use this before you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 - install an under sink water filter so you can brush and water floss with clean water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 - start at a low power setting and move your way up as your gums get stronger.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BOUGHT 5-6 IN THE PAST 3 YEARS. YOU CAN RELY ON ON THE MOTOR.&lt;br /&gt;NOT ON THE PLASTIC TUBES. USE A LITTLE BRICOLAGE AND EXCANGE THE TUBES&lt;br /&gt;USE SALINE SERUM ( LIKE IN HOSPITALS) AND EXCHANGE THE TUBES.&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS. WHEN MADE IN THE USA EVEN THE PLASTIC TUBES LASTED...!!</li>
    <li> Product came perfectly packaged. It does work perfect. Come with different brushes so my husband with braces can use its own. I love it!</li>
    <li> I expected this product to eliminate the need to floss with string, but according to my dental hygienist,that is not the case.  So based on this, the product is not meeting my intended need.  Otherwise, it is fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Waterpik Ultra Water flosser for several years now, once in the morning and once at night.  It has become an essential and welcome part of my oral hygiene routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it took a little learning to figure out how to lean over the sink at enough of an angle to have the surplus water exiting my mouth splash down into the sink, rather than onto me or the vanity surface.  This is not difficult.  (People with low-back issues may want to rest their free hand on the edge of the sink for better support.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I floss the regular way first.  Then I use the Waterpik.  Then I brush.  As others have said, it&#x27;s really quite surprising how much additional crud the Waterpik washes out from your teeth and gums, even after flossing.  You can see the results immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance is minimal. Every 6 weeks, I run 2 tablespoons white vinegar with a full reservoir of hot water thru the machine; then flush with hot water.  (This routine was suggested to me by a Waterpik customer service rep.  And, by the way, that rep was very easy to reach by phone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My machine has 10 labelled settings (1 to 10) for intensity of the water jet.  I have some gum sensitivity, so I use the lowest setting, and it still works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is small.  I sometimes take it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> So, so loud.  It worked though.</li>
    <li> have been used it for days,i still use my floss,not sure it could completely replace the old way.the noise is more than i thought but ok.&lt;br /&gt;and not recommend to the ones whose washing table is small.it requires about 6*6 inches to place the device.&lt;br /&gt;mostly i only use the regular tip,it reaches all over my mouth,feel frash after use.</li>
    <li> Since ordering, I&#x27;ve used my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser twice daily.  Not only does it provide superior cleaning during a cleaning session, but my teeth retain that clean fresh feeling all day! Great investment for anyone dedicated to their overall oral health.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described.  Our dentist recommended using one of these, and since, using we have had much healthier teeth and gums.  Plus the dentist is very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Much better design than their prior model. Very happy with this new model. The coiled tube is an improvement, stores better in the base to avoid clutter on the counter.</li>
    <li> Just 2 weeks after intensive usage (2 times a day) ,  we can feel the different. Our gums become healtier, with brighter color. The tartar and plague are cleaned.</li>
    <li> I had an older model and could not find replacement heads.  This runs much quieter than my old one and does a great job</li>
    <li> However, I have recently moved and have a smaller bathroom. This waterpik takes up quite a bit of counter space.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this waterpik for about 5 months now, and I can&#x27;t believe how healthy my teeth and gums feel.  Went to see my dentist the other day for a regular cleaning and he didn&#x27;t say one negative thing about my teeth. All other times I&#x27;ve been to the dentist, I was told I had cavities and even the beginning stages of gum disease.  I only use this device once a day before I go to bed and my teeth always feel way cleaner than when I just brushed and flossed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a month or so old so it&#x27;s too soon to comment on reliability, but the plastic casing looks cheap. It performs it&#x27;s intended use so can&#x27;t complain. Included tips serve well. I like the coiled cord as it sits in place after use, making the unit look tidy. I wish to water receptacle could hold more such that refilling during use was not required. Overall, it&#x27;s a good starting model.</li>
    <li> I had used waterpiks in years past, and liked them fine, but this one is even better. As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve had some problems with bleeding gums. Since I hate traditional flossing I bought this as an alternative. After about a month of use my gums feel healthier and don&#x27;t bleed as easily. I&#x27;ve increased the power a bit but I&#x27;m still not at the top level. It feels great. I just returned from a 2 week road trip and the waterpik went with me. I really didn&#x27;t want to go 2 weeks without it now that I know what it can do and how great it feels..</li>
    <li> Previous Waterpiks I&#x27;ve had have been much more combersome and I&#x27;ve had to fiddle with them too much to really be worth it. This one is so simple and works great. The water pressure is perfect and the storage in the top is very efficient and out of the way. My teeth and gums feel clean and my mind feels organized.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my first WaterPik and I&#x27;m disappointed in that the water coming through the piks is not forceful enough to give the gums a really good massage while cleaning.  The water piks seem too fragile.  The water cord is too short and does not allow for one to stand up while cleaning.  One must bend over the sink and this becomes an uncomfortable position before one finishes. That said, I will continue nightly use of the WaterPik as part of my dental hygiene as well as my Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and really enjoying to use. The entire mouth feels excellent after each use.</li>
    <li> My waterpik of 6 years finally gave up the ghost.  After two handle replacements (complete with tubing), the motor finally died.  I really like the waterpik, and not only use it for cleaning between my teeth, but also use it to blast my tonsils.  With respect to performance, I&#x27;ll have to agree with James Cooper&#x27;s review (Nov. 2006), which is actually pretty funny, because I purchased my first waterpik in Sept. 2006.  The new 2012 waterpik I just purchased has even less pressure than my previous 2006 version.  I was on level six with my old unit.  With this unit, I am on level 9, just to obtain a comparable pressure.  The reduction in power is a disappointment, and unfortunately, I am not aware of any other appliances that can compete with the waterpik.  For those of you with older units that are operating at the higher levels, this new waterpik may be problematic.  Other than the reduced pressure (for which I award 4/5 stars), I am not having any other issues with the unit at this time.</li>
    <li> Performs great, many device options. Great buy. Would recommend to anyone wishing to have excellent dental hygiene. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my fiance in December 2011. She always hated traditional flossing as it can be painful and bloody. This was the perfect solution. She uses it every day and loves it. She&#x27;s worked up her tolerance to the highest setting now and couldn&#x27;t imagine life without it. I plan on getting myself one and recommend anyone who is interested to get one too!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Waterpik we&#x27;ve bought over the past 10 years. We just love using it.  Both my husband and I use the flosser daily as part of our oral health program; and, our dentist has complimented us on the great condition of our gums.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Water Pik.  Compared to my last Water Pik, which finally bit the dust after several years of service, this new device is quieter and more compact.  The on-off switch design and placement is also improved.  Overall, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> he was 110 volts. We did not know that it happens and it immediately burned .I really wish there was a warning about this</li>
    <li> This is a great item, and well worth the money. This does so much more cleaning than flossing. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few months. It took a little while to get used to it and use it without getting water everywhere, but it comes with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are able to adjust the water pressure (1-10) so you can start out low and work your way up if your gums are sensitive. I&#x27;ve flossed and then used the waterpik after to see if I missed anything, you may be surprised at what you find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a quiet machine, but it&#x27;s not obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a lot of extensions, I really only use the one standard one. I&#x27;ve tried the others, and I really don&#x27;t see the point, but they may come in handy one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a great investment for me, and personally found it to be a solid design and so far have not had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> My dentist loves these. It works great and is so handy I use it practically every time I eat something.</li>
    <li> Use this daily and I find it powerful and that it really cleans between my teeth.  Hopefully it is also doing a good job on my gums!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because of tight teeth causing floss to constantly break &amp; floss getting stuck in the tight teeth and food gets caught in the couple of teeth w/ large spacing. I was going through a lot of floss and toothpicks.  Much to my surprise, after using this for just over a year, my gums &amp; teeth have been progressively getting better.  At my last exam, last week, the hygienist once again, expressed surprise at how great my oral hygiene is.  She HAD to know my \\&quot;secret\\&quot; as my gums were getting better and almost NO PLAQUE on my teeth!!!  The Waterpik plus Colgate Optic  White tooth paste is giving me clean &amp; white teeth &amp; improving gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my mouth feel so good, that I brush &amp; \\&quot;waterpik\\&quot; more often, thus, further promoting good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these several years ago and have been using it faithfully.  My original one finally bit the dust and I just bought another one to replace it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a substitute for regular dental floss -- which I still use -- but my Waterpik makes my oral hygiene routine feel complete. There are several different attachments but I really use only a couple of them. It&#x27;s nice to have a choice, though.  I love my Waterpik and think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Had one of these many years ago. Old one  worked great. new one is even better,with a longer water connection hose and rotating head to control the spray. the variable water pressure is also a great feature.</li>
    <li> I was unable to use and had to return. Very sensitive gums from cancer - so worried it might do damage right now for me.&lt;br /&gt;Think it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement item. The previous one lasted about four years. The machine still worked, tube connection below the handle cracked and water was flowing from there instead of the nozzle.  This is indeed a weak point in the design. Other than that I would rate it at five stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much for writing long reviews but I&#x27;ve had this for a little while and it works well and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the sink. I don&#x27;t know if this is better than string flossing but it works for me. Shoots out all the gunk. I still do a string floss once in awhile just to make sure I&#x27;m covered. Who knew shooting water at your teeth could be so much fun lol</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is a great investment for oral hygiene.  It removes food particles between your teeth and below the gum line that regular floss can&#x27;t reach.  I add either mouthwash or peroxide to the water in the tank to increase the antibacterial action.  Highly effective.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is the third one I have bought and we absolutely love them!  They are easy to use, work very very well, and have made a BIG difference at the dentist.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love the water splashing everywhere but perhaps I&#x27;ll get used to it eventually. Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, however.</li>
    <li> I have been using 3 models for the last 4 years. All made are made in China.&lt;br /&gt;It is so good and I just buy this one to help my gf to improve her health.&lt;br /&gt;I trust waterpik. And never thinking about switching to other brand.</li>
    <li> I had one of these about 30 years ago--it worked, but not so well.  This one has enough force to copletely eliminate the need to floss.  It seems to be well made and I have no complaints at all.  Amazon has the best price I found and they are one of the best companies on the planet.</li>
    <li> We love this waterpik and see the difference of just brushing our teeth and brushing our teeth and using the waterpik also. We have been using this product for roughly four months now and found that the casing that keeps the other heads smells over time. This gets annoying and wished something can be down about this. IT does have holes on top for breathing but it isn&#x27;t enough. I love putting mouthwash instead of water, its like killing two birds in one stone.</li>
    <li> This water flosser was the one I picked from the reviews I read and the needs I needed to be met. i didn&#x27;t want anything super complicated and I wanted something that was not so big. This one also has 10 settings on the pressure of the water, like 6 different interchangeable heads and a case to hold the heads on the top of unit, its a good one.</li>
    <li> This thing seems to work fine but it really takes a long time to wash my car. Also the pressure isn&#x27;t strong enough to get the tires real clean either. It does do a great job on my teeth though</li>
    <li> I recently got braces as an adult. Never having them before, I had no idea how cumbersome the flossing process would be (I mean, I anticipated SOME adjustment, but it just takes too long to be practical). I purchased this device upon recommendation from a hygienist that gave my dental school class a lecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Waterpik. I feel that it does a great job removing large debris interproximally, and, in conjunction with my Sonicare, a very good job at removing sources of bacterial growth/proliferation. I use the device at its maximum pressure setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I purchased a model with a large water reservoir because I use every bit of it. There&#x27;s a wireless model out with a smaller water reservoir, but I&#x27;m glad that I have this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think that Waterpik/Sonicare (or any other electric toothbrush) combination does a good job for me during my orthodontic treatment, I still use regular floss occasionally. I just feel like I should.</li>
    <li> Waterpik seems to do its job except it trips my GFCI circuit breaker every time the unit is turned off.  No other devices that use this GFCI cause the breaker to trip so it must be a defective Waterpik.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I like the pik a lot leaves teeeth and gum feeling nice.Takes a little getting use to. Not a big issue. Would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Have had a waterpik in the past. Following many years of use, it needed replacing. Thought I would save some money. Bought an Interplak unit. Never really provided the success I had with the Waterpik. Water pressure not sufficient. Water did not always flow. Would often have to apply suction on the tip (by sucking on it) to start flow. Decided to go back to a Waterpik. Have been using daily for the past month. No comparison. Great pressure. Knob at base of tip allows one to easily change flow direction as one cleans the different surfaces of teeth and mouth. Compact. No leakage. Controls clearly accessible. Storage for extra tips convenient. Hose recoils easily when finished using. Price is right. Yes, I highly recommend this unit. As does my dentist, especially for my somewhat spongy gums. I usually do not get involved with these reviews, but the design and effectiveness of this item is worthy of praise.</li>
    <li> Good value. I recommend it. It has adjustable pressure and extra tips included.&lt;br /&gt;You can swivel the tip as you use it to get at all the surfaces.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this water flosser every day and I know it works because my 6 month dental checkups are a bit easier!!!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommend me getting something like this since I am not a every day flosser.  I love this and can&#x27;t wait to see the results when I go back to the dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought  this waterpik to get raid of food particles and build up plague from around my gum line. I used my water pik 2 times day to make sure no food reamains around by gum lines. I also put some peroxide in my water pix with some water and wash around my gum line with it. The water pik has a setting from 1-10, I usually set mines on 8. It come&#x27;s 5 attachment pieces, 1 to brush your teeth, a tongue scrapper, one for if you have bracers, one to clean between the gum line and another tooth brush to get in between your teeth. I just love my pik and would not give it up for anyhting in this world and it keeps my gum line healthy. I would recommend this to anybody who wants to improve their oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this water pik is that it cleans around the gum very good, you wouldn&#x27;t believe all the dirt that was still on your teeth after you already had brushed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con about this water pik is that it makes alot of noises. So if you live with other people you will clean your teeth at a reasonable time because this thing can wake somebody up. It is just a loud and noisey little machine.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. Anyone who wants to keep there mouth nice and clean without having to floss this is what you need!!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Has great flow and pressure.  Gets food out of teeth, but also able to use on lowest setting to remove wax from ears.</li>
    <li> and just about as small, so I take this when I travel. and my gums are soooo imp;roved buy using this product nightly as least and twice a day is even better</li>
    <li> About a month ago, I saw a dentist (for the first time in ~5 years - no insurance) on an emergency basis to replace a filling that had fallen out. At that visit, he told me he was concerned about my oral health, given that my gums were sensitive and bleeding during the filling replacement. Admittedly, I hadn&#x27;t been flossing regularly because my teeth are very close together in some places, and regular floss &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; and cuts my gums. The dentist recommended I try a Waterpik and come in for an evaluation in a few weeks. Needless to say, I was a little unnerved by this assessment and bought the Waterpik that afternoon. I have been flossing with the Waterpik everyday 1-2 times a day since then. Last week, I had my follow up, and the dentist said my teeth and gums looked perfectly healthy. I think the addition of the Waterpik to my oral health routine probably saved me some hefty dental bills.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 75 and have lost a good number of teeth. If I had bought and used this years ago I firmly believe that I wouldn&#x27;t have lost a one. Young or old, if you still have a tooth in your head, get this Waterpik and use it every day (once a day seems sufficient). For me brushing and flossing and Listerine are necessary but just aren&#x27;t enough. I mix a little Listerine in with the water in the reservoir and accomplish two things at once. Gum disease, especially in later life is worse than cavities. Get a Waterpik!</li>
    <li> I have the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for a couple of months now and it work greats. I have it set to number 6 and that is more then enough power I could only imagine what it would be like on 10.</li>
    <li> this is a replacement for a waterpik machine that I had for many years. It functions well - the only thing i would change is to give it more force. I set it at the highest setting and wish it could be set a bit higher.</li>
    <li> This is great working tool , I got it for my wife at Christmas and she is extremely happy and uses it all the time .</li>
    <li> Worked well at first. After one year the rubber gasket has worn out and won&#x27;t hold water in reservoir.</li>
    <li> We had one before but left it with a friend when traveling.  I have crowns i&lt;br /&gt;On my teeth and it requires daily cleaning of the gum.  This is the best product I have used so far!</li>
    <li> Just received it, tried it...LOVE IT!  I purchased this older version as opposed to the newer one, because of the reviews.  Nice to know its a solid product with great reviews.  I am looking forward to using it with three drops of colloidal silver (see NutraSilver) as I know it will be a dynamite one-two punch in keeping my gums perfect!  You will see my review on NutraSilver, and no....I don&#x27;t get a penny or free product, its just the best colloidal silver I have ever used and it has had amazing results on my gums.</li>
    <li> I sounded about this product, and when I use I can discover a good product. Now I love it. The price it is ok . In Walmark is cheaper</li>
    <li> If you are like me and have found you have to floss twice a day to grab the stuff that accumulates between your teeth that brushing does not reach, you might want to consider the WaterPik.  I had never used one before this year, but am now a steady twice a day user. It is quick, effective, and pleasant.  It leaves my mouth feeling remarkably clean - so clean that I notice the difference.  I can see the particles coming out with the water.  So why is it not for everyone?  It forces a stream of water into the crevices between and around your teeth, using a cup or two of water.  What goes into your mouth must come out again, so you have to bend over the sink.  It could get messy.  What I do is to completely close my lips around the mouthpiece, letting the water out at intervals, much as one might do with a mouthwash.  It is easy to manage that way.  I set the spray up fairly high (8 out of 10) and it takes a minute or two to do a thorough job.  I am totally hooked.</li>
    <li> I have braces and the water flosser cleans out enough food from my braces to have another meal.  Amazing how much comes out when I use this.  My orthodontist technician said she wished everyone had as good dental hygiene as I do.  So it works!!!</li>
    <li> The tank holds an ample amount of water to clean all of your teeth.  I expecially like the ability to turn the water off to the wand with your thumb.  This is done with the switch right on the want.  Keeps you from spraying water everywhere if you need to talk or change sides of your mouth.  The water jet is adjustable from low to high.  I prefer to use on high.  The pik has more than ample power.</li>
    <li> Could have been 4 stars, I guess.  It works pretty good at cleaning the gum line.  The Flosser is light and leaks if you don&#x27;t put the tip in exactly right.  It&#x27;s all plastic and makes a little noise, BUT it does what it is supposed to do.  So far it works just fine, and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> Good value y does the job.</li>
    <li> this is the best &#x27;upgrade&#x27; to my dental habits I have ever done.</li>
    <li> My hygienist said if I would waterpik daily it would eliminate the need to floss...which I hate doing!  She was right...and she is much happier now to clean my teeth then she was before!  JG</li>
    <li> No matter how often or how hard I brushed and flossed my teeth , this amazing little thing found particles of food stuck in between my teeth and got it out, made my mouth feeling very fresh and crispy clean . An investment that is worth every penny .</li>
    <li> Very clean gums with this product for a healthy mouth, I like it.</li>
    <li> Messy until you get the hang of it, but effective. I brush my teeth and floss regularly, something to do not just with hygiene but with a horrible fear of losing my teeth. I was appalled at the gunk still getting washed out by my Waterpik. But thank God it is now getting washed out!</li>
    <li> On my dentist&#x27;s suggestion, I purchased the Waterpik to improve the health of my teesth and gums. With the varied piks I can focus on the areas of concern. Easy to use and powereful enough to reach areas where brushing and floss may miss, the Waterpik is the answer.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik. This made a difference my dental hygienist noticed.</li>
    <li> I really like the Water Flosser and I am amazed at what I get out after I have brushed and flossed.</li>
    <li> Changed my life. Easy and fast to use. You actually see the stuff come out of your teeth and was away into the sink, even after you brush or floss. Works much better than string floss. I think everyone should have one if these. The unit doesn&#x27;t look very sleek, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. WORKS PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected</li>
    <li> It is great.  Like that it takes up less room on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Heavy construction makes this unit feel solid.  Quality, VERY QUIET compared to my previous irrigation device.  Reasonable small footprint on my counter.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This model replaced an older one w/ a more rectangular tank that flipped over to cover / store it.  I LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCH MORE:  the lid holds the attachments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that coiled up cord:  while it could be a little bit longer, it practically puts itself away with this models new design.  It hooks in like a hand held shower.  The most help it needs now is maybe pushing the coil back 1/2 an inch so it slips into it&#x27;s nesting spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 *&#x27;s IF there was a nasal irrigation tip available. I checked with the company. I was able it modify the Braces cleaning tip (removing it) and slipping the Grossan tip onto the end instead.  That is the work around. Details of that are in my review of that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old one - it is MUCH quieter.  I have to chuckle tho when people comment about the noise on any electrical appliance - they ARE machines - so you have to expect SOME noise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the rest of the community pretty well covers the rest of it.  (Totally agree on the tongue cleaner being pretty silly.  More veggies - less starch helps that too.)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, nice pik for the $$  oh what a lovely bunch of coconuts, i have a lovely bunch of coconuts......</li>
    <li> I was quite hesitant about this product - it&#x27;s just water! But this things really works! Buy it if you find traditional floss a bit hard to use - but you probably don&#x27;t need this deluxe version unless you have braces!</li>
    <li> Worked very well but did not last. First thing that went was the little on/off button on the handle. That was after about 12-15 months. Next was the water hose from the unit to the handle. It cracked in half. Great idea, needs better plastics.</li>
    <li> After a few months use started leaking</li>
    <li> I bought this for the wife as a christmas gift and i think its her favorite gift. She uses this unit a couple times a day. Hold plenty of water and has grear water preasure. If you looking for a waterpik i dont see any downside to this one.</li>
    <li> My husband was bugging me for months to get one of these from the dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  I was reluctant to buy it since I did not want another piece of equipment on the bathroom counter.  I was so extremely impressed with the performance that I also bought a portable one since I travel all the time.  The cordless one is not the greatest, but once you get used to using a waterpik, your teeth don&#x27;t feel clean without it.  I am a very good tooth brusher since I use a sonicare (also love), but it is amazing that particles will still come out when using the waterpik.  This is a great device even if you are a good tooth brusher and flosser.</li>
    <li> Made a HUGE improvement on the health of my gums.  Now I only have to have my teeth cleaned twice a year instead of three or four times.  This is my second one.  I wore my first one out.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is probably the fourth Waterpik I have owned. I use it in conjunction with flossing and brushing. It does a very good job of loosening food particles in between and around the teeth. In less than a year after I first bought it, however, the bracket holding the handle cracked. I imagine this could be remedied by a different design. There is a warranty and the company replaced it. It also seems to be very noisy. My bathroom is next to the bedroom and I can&#x27;t use the Waterpik if my partner is already asleep.</li>
    <li> First I loved the pressure of the water. But it was loud and I didn&#x27;t like that you have to hold the button to stop the water!! I keep turning it on and it starts spraying! I wish you pushed the button to spray!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it. Everyone should try it. My Hygenist recommended it to me and I have been using it ever since. Great for cleaning between teeth and under gums. Highly recommend it. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because they said it was quiet and mine is very loud.</li>
    <li> I have not yet had this a year. The cord is impossible. Two kinks have developed that obstruct the flow of the water. The cord is unwieldy and gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;When it works, it works well; the cord is a major design flaw that should have been caught before this model went on the market.</li>
    <li> I started NOT to write a review on this item because there really isn&#x27;t much to say. It does the job! It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This thing makes it so easy to get all of the crud out of your teeth and gums. I enjoy using it and its great that I no longer have to reach my fat fingers into the back of my mouth to try and keep my gums healthy. I use it every day and have seen great results.</li>
    <li> This thing over the course of 3 months have helped my teeth change at least 3 shades of color.  They&#x27;re not sparkling white yet, but I have a cleaning Monday, and I&#x27;m sure that will put me over the top.  I&#x27;m also curious to see if this is helping or damaging my gum line, as I&#x27;ve read both sides of the story.  I only keep the power on 5 out of 10, and it blasts broccolli out of my teeth quicker and less painfully than when using a piece of dental floss.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the water flosser. I like it it is so updated form the original water pick. Best water pick product.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the &amp;#34;purchase process&amp;#34;, but not so much with the actual product.  I&#x27;ve never used a &amp;#34;water flosser&amp;#34; before, seems like it&#x27;s a mess.  I know it will take some getting use to. I&#x27;m unsure if this was a smart buy.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Great invention.  It is very convenient; easy to use.  Kids also love using their own flosser.  It is better than the mechanical flosser</li>
    <li> Our family has used these for years.  We have never had any problems with them, and our dentist says that our periodontal health is now the best he&#x27;s ever seen it.  He did give us one caution:  don&#x27;t skip brushing just because you&#x27;ve used a Waterpik:  the brush and toothpaste also have an important role to play (gum massage;  surface polishing;  pH adjustment;  fluoride treatment;  etc.).  Since my wife and I are on Medicare (i.e., no dental coverage), and since my wife has had osteoporosis treatment (i.e., dental implants no longer advisable), maintaining good dental hygiene is extremely important, and I am so thankful we have these devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something Waterpik doesn&#x27;t mention:  their units will trip some GFIs (and if you&#x27;re using the unit in the bathroom then all outlets should be GFI-protected).  Solution:  a cheap surge-protector cube (around $7 from Radio Shack, I seem to remember).  I&#x27;ve had no trouble since.</li>
    <li> For the price, it does a good job.  Very easy to use and maintain.  Would recommend to anyone who uses a water flosser.</li>
    <li> this is really a good product....i just don&#x27;t find the time to use it enough...after brushing over 2 minutes and mouth wash over 1 minute twice a day you just want to get on with ur day ha</li>
    <li> I choose this item because I like waterpik products and it did not let me down.  I use it a lot and it does an excellent job.  I would definitely recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. I use it every morning and night. it helps flush out the food particles that my manual toothbrush can&#x27;t clean out. it is easier to use than the thread floss.</li>
    <li> I have had this about two weeks now and it is still going HAM. It took a smooth week to get real comfortable with it and get my gums up to shape with out bleeding like a was a spartan fighting the GD Persians. Definitely makes flossing more bearable too. Buy dis yo.</li>
    <li> So much better than regular flossing I finally feel like I am getting a deep clean every morning and evening and its so convenient!</li>
    <li> Oh YES, this Waterpik rescued me from the pain I was getting in my gums for years!  It has so many different tips to do so many different things for my aching gums.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the battery operated one.  This Waterpik offers a variety of settings.  I love this Waterpik, I just wish I found out about this one sooner.  It&#x27;ll save you $$$ from going to the dentist!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for about a month and I&#x27;ve notice twice that tartar has started to build in a loose space between my teeth. After the second time, I decided to use floss just after using the Water Flosser. What I found were some big globs of plaque/tarter between some of the back teeth. I don&#x27;t know where Waterpik gets their statistics, but so far, I am very disappointed. I thought this was supposed to be easier to use and more effective than floss. That&#x27;s not what 1 month of experience tells me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual is typical of modern Waterpik appliances (I&#x27;ve tried their electric toothbrush too). It is nice to look at, but doesn&#x27;t tell you much useful information. For instance:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t tell you that the effectiveness of the flosser is severely diminished if you use less than medium pressure. You can only get this information by look online at Waterpik&#x27;s site for Professionals.&lt;br /&gt;2. It also doesn&#x27;t tell you that you can only use the flosser for 5 minutes within any 2 hour period. Otherwise, you risk overheating the motor and reducing its life. If everyone flosses at night, you&#x27;d need one of these for everyone (so wasteful). You can only get this information if you look at the sticker found at the bottom of the appliance. Somehow, I don&#x27;t think many people will every look there. I did it only by chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think people who don&#x27;t floss are more likely to use this product since it takes such little time and makes my mouth feel clean, but it is not more effective than regular floss. Also this product works well to clean metal work in the mouth such as braces or wires on your teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in Dec 2009 and used it over the past 3 years until I managed to put a hole in the nozzle.  Using this product helped my poor gums and made my dental checkups go easier on me.  I kept it on my bathroom vanity so it was there to use, just needed to fill with water and plug it in.</li>
    <li> I had a 1980&#x27;s model Waterpik. I like the design of the new one better.&lt;br /&gt;I preferred the old model water pressure, higher on the high setting.</li>
    <li> i know this sounds strange but i ordered this product from amazon because i have a ear problem of wax and fluid ive had for years after years of cotton ear drops rubbing alcohol painful doctor visits nothing worked i had seen the ear vac commercial on tv had some doubts researched amazom reviews bingo one customers daughter had the same problem and said a water pik worked and explained how to use i purchased the water pik from amazon who ive never had a problem with and its great the item is perfect for storage much quieter and has different tips so it can be used for the ear problem and for teeth especially if u dont have dental insurance for ear prob i just fill the device with warm water and adjust the settings to spray the water in-dont put tip in ear- and the warm water and pressure breaks up any wax buildup so pleased amazon has this item and for the other customer who suggested it best investment ever made and glad amazon had it thanks again amazon what a great company and this product is definately worth getting</li>
    <li> Works as described. I bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser with all 6 tips. They have a slot for all but two. So those two just rattle around in the container on top of the machine when I move it and fall out when I open it. (I have a different solution for my tips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself works fine on getting out the grime. Wish the reservoir were larger for a longer session without refills.However, I do enjoy its current compact size for storage.</li>
    <li> At my last dentist appointment I was scolded for not flossing and told that my gums were in really bad shape. I floored the hygenist when I told her I floss extensively every. single. day. They gave me all sorts of recommendations and I have followed none of them, You see, I have been dealing with poor gum health for years and nothing they have told me has worked. So I&#x27;ve taken matters into my own hands. I started oil pulling, which has GREATLY improved my oral health. I also bought this water flosser. My husband thought it was kinda goofy, and it&#x27;s a little awkward on the first try, but I&#x27;m really enjoying it now that I&#x27;m getting used to it. Using lukewarm water is a must to prevent irritating sensitive spots, but it powers out any debris in between your teeth and I am loving the gum massage. There will be no more flossing for this girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, other reviews mention the noise. It is a bit noisy, but nothing crazy. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much louder than my sonicaire toothbrush. I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity because I just got it, but it seems durable enough. It does take up a bit of counter space, so be sure you have the room for it somewhere. A pedestal sink would not work.</li>
    <li> The first one lasted forever, actually at least 10 yrs but was not used consistently.  The 2nd one lasted only 3 years and was used consistently.  The hose finally started to leak.  This one is fine but it causes a static sound if the radio is on.  I have both appliances plugged into the same outlet.  The others didn&#x27;t do that.  And the pressure doesn&#x27;t seem as strong which might be on purpose.  I think I&#x27;ve irritated my gums by setting the pressure too high in the past.  In the end, my dentist is happy with the results and that is what counts.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great product fill it up and let the waterpik do the flossing for you.  Only con is that it leaks ocasionally but it is not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> If I had a list of some of the greatest inventions ever made, this would be among the top five on my list.  I used to have really bad oral health-- particularly my gums bled a lot when I brushed.  This is mainly due to the fact I am really bad when it comes to daily flossing and my dad&#x27;s side of the family has a history of bad teeth.  Then my dentist recommended I buy this product.  The Waterpik is fast and super easy to use. I think it takes less than 30 seconds to clean my teeth.  Ever since I started using this just once per day, my gums stopped bleeding.  When I go in for a checkup and teeth cleaning every 4 months, every thing turns out fine.  My only regret was I wish someone introduced this product to me when I was a kid.  Seriously, everyone should get this product.  It will save you a lot on your dental bills and maybe even some teeth!</li>
    <li> great product,waiting get another one! Every should get one.It feels like you just got back from the Dentist.Waterpik really hit a home run with this.</li>
    <li> Works As Advertised. I&#x27;ve been very impressed by this machine. And I recommend it to anyone looking to have a healthier mouth.</li>
    <li> -quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;-excellent quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wanted one of these waterpick water flossers with larger tanks.  I figure rather than spending so much money at dentist, might as well investin in a Waterpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my constant traveling schedules years back, I bought a portable Waterpik, but it was just not holding enough water to be effective.  The water stream is kind of weak, and I gotta refill it so many times during one session.  As a result I stopped using the portable Waterpik.  This one can hold way more water and has the option to have stronger stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design alot.  With a holder in the middle and the cap on top that also serves as a case for interchangeable tips.  I use it with my Philips electric tooth brush.  Now my teeth feels super clean! I just can&#x27;t wait to use it every night!</li>
    <li> Does the job..  Great product!!  The only draw back is the top lid won&#x27;t accept all the picks! ........  Buy it..</li>
    <li> Wonderful! How my husband and I lived without using one of these, (actually, 2 of these, as we have one each!) is such a shame! It makes teeth cleaner, gums cleaner and leaves the mouth feeling totally refreshed! Take note of the difference between flossing and using this machine! Flossing doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore!! Well, it has its place, but needs this water machine to finish off the job properly.</li>
    <li> Using this daily helps to keep our teeth clean. We just had our cleaning with the dentist and since we&#x27;ve been using this, our teeth keep that just from the dentist clean. I do floss also with this about once a week to see how well this is keeping my teeth clean and it does live up to its expectations and does live up to doing better than floss. I like that the tools are all held in the case that sits on top of the reservoir. The reservoir is easy to fill and keep clean. A good investment in keeping healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I have owned.  Both prior ones are non-working due to the same problem.  The tubing from the pump to the handheld head eventually cracks from usage and is not designed to be replaceable.  I tried fixing the first one, unsuccessfully -- now I just figure it&#x27;s easier to buy a new one.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good for a year or two... I would happily pay more for a more durable product.</li>
    <li> This is a loaded gun! You can save yourself or hurt yourself depending on how you use. Dentist strongly advised to use it only under lowest setting. Using at higher setting will damage gums and teeth in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also physical flossing shouldn&#x27;t be stopped as per Dentists. This is a complement and no way a substitute of physical flossing if you use under recommended setting.  The medically recommended way is to physically floss and then use this at lowest setting - in that case it works great!  (per Dentists and tested) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall a good product but wrongly placed, marketed and advertised. Probably one of those companies where scientists did a great job, but then hired some old car salesmen to devise a marketing and product placement strategy!</li>
    <li> I hate, hate, hate using dental floss.  This is a great alternative, but yes your dentist will probably tell you to do both.  I use it twice a day and don&#x27;t seem to have any build-up.  In 6 months we&#x27;ll see what the dentist says.</li>
    <li> I use this Waterpik all the time, it&#x27;s much better than using dental floss, it does a great job of cleaning between your teeth and making your gums feel great, I bought this item because my dentist recommended it.  Yes, I would recommend this item</li>
    <li> I bought this water flosser on the advice of my dentist, and used a $5.00 rebate from his office too.  It actually came with six different tools, one more than there is room for even, and includes a tongue cleaner, deep pocket pik, a regular jet-style tool. and others.  I like how you can vary the intensity of the water, and I quickly found the level I like best (pretty intense).  I never though I would actually ENJOY cleaning my teeth, but it&#x27;s true.  It feels really good, cleans my teeth well, and has actually encouraged me to use it every night, not like regular floss from which I would take &amp;#34;floss vacations&amp;#34; whenever I was tired or didn&#x27;t feel like flossing.  I think the Water Pik is actually faster than flossing.  Get it, you&#x27;ll really like it, and your dentist will definitely approve!</li>
    <li> Although a bit awkward to use at first,once I got the hang of using it,the Waterpik does a good job of rmoving debris and stimulating my gums.  I like the other tios that are included. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is a great product - I  love using it!  I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> worth the price....i am ticked that an opinion needs this much trouble  this is the last rating I&#x60;ll make. shove it</li>
    <li> This flosser is simple to set up and easy to use.  It has variable control so you can soften the pulse for tender gum tissue.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and would recommend to anyone with teeth!!</li>
    <li> This water flosser was purchased to replace an earlier unit that finally failed after over a decade of use. The improvement in this model over my former one is very noticeable, being quieter and, I think, more attractive due to the blue and white coloration. The power setting for the pulses is now on the body of the unit as opposed to on the handle of the pik in the previous model, putting less strain on the tubing, which was the part that failed on the older machine. I think the unit could be improved if a toothbrush holder were incorporated into the body, perhaps as simple as a ring, which would hold the brush upright alongside the unit. This system comes with several ancillary tips that would be useful for those with braces or other oral appliances. If more than one user is likely, be sure to purchase additional standard tips, which are easily switched at the time of use. A good system.</li>
    <li> This replaces my previous waterpic.  Much quieter, more compact and easier to use especially on back teeth so I&#x27;ll use&lt;br /&gt;it in place of string floss.  It is better than my expectations and I&#x27;m looking forward to my next dental checkup.</li>
    <li> Real good pressure on this one. And a big enough water tank to get the job done. this is my second one of this brand and style and when this one goes belly up, I will get another.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed that they sent the attachment for braces rather then the tongue cleaner. I think it would be nice to be able to pick one or the other when ordering.</li>
    <li> it replaced one of the same model  I have the larger model which I don&#x27;t like  this one is much lighter and easy to use</li>
    <li> Lighter than the old unit and work well so far without any issue.&lt;br /&gt;Although, Costco sometimes havs a better deal for the combo.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve all started using this product and love it.  I feel that my teeth are so much cleaner!  My boys who wear braces love using it....although you can&#x27;t be too picky about water shooting out all over your bathroom.  I recommend this product for anyone who wants that extra clean feeling at a good price!</li>
    <li> very good product.  Began using it every night before bed. Its a lot better than regular flossing. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife is a busy mom with three kids and recently got braces.&lt;br /&gt;I quote &amp;#34; this sure saves me time flossing.I would recommend it to others&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this flosser.  I was told I could add  mouthwash in with the water so I tried it. It makes my mouth feel not only clean from the flossing but fresh from the mouthwash.  I love it.  Using it every night at bedtime, it has become addictive.  At least it&#x27;s a good addiction.</li>
    <li> I use the Ultra Water Flosser twice daily and feel that it does a great job of cleaning between the teeth and around the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cordless Water Pik Flosser before this, but I like this better because of the larger water capacity and it is easier to use because it is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  would recommend it based on one months use.</li>
    <li> I use the Waterpik flosser at the end of the day, usually without brushing.  I brush in the morning.  I have two bridges, one on my lower front 4 teeth and one on the left side of my upper teeth.  When I flossed before I got the bridges, I did not mind doing so.  After getting the 2nd bridge, flossing became a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik is so easy to use, and I do notice that it does a better job on my lower front teeth.  I use the Waterpik at full force on these lower front teeth because that is where I have the worst tartar problem.  I still floss about every two or three days in the morning.  With the combination of the two methods, I have very little tartar problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like my Waterpik Ultra Flosser.  I never tried any other water floss machine, but I do really like this one because the water pressure can be varied a lot.  I think I read that some water flossers have no adjustment of the water pressure.</li>
    <li> This device is a must to have!!! I was recommended this device by my dentist because of a gum pocket discovered.  After purchasing and using all the attachments I needed daily I feel as though I have received a professional teeth cleaning. It&#x27;s a wonder to see all the food partials left in your mouth even after you have brushed your teeth. The Waterpik helps to remove it all!! A must to have!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first time water flossing and I wish I had thought of this years ago! I love it. The machine works really well and is easy to use. The design is great for cleanliness and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no mess, quieter than Waterpiks of the past.  Probably doesn&#x27;t need higher end settings.  I keep mine at 7 and that is plenty of pressure.  Used it about a dozen times and, so far, am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before bed.  I normally hate flossing with string but this makes me a whole lot more willing.  I think it works just as good as using the string and does remove things between the teeth pretty well.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra is definitely a great buy. Although I only got it about a month ago it is more than I expected with the inclusion of the various tips especially the one with the brush on the end. The adjustable speed is a real plus and it has good power like a mini power washer. The reservoir is a good size that offers enough time to floss between all your teeth a few times before it empties leaving you with a fresh breath. Very convenient and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Rouse from Barbados</li>
    <li> I bought this WaterPik 46 months ago. I am here looking at them because the plastic bracket that holds the handheld irrigator piece has a crack and I thought I would get a new one. It&#x27;s probably got a couple more months of life, but I do not want to be without one and know it will finally snap one day and then I will have to buy one locally. I don&#x27;t think we will be able to use it once this piece breaks. The water would run down the hose and out unless it&#x27;s held up. That&#x27;s the job of the plastic holder thingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I use this daily. It works great and is durable. Plastic parts get brittle and crack and break over time, so I am not having much heartburn at all thinking we got 4 years out of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints on this item. I am impressed that it&#x27;s actually $5.51 cheaper right now than in was in 2009. 3 cents a day. Not bad, not bad at all.</li>
    <li> love but only certain times.&lt;br /&gt;its not for me for every day use but i can see how it works for others.&lt;br /&gt;if you go to the dentist and dont like flossing this works</li>
    <li> Never will have to use string floss again.  This is powerful enough to get all of the debris that is stuck between my teeth.  Regular floss gets stuck and I usually wind up ripping it out of my mouth.</li>
    <li> I recently got braces, and read around about how hard it is to properly floss, and what a pain it is. Almost everyone recommended a waterpic. I can see why now that I have one. It makes keeping my braces clean really easy actually.  If you have braces, get one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it, so I got it, and I am very pleased. The  water in the tank does not last that long, but you have to put fresh water in it almost every time, but that is the only drawback. Even after brushing, stuff still comes put from between your teeth. I was surprised.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a waterpik to help clean below the gum line and around dental work. This does that and more. This waterpik makes my teeth feel like I just had a dental cleaning,....everyday. I like to add a cap full of mouthwash to the reservoir and sometimes I will add a bit of peroxide as well. You have to be careful though or you will wind up squirting yourself  or the bathroom wall if you don&#x27;t pay attention to the button and where you have the wand pointed. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very well and it really will help keep your teeth and gums healthy if used regularly. Perfect to use if you have crowns, bridges, or braces.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping...I love this water flosser!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hygienist so I bought it. My teeth are so tightly spaced even floss is tough to get in between so she recommended this product. It&#x27;s messy as heck and empties faster the higher the setting. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to though so the other stuff you just need to deal with and not be a whiny baby.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 - one for me and one for my husband. I love it but it is only good if you use it.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product.  It works very well as expected.  Two heads make it easy to share.</li>
    <li> Quit working after 4 months.</li>
    <li> Since purchase I&#x27;ve had a cleaning and saw my dentist.  He said he has seen improvement and to keep it up.  Love the Flosser.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stop using it. I love feeling the water flow through my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a great machine and so glad I bought it... I love how my mouth feels so clean after I have used it.</li>
    <li> JUST AS EXPECTED.  IT CLEAN MY TEETH EFFECTIVELY</li>
    <li> My gums have never felt better.  Love the Water Pik flosser.</li>
    <li> Leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> I love my water pic i use every day it gets around crowns and bridges and cleans out ant thing that still may be in there after brushing,</li>
    <li> The dental hygienist said my teeth stay so much more free of plaque since I started using my water pic.</li>
    <li> This item I use often to maintain healthy gums and clean teeth.  Use it with hydrogen peroxide as a rinse and with a good mouth wash, your mouth will feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a Waterpik that I used for well over 8 years.  The switch went out on the old one and I bypassed it but felt it was time to replace with a newer one and I was right.  This one has far more power and hold more water.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I began using a Waterpik in the mid 1980s upon the advice of my orthodontist.  That unit came with one basic, classic pik which worked fine.  The pressure setting on that machine was plenty strong enough if set at three or four.  Much more than that was too high pressure for me.  That old unit had a compact design with a slim profile, too, so it took up less space than this \\&quot;Ultra Water Flosser,\\&quot; and it possessed a modicum of simple elegance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After twenty plus years, my old Waterpik finally died.  I read rave reviews about this model on Amazon.  Amazon reviewers can usually be trusted to tell the good, the bad, and the ugly.  The good reviews of this model were plentiful, so I bought it.  I used it for the first time today, and I must say I am extremely disappointed in it.  Below are the pros and cons from my viewpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)  With the pressure setting set to ten, this unit is better than nothing but not much.  It will help flush out larger food particles from between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)  This unit is far too large and takes up far more than its fair share of space on the vanity and even in the&lt;br /&gt;cupboard below.  It&#x27;s large, bulky design has absolutely no sense of elegance to it.  Steve Jobs and Apple brought the concept of sleek elegant design (some even say sexy) to computers and other electronics and made a fortune.  Waterpik seems to be going in the exact OPPOSITE direction.  Big, bulky, and ugly are the only words to describe this unit.  It is a space hog with no visual appeal whatsoever.  It reminds me of what those old office adding machines look like in comparison to a hand held calculator that uses a microchip.  The old adding machines were big, bulky, and took up a lot of room on a desk top, but the new calculators took up the merest corner of the desk top and slipped easily into a lap drawer whence not in use.  Whilst everyone else has been pursuing smaller size and a more elegant profile over the last forty years or more, Waterpik seems to be opting for ungainly bulkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)  The plastic feels positively flimsy compared to my old Waterpik.  Waterpik customer service told me this is because the plastic in this unit is more readily biodegradable than the old type of plastic.  The woman said new laws prevent them from using the old type of plastic.  I am in favour of anything that helps the environment, but this still feels as though this plastic will not hold up for very many years.  The box says Made In China, and everything about this unit definitely shouts VERY CHEAPLY MADE IN CHINA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3)  The extra specialised tips do not seem to be of any real value.  They are nothing more than bells and whistles that the manufacturer uses to justify charging more money for the product.  The classic tip is all anyone needs, and I vouchsafe this statement based on the fact that I wore braces for five years.  All I ever used for more than twenty years was the basic, classic tip, and I have always had excellent dental check-ups even during the five years I wore braces.  Moreover, although I am a very experienced Waterpik user, I flooded my vanity trying these specialised tips.  To use these specialised tips, one has to look into the mirror to see what one is doing.  Looking into the mirror means raising one&#x27;s head to mirror height.  Raising one&#x27;s head to mirror height whilst using these specialised tips causes water to go absolutely everywhere.  I did not have this problem even the first time I used the old model with just the basic, classic tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4)  The water pressure on this unit is NOT the same as the old model I used for twenty years.  As another reviewer commented, and I heartily agree, the old model had plenty of pressure set at three or four.  This model has to be turned up to ten to approach the pressure of the old model set at three or four.  Even set at ten, it does not feel strong enough to me, and it certainly is not equal tomy old Waterpik&#x27;s pressure set at ten.  Waterpik customer service told me that they had a bad batch of these a few years ago where the motors were not strong enough.  She suggested that I had gotten one of those models.  I had her check the serial number and the model number of my unit.  It was manufactured in 2013, so it is not one from their bad batch a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5)  On the lower settings, this model does not \\&quot;pick\\&quot; between the teeth so much as it simply floods them with a very weak stream of water.  Taking a mouthful of water and swishing it around in one&#x27;s mouth creates more pressure than this unit creates on the lower settings.  Waterpik customer service said this model has a different type of motor than the old ones had and uses less electricity.  Really?  Well, speaking for myself, I would rather pay a few extra dollars a year on electricity and have the old motor.  By way of analogy, there are \\&quot;low flush commodes\\&quot; and \\&quot;low flow shower heads\\&quot; on the market, too, and I have used them before, but I certainly would never INTENTIONALLY install one in my bathroom.  Why?  Because the pressure is too insubstantial.  I want to feel a strong shower if I am going to shower, and I want to feel a strong pressure from my Waterpik if I am going to water floss my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, after twenty plus years as a user of a Waterpik, I am deeply disappointed in this unit.  Large, bulky and totally aesthetically unappealing; plastic that feels cheap and insubstantial; a motor that feels underpowered; assorted specialised tips that really do nothing more or better than the basic, classic tip; and Waterpik&#x27;s customer service&#x27;s attitude of \\&quot;you are WRONG this is just as good if not better than the old model,\\&quot; all lead me to give this unit a BIG thumbs down.  As for Waterpik&#x27;s customer service representative, please know that the customer is never WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe this unit will give you any better oral health than using an electrictoothbrush, floss, and a manual tongue scraper followed by a good mouthwash.

    <li> I love this product, I wished I had found it years earlier.  Easy to use, very effective cleaning.</li>
    <li> I like this, and it does it&#x27;s job quite well. After using this and my electric toothbrush my mouth always feels like I just left the dentist. However, my only complaint is the water reservoir isn&#x27;t big enough, in my opinion. I usually end up using one and a half reservoirs in one use. It&#x27;s a bit annoying to refill it in the middle of using it.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a very fine product, highly recomended.</li>
    <li> Works great in getting in all the &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34; !  We even use it on our dog... she has her own pic! LOL! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This device met all of my expectations and more. Their 14 day healthier gum guarantee was very true. My gums look healthier than they&#x27;ve ever looked. Super easy to use and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants something easy to use and that is super effective.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Flosser I purchased 9 months ago became very weak. I mailed it back to Waterpik per their instruction. When I received the machine back, it is still VERY WEAK. But Waterpik reps insisted that the machine has no problem at all. I usually use power level 10 now the water power is only like level 5. The customer service reps were rude and the manager did not answer calls. Left messages and the manager never called back. The machine is not working right and Waterpik did not want to honor their 3 year warranty. I&#x27;m really pissed. Everybody should be aware of this company. I won&#x27;t buy any Waterpik again.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product. It comes with a lot of different heads for the handle.&lt;br /&gt;You can easily adjust the water pressure.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty loud.&lt;br /&gt;It sadly doesn&#x27;t replace flossing but it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I used it four-five times a month for a little bit more than a year. The cleaning part fell off the hose that connects it to the water unit. There is no way to repair it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> check these pearly whites everyone should have one of these available thru amazon</li>
    <li> While I think it is a wonderful way to really clean my teeth, I am disappointed by the difficulty of using the controls that adjust the water pressure. They are very difficult to adjust and usually I have to brace the unit against a object so it doesn&#x27;t slide when I adjust the pressure. The other negative I have is that the button on the hand held pick, that restricts the water flow while you adjust the presssure  sometimes locks and therefore no water can come through to the pick. In that case you might as well not have the unit. That part of the unit design seems very poor and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like the feeling in my mouth after using the water pik.</li>
    <li> Great product. My husband can&#x27;t say enough great things about product! Uses it every day and has seen great results!</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> After several weeks the unit seems to be working fine.  I have been having issues with &amp;#34;deep pockets&amp;#34; on some molars.  The dental hygienist suggested a water pick would be a good idea.  I thought a $10 discount for an &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; was reasonable, but when it was delivered the box had actually been crushed and the unit cracked inside.  I called and Amazon discounted the unit further, it seems to work fine so far.  I actually didn&#x27;t realize there was no warranty on &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; items, but it would have been a hassle to ship it back and pay extra for a new one.  So, i&#x27;m expecting a better checkup at the next cleaning and hoping for the best as far as reliability on the unit goes.  I don&#x27;t have any problem with noise, as others have expressed.  It&#x27;s quieter than the 15-year old original water pick that my kids had when they wore braces (I dug that out from under the sink and it didn&#x27;t work well because the plastic tubes had hardened and cracked.)  I believe this new &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; model has all the features I need, such as an adjustable pressure gauge.</li>
    <li> I would suggest every family owns one.  The basic head is enough to keep my teeth superclean.  It definitely reach a lot places where brush couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complain is that after 2 months&#x27; use, the button on the handle often stuck.  But I can use the flosser without it.</li>
    <li> Seriously, just buy it.. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> I replaced the old style waterpik that gave out after many many years of use. The new one is so much quieter and stores more easily. Although I like the multiple attachements, I use just one.</li>
    <li> Fulfills needs perfectly! Nothing is better than this product at the moment. Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
    <li> best water pik&lt;br /&gt;best price&lt;br /&gt;works wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;love that it has so many pressure settings&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean compared to others</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for me. I don&#x27;t really floss on errrrrr...... a consistent basis, so this was a welcome and easy alternative.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flosser - has many adjustable strengths.  I put it a little hydrogen peroxide with the water as a mouthwash and tooth brightener and disinfectant all-in-one.  I like the design very much - very easy to use, much better than previous designs.  If I have one comment it would be that the water container could be another cup larger to accommodate enough water to do all parts of the mouth closely and carefully.  However, refilling it is not a big deal.  The industrial design of this piece is very good and user friendly.</li>
    <li> I really like it since i got my braces.  It makes it much easier to clean and floss.  But the thing does leak some around the place where you put the nossle into.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this as the best dental insurance I could have. I have been using it just about every night at bedtime and I am amazed at how clean my mouth feels afterwards. As a flosser it does everything that it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Not very good at what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Flossing is a much much much better route than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water splashes everywhere, it doesn&#x27;t get in between teeth well enough, and it&#x27;s very loud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a product that I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik that is about ten years old.  Saw this one advertised and thought not only do I need a more up-to-date Waterpik, but bought one as a gift.  I love, love, love this new device!  There are about six different &#x27;heads,&#x27; and even one designed for individuals with braces.  If you don&#x27;t have one, I strongly recommend that you purchase one.  It will save you a lot of money as you grow older.</li>
    <li> This is our second one in 4 years. My husband likes this one. Just in the past year the old one started to leak from the bottom.  (He never emptied the water at night when finished, which I still do not think had anything to do with the leak, but thought I would mention this part). He loved this model because it was basic and wanted the same one anyway.</li>
    <li> Am very satisfied with my purchase..  I would recommend this to someone who needs a water flosser. But,  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good a dental floss.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is much improved over my last one - much easier to use.  Anything that promotes health of my teeth is appreciated, especially for my 2 implants.</li>
    <li> Quite easy to use, and u can feel the effect. The intensity of the water is just right. Worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand and system.  Our original one came with a traveling one.  The travel one is okay but we bought another one to leave at a second house we own.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because It is difficult to floss my&lt;br /&gt;teeth in tight spaces. I use it daily and find that it really&lt;br /&gt;helps. It really works for hard to get places.&lt;br /&gt; I still use regular floss for some of my teeth that I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have a problem with and then use the waterpik also.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for cleaning gums too. I find it well worth the&lt;br /&gt;investment.</li>
    <li> I did a lot f looking into different brands as well as the hand held ones vs. the counter-top (tank) ones.&lt;br /&gt;(It does not leak)  I am very happy with my choice &amp; at a good buy too.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this product, well made, easy to use and easy to keep clean. Love all the interchangeable gadgets and the # of extra toothbrushes included...good product, great price...</li>
    <li> So this is a perfectly fine product, with a variety of heads.  The only complaint I have is that they give you 6 attachments with only 4 holders, and then the pik itself holds one.  What the hell are you supposed to do with #6?? My number six just ends up being placed all around the counter top to get it out of the way, I guess I could just put one anyway and then never use it, that seems stupid too. That is one of the dumbest design flaws I have ever seen.  That is why I give it four stars instead of 5, stupidity.</li>
    <li> So far the product has worked great! I can tell a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth. I misunderstood and thought it came with extra parts for a second person, but it is still a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this because it seems to work a little different effect than does tape dental floss, swishing warm water around your teeth and simple brushing. I&#x27;ve read that it also improves the health of your gums, certainly mine feel better. My only caveat is to be sure to place the cover on the tank after each use; my cat likes to jump up on the counter and drink out of my special water source herself. She also takes great interest in my use of this device. All of this has nothing to do with the Waterpik itself of course; is simply my own unique and personal problem.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and runs quietly.  It has many attachments to use.  I find I use one and then the other.  I like them all.  The container is easy to remove and rinse after use.  The attachments can be turned to point in a different direction for covering the upper and lower teeth.  It has a pause button so you can stop and swish the mouth out.  I had a different brand water flosser before that was pretty good.  This one is much better.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I love it so much, I only wish I would have bought it before the others!!! My best friend ordered one as well and loves it!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> My teeth have been much cleaner.  Even my hygienist said so.  That&#x27;s a good thing when you can get that kind of comment.</li>
    <li> it came with every thing but they tell me that know i will have to replace the heads ever 3-6 months and it does get water every were but oh well but it is loud but it is good for what is is for</li>
    <li> This works ultra well with warm water to get the stuff out of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like flossing the old way but this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> works great and does an outstanding job</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people with braces, and find it difficult to floss. Easy to use, and does not take up too much space in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more powerful than my old ones. It has more attachments but I haven&#x27; tried them. I like it&#x27;s compactness.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the advice of my dental hygienist.  I have periodontal disease &amp; she recommended a waterpik as a means for better gum health n addition to regular flossing, &amp; to help minimize plaque buildup.  I llke it b/c of how clean &amp; fresh my mouth feels after using it.  it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my sink, its not noisy &amp; hopefully my gum health is improving w. use.  i haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist yet to know if its made a difference.  At night when I use it I add a little baking soda to the water n the resorvoir &amp; when I awake the next morning my mouth still feels fresh &amp; clean.  I alternate between using the std tip &amp; the tip specifically for plaque removal.  I don&#x27;t bother using the other four that r supplied.  The drawback about this product. is that it leaks.  If u put water n the resorvoir &amp; don&#x27;t use it right away, then leave it &amp; come back after five mins or so there&#x27;s a puddle of water on the sink.  I still like the product though, but Waterpik needs to address that issue.</li>
    <li> Great machine and my teeth feel pretty good after using it.....the down side is that it is a little messy, maybe once I use it a little more I will get better at it and it won&#x27;t be as messy.</li>
    <li> It is much better than string floosing, but that is only true if you have braces, I feel that it is inferior if you do not have braces as it can push food particles out only from areas that are relatively opened.</li>
    <li> Have been using Waterpik for years and this version operates with much less noise than the original.  My youngest daughter just got braces and I purchased one for her as well.</li>
    <li> Completely unhappy. Description did not tell me which tips I would get. Only one is the type I use. My wife has no tip to use. We have used a WaterPik for over 30 years. Will warn my friends about buying one.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these one for our son and the other for my husband and I. Our son had braces and it was great with all the attatchments</li>
    <li> Seems good so far but I had to take off 1 star because the compare chart given is incorrect - it says it comes with 2 jet tips for the Ultra, but it actually only comes with one.  So if you need more than one, be sure to order extra tips when you get it!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is great and a better product than the old or original Waterpik.  I like the fact that the water reservoir is covered and thereby protected.  I also like that the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is more compact than the older model allowing it to fit into any space.</li>
    <li> This product gives u the best feeling during usage after usage this definitely save u a trip to the dentist. This product really gets down in ur gums for extra cleaning. I use water and mouth wash mix to clean this comes with accessories also. After daily usage it&#x27;s still going strong I keep my setting on 10. For first time using do not turn up high or it will hurt. Go slow. You will feel the difference after time u use it. This product makes ur mouth feel so good after u use it! I love it gets a high thumps up from me. I had this product over a year and it still works great!</li>
    <li> We love our waterpik!  Our dentist says it is better than flossing, especially for those with some gum problems already.  He says my gum problems are improving and as long as i keep using it I will not need to see a pariodontist (very expensive).  It is easy to use and keeps my gums clean and healthy.  I use it once a day at night, so that I can sleep with a completely clean mouth.  I have had no cavetys since I began using a waterpik 4 years ago.  And I always get rave reveiws from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these over the years, and I like this one the best.  For starters, they improved the switch so it actually STAYS ON while you&#x27;re using it.  What a concept.  The white cover over the tank is a storage pod that holds all your accessories.  That thing seems a little sloppy to me, and they could improve that design a bit, but not a show-stopper.  I don&#x27;t like to floss, so this machine really helps me keep up with dental hygiene. I thought it was a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Really gets gums and teeth clean but have had problems with pause valve.</li>
    <li> I despise flossing and until I got this unit, rarely did so. I bought this for my son to clean his braces and ended up using it myself everyday as well. Having the different tips allowed us to each have our own.&lt;br /&gt;The jet is so powerful as to be painful If on full power. Fortunately, the pressure is fully adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;I do not really feel clean if I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it.  However,  my dentist tells me that frequent usage of this water flosser might dislocate or loosen the fillings in my teeth.  Is this true?  I am reluctant to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This works great! Exactly how the product description says it will. It is very powerful and does an awesome job of cleaning</li>
    <li> I have both upper and lower implant supported bridges in place of natural teeth. I must add that I thoroughly floss the posts and all places that require flossing and use the  irrigator purely for removing food debris; I do not see how the Waterpik could possibly take the place of flossing. I have been using the OralB 8500DLX OxyJet Centre system for approx. 7 years. It included a toothbrush, which I seldom used - preferring a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Over time the power of the irrigator has reduced and the switch has not worked properly for some time. After reading reviews, I purchased the Waterpik. My previous unit affixed to the wall of my small en-suite bathroom, saving much needed space; this one does not. Also, the water container on the previous one was much easier to remove for filling - this one needs to be lifted over the jet handle and the lid lifted off. This may sound petty, but, as an annoyance factor, it makes  an appreciable difference.&lt;br /&gt;The efficiency of the unit, however, cannot be faulted. At first it annoyed me that one must  depress the handle switch to pause the water flow- not switch it on to start the flow; I&#x27;m now used to it. I hope that, when it needs to be replaced, they have a wall mountable model! I purchased the unit through an Australian site, as I did not want to bother with a tranformer, which I believe is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;For travel, I have ordered the Panasonic portable model(through Amazon) as reviews claim it is more compact than the Waterpik portable.  I have not yet received it, but am crossing my fingers!</li>
    <li> When a customer gives a product a five star, then additional words should not be necessary . This is a five star product</li>
    <li> I really cannot stand flossing with the \\&quot;string\\&quot; type flossers; however, find the water flosser concept super.  It is totally amazing how much is removed from between your teeth without causing inflammation to your gums, having difficulty getting the string flossers out from between any tight spaced teeth, etc.  Simply stated... my husband and I LOVE this water flosser and we highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift. Recipient was very happy. Arrived timely.</li>
    <li> Have experienced no issues with leaking or otherwise.  Very happy with product.  Been using for 3 months now and still going strong.</li>
    <li> WORKS THE WAYI THINK A FLOSSER SHOULD WORK. APPEARS TO REMOVE PLAQUE AND FOOD PARTICLES WELL , WITH THE FLOW METER THAT ADJUSTS. PROBLEM WITH HANDLE ASSEMBLY A SPLIT OCCURRED AND HAD TO REPLACE!!!!</li>
    <li> Have had this unit for a few years and still love it. I hate to string floss, but this is so easy that I use it faithfully twice a day. Caveats: watch where you point it when you turn it on! And if you leave the head below the unit (when OFF) it will siphon.</li>
    <li> I love my water pik. I use it almost every night. The first time I used it, I could feel how much cleaner my teeth felt! I have had it for several months and I haven’t experienced any issues with it yet.&lt;br /&gt;I only use the one attachment and the other ones I haven’t touched once. I also have a Sonic Care toothbrush which I have used for 10 plus years. I also still do floss. Combined, these three steps keep my teeth and mouth very healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;Make the investment in this product as I don’t’ think you will be disappointed.  Remember, you are not fully dressed without a smile. This product gives you a little more confidence in your teeth knowing they are clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the third model I buy and the one I like the best. It&#x27;s less noisy than the others. Easier to remove and place the cup in place. The best all around.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Uitra Water Flosser got four stars from me because I like it. The Waterpic has plenty of force. I run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pic a few numbers short of max. I like the way the pic and tubing fold back into a neat assembly. I&#x27;ve only had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pic for a short time so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s longevity. I would recommend this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day everyday instead of flossing.  It works very well to get any food or debris out of my teeth and gumline.  I started with the &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; pressure setting and am now up to the &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;.  Just like with flossing, my gums did bleed a bit when I first started using this but they do not bleed at all anymore.  I am not sure what my dentist&#x27;s opinion on this is versus traditional flossing but I definitely prefer it.</li>
    <li> Despite the off switch making it so much nicer than the original ones over 20 years ago...but I still manage to spray myself and the walls. I found that it didn&#x27;t want to start working..or pumping actually when I attemped to prime it so to speak as the directions tell you. I set it up for that and after many minutes nothing happening. HUH...I was aware others wrote in that it was dead on arrival. But I could hear the pump being actively trying to work...just no water. So I ever so slightly lifted the corner the pump hole is on the water canister facing the pik it&#x27;s on your left side towards the front corner...anyway I lifted it just a real tiny amount like maybe less than 1/4 inch or even no more than an 1/8 even. And a couple bubbles came up and I set it back down seating it again and the water came through right after that. So it was an air lock. That simple and that simple a fix but sometimes an airlock might be larger than the few small bubbles I had emerge. So you might have to work it a bit  maybe even shake it back and forth gentle of course. This kind of information might be helpful and prevent returns in the future. But the sellers need to realize this and tell you or warn you in the descriptions. Also Really WATERPIK should have this in it&#x27;s brochure or manual as it is and tell you right off that it can occur. Been no problem since by the way.</li>
    <li> It does its job well, but is not built to last.  On two of them, the plastic hose became brittle and broke in about a year, and isn&#x27;t replaceable.  So I had to buy a new unit.  The third unit just arrived, and the on/off switch is not attached to anything inside the machine, and just flops.  So I had to return it.  I am looking for a product that does the same job and is well-constructed.</li>
    <li> I use my Waterpik after each meal. It leaves my mouth feeling so clean. This was recommended by my dentist and I am very pleased and satisfied with it. Having many crowns and implants, keeping my gums healthy is very important to me.</li>
    <li> Everything works, but water gets chemical odor regularly--maybe if it is cleaned and water changed daily the odor would go away--but isn&#x27;t that a nuisance? Also, the holder cracked--not all the way through, but that will happen and then it will need to be replaced prematurely--?</li>
    <li> The waterpik works great.  I have never owned one before but glad I made the purchase.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy, other than that, it&#x27;s a good product, I am using it everyday and it became my daily routine now</li>
    <li> Ummm as an Insulin diabetic, I have a rapid buildup of plaque( high blood sugars) almost daily. Well, after using it, I feel like I have just been from a dentist with a tooth cleaning.  The short of it is that my spouse bought this at WM for a significantly greater price. Get it here because you&#x27;ll save a bunch and you don&#x27;t have to go out and get it...right at your door...a GREAT product! BTW, I put a dash of my favorite tooth rinse into the reservoir and then top off with water....No more receding gums for me...Nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
    <li> The best thing about the WUWF is that it isn&#x27;t worse than the one it replaced, which is an important concern with most purchases. The previous Waterpik lasted about 5 years and then sprang a leaky hose. The replacement works about as well as the old one.</li>
    <li> It is a fine cleaner and massager at the gum line but I still feel I need to floss between my teeth.</li>
    <li> This was also for my son for a gift for Christmas.  He said when he used it his mouth felt very clean like just having  his teeth professionally cleaned, but the only thing is that it leaked a little bit so you have to be careful.  He said it was dripping from the tube, and his pants he had on got soaked.  Just be careful to remove every thing from the counter, and have the unit near the sink when you are using it.</li>
    <li> I was afraid that this process would be time-consuming and complicated but it is easy to do quickly and is especially helpful for small mouths with tight spaces between teeth!</li>
    <li> Its a little splashy but thats because i forget to close my mouth close enough. After I dentle floss I use the water one to see if stuff remains and it does. Its a total clean for me.  I have  bridges,crowns so this product if GREAT for my teeth.</li>
    <li> What a difference this has made in my dental health!  Much better &amp; easier than flossing!&lt;br /&gt;Great results!  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I like the variable water pressure and the mulitiple picks. I use this at least 2 times a day, love itl</li>
    <li> I love to brush my teeth, and I am a stickler for oral hygiene, but regular and thorough brushing just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me.  I bought this and use it at least twice a day.  My mouth and breath are SO much cleaner.  After using it the first night, I was amazed because when I woke up the next morning, I didn&#x27;t have gunky/pasty morning breath.  My mouth felt clean, and my breath tasted sweetly fresh.  Amazing!  I used to get tonsil stones, but when I use this regularly, I don&#x27;t ---hallelujah!  I am so happy about that.  I recently moved and was without this for two weeks as it was in the movers truck somewhere---I was pining for this.  I can&#x27;t imagine what people did 100 years ago without this--yuck. BTW, this is my first review. I just had to sing this product&#x27;s praises.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing compares to the durability and strength of this product.  It lasts longer than most.  The last one ran for almost 3 years with salt and peroxide mixed with water running through it.</li>
    <li> I am a daily flosser who has used string floss my entire life. About a year ago, I had a crown put on one of my molars on the right. After returning to the dentist several times and even having him change the crown, I still was unable to chew on the right side because of pain. The dentist always said there was nothing wrong with the crown or the tooth. I was despondent. A friend of mine has a water flosser and I decided I wanted to try it out b/c she raved about hers. I got one and was blown away. My teeth felt fresh-from-the-dentist clean the very first time. And I am happy to say that for the first time in almost a year I am able to chew on the right side, completely pain free. I have only had it for two weeks and can confidently say, I will never go back to string floss.</li>
    <li> I used the waterpik the entire time I had braces. My gums were never swollen and I didn&#x27;t have any plaque buildup. My orthodontists and dentists were so impressed I was able to keep to my teeth and gums so healthy during my treatment. Once my braces were off, there was no gross staining or anything. I haven&#x27;t been using it as much since I got my braces off, but I really liked the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I noticed is that it is hard to clean. I&#x27;m worried about a mold buildup so I think it would be wise to swap out the entire machine every now and then.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a very old one that I had for over ten year!!!  I can only hope that this one holds up as long. It is so much quieter and all of the attachments work super well!!!  I have only been using it for a week now and my gums and pockets are feeling so much better already.</li>
    <li> I would go with the water flossers that you could attach to your sink or shower instead, much more convenient.</li>
    <li> Aparelho muito bom para uso diário, fácil e prático. Produto chegou antes do prazo e em perfeitas condições de entrega.</li>
    <li> I needed this for a particular situation.  It works very well, - which is something I couldn&#x27;t say about the other brand I had before (which we all know, was initially cheaper - in more ways than one).  I would buy it again</li>
    <li> sturdy and very easy to use.  great water pressure - haven&#x27;t had a chance to try all the attachments yet.  so far, the water pick works great !  would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> We ordered this thinking it would be exactly like our previous model. I think it is the same model number but I am not sure. Anyway, it needs more oomph to get the job done, in my opinion. Not bad, just a tad weak.</li>
    <li> I swear dentists don&#x27;t want you to use this because it will put them out of business. This thing cleans way better than floss ever can, it leaves your mouth feeling like you&#x27;ve just been to the dentist.  Awesome product, I hope its durable.</li>
    <li> nothing better to ward of gum disease-use it daily with mouthwash for a clean feel to your mouth. your dentist will approve</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years and absolutely love it.  I bought this one for my mom and she loves it too.  If you are looking for a great product no need to look at further.</li>
    <li> Like it, but a bit messy. Nature of a water pressure device.</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my dad because he has a sjogren sindrome so odontologist recomend this prouct for him it worked perfect and its daily used</li>
    <li> In the description it states this product comes with a tongue cleaner, but the tongue cleaner was missing. Shipping was prompt and everything else is fine.</li>
    <li> Works fine except the tube that feeds the water is too short! I would NOT recomended for a tall person.</li>
    <li> I am on my third one (I use it twice each day). Waterpik improved my gums immediately. It does an excellent job removing any food particles. I don&#x27;t floss with the string floss, yet I have excellent dental checkups. My mouth does not feel refreshed unless it gets the Waterpik treatment.</li>
    <li> Works, but messy.  I think they all are messy.  It has many &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; for different needs and it works.  That&#x27;s the most important part!</li>
    <li> This product helps clean your gum and prevents cavity build up.  However, its sound is so noisy.  It also gets stuck when you turn on or off the machine.</li>
    <li> Nice and works good. Only reason I deduct 1 star, right after I purchsed this through amazon, I found same thing from costco for cheaper price.</li>
    <li> So happy with this, teeth and gums feel great.</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars but it lost a significant amount of pressure with regular use after only 4 months.  Right now using it on the &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; setting feels like the &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; setting.</li>
    <li> Love this item. Works perfect</li>
    <li> This thing is the best. I hated flossing, but I actually look forward to using my Waterpik. My dentist actually likes me now!</li>
    <li> I really like this. I am noticing less sensitivity when flossing with regular floss now that I am using this. I have started out on the lowest setting but have been able to move to a 3/4 on it.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my next cleaning is better than my previous one.</li>
    <li> This thing works fantastically.</li>
    <li> Best one I have used.  Works great!</li>
    <li> After going to the dentist and finding out I had the start of gum disease, the hygienist recommended I get a water flosser.  I reviewed several on amazon.com and this one caught my eye.  I LOVE IT!  It has 10 water strengths and several different tips you can use with it.  I was never a diligent flosser but with this, I actually enjoy flossing my teeth.  I am amazed at the power in this little machine and how it can blast food out from between your teeth.  Hopefully at my next dentist visit they will notice a difference in my gums as well.  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I recommend this for everyone who has teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the attachments help clean the teeth; the warm water feels good; if you have braces, cleaning your teeth is a snap.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is a great item. This was recommended by my dentist, and it worked out--- great! There was no damage, nothing wrong with it, and no parts missing. Of course, I would RECOMMEND it to you, but there is a reason why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. As you can see, it is TOO COSTLY!!!! Otherwise, perfect!</li>
    <li> Love the tool but it stopped working after a few months. The pump makes the same sound but no water comes out. Seems to be the connection between the reservoir and the pump.  What a waste.</li>
    <li> Use this every day and can not ask for more.  It is quiet compared to my old water pik.</li>
    <li> The best tool in my dental care regime.</li>
    <li> My wife recently underwent dental surgery for an implant.  After a few weeks of follow up visits to the dentist, this results from this waterpik are excellent.</li>
    <li> I first liked this product because it did work. However, it suddenly stopped working (no power) recently. It only lasts for 6 months. And I was told couldn&#x27;t be returned/ exchanged.</li>
    <li> Water pick is easy and comfortable to use (as long as water is warm).  It does seem to get out minutia left behind after flossing and using interdental brushes.  My dentists should have told me to use it years ago.  Problem is after taking good care of teeth and gums and going for scaling three or four times a year, I have still suddenly developed pain, gum pockets and bone recession.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m grinding in my sleep.  My internist is trying to see if there is a generalized osteoporosis.  Meanwhile, I like the water pick and will still use it but don&#x27;t know if it will help my problems.  Can&#x27;t say teeth feel more comfortable, but don&#x27;t feel worse.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it manages to remove very small particles from even hard to clean places. I hate regular dental floss.  I was also completed by my dentist and dental hygienist for my choice.&lt;br /&gt;The product came without one of the attachments that I really wanted and the seller worked with me and did everything to keep me satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always flossed my teeth, but ran into difficulties recently, resulting in cutting the sides of my mouth with floss and getting yeast infection on both sides.&lt;br /&gt; My husband convinced me to try his Waterpik and I loved it immediately.  I loved the ease of using it and how clean and fresh my teeth felt.  I ordered my own Waterpik and use it after meals.  Actually, I would not go back to flossing, after having experienced water flossing.</li>
    <li> After a quick review of the product I plugged it in and had my first \\&quot;water floss\\&quot; and it was great.  From the beginning the whole experience made my mouth feel so clean. At first it takes a while to get used to the water splashing if you keep your mouth open!!!  Having the option of the extra attachments is good, although I have basically just used the original pic. I also like the different degress of power levels it offers. The only fault I can find is it does make some noise while using but not enough to discourage me from purchasing.  All in all it is a fantastic purchase for a very reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Working well.  My son just got braces and needed this.  Only uses one of the tips although it comes with a plethora of them.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been recommending a water flosser for a while.  This seemed like the best one without doing a whole lot of research.  I&#x27;m fairly happy with my purchase.  I think any complaints I have would about water flossing in general.  This unit seems pretty powerful and one reservoir is enough for me, but you have to refill every time.</li>
    <li> I WAS SURPRISED HOW QUICKLY IT ARRIVED I DECIDED TO ORDER THIS ONE BECAUSE OF THE SETTINGS WENT UP TO 10 SPEED MY MOTHER HAS THE PANASONIC HANDHELD ONE,BUT I WANTED SOMETHING STRONGER,UNFORTUNATELY ITS NOT AS POWERFUL AS EXPECTED AND ITS NOISY NOT TO MENTION ITS MESSY,WATER GETS EVERYWHERE AND WATER RUNS DOWN YOUR ARM SO YOU MAY HAVE A CLEANER MOUTH,BUT YOU WILL DEFINATELY HAVE A MESSY FACE BASIN SO EVEN WHILE KEEPING YOUR MOUTH CLOSED WHEN IN-USE YOU STILL GET SOAKED SO IN THE FUTURE I DONT THINK I&#x27;LL BE PURCHASING ANY WATERPIKS MAYBE I&#x27;LL TRY THE PANASONIC INSTEAD ONE WITH MORE SPEED BECAUSE THE ONE MY MOM HAS ONLY HAS 2-SETTINGS I HAVE BRACES SO IM LOOKING FOR THE ULTIMATE CLEANING ACTION, SORRY AMAZON THIS ONE IS A NO PLEASER.</li>
    <li> 4 years later and I&#x27;m still absolutely satisfied with this waterflosser. I&#x27;m still using the original tips too! Perfect for people who, when flossing, end up just shoving more food up into your gums rather than have it come out. Leaves a squeaky clean feeling in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that people have had leaking problems? Never had that with mine.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is a significant upgrade to the old model I have been using for years. It is more convenient to use, easier to remove the heads, and easy to store in my medicine cabinet (which is an uncommon 6 inches deep.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a water pic for many years but have never had one that also had a tooth brush attachment.  I really like that added benefit.  This water container design is much better than the older designs.  Looks sharp and has a good feel to it.</li>
    <li> We actually have liked this product and used it for more than two years.  However, recently when changing the tip I noticed black particles coming out of the hand-held wand bulb.  I then hit this plastic section against the sink and dislodged a considerable amount of additional black material.  I felt it was then important to break open this plastic bulb section - the part you hold in your hand - and found it full of black colored mold!  In my opinion this is a serious design flaw.  Since this section is not sealed, it should be possible to clean it.  Yet, in the Waterpik manual, you will find no instructions on how to do this, or that it is even necessary. I have read one third-party article that recommends periodic soaking of this plastic bulb in vinegar.  However, there is no a way to assure that it is clean, without breaking it.  It does appear that any mold in the plastic case of the hand unit may not contaminate the water spray into the mouth, however, the proximity of mold growth so close to mouth is, in my opinion, unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Waterpik to advise them of my concern, noting that, while we don&#x27;t seem to be allergic to mold, many people are and this section of their device should 1) be re-manufactured to allow opening and cleaning and 2) cleaning procedures should be published in their manual. Obviously, we have discontinued using the Water Pik. To their credit, the company has responded by email and is, apparently, now looking into this matter.  They have offered a replacement unit and we have declined.</li>
    <li> It works and I&#x27;m happy with it. No problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to my dental hygienist&#x27;s strong recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS - fairly small size, easy to operate, great choice of \\&quot;tools\\&quot; (most are unused, tho&#x27;), adequate water capacity for a thorough washing job.  Well designed controls, well thought out tubing storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS - the seal between the tank and the pump unit is snug (good for keeping leaks under control), but it makes removing the tank a two handed operation... Would prefer being able to remove it with one hand... Certainly not a show stopper, but a minor annoyance...  Has a bit of a learning curve to use it without spraying water all over the countertop and mirror, but after a day or two, becomes intuitive.  If the attachment is not well seated (audible \\&quot;click\\&quot;), it will leak thru the bottom of the handle...  Not a true \\&quot;con\\&quot;, but more of an operator error issue discovered the hard way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a \\&quot;daily flosser\\&quot;, I never thought I&#x27;d need a water powered version, but after using the unit for a couple of months, about 80% of the time it removes particles left by a thorough brushing.  In addition, my hygienist has said that it has helped improve the health of my gums...  Am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This has worked very well for my teenage boys who have braces and needed something a little more than a toothbrush to get their teeth cleaned.  It was easy for them to figure out how to use and keeps stuff from getting stuck in their braces.</li>
    <li> It arrived sooner than promised (always goid) was a good price and works great.</li>
    <li> The first time I used the Waterpik it leaked a little, The leaking has stopped my favorite picks are the toothbrush and the plaque remover the rest I don&#x27;t really use, I did try them all though. my least favorite is the tongue cleaner. one thing I really don&#x27;t like is the lid it just sits on the water reservoir I think it should fit snugly on the water reservoir also the extra picks sit in the lid, theirs more picks than the lid can hold snugly. in closing I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is powerful!! first-time users beware... use a lower pressure setting.  I was using the tip suggested for use with a bridge, but I found the one for general use performed much better. I haven&#x27;t used any other tips, so I can&#x27;t comment on them, but I definitely think this is a quality product for the price and would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist asked me to get one because regular flossing wasn&#x27;t doing it for me.  So I got this, and I must say it works well. In fact, in the beginning I actually looked forward to using it every night because it was actually a enjoyable experience in addition to keeping my mouth clean while effectively removing trapped food.  The only thing is how loud it is.  In a Brooklyn apartment building, I actually try to use the Water Pik before 10 every night just so I don&#x27;t wake up the kids next door.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the water flosser.  I tried it for 3 months then came back to her, not telling her I used it.  My check up was great.  My gums were healthier, by far, than they had ever been.  It is so easy to use that I used it on average twice a day.  I used about 1/3 hydrogen peroxide to help kill the bacteria under the gum line.  I am very impressed and will be using this great device forever now.  I expect to have my teeth into my nineties and the water pic will be the most important tool for getting me there.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by my Dentist. Over the last 10 years, I have owned four of them. It is a great product, however it has a tendency to live until it is just barely out of warranty and then die. I have grown weary of paying full retail price for them every 3-1/2 years. I was pleased to find the latest replacement on Amazon for a decent price and received it on time. Hopefully this one will outlive the warranty by more than three months.</li>
    <li> If anyone thinks that brushing and flossing regularly is enough, use this device just once *after* flossing and brushing, and you&#x27;ll discover all sorts of food particles which this device removes. The results are nothing less than astonishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as other reviewers have mentioned, do not think that this device will end brushing, and especially flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dental plaque seems to require reasonably vigorous, physical removal with floss.  Check it out, and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m referring to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My view of the best sequential practice with this device: first floss, then water pic, then brush, rinse well with water, and then flush the mouth and teeth with a chaser of the mouthwash of your choice: especially before a night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product: in my view, it is absolutely essential for reliable dental health..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thought, lots of pressure is not required to be effective and thorough.  Don&#x27;t overdo it: your teeth are not your driveway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no relationship with the manufacturer or marketer of this product; I&#x27;m just a happy customer.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is the best I&#x27;ve had, I recently had the cordless one but it started to run slow after just a few months of use didn&#x27;t have the same force as when I first used it, so I purchased the waterpik Ultra hoping it wasn&#x27;t to bid for my small sink I can place it right were you would put your soap dish without even vibrating off the sink it is just the right size and packs a lot of power. I will use this for years to come also I set my force at 6 to 7.</li>
    <li> I purchased the WaterPik Ultra flosser about three years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. It works really well. My husband and I both use it and my teeth feel cleaner than when I used to only use floss. My only complaint is that it takes up a lot of space on my counter and can be messy but I use it more frequently than flossing. My teeth are pretty crowded and the water stream seems to get between my teeth better than flossing ever did. I don&#x27;t use all of the attachments, mostly just the water jet - so I can&#x27;t speak to how well they work. Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with the WaterPik. It&#x27;s durable -- ours is still going strong -- and seems to do a better job than floss alone.</li>
    <li> I see my Hygienist one time over the dental insurance&#x27;s annual allowance (for inflamed gums). At my last Dentist/Hygienist experience it was suggested, for better gum health, I try a Waterpik. I complied. I have been using the device twice per day while attempting three brushings with an electronic reciprocating rotary&lt;br /&gt;tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t know what the professionals will say until my next dental visit. I can truthfully say that while it is rather messy to use (on higher volume settings a lot of water goes into the mouth), my mouth and teeth feel cleaner and, occasional signs of bleeding gums have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Erickson</li>
    <li> Never having used the Waterpik before,  I haven&#x27;t another to compare, but it seems to be doing an excellent  job.  I will know more after I have been examined by my dentist who recommended it.</li>
    <li> This waterpik ultra is everything that I expected and more!  The power options are just right for the needs of all who dare to use it.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful product - it really strays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product</li>
    <li> Bought this model and soon after the following problems occurred:    Unit leaked by tip connection....Purchases a new $12 assembly.....

    <li> I just received this item yesterday (Friday, Oct. 26) and I have used it twice and I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great water flosser. I have no issues with the reserve tank or anything leaking. The quick start guide was all you really need to get started, but as always, be sure to read the entire instruction manual. The variety of tips were a great plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had issues with gingivitis in the past and I&#x27;ve been doubling my dental hygiene since I discovered at my last dental visit I was beginning to get periodontal pockets. I stuck to the string floss, but the amount of time and having stupid fingers left me discouraged and tired. I then discovered I was pregnant and one of the main things was the affect of pregnancy can have on teeth - one of which it can cause gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I could see the nasty bits still stuck between my teeth! My gums aren&#x27;t sensitive so I had the water pressure around 4-5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I mixed a bit of Listerine into the water in the tank, turned up the water pressure to 8 and it felt like my teeth and gums were getting a power wash. I&#x27;ve never had my mouth feel cleaner besides when I went to the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combating my mild dental issues with Crest Gum Protection and this water flosser, I hope to turn my issues into a thing of the past! I have a dental visit coming up in a few weeks, so I hope with daily, continued use this water flosser lives up to the standards others have set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update.</li>
    <li> Good: it actually works.  Does a good job at cleaning, especially if you have braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: it is loud!  The little pump really pumps but you can control the pressure which controls the noise level.</li>
    <li> TheWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser is not so \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; when it comes to capacity of the water container.  The water supply will not last very long when you have the setting on high pressure.</li>
    <li> The product does just what it was supposed to do and has worked without a hitch.  My only criticism concerns the accessories -- tongue cleaner, etc.  They just get in the way, and I disposed of them within two weeks of starting to use the unit. I would have gladly traded them for an extra pick.</li>
    <li> If you floss your teeth regularly and use this waterpik every night I know your dentist will say No Cavities!!  I have used this for 3 years now and my gums are so much better.  No bleeding even wtth the professional cleanings are done.  I add a little mouthwash to warm water and away you go.  There are several different kinds of tips according to what your needs are.  The only negative Is the holder that keeps the brush in place on the body of the waterpik broke so I ordered another one.  This does not detract from the 5 star rating I am giving it.</li>
    <li> Loved this waterpik during it&#x27;s brief life.  After less than a year, the tube that connects the base to the handle developed a hole.  If I could open the handle, i could cut the hose and reattach with the hose slightly shortened. This appears impossible to do.  In other words, a great waterpik becomes junk in under a year because waterpik couldn&#x27;t have a used a sturdier hose.  what a shame.</li>
    <li> The product is still functional after two months of use, but the glass pick is becoming loose.  Only time will tell if the Waterpik continues to operate.  The design is compact and takes up little counter space.  I like the way it cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> The button on the handle sticks making it very difficult to use without spraying your bathroom with water.</li>
    <li> It works well but the button on the hand controller occasionally sticks and the only way to free it is to rap it sharply on a hard surface, sometimes multiple times. I understand this is a design weakness with the unit and I expect it to fail at some time. It is only a couple of weeks old and the problem started within a few days. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this product find, cleans and flushes even after brushing.  I don&#x27;t really care for the storage area in the top cover as it spills out wjhen you are filling the tank prior to using.</li>
    <li> I bought this for husband because he hates using traditional floss! So far this has been a good purchase. The Waterpik is easy to set-up and use.</li>
    <li> Works fine, didn&#x27;t blow my hair back.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it helps with that clean healthy oral hygiene feeling.  Use after brushing teeth to get rid of food particles missed by toothbrush. Add oral rinse to water for a fresh clean feeling.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago my wife and I went to the dentist for our regular checkup and cleaning.  I have had periodontal disease for years, and every time I brushed my teeth my gums would bleed profusely.  I&#x27;d wake up in the morning with dried blood covering my lips and teeth.  When I ate a sandwich, the bread would cause my gums to bleed and would stain the bread wherever I bit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago my wife and I went to the dentist for our regular checkup and cleaning. He recommended the WaterPik to us, saying that it does a better job of flossing.  I rarely flossed, and it showed at every exam for the past fifteen to twenty years or more.  Well because he recommended it highly, I researched the reviews on the product, and decided to order the Ultra (WP100) model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this a week ago, and have used it every night at setting 6.  On the first night, it was unbelievable how much blood came out of my mouth as I spit out the liquid.  It was disgusting.  But after the session, my teeth felt like I had just the dentist after a cleaning - smooth across the back of the front teeth as I glided my tongue across those teeth.  Just to get the feel of the device, I cleaned my teeth two more times that evening at intervals of about two hours each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second night I had nearly the same amount of blood.  But the amount of new food the WaterPik extracted from my teeth was amazing.  We had salad with dinner that night, and I almost could have made a small salad with the amount of greens the WaterPik washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each night after, the level of blood reduced significantly, until now, after 8 days of use, there is almost no blood at all.  My breath, which before I could smell sitting at my desk in the office and was horrid is no longer foul.  It always has a fresh, clean scent to it all day long.  In addition the sensitivity to cold has significantly decreased as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this I fill the reservoir almost full with warm water (warm is my preference due to sensitivity to cold), then I add one cap-full of ACT Restoring mouthwash (with fluoride - recommended by Dentist for the sensitivity), and one cap-full of the Target branded Listerine Fresh Burst.  The mouthwashes get the fluoride treatment recommended by the dentist as well as the restorative and anti-bacterial treatments my (soon-to-be-formerly) unhealthy teeth and gums need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to be &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; about reviews, and I almost never believe the &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; testimonials.  But in this case I am living the before and after, and I am amazed at how much healing occurred in one short week of use.  I&#x27;m totally sold on this product, and if I had to buy another one, without hesitation I would buy the same product over and over.  WaterPik rocks!</li>
    <li> Works great.. Definitly feels better than regular flossing</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Works splendidly and does a great job at cleaning between your teeth. I highly recommend this product. worth the money</li>
    <li> Ive only had it for a week, its fun seeing all sorts of gunk that comes out in between your teeth! After using this product, it leaves you that clean fresh feeling. The only thing about it is that its a bit loud, but what do you expect, its blows pressurize water.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Seems like sturdier construction that previous unit.</li>
    <li> Absolute must if you wear braces! Works great and takes much less time cleaning food out of your teeth!</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied with Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. it is as advertised and does an excellent job of cleaning at gumline and between teeth.  I use it every day.  No disappointments here!</li>
    <li> Good performance, good price.  Styling is a bit tired - maybe using their molds from the 50s keeps the price low ;o)</li>
    <li> This is my third waterpik. This one has much better pressure than my old one, which I tossed when it started to leak from the wand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that it will keep up the good work.  Fittings appear tight. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so.</li>
    <li> This item is a little bit senseless. The water just dribbles down your chin or you have to constantly spit it out. The different heads may look different, but they don&#x27;t clean differently in my experience. For the price, the flosser should be more user-friendly. I didn&#x27;t see a change in my teeth, but thought to wait until I went to the dentist to see if they noticed a change. They did not. I am in the process of requesting a refund on this item, but because I waited it out to see if it properly flossed my teeth, according to the dentist, I will have an issue with the 30 day policy.</li>
    <li> Buyer&#x27;s remorse. I really thought it would have more power to it so I&#x27;m not impressed. I have to have it turned all the way up to get any benefit at all and then it tickles my mouth. Wished I would have saved my money.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Works like a charm.  Very useful for teeth, gums and all sorts of water cleaning on jewelry, etc.  I used it also (separate nozzle) for cleaning out my sinuses.  I had a sinus issue some time back last winter.  I used sea salted warm water leaned backwards into the bathtub and sprayed this under each nostril to drain it.  Very well made product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and good for your teeth/gums. Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived without it !!! I added this to my nightly routine when I got a full set of braces and I am so glad I did !!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! My mouth has never felt cleaner!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased flosser several months ago.  Unit is used several times daily.  Works very well.  Thank you four service.</li>
    <li> Real good purchase. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the first water flosser I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it. It&#x27;s very easy to figure out and it does a wonderful job. The way my teeth are, a lot of times, using regular floss can be a little painful. That is not the case with this Waterpik though. It&#x27;s much easier than using regular floss as well. After using this thing for a week, I&#x27;ll never go back to regular floss again.</li>
    <li> It works..lots of pressure..it does what is supposed to do. Now is just a question of reliability...So fat so good</li>
    <li> Look out for voltage. Product looks ok, but it is not multi-voltage, it is only 120 V, so if you are planning to take on a trip to Countries where the standard voltage is 220 V don&#x27;t forget to take along a transformer. I haven&#x27;t got the chance to use it yet because of this.</li>
    <li> This is the best product to help with flossing. I have braces now and it is thorough.  Has many attachments, easy to use and just excellent cleaning. You will be glad you purchased this product for help in flossing and cleaning.</li>
    <li> Genius product from the company that defined the category in the 60&#x27;s. Works well under many different conditions with the pic selections.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of water flossing in the shower - less mess! Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t  get the job done. When new, the battery life was short but adequate. However, there was no indication of low battery, you just wait until it stops working. The bigger problem is that the batteries completely give out after only a few months. Both my girlfriend and I bought these around the same time, and both completely quit after about 3 months. I recommend going with the counter top model.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I highly recommend it for healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for teeth and gum hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this brand for years.&lt;br /&gt;Downside is that the water runs everywhere from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Tend to break down every few years, seems like just when the warranty has expired.&lt;br /&gt;However, that said, the benefits still outweigh these issues and the improvement in oral hygiene is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> How does one live without a Waterpic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, because it blasts away particles under the gum line that are missed by&lt;br /&gt;regular brushing and rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weak point of this product is the holder that fastens the hand piece to the main&lt;br /&gt;unit and secures the unit between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a weak &amp;#34;u shaped&amp;#34; piece of plastic that breaks long before the unit is ready for&lt;br /&gt;replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the hand piece is not kept in a vertical position by the &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34;, the&lt;br /&gt;remaining water in the reservoir will drain out onto the counter and sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the company can not provide a better &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34;, the unit should be &amp;#34;notched&amp;#34; and&lt;br /&gt;replacement holders should be made available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase this model again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using the string floss but I definitely love using this everyday.  It really cleans up all the nooks and cranies.</li>
    <li> Definitely would not buy again, a waste of time....and money.</li>
    <li> succeeded  expectation.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE, SUPER FAST SHIPPING THANKS AGAIN</li>
    <li> I like the way this operates, easy to use, I have gum issues and this has improve my dential hygiene visit to the my doctors.</li>
    <li> I have very weak teeth. It&#x27;s hard to get every part of my teeth clean just with a toothbrush. But with a water flosser, I made it. And I also bought two sets for my parents.</li>
    <li> I regret that I allowed my dentist to convince me to purchase this one.  It looks nice, but it makes a mess in use if you aren&#x27;t very very careful  bu allowing water to spurt all over.  To me it is a waste of money and I can do the same thorough cleaning  with other means that didn&#x27;t cost what this one did.</li>
    <li> This flosser is so so much better than the traditional way of flossing.  It is nearly impossible to floss in the back molars, but this water flosser gets  everything.  The settings start low, and you can gradually increase the pressure.</li>
    <li> I love my water flosser.  It gets the spaces between my teeth really clean~ I can actually see the food bits that fall out as a result of using the water flosser, so you know that it works.  Seeing these food bits falling out is very satisfying because it means I am getting RESULTS.  This was my first time using a water flosser, so it took me awhile to get used to using it ~ the high pressure water was intimidating and hard to control at first.  I&#x27;ve accidentally sprayed the bathroom walls, sink, and myself ~ pretty much anything within 3 feet of where I was standing.  But now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it, using the water floss is a breeze and accident-free.  NOTE: The water flosser is NOT intended to replace dental floss~ instead, the water flosser is intended to supplement dental floss.  I use the water flosser first so that it does most the work, and then I follow up with dental floss.  The water floss + dental floss routine leaves my teeth cleaner than just dental flossing alone.  I never thought that this would be the case before I started water flossing because I thought simply dental flossing was sufficient.  But the water floss takes my teeth to a whole new level of clean.</li>
    <li> I have the Waterpik for about 1.5 year before final stop working. The product is not reliable as the old model.</li>
    <li> Excellent, do works as advertised. Now I need the sonic toothbrush. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I like it because you can totally keep it clean.  The battery operated Waterpik&#x27;s collect mold over time and there is no way to take them apart and clean them.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for dental hygiene.  My hygienist recommended I purchase a waterpik.  It&#x27;s a little messy, but you just have lean over the sink when using it.  After all what can you expect when you are shooting a steam of water into your mouth.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it is still being used daily. Dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after looking for a water flosser online for a while. I have had good experience with Waterpik products in the past, and i did too with this one. Sturdy plastics, easy to clean, and most important: parts are still available for purchase.</li>
    <li> this product simply works.  We add listerine to it.  the settings are a nice feature.  the ability to change the settings is a good feature.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to get into a pocket left years after a wisdom tooth was pulled.  It works well on most teeth, but you have to change tips to get to the pocket tip, and the pressure for that tip has to be set much lower than normal (needs to be on the lowest pressure setting).  It would be nice if the normal tips had a bit more angle so that I could use that tip to reach behind my last teeth (to the pocket), but the normal tips have about a 45 degree angle on them, which isn&#x27;t enough.  Still, I like how it works in general.  Another item of note is that the directions tell you to fill the tank with warm water - but in my house, getting a cup of water takes a gallon of water to get the water warm, so I&#x27;ve been filling the container the night before I use it, and then use the water at room temperature.  It&#x27;s a little cold on sensitive teeth, but saves the planet a little energy and water.  Seems to work fine regardless of temperature.</li>
    <li> This product is better than what I was expecting!  Thrilled with the product and the results of its use!  Way worth the price!!!  Love the fact that you can adjust the pressure of the water.  My husband and I use different numbers.  There are also different attachments.</li>
    <li> This is a nice Water Flosser.  I have been using it since my purchase and so far I have no concerns.</li>
    <li> Meets my specific needs. Easy to use. Would recommend for anyone being conscious of care of their teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> We recently purchased this as my wife was not a big flosser, and recently got braces which made flossing even more difficult. She uses this at least daily and it does a fantastic job. Very easy to use and just sits on the counter top in our bathroom. Highly recommended for those with braces.</li>
    <li> It gives a good feeling after being used... and one can adjust the water pressure from just &#x27;bubbly&#x27; to VERY strong!  My mouth feels much healthier since I began using it.</li>
    <li> I love my Waterpik and use it at least twice a day.  It is well worth the price.  I also bought replacement heads and am glad to have them.  It came with a travel Waterpik and was also great on my vacation.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
    <li> This thing is great,Gets everything out. Ten times better than string floss.</li>
    <li> I gave this waterpik to my husband for his birthday and he was thrilled! He says he can never go without one again. It feels wonderful on his gums and really cleans better than flossing. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpik and have been very happy with it!  I love the adjustable water dial, and as long as you remember to empty it, you won&#x27;t have mold issues on the inside.</li>
    <li> superior Waterpik appliance.....best of all designs  I have used a Waterpik for 10 years and this the very best ever</li>
    <li> Within the first year of use, the curved plastic piece holding the handle/tip cracked on the right side and would no longer hold the handle (so water runs everywhere.) The company sent me a new Waterpik (same style) at no cost. Now less than a year has passed and the curved plastic holder on the new Waterpik has a crack running down the length again! I am the only person using this product and it just sits on my bathroom counter. There is no way I am doing anything to cause this damage. The jet function works well but I am going to switch to another brand at this point.</li>
    <li> Purchased this at the advice of my hygienist, since I always forget to floss.  Works great, and I definitely use it more often than I was flossing!  Super quick &amp; easy to use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and worth every penny. It was suggested by our dentist and she noticed thedifference in our oral health</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this, I had given mine to husband ...was without for a week and decided, rather than end in divorce court for stealing the old one back......got a new one.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it...great product...never want to be without !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s obviously a smart device, and it works for my braces, but it has two problems in my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t really replace flossing, it&#x27;s a complementary device to oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;2. The user interface is stupid. The device should have had ONE button (on the part that you hold it), and release water only when you press it. Right now, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite, and usability is counter-intuitive, resulting in spraying water everywhere in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> love the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. Works well and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good product, but will require cleaning every few weeks to prevent mold buildup</li>
    <li> This product works very well however I  have reliability issues.  The WaterPik started leaking from the bottom that is why I gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> I have the best dental checks since I have started using a Waterpik water flosser.  It is a little messy, but you can see the food particles come out from between your teeth.  I have always had bad gums, but have seen dramatic improvement in my gums since starting to use the water flosser.</li>
    <li> Good power, feels good with warm water, does every thing it&#x27;s made to do. A lot easier than flossing. A+++</li>
    <li> Used for 1.5 years, the wire broke, but the custom service responded immediately and a replacement is on the way.</li>
    <li> I got braces a month ago and bought this item 3 weeks ago and I love it. I use the orthodontic tip daily after I brush my teeth. I always get the stuff I missed after brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> Still working on mastering this technique... I don&#x27;t think that this will ever replace flossing, but it is a good supplement... My only warning is, don&#x27;t crank this sucker up thinking it will work better, you may end up cutting your gum! ouch. I know, dumb mistake... Overall I like this product, besides my one incident, it is a little more gentle than flossing.</li>
    <li> Hard to use. Useless according to my dentist.</li>
    <li> I have used water pik for years and my last one finally started leaking etc.  I decided that it is time to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but praise for the product.&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that I seem to splatter alot.  I do not fault the flosser.  It is me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally review products that I purchase.  The flosser is special</li>
    <li> The strength of the spray is great.  The variable heads are equally good.  My only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is that the reservoir is too small for my husband.  He loves the feeling so much that he wants to use it longer without having to refill it.  For me, the reservoir is an absolutely fine size.</li>
    <li> I love my new routine every night filling my reservoir with warm water and a few drops of grapefruit seed extract to help my poor gums be healthier and it feels so good to know they guarantee healthier gums within 14 days. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Much more fun than flossing!!</li>
    <li> It seems to work o.k., however, it is a little messy to use (especially be a 9 year old and an 11 year old. It is also very noisy, if it was a car, I would say it was on its last leg and it is brand new. If I was to purchase again, I would get a better one.</li>
    <li> Love it! It sure beats flossing! I have it set on 2 and it seems to be just right! It was recommended for Tonsil Rocks!</li>
    <li> that would be great if it could contain more water&lt;br /&gt;i am worrying about that whether it will make a big gap between my teeth and gum...</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my teenager; who has braces. She loves the feel of the Water Pik. She says it massages her gums.</li>
    <li> The button you press to stop water flow broke right away and stayed stuck in, just made this useless otherwise i loved it</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE, PRESION ADECUADA, LIMPIEZA OPTIMA, DIEFERENTES NIVELES DE PRESION, PRECIO UN POCO ELEVADO COMPARADO CON LA COMPETENCIA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CUMPLE CON LO REFERIDO POR EL FABRICANTE</li>
    <li> the pressure is noticeably weaker than the conventional water pic machine.the pressure is noticeably weaker than the conventional water pic machine.</li>
    <li> What a great little machine! Painless and thorough, well worth the price. Just make sure you use warm water. There are many attachments, but I use the pic tip most often. Reaches into hard to get to nooks and crannies in your mouth. I have a full bridge, and this gets the job done better, cleaner, and faster than the old string method.</li>
    <li> This is a great flosser, if you have a briidge or braces or close teeth, this is for you&lt;br /&gt;you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the second one for our household. It is a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good unit!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Love the multiple tips.  Stores neatly and compact to keep on the counter.  Very happy with it.  The video review really sold us on it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and find it amazing how much material it loosens up, even after a good brushing.  I feel like I&#x27;m taking better care of my gums and teeth now.</li>
    <li> My old Waterpik finally gave up the ghost after only about 35 years.  After listening to the chug-chug-chug of the old but still operable beast, it was a wonderful surprise to find the new Ultra Water Flosser quietly doing a great job.  It is sleek, quiet and efficient.  It does a great job, is much easier to use and to keep clean and it takes up less room on the counter.  Get one.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> While the dentist swears by this, I am not so sure that it was worth the money.  It was a good price.</li>
    <li> A very good product. I have the older one. I ordered this one for another family member. Slightly different than the older model but works just as well.</li>
    <li> Pick holds plenty of water to cover all of your gums inside teeth and outside.&lt;br /&gt;You can add your favorite mouthwas to the water.  I am using Listerine and I rinse it out when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;the level of pick water pressure can be adjusted from 1-10.  When you use it for the first time it does not seem like the pressure is much but like using dental floss you will notice it if you use to much pressure the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons, the cord just does not seem long enough and I am kind of tall so I have to bend way over to be over the sink and have enough cord.&lt;br /&gt;I have accidently hit the button that releases the pick because it is located at the same place you use to turn the pick to the angle you need it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  No broken or torn floss to deal with!!  Flushes between teeth and gums very effectively!!  Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik I have purchased. One for my son and one for myself. His was difficult to get started and has quit working. Mine is working sporadically and was also hard to start.</li>
    <li> This was at a great price and was delivered on time and in perfect shape.  The performance of this product has been good and I would suggest this as your purchase.</li>
    <li> this has made a big difference in my life i feel it has improved my health.. my teeth looks great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Came quickly and well packaged. Works very well and easy to use.  Would recommend&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I am still using this. Not as often as I did but it works really well and is good at cleaning strongly built jewellery and my nose pads on my glasses too!</li>
    <li> I am using this unit with an attachment that my Nose Specialist gave me to irrigate my sinuses after surgery.  It works perfect, but the first Waterpik I got, updated model, uses a different size attachment than this one so I had to return it.  Just make sure any new attachments will fit.</li>
    <li> It flushes debris but does not replace dental floss.  The older model I had had a larger water container.  This container is a bit too small for my liking.  I would not recommend it to someone looking to stop flossing with string.</li>
    <li> Waterpik - I have been very satisfied with this product. Easy to use and plenty of attachments. Easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> So the people who said it doesn&#x27;t have enough power? They&#x27;re nerves are not properly wired to their brain.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this about 3-5 times a week since July, and I still find level 4 too much at times.&lt;br /&gt;At level 10? I used it to pressure wash soap scum off my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended I get one. My teeth are pretty close together, and I am keeping my wisdom teeth. Dentist said these are great for people in this situation.&lt;br /&gt; After about a week, I was curious if it was cleaning out between my teeth as much as floss. I used the water pik, then flossed and floss was clean. Definitely easier to get molars with this than with floss. Even with my electric toothbrush, the water pik finds hidden chunks.</li>
    <li> great product for my son who just got braces</li>
    <li> I guess I misunderstood what this thing is for based on what I was told prior to buying.  Some Hygienists made it sound more like an alternative to flossing.  This is clearly not the case based on how clean my mouth feels after and what my actual Dentist Told me when I went in for a filling.  After purchase I was told one still probably needs to floss and that this will just get the bigger jammed in stuff out of the way.  So the product works and it does clear big gunk, but just not what I thought.  My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel particularly cleaner after on the average day, only if I&#x27;m very dirty.  Do NOT expect the same difference in feel as one gets when going from a normal to electric toothbrush.  (Some how what I thought I was getting.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months. Its awesome!! I put a dash of mouth wash, and I feel super clean after each floss.</li>
    <li> The directions are clear and precise&lt;br /&gt;The device is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I love that all of the accessories are stored in the same place</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every single day for 9 months and it&#x27;s held up except for the plastic hose that developed a leak. However, it was easy enough to buy a new hose/head to replace the leaking one. I like the fact that this one has plenty of power to blast between my teeth. I also like that water doesn&#x27;t stand in the area beneath the bowl.  Unlike the earlier Waterpiks, the head on this one rotates so instead of turning the hole thing around with your hand, you can just rotate the flosser part using your thumb. Hopefully they&#x27;ll improve the quality of the hose so that it will last a little longer.</li>
    <li> This is the thrid Waterpik that I have had.  They do a great job getting stuff out of your teeth, even after brushing.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended getting a waterpik. So after pricing them in the store and reading other customer reviews I decided on this model/brand. Even after paying shipping it was still cheaper than buying it in the store. It works as well as promised and I was amazed at how much food particles it washes out even after flossing and brushing. I love it.  My wife is now using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I also highly recommend buying it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> disappointing purchase.  very noisy.  have to practically sit on water container to achieve connection.  actually, have wondered is it a second.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my teeth and is not as intrusive and as bloody as conventional floss.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t used a Waterpik flosser for a few years, and I really missed it.  This one gets the job done. Quieter than the old one.</li>
    <li> I rate this item 5 star and feel it flosses you teeth better than the waxed string.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This thing is so simple to set up, it&#x27;s ready to use in minutes. I initially bought this product with the intention of making flossing easier, and I actually think it makes flossing fun. I find myself flossing more often than before, and I believe my gum health has improved tremendously in a short time.</li>
    <li> our dental hygenist suggested Waterpik and so far we really like how well it cleans your teeth and very easy to use</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate flossing. I really, really do. I&#x27;ve been looking at these on and off for years, but they were always so expensive, until relatively recently. I saw this one for a great price, so I pulled the trigger on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, these things in general (nothing against this one) are really cumbersome to use. Until you get used to it, you&#x27;re going to make a mess. Just be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this thing is great. I use it on around 6, and it has enough pressure to do a better job than flossing - my wife can&#x27;t handle 6, it hurts her gums in her more sensitive areas. It&#x27;s pretty clear that this has more than enough power to do what it needs to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel extremely clean when I&#x27;m done with this - cleaner than they have in a long time, even with flossing. I wouldn&#x27;t say that my teeth feel as clean as when I come home from the dentist, but definitely not far off. If I was better with the tool, I could probably do almost as good of a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great, it does it&#x27;s job, it holds a lot of water, and I don&#x27;t have to use floss anymore. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, really.</li>
    <li> water stays inside the handle ...and now im worried about mold</li>
    <li> its like going to the dentist everyday</li>
    <li> This water pic delivers good water pressure to clean.  You will be happy with this product and the results.  Wishing you a brilliant smile and good health!</li>
    <li> This came fast in a nice package. It is very good to clean my teeth. The only thing is that takes space and one must be sure that the water is warm.</li>
    <li> Better then I expected.</li>
    <li> I seriously felt like I just left the dentist and wonder why I have not purchased a WaterPik sooner.  My youngest son just got braces, so that&#x27;s what prompted this purchase.  We do not want to take a chance on his teeth getting discolored and disgusting with plaque and tartar due to how close his teeth are and how much of a pain it is to floss with braces.  He loves it and I think it is going to make him more engaged in his oral health.  I&#x27;m an obsessive flosser and my hygienists love me; however, this may make it even better.  I have very tight contacts (pretty much zero space between my teeth) and have been known to shred floss.  This will make life easier for everyone!  I will say it may take a few times for you to get the &#x27;how to use it&#x27; down.  We were spraying water everywhere the first few days.</li>
    <li> Helps me keep with teeth clean.</li>
    <li> So far this is working just fine.  Be sure to keep the wand in your mouth and positioned so it can&#x27;t spray out.  Otherwise, you bathroom mirrors get a bath and you will be cleaning them after every use.  However, it is a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The button used to stop and start the flow of water got stuck after one month of use, and we were no longer able to use it.  I would expect a longer life out of a $45 item.</li>
    <li> When I read the information this product seemed to me exactly what I was looking for, a portable water pick, something I could take to the shower and not something that needs to stand on a counter. I am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It lasted less than 2 years. It works great for as long as it works.</li>
    <li> There are 255 poor reviews for this product. I will add #256. I actually enjoyed using this for several months, but then it started leaking and stopped working after several months, just as described by many others.</li>
    <li> great value for money but not so convenient process of refilling water (bulky). the design needs to be more efficient</li>
    <li> This water flosser is excellent.</li>
    <li> I will never use dental floss again. This Waterpik is amazing. I love how clean and efficient it is and you get lot&#x27;s of exchangeable pics to use. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using it after each meal and miss it when I don&#x27;t have access. Highly recommended for a clean mouth.</li>
    <li> ORDERED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IT HAS WORKED FLAWLESSLY FOR GOOD DENTAL HYGIENE. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS QUALITY ITEM.</li>
    <li> Works great and I loved the price. This ends up being a little messy at first but worth having good teeth. It works very well.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Dentist has been recommending this for several years.  Sorry I put off so long.</li>
    <li> Really glad I finally bought one and this one works form me</li>
    <li> I was considering a portable water flosser for my office.  Since I do not have my own bathroom, I have to hunt around my hospital unit until I find a free sink.  So portability was important.  However, after reading Amazon reviews of all the available portable units, it was clear that none did a good job (weak stream, low tank capacity), and all had reliability problems.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, one fellow wrote that the tank size on portable units WAS adequate, as all you have to do it get the food out from between your teeth.  This is not true!  More importantly, you are flushing decay causing bacteria from below the gum line.  Waterpik instructs to floss 3 seconds per tooth.  And you need to approach from the outside and the inside.  So tank capacity is important.&lt;br /&gt;The Ultra&#x27;s compact size means I can carry it, along with my electric toothbrush, to whichever sink is available.&lt;br /&gt;The coiled hose is in the middle of the device, so you can use it at any sink.  And it coils right back to it&#x27;s original shape after use.&lt;br /&gt;The spray flow is less than the Hydro Floss, but definitely powerful enough to clobber plaque.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is significantly quieter than the Hydro Floss.&lt;br /&gt;The styling is aerodynamic and modern, which tells the bacteria in your mouth that RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!&lt;br /&gt;The large, knurled ring at the base of the pic is easy to rotate.&lt;br /&gt;You even get extra attachments which I don&#x27;t use but some will appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;So this is a great machine as a table top unit, and as a portable.</li>
    <li> Very easy to set up and works great in daily use. It clearly has benefitted from careful design - I particularly like how easy it is to rotate the direction of flow by turning the nozzle using the gnurled knob with my thumb.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good product</li>
    <li> Am pleased with the results of the waterpick. Does a great job and massages my gums. It was a worthwhile purchase!</li>
    <li> I feel like I have had my teeth cleaned professionally.....can&#x27;t believe the food I missed while brushing and dry flossing.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for about 6 months.  Then one day it just stopped working.  There was a burning smell coming from the pump motor.  Nothing but the hose is repairable on it, so there went $60 down the drain.</li>
    <li> Like it really well.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product...even for those who floss and brush every day.  i highly recommend it..don&#x27;t use it on strongest until you&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Waterpik.  I like the size of the waters reservior.  I like that the extra hose&lt;br /&gt;tucks into the side out of the way.  Especially like the lid that serves as a container for the other&lt;br /&gt;utinsiles and also for the large number of funcitons that it&#x27;s capaable of.  Very well designed.</li>
    <li> ...and that&#x27;s why I bought the Waterpik. The only drawback to this model is that it has no provision to mount on a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My dentist said this unit does NOT take the place of flossing. Downgraded to four stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks for many years and was a bit disappointed with the previous model that I purchased. This version works fine and seems to do a great job on my teeth too. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old man and I must be honest, I NEVER used to floss. I recently got braces and I wanted to really focus on taking care of my teeth since I&#x27;m investing so much to correct them. So I began to floss and it was almost impossible!  I did some research and come across the Waterpik system. I LOVE IT!! It feels so good and makes flossing effortless. I can proudly say I now floss at least 3 times a day and my dentist and I noticed quickly the results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a modest improvement over my waterpik of many years ago which was in my opinion of little value in dental hygiene.  I was wrong.  The Water Flosser removes a startling amount of food particles from between teeth, even after flossing.  My Dental Hygienist and I were both surprised at the improvement in my gum health after just a month of use.</li>
    <li> Great flosser, works really well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kids for Christmas so it would be easier, more effective, and more fun for them to floss.  So far, they LOVE it. It has good water pressure and is easy for them to refill and swap out heads independently.  Unfortunately, it did NOT come with the color coded tips as indicated and only has ONE regular tip. The other accessories are varied and surely there is something for everyone but it would have been nice if it had included what was in Amazon&#x27;s picture.  I am having to order additional tips.</li>
    <li> I am always amazed at all the gunk this flushes out of my teeth. Now after I&#x27;ve eaten something, I actually can&#x27;t wait to Waterpik. The idea of all those food bits lurking about unseen just grosses me out. Not only do my teeth feel and look cleaner, my breath is also fresher. An added perk I did not expect - after years of dealing with teeth sensitivity to hot/cold food or drink, regular use of the Waterpik seems to have made that disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, go for it. I sat on that same fence far too long. My only regret with this purchase is that I did not do it much much sooner.</li>
    <li> As usual product is worth using everyday! Water pik is the best where oral care is concerned, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended this item.  He has one and loves it.  Looking forward to better dental check ups. will be ordering replacement parts as needed.</li>
    <li> It is very efficient and extremely powerful for its size. I found this water pic to be very cost effective for the size and power. I would not have any hesitation recommending this product to family and friends</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik because I will be getting braces and I read reviews and my dental hygenist said that this is amazing for orthodontia.  I figured I would get a hang of it before I have things stuck in my braces!  I got all wet trying to figure out the pause button and proper pressure control.  However, now that I have used it for about a month, I can say that I am impressed.  I was unsure at first how well this would clean between my teeth, but it is amazing!  My teeth feel amaing and my gums feel healthy!  I have a periodonist appointment soon and I am anxious to see what he says!  I would definately recommend this to anyone that finds traditional flossing painful!  My gums feel so much better after using this compared to regular flossing!  Give it a try and you won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: after a few months of using the Waterpik and I got my braces, I am so very happy with this product.  The different tips that are included help keep the areas around my brackets clean, and I never feel nervous that I have food stuck in my braces.  I had heard the assistants at the dentists scolding someone for the cleanliness of their braces and teeth when they had come in for a check up, but I did not get that at all and I owe it all to my Waterpik!</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is a great product. I got this product at the end of 2012, and I use it everyday to clean out any debris lodged in between my teeth before flossing. It works great for doing this exact job, and in my opinion this is the only job it needs to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I see with this unit is it would be nice if it included more than one classic jet tip. The other tips in my opinion are pointless. The water flosser should be used to &#x27;floss&#x27; your teeth, not &#x27;brush&#x27; them. Many people may disagree with this opinion, but I believe that if instead of all of the pointless tips, there should be four classic jet tips that are color coordinated so multiple members of one&#x27;s family could use it without feeling &#x27;grossed out&#x27;. Personally, it doesn&#x27;t bother me to share, but I know my wife would appreciate her own tip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, there is no leaking, but I will continue to update this review with any quality issues.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist suggested this waterpik.  No problems with it.  First few times you use waterpik it is pretty messy but you soon learn to stay above sink.  After using the waterpick for three months a return visit to my hygienist resulted in much improved gum health.  Been using for 9 months, still running well. Good price , fast service + prime shipping.</li>
    <li> While we are all told to use dental floss daily, nothing comes close to this water flosser.  I use this in conjunction with regular floss and an amazed what the regular floss misses this the water flosser is able to get.  Your mouth and gums will not only feel more clean, but it will be cleaner.  Add a little mouthwash to the water tank and you will have a party in your mouth.  LOVE THIS FLOSSER!!!!</li>
    <li> waterpik is the best option to help reduce plaque and tartar for people who have difficulty flossing, or adults with braces. Easy to use, easy to clean, can be used by multiple house members by easily switching out heads. Good buy!</li>
    <li> I really like this water flosser because it is compact, powerful and has lots of options. Easy to use and works great. I love that it takes up little counter space as well.</li>
    <li> Best product ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Waterpik we bought lasted over 5 years; we used it daily and at least twice. But recently the hose between the machine and the handheld flosser-device developed a crack. So we bought another one, and are very, very happy with it. (Didn&#x27;t buy it through Amazon though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to Europe for a few months I bought a different brand there. It was awful and I was glad when I could use the Waterpik Waterflosser again.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been cleaner.  I highly recommend it.  So I have to say 10 more words so here they are.</li>
    <li> good to protect our teeth</li>
    <li> This is my 7th water flosser since i put braces on my teeth some 14+ years ago , I use it before regular flossing and brushing. Together, they keep my teeth clean and healthy.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> Delivered in time, as promised. Easy instructions, easy to handle, easy to clean and easy to store. All in all a perfect buy!&lt;br /&gt;Would (and have) recommended it!</li>
    <li> I had an old design and it was broken after 2 years of intensive usage...I am happy that I got this one&lt;br /&gt;as the cord is easy to manipulate and the off/on switch is better that on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot live without waterpick any more!</li>
    <li> This is actually my first time using a waterpik. After using it, my teeth felt and shined as if I just got out of my dental office. My whole family likes it, especially my son who wears braces. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and believe everyone should have it!  My dentist recommended it as regular flossing was hard for me as my teeth are close together.  This does a better job than flossing can ever do.  I would definitely recommend it no matter the cost!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective.  Would have given it full marks if they had reduced the range of tips but given you two each of the ones you use regularly to allow you to share the product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this.  I can floss my whole mouth in about ONE minute -- without hurting myself (by pushing down floss too hard, etc.)</li>
    <li> AT 50 years old my mom had to have all her teeth removed.  Her subsequant advice was &#x27;ALWAYS do what you can to keep your teeth.&#x27;  The hygenist stated that the oxygen that is carried under the gums to kill bacteria is better than flossing (which you should be doing daily anyway)  It never fails to remove more particulate after a good brushing.</li>
    <li> Compare with price is reasonable. Refill is easy and planty of options to clean the teeth and hope it last for long time.</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  AFTER I USE MY ELECTRONIC TOOTHBRUSH,  I USE THIS TO REALLY KEEP MY TEETH CLEAN.  MY DENTAL HYGIENIST HARDLY HAS ANYTHING TO CLEAN WHEN I GO IN FOR MY REGULAR CLEANING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ORAL HYGIENE.  THANK YOU AMAZON</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my 10 year old model which was making odd noises when I used it. This model is much better because it has a more compact dseign and works more efficiently to clean my gums. I recently went to the dentist and received a great report on my gum care. I told them it was because of the new WaterPik with its many different tools and its powerful stream of water.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  Just returned from my first dental cleaning since purchasing the Water Flosser and the dentist said &amp;#34;What ever you are doing keep it up.&amp;#34;  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> As a ten plus-year user of Waterpiks, I must say that the old design was much easier to use than this one. These parts  fit like a puzzle, rather than lock together, causing this thing to get dropped frequently when you pick it up. Hate it! The old model, which had the water reservoir that inverted and covered the entire unit was a much smarter design. If you want to leave the unit on your bathroom counter, which isn&#x27;t very sanitary, then you might be in luck. If you want to put in your cabinet every day, then be prepared to drop it all the time.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my teeth.  I cured myself of gingivitis with this Waterpik flosser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Effective&lt;br /&gt;Easy setup&lt;br /&gt;Reliable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I had the old water pic and it finally died after maybe 15 YEARS!!! Love the new accessory brushes, especially the one for plac. Took the orthodonic brush to work and put it on the company bulliten boad for anyone who had the Waterpik and has children that were in braces. I was gone immediately!</li>
    <li> It arrrived nicely packed fast and works great It is the best purchase I ever made for my teeth and I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and does not take up a lot of room which is nice. The cord isn&#x27;t very long, so it limits where I can actually place the unit on my sink counter top. Very powerful. I still don&#x27;t really know how to use it without making a complete mess. Water gets everywhere when I spray my teeth in between my braces and along my gum line, but it does help so that I don&#x27;t have to mess around with normal dental floss. I completely dry the reservoir and detach the nozzle after daily use, because I worry about what other reviewers have mentioned about mold in the handle. Overall, I like it. I just wish that it didn&#x27;t take so much time to clean up after use. Maybe that just me though.</li>
    <li> We use these every day.  Our dentist is happy with result.  Quality product; holds up for years.</li>
    <li> It works, a bit too big, like all these devices, it takes time and effort to use properly. Easier than flossing.</li>
    <li> This is my best friend with braces at 42 years old. The waterpik really reaches places that floss and a toothbrush can not reach.</li>
    <li> Happy with product and company that sold it.</li>
    <li> First time using the flosser last night and it worked so much better than our old model.  The tips are all undercover in the top which is a lot more sanitary than the old model we had.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Easy to use and can handle water and or mouthwash in the tank. Also has 10 pressure settings.</li>
    <li> A few months back I got a new dental bridge and the dentist recommended a water flosser.  I had used one many years ago when I had orthodontic work done so had something to compare this one to.  This new Waterpik device works well.  I find that if I use warm water that it&#x27;s more comfortable than using cold tap water. The lid (which holds the extra attachments) that sits on top of the device is sort of a pain to use as it opens up and spills the attachments.  I guess the solution to that is to remove the extra attachments and store them somewhere else.  If the lid was deeper this wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem.  Another solution would have been to have a better closure on the lid but this is related to the company&#x27;s design and doesn&#x27;t reflect on the seller.</li>
    <li> I thougt the water tank was big, but it turns out it&#x27;s the right size for one clean! at least for me.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest water flosser I&#x27;ve owned to date. Removing the attachments is very simple just push the little blue button and the attachment breaks away very easily. Plenty of water pressure for cleaning your teeth which can be adjusted. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> While generally happy with the &amp;#34;in mouth&amp;#34; performance of this product, after only a couple months of daily use, it leaks! The clear reservoir that sits on top is designed to be removed, filled with water and replaced. To facilitate this, there is a rubber valve on the bottom that is supposed to seal itself when not seated on the machine. Now, when water is added, it leaks like a sieve and I&#x27;ve got to quickly pull it from the sink and place it on the base as water runs all over the counter. Yes, I&#x27;ve made sure there is not something stuck in or under the valve. It just seems to have worn out too soon.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Good price.</li>
    <li> I had a classic waterpik flosser and it was so loud that it hurt my ears.  This one works great, has additional attachments that I didn&#x27;t get with my other waterpik and most importantly, this one is so much quieter.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended by by dentist for a gum issue I experienced.  It has resolved my problem and I like the product very much as my teeth and gums feel better when it is used.  I would recommend it for others who floss a lot.  It is very easy to use and does not take up a lot of space on my sink.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it at least twice a day. Best recommendation I ever got from a dentist technician.</li>
    <li> I have problems with my teeth and this waterkpik ultra water flosser has helped and it keeps my teeth cleaner and I dentist say&#x27;s it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Make my teeth feel great. Can wait to use it after every meal. It&#x27;s true that it can make your gum bleed at first, but you will get used to it.</li>
    <li> I was not as satisfied with this product as I had hoped. If I put the pressure higher than 2 it is hard to control.</li>
    <li> The great thing,Fast shipping, Brand new, non gray market, factory sealed box.Call quality is great.For me, and for everybody else, this thing is just about perfect.</li>
    <li> Loved this machine when I first got it. Loved it. However, it quit working after just a couple of months. What a waste of fifty bucks! Of course, I won&#x27;t replace it with the same brand - can&#x27;t afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/24: I&#x27;m upgrading my review from 1 star to 3 stars. I received an email from WaterPik this morning that they are shipping me a new unit, no charge. Very impressive customer service. Now, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if this one lasts...</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I went to the dentist and were told that we have early stages of gum disease, which was quite a shock as neither of us had cavities, bleeding, any dental problems at all, and we both floss. Our problem is in the back teeth (I guess both of us have narrow mouths) and the dentist suggested the Waterpik to help reach back there. We have had it for six months and the improvement of our gums in the back teeth have been remarkable. My husbands gums have healed up back to where he has no pockets and I am almost there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little awkward to use at first and I got water everywhere, but quickly it became another habit like brushing my teeth. Now I feel like my mouth is not clean unless I use the waterpik.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  o  Powerful water jet&lt;br /&gt;  o  Does remove debris from between teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  o  Reservoir lid design&lt;br /&gt;  o  Tip release button easy to inadvertently press&lt;br /&gt;  o  Does NOT replace flossing as I thought&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit works well enough, and so far has held up to nearly 6 months of daily use.  The water jet is very powerful when turned up to the maximum setting, and actually, one oral hygienist I go to (I alternate between my DDS office and a specialist every three months) advised me not to turn it above halfway.  I was very pleased to be able to use this in place of flossing.  However, when I went to the specialist&#x27;s office yesterday for a cleaning, the oral hygienist there advised me that this WILL NOT replace flossing, which is the main reason I purchased this unit.  She also found a worsening of the periodontal pocket depth, especially around the molars.  The only thing I have changed in my oral care routine was to stop flossing and start using this unit.  So I must conclude that the worsening is to to my lack of flossing.  I have resumed flossing and will continue to use this in conjunction with brushing, flossing, and antibacterial mouthwash, and see if subsequent visits reveal improved results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip on the wand can be easily removed by pressing the little blue button near the base of the tip.  Actually, it is a little *too* easy to accidentally depress.  Once I got used to this fact, I found myself holding the wand farther down to avoid this.  Not a &amp;#34;show stopper&amp;#34;, just a minor thing to take into account when you grip the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir lid has a place to store the extra tips, and they don&#x27;t even all fit correctly, and it doesn&#x27;t stay closed when they are inside.  So I ended up taking all of the extra tips out and putting them in a drawer.  Also, the design of the lid makes it awkward to handle and it can easily fall into the reservoir while you are trying to put it on.  Irealize it is probably impossible to make a perfect design, but IMHO they would have done better to make the lid a solid piece without the storage compartment, and add a knob on top by which to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I am skeptical that there has been any benefit by adding this to my oral care routine.  Given my experience, if I had it to do over, I would probably choose not to.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels so clean! Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this water flosser.  It is compact and fits well on my bathroom sink unlike many other waterpiks I have seen.  Since I bought this flosser, three other friends of mine have bought them and love them as well.  I use it every time after I eat.  When I am out of town, I really miss it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product as it seems to do a good job and provides a decent choice of options and controls. The only negative I have is that I have to be sure and use it before other folks here go to bed because this device is noisy when it&#x27;s running. Sounds somewhat like a water pump or air compressor.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Not only does it get rid of plaque/tarter, it seems to almost reverse gingivitis or other hygiene issues. I was one of those people growing up who wasn&#x27;t fortunate enough to go to the dentist. My father was a typical guy who didn&#x27;t handle these matters, and my mother was very afraid of the dentist. I was screwed. As a result, when I was 15 (1st trip), I had 7 cavities and it wasn&#x27;t a good start. Years later, now almost 28, this was my 4th trip to the dentist and with advanced technology, I was able to view my mouth on the monitor. I had a few cavities, and was in need of 2 extractions/root canals, but the dentist was amazed at my overall hygiene. He told me based on my charts (lack of dental history), he expected a lot worse. He even told me a few horror stories of people with similar history as mine. He complimented me on my teeth and was shocked that I don&#x27;t floss. I told him that I owe it to the Waterpik. He was amazed and told me to continue using it as a supplemental fix in between routine dental checkups. I am so grateful for this product because I should have had tons of plaque/tarter build-up, maybe even periodontal disease, but the Waterpik insures that I don&#x27;t. I am pleased with the purchase and will use it forever, if possible. Plus, now I am able to go to the dentist, so overall I am pleased with my new dental hygiene. Definitely owe big thanks to Waterpik!</li>
    <li> This is the first waterpik I have used.  My gums were getting sore alot.  I tried this and have not had any sore gums since.  I was surprised at how much food particles are left after flossing.  This is great.</li>
    <li> Very adequate water pressure enabling a thorough cleaning. My. mouth feels very refreshed. The waterpik was very quiet during its operation.</li>
    <li> I have crown &amp; bridges, so hard to keep particles out. This is a wonderful tool.  So many different attachments for so many different things. I would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I like using it so far.  I think it is going to be a good thing.  I definately like it more than flossing and it&#x27;s supposed to be the best one according to my dentist.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Mouth feels much cleaner..</li>
    <li> I have never owned a water pik and I am so disappointed it took me this long to get one. I received this item less than a week ago and I have already bought 2 more as gifts! The different settings are great (I am only using level 5 while building up the strength of my gums) and I can see the difference in the health of my gums already! In just a couple short days a problem bloody area is no longer irritated or bleeding. I would buy this product again and again, there is no downside.</li>
    <li> I went to the dentist and we had only used this for 1 week and he noticed a big difference in my gums. This waterpik really works. We are using it twice a day. My teeth feel so CLEAN.</li>
    <li> Does a very good job.</li>
    <li> Better than flossing by far.  Easy to use and my mouth feels cleaner for much longer.  The adjustable water pressure setting makes this a great tool for oral care while going thru chemotherapy.</li>
    <li> Great on-line price (much cheaper then stores).  Quality construction with large reservoir.  Includes nice power options &amp; several choices of spray tips.  Does a very good job cleaning your mouth.  Will still need to floss.</li>
    <li> I had one pocket in my gums that needed attention beyond the normal flossing and brushing.  This has made a difference and my dentist and I are very happy with the results.  Once I started using the Sonicare electric toothbrush (also purchased on Amazon) and the Waterpik flosser, I have sailed through the teeth cleaning appointments!  Very happy with both products.</li>
    <li> Once you&#x27;ve used this for a while, you get used to controlling the splashback.  Then you can concentrate on really getting the food out of your teeth!  Anyone with elaborate dental appliances will be thrilled with the way this flushes out the remnants of your last meal.  Messy to learn to coordinate the water jet aim, but once you see what you had stuck in your teeth, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever got by without it.</li>
    <li> We use it after we floss and it gives you that completely clean feeling. You can often get a little more VISABLE debris out of your teeth even after brushing and flossing.  I feel confident that when used after flossing you can get more invisible bacterial debris out of your mouth.</li>
    <li> Product works great and is easy to use. There are too many attachments. I&#x27;ve tried several and like the rubber tipped one the most.  It&#x27;s important to use warm water (more than lukewarm) because it cools down as soon as it gets into the plastic container.  Also, let the water run through the tip for about 10 seconds to clear out the cold water. It&#x27;s amazing what little pieces of food particles this waterpik flushes out. It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
    <li> The waterpik brand is far superior to it&#x27;s competition, I made the mistake of buying the interplak brand first.  The water pressure is on the waterpik gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Crazy how much stuff comes out of your mouth. Just be easy with the setting. Start low and work your way up.</li>
    <li> Seriously, get rid of your floss.  I can floss and rinse and actually follow-up with Water Flosser and find that it always locates and removes other remains &#x27;stuff&amp;#34; left from flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Best dentist visits since I started using Waterpik over 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It can help you clean the food residue on your teeth. I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> Having tried another brand, we returned to this model. It is the sturdiest and most effective of those currently on the market. only drawback is the clip for the device wears out much too fast.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great and shipping went well. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the waterpik flosser.  My kids (ages 8 and 6) aren&#x27;t super impressed though.  They both thought it was a bit too much pressure, even when turned down.  Hopefully they will get used to it in time.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this religiously every night.  We&#x27;ll know more about how effective it is after out next dentist visits.  It seems to be doing a good job.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Waterpik for nearly 2 years (May 2013) and it is still going strong.  I use it at least once a day. After brushing and flossing it still flushes out food I missed so I feel my gums are much cleaner afterwards.  The button sticks a little but not so it can&#x27;t be used.  I also regularly use the periodontal tip since I have periodontal disease.  I haven&#x27;t had to replace any of the parts as of yet.</li>
    <li> Item received as described and I love it. Wish I would have used this a long time ago, although I will say it doesn&#x27;t beat dental floss for removing heavy deposits from in between your teeth. More like for maintenance after a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 2 years ago, for my husband and myself. I finally got fed up with walking across the bathroom (it&#x27;s a big bathroom, don&#x27;t judge!) to his sink, swapping out the tip, etc.... and bought a 2nd one for my personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle hose reaches easily from the back corner of my 30\\&quot; vanity to the sink without pulling it tight. It&#x27;s long enough to reach between most dual-sink vanities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds plenty of water for a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set pressure at 10, which is a pretty harsh jet. It has no trouble dislodging even stubborn popcorn hulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, with it&#x27;s small footprint, good power and long-ish hose, this is a terrific unit. I liked it so much I bought it again. What&#x27;s not to recommend?</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this unit was to get tiny food particles and bacteria out from under my cap.  You can put some salt water (I melt the salt in warm water in another container first) in the unit and just clean really well the dental work where bacteria gets caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say any solution used in it should be followed up with plain water to help rinse it out so I first do the salt water solution and then clean with plain water.  You can use Hydrogen Peroxide too but I would be careful with mouthwashes as I can see it gumming up the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is powerful and compared to the older units quieter although it just is always going to make enough noise to disturb someone still trying to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not come with the tongue scraper but an extra regular tip which is fine.  I have a tongue scraper anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a tip for cleaning braces which I think is a great idea but I just don&#x27;t need it.  I also use the tartar and massage tips.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Waterpik for years, but my new one is quieter and lighter in weight and every bit as effective as my old one. I find it to be essential in maintaining good oral hygiene and healthy gums. My dentist recommended me getting it years ago and ever since I&#x27;ve used it faithfully and my biyearly dental exams have proven that it is well worth owning the Waterpik. I feel it is as important as having a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as a gift and she loves it. It satisfies her hygiene obsession and is very easy to use, with just a few buttons and a dial. The reservoir is very easy to refill and clean even in a small sink due to its height and wide mouth. She&#x27;s had it for 5 months and so far, no problems.    [EDIT] After 21 months, the Waterpik is still working great.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get a waterpik for better tooth care and I am glad that I did that. The Waterpik works as promised and does a great job of cleaning the gums and removing food left in the mouth.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t always brush my teeth as often as I should, but I get super annoyed when I eat steak or popcorn or chips and get stuff stuck in my teeth.  This thing does what it says and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAREFUL!  It will literally blow your gums off!  Start off on 2 and do your whole mouth, then bump up from there.  I settled on 3.5 and warm water.  Any higher and my gums literally bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to that when you turn it on, it shoots water out immediately.  You have to press the button to STOP it, not START it.  I have forgotten before and taken it out of my mouth forgetting to hit the button, or accidentally letting off at the wrong time shooting water everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a ton of accessories, but I don&#x27;t see the point.  The main tip is all you need, and it comes with two, color coded white and blue so you can share this with someone without getting their mouth germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it will blow popcorn, meat, chips, crackers, and more out of your teeth, even after brushing.  You&#x27;ll be surprised at how effective it is.</li>
    <li> Very good, love the waterpik.  I also have the cordless.  Second cordless cause i just wore the other one out I used it so much.  Dentist loves that I&#x27;m using it also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for several weeks and like just about everything about it.  Not too noisy, easy to manipulate and adjust, easy to clean, etc.  It&#x27;s amazing how often food particles are dislodged, even after using my Sonicare.  No negatives thus far.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.  Took some practice to get used to it. Would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Wow! Mouth feels so fresh and clean. Gums are stimulated and dirty food you didn&#x27;t know was in your mouth succumbs to the waterpik.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really amazed that my dentist didn&#x27;t recommend one of these before. So much better than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; flossing, and is already improving my gum-disease issues. I think more people should pre-emptively get these instead of waiting until an amount of damage is done like I did.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s working, it works fine. However, after using it one year, charging it fully (24 hrs) when needed, it lost its strength. This the second Waterpik. The last one did the same thing. I&#x27;m ready to throw it out and look for something else. Too expensive to replace annually.</li>
    <li> We all enjoying it!!! Great flosser!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> My previous water pik died after 25 years, so this was a replacement.  It works just as well as the original.  I like the assortment of pik end tips, as they give me more cleaning options.  The reservoir for water is a bit smaller than my old one, so I have to refill it once during my cleaning session.  The new water pik is also a bit lighter in weight and tends to move around when I try to shut it off.  All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the new water pik.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it functions but i don&#x27;t like the way it feels</li>
    <li> Great flosser!  However, you can buy it cheaper from Walmart for $49.97:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Wow, so you can do better than just floss huh?  This thing works well.</li>
    <li> No mention in advert that this only works in US. When I plugged it in and started it, that ruined it.</li>
    <li> Works well but is very loud so if you have roommates or close neighbors keep that in mind</li>
    <li> Flosser is great and is pretty powerful on the 10 setting which I use. It will get hit your gums pretty hard so don&#x27;t be surprised if you spit a little blood out. It&#x27;s GREAT for getting the real far back areas on the mouth which is hard with floss. This isn&#x27;t here to replace the use of Floss but to aid in teeth cleaning. I still use my dental floss and follow up with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 star: Because the button used to stop the water from spraying gets stuck during use and it is annoying.</li>
    <li> I am an adult with braces, 35yr, just had them &#x27;installed&#x27; a few months ago. I do not know why in the world orthodontists don&#x27;t automatically send you home with one of these after your new &#x27;hardware&#x27; has been mounted in place! I now realize that my teeth have never actually been clean this whole time and that includes 15-20 minutes a night with special brushes, impossible floss and other &#x27;tools&#x27; for these braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My parents had an old Waterpik (same model, old packaging) that kept on working, so I borrowed it for a few nights and didn&#x27;t want to part. It was beautifully gross to see all the &#x27;extra&#x27; food flush out of my mouth with the waterpik and that was AFTER brushing and brushing and re-brushing to get them clean. I never realized how much was actually left in there, hidden from the brush, stuck under the metal, bacteria waiting to feed off it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Please, for the love of your teeth, if you have braces, order a waterpik! You are already purchasing a &#x27;major appliance&#x27; for your mouth anyway, just think of this as insurance for it. A small investment to pay for a happier smile. And toss the nasty and pointless toothpaste... just use baking soda on your brush and/or dissolve some in the water to use in the waterpik. Baking soda helps to balance the pH levels in your mouth so bad bacteria can&#x27;t grow... Like you can even pronounce the ingredients in your tube of paste, let alone know what its really doing to your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  By the way, my three children, 5, 8, 12, love it also! I wouldn&#x27;t get the &#x27;Kid&#x27; version if your little ones are 6-7 or older as my 8yr is already at level 6 in the intensity and the kid version only goes up to 3. I guess level 3 is fine for some people, but I am using this in place of floss because of braces and you need more intensity then 3 to get the job done. And since these last a long time, your kids will probably grow out of the level 3 quickly. Just a thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, if you want a clean mouth, braces or not, toss some baking soda in the water tub with warm water, stir and cut on the dentist in a tube. Slowly work your way up to 9 or 10 (over a few weeks) and get ready to feel satisfied! ☺r not, toss some baking soda in the water tub with warm water, stir and cut on the dentist in a tube. Slowly work your way up to 9 or 10 (over a few weeks) and get ready to feel satisfied! ☺</li>
    <li> What a piece of crap! My hygienist said this is nonsense and the best is to just use floss and rinse. Used this for over 2 months with nowhere near the same results as just floss. waste of money!</li>
    <li> Love it! This product is very good for deep cleaning to avoid the extreme high cost of corporate dentists offices. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2, one for myself 1 for my mom, we love them, I plan to purchase more for my family</li>
    <li> It gives you a great job of cleaning and massaging of your gums and the pressure&#x27;s are great between 7-8 for cleaning.</li>
    <li> It is not too noisy.  I wish it could be turned up a few more pressure setting but overall it works.  The tank could stand to be a little larger too but refilling it is not that big of deal.  After over a year of use it is still going strong.  The dentist has noticed improvements since I added it to my personal care.</li>
    <li> This flosser is the best. I have some implants and dreaded using the thread flossers on the market for that purpose. They hurt when threading and tugging around the implant.  My dental hygienist uses a high powered water pulsing instrument to really clean and massage the gums. I saw this and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using this flosser for several months and my check-ups have been excellent. They are spreading the word through the practice for anyone who has implants and those without as well. I don&#x27;t use all the extra gadgets included in the package but this product is great. Can&#x27;t go to sleep without flossing &#x27;cause my mouth really feels clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased a waterpik after a bad wisdom toothache that was bugging me.I noticed a pretty embarrassing size crater on the same tooth after investigating with a flashlight. Yep, there&#x27;s a reason why you need to visit the dentist often! Silly, financially poor, reckless me!&lt;br /&gt;I thought my frequent flossing and brushing with a nice, expensive electric toothbrush was keeping cavities away, but apparently not. You&#x27;d be surprised what&#x27;s wrong with your teeth if you took the time to use a small mirror placed in your mouth and a flashlight(or just go to your dentist and they&#x27;ll explain how much your teeth suck - more fun to observe it yourself, I think). It&#x27;s frightening that I went so long without noticing a huge pit in my wisdom tooth simply because of standard bathroom lighting that was hiding my flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using the Waterpik(1-2 times a day, still using normal floss beforehand) my teeth feel a lot cleaner, and I&#x27;m more confident with my breath.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually a bit grossed out using it; despite intense brushing, mouthwash, and string flossing throughout the day, the waterpik manages to get out CHUNKS of food I couldnt see or feel. I literally see food falling in the sink, most noticeable around the bottom wisdom teeth. These aren&#x27;t small, mind you; they&#x27;re massive chunks that I cannot figure out where they couldve possibly been hiding, even when I use a flashlight beforehand to feed my curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cause of my massive cavity and toothache were now apparent; my \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, old fashion routine simply wasn&#x27;t cutting it. If you don&#x27;t own a Waterpik, neither is yours - maybe mostly if you still have wisdom tooth, especially if yours are hard to reach a toothbrush to. There&#x27;s just a lot of food hiding in your gums, and normal floss isn&#x27;t going to do anything about that.&lt;br /&gt;A waterpik feels MANDATORY to me now, and I&#x27;m going to make it my mission to warn everyone I care about that they desperately need to purchase one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theonly cons are that I wish the device had a smaller footprint; it doesn&#x27;t fit very well on my small sink, and I can&#x27;t keep it there throughout the day, so it stays underneath my sink until I&#x27;m ready. Also, I wish the hose attached to the waterpik handle was a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Made a huge difference with my gums - I use strong salt water in the unit to rinse and sterilize my gum pockets.  It gets a surprising amount of debris out, and I no longer get inflamed gums when something gets stuck.  The volume of water is more than adequate, finally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the various tips and while some variations don&#x27;t seem that useful, the overall function is sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the unit tolerates salt water fine - I run plain water through it after each use, and it has been fine for about 2 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously tried the cordless version (not enough water and unreliable), as well as the water faucet attachment (very reliable but ineffective without the pulsations), and this was a big improvement.</li>
    <li> Great item. I should have purchased this water flosser a long time ago. My dentist has been suggesting a product like this, but I just continued to use the dental floss - those days are gone.  I actually floss now more often because of how clean I feel afterward.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I just had a total joint replacement and learned that flossing could force bacteria into the bloodstream just as much as a dental treatment that my surgeon said I had to take antibiotics before I had done. The research I did said a water jet wasn&#x27;t an issue. It works very well, but don&#x27;t buy this model for all the other tips. The toothbrush isn&#x27;t effective and I won;t ever use the others.</li>
    <li> It works fine...price was right and it cleans my freaking teeth and gums...does everything I expected&lt;br /&gt;4 more words were necessary before you let me submit.....How utterly simple and silly.....</li>
    <li> Good price, good quality, does what it was designed to do.  New and improved design makes this newer model much better than the one I had before.  ,y older one died an natural death so this was a replacement product.  I like it better.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and eliminates the need for all the string floss. Makes the mouth feel really clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Arrive on time. Can&#x27;t wait to start using it.</li>
    <li> If you use sea salt and baking soda I suggest after each use that you run warm water (alone) to clean out the pipes if not you&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt; be having problems later. Great overall</li>
    <li> It could help wash the stuff stuck away. But it could not whiten the tooth or wash the old things.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested it and I bought this one. I love how it makes my teeth feel. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> works fine so far. thank you.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings on this product. Ill list pros and cons of why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful, dentist grade.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for people with braces, that&#x27;s why I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It was $10 cheaper here than walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what setting you put it on, it will make a mess of your face and bathroom mirror (splash back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about as loud as a professional blender even on it&#x27;s lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it only for two weeks and the stream off button on it is already getting stuck while using it which is very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about returning it but need it for my ortho care.</li>
    <li> Puchased this brand that was suggest by specialist.  After purchasing did look around in stores, but this particular one I haven&#x27;t seen.&lt;br /&gt;My husband goes to a specialist as well as the regular dentist (so 4 visits a year) - had one surgery on gums of 5 hours and second of 3 hrs in the last 20 years!&lt;br /&gt;With combination of using his previous timed toothbush and this waterpik - the regular dentist stated his teeth and gums looked great.  He hasn&#x27;t been back to the specialist yet.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  My teeth feel very clean after using this and they are shiny. The price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> After using this for about 5 months I don&#x27;t think I can ever live without one. It&#x27;s easily become part of my morning and evening routine. I look forward to it in the evenings when I have steak or popcorn or anything that get easily caught between teeth. Sometimes I&#x27;m amazed that I couldn&#x27;t feel some of this stuff stuck in between my teeth and I wonder how often this happened before I owned one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, if you get one use it with half water half mouthwash. Get the cheapy kind too because it&#x27;s gonna go fast. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fresh clean mouth.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was as promised. It is simple to use and works well. Fill the resevoir completely or you will run out of water before you finish. I just had my teeth cleaned this week and the Dentist was pleased with the absence of plaque. Admittedly, I use floss too, but this is quicker and easier. It has an on/off switch, a pressure regulator and a button on the wand that temporarily stops the flow of water.</li>
    <li> Does a great job! Just what I purchased it for.  A bit messy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact model twice before, but this one seems better than the others ever were.  The old one was years old  and I was happy with it, but there comes a time for everything. I know better now how not to break it when traveling.</li>
    <li> I like this unit. Easy to use but would like to have a longer cord.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the ease and efficiency of this waterpik and being able to adjust the strength of the flow to get in between tightly spaced teeth but after about 20 uses the hose connecting the water pik to the outflow on the bottom came loose and started leaking.  This caused a mess and a drop in pressure.  I&#x27;ve since had to reinsert the hose every time I use it at least twice.  It&#x27;s such a hassle and so poorly designed I really regret getting this.  If it weren&#x27;t for that flaw, I would give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like this flosser, but I have no room for it on my counter.  Therefore, I don&#x27;t take it out much to use it.  It takes some practice to use, and I usually end up spraying water all over the place.  It seems that the operating button works backwords:  You have to press it to STOP the flow of water.  If you are not pressing the button, water prays all over the place.  Otherwise, it seems to have a lot of power, but I just don&#x27;t see how it can clean BETWEEN your teeth as well as traditional dental floss does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one comes with lots of attachments, but I&#x27;ve only used the basic sprayer.  Don&#x27;t really know what someone would do with all of the other attachments!</li>
    <li> A perfect alternative to floss strings and piks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a small amount of mouthwash as mentioned in the product manual and it leaves a fresh clean feeling after use.</li>
    <li> I just received my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser today and I&#x27;m already loving it! My mouth felt so fresh and clean after using this product this morning. I don&#x27;t have any sort of dental work, but I hate flossing and have heard good things about Waterpik. I was a little concerned when I read that it causes you to drool, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t have that problem. The instructions it came with were easy to understand and very informative. This product is extremely easy to use and took minutes to set up and start using. The size is perfect and will fit comfortably on my counter or in a drawer. I will give an update after I get more use out of it.</li>
    <li> it really helped to clean the unreachable parts of my teeth and gum which i couldn&#x27;t take care of with the specialised brush. wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel clean and it will help my gums stay healthy.  Less work at the dentist. You should try one</li>
    <li> I love this two things to know. its a little large and make sure you dont put it on MAX pressure. IT WILL HURT.</li>
    <li> Bought it for our 13 year old daughter who just got braces.  She took to it quickly and it really helps keep things clean.  Besides, it was rated best by Hammacher Schlemmer!</li>
    <li> Love this water flosser! Have been using it since January 1st and can&#x27;t go a day without it. My dental hygienist kept recommending this unit and I had a waterpik many years ago and wasn&#x27;t excited about trying another one because I didn&#x27;t like that one. But I finally broke down and took her recommendation and I am not one bit sorry that I did. It has helped my gums immensely, and every time I use it my teeth feel so much cleaner than just brushing and regular flossing ever did.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to use. Only problem is I would like the hose on the handle to be longer. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and I think it is really too short for comfortable use.</li>
    <li> If you have braces, you NEED THIS! I am amazed how much crap is left in my teeth after I brush. The braces don&#x27;t help. I HATE flossing and never do, even when I didn&#x27;t have braces. This thing is the best thing ever invented.</li>
    <li> Highly satisfied with this water flosser. I would recommend it to everyone. I even got another one as a gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> I am not trying to be gross.  I always floss, but you will be shocked with what \\&quot;comes out\\&quot; with the waterpik.  It is now part of my nightly ritual.  A great product and a good habit!  You will to go to bed until you get all that residue out of your mouth!</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit in January 2011.  I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 times per week since then, at most 400 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today it broke.  The (much too short) hose connecting the handle to the body broke in two midway along its length.  I&#x27;ve never mistreated this unit, on the contrary I&#x27;ve always been careful to return the coiled hose neatly to its place.  The unit was never dropped or abused in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design flaws noted by many other reviewers were significant irritants.  Hose too short, tip release easy to trigger accidentally while in use, much lower pressure than earlier models, a knurled knob that fails to turn tips during use.  The top-heavy design makes tipping over all too easy, especially because the too-short hose forces you to balance the thing on the edge of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failing in less than 2.5 years is simply not acceptable.  I like the dental benefits of a genuine water jet.  Now I will go find one.</li>
    <li> It works much better than I thought it would and was recommended by my ortho.  I blast the heck out of the gunk between the teeth and keep the gum lines clean.</li>
    <li> I love water flosses, and because my love to this kind of devices, on April 28, 2013 I have ordered a WaterPick WP-100.  I received it in Miami and carried it to my country.  After unpacking the unit I have followed the instructions stated in the enclosed Manual.  I plugged the device, turn it on and poured a small amount of water into the sink.  It worked fine, but when I tried to use it on my mouth the device did not started any more.  I have tried to contact the manufacturer through its web customer service and I did not get any response.  After that, over the web page, contacted the company through the chat service and I didn&#x27;t get any solution.  To send back the device to the States is quit costly, almost the same value of the device, therefore I have sent it to be repaired by the local representative.  The problem is that the plaque that rectified the alternate electricity burned out, because it was a defective.  The repair cost me more than the amount I have paid for the device.  The repair was $U 1,500, equivalent to US$ 75.  Will Water Pick Inc. reimburse me for the repair cost?  If its service is the same the answer I have got in relations to my inquires, for sure not.  Anyway, I&#x27;ll try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 5 up-date: I&#x27;ll like to actualize the information:  Early this week I have send a message to Amazon describing the problems I feced with the Brand new the WaterPik.  They immediately answer my request and bring a prompt solution and make me a refund to cover the repair.  Now I&#x27;m using the device and it works fine.</li>
    <li> but I haven&#x27;t made a habit out of it, yet, as I only use it occasionally. Will probably update this review when I do get there, but till then, it does what it says and it is powerful enough.</li>
    <li> There is one problem that I have experienced after a few weeks of use. The rubber piece in the container part of the unit started leaking water while I was filling the container. I had to use the end of a tooth bruch to push down the rubber plug to stop the water leaking.&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe that this is normal. How do I correct this problem without sending the unit back to You. Could You send me one or two of these rubber plugs. Then I will be able to see if this is a normal problem, or just a one time occurance.&lt;br /&gt;  C. Wargat</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use, nice and compact.  Arrived quickly, great condition, great price!  : )</li>
    <li> This thing sounds like a car in your bathroom, and you have to refill the &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; constantly.  I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This was my Christmas gift to myself after getting mediocre check-ups with the last one coming with a warning I had gum disease starting !! I read the reviews and thought \\&quot; I will give it a try, what have I got to lose\\&quot;?? It is now 6 months later and I walked in the dentist office today over due by three months for a checkup. I was a little anxious and nervous as the hygienist started cleaning. For the first time in 20 years I didn&#x27;t hear anything about brushing better. After the cleaning, I got another gum disease check with a tool that goes under the gums and finds bad tissue. The hygienist&#x27;s tool was reading for the first time in years good readings with the gum disease now reversing!!! In fact, it was no longer finding weak tissue where before it was! I had an awesome checkup! Thanks Water Pik for a great product! If you are reading this and have been getting poor check ups, you should add the Water Pik to your routine too. I also had some help from the Sonic care toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Work great for removing food from your teeth that brushing misses.  You will be shocked at how much food is still food is still trapped between your teeth.  I am not kidding you could have a snack on what&#x27;s left over!  My gum health has dramatically improved since I bought this Waterpik!  Great tool and easy to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice unit. it&#x27;s small, compact, light weight and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Has 10 settings / speeds and is powerful and strong&lt;br /&gt;w/ plenty of tips.&lt;br /&gt;Very well designed. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> After using my last waterpik for about six years without any problems, the supply tube inside the handle started leaking. I figured it had outlived its useful life span and ordered this more compact model. It&#x27;s well designed and improved on the items I didn&#x27;t like on the old set (handle storage, location of adjustment knob, lack of reservoir cover). Finally an appliance that&#x27;s been designed by someone who put some thought into it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It works very well, and you can even use it to powerwash the toothpaste buildup out of your sink, but that gets a bit messy.</li>
    <li> Very compact and easy to use.Sits well on the counter smaller than other units I have used. Very clean and sanitary.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t floss nearly as much as I should, probably like alot of people, but I know its essential for healthy teeth and gums.  I figured I&#x27;d try this, hoping that its an easier option than pulling pieces of &#x27;string&#x27; between my teeth.  This waterpik is the bomb!!! I have managed to use setting 6 which is plenty powerful enough for blasting crap out from between my teeth, I cant imagine what the higher setting would do. I used the lowest setting for the first few days to let my gums get used to it. I did bleed I bit for the first few times, then that stopped. Within two weeks of using it my gums and mouth felt so much better, all those niggly little sensitive areas had gone.  Good Tip .....If your teeth are sensitive use nice warm water, regular cold tap water was too cold for me given the pressure that its hitting your teeth....now however I can use cold water if I choose, I also put about 3 or 4 caps of listerine into the water tank.......Now I floss twice a day.....why? Because this machine makes it sooooo easy.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying that I hate flossing, especially since I have a permanent retainer that requires I use special threader floss to floss. I bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser because I thought it would be an easier more effective way to floss between my teeth and around my retanier. There&#x27;s a small learning curve, but it really is easy after you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I decided to use the Waterpik Ultra Flosser exclusively (no string floss) for six months in between dentist visits to see if it could replace string flossing entirely. Unfortunately, the Waterpik Ultra Flosser wasn&#x27;t the success I hoped for. To my surprise, my dentist asked me if I flossed regualry and really got on me about flossing more! I was actually stunned and little embarassed at the end to tell her that I do floss daily with the Waterpik. She mentioned that it complements flossing, but stressed that it&#x27;s not a replacement for regular flossing. I&#x27;m inclined to believe her after my last visit. It really does help remove food lodged between your teeth, but as for plaque removal along the gum line it&#x27;s tough for to recommend. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of having braces, I can tell you that keeping your teeth clean and flossing are very time consuming and difficult.  I am fortunate enough to have heard about this water pik to save me the hassle of cleaning teeth that are very high maintenance.  You&#x27;ll find life much easier with this, I guarantee it!  I&#x27;m sure this works just as well for those with out braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip:  Make sure to keep the pik very close to your teeth.  As it&#x27;s in there try to keep the water inside your mouth while allowing the water to drizzle down the side of your mouth.  Don&#x27;t do what I did when i first got it.  I basically just turned it on high blast and tried cleaning my teeth from about an inch away.  Water sprayed everywhere while the jet stream hit me all over my face uncontrollably.</li>
    <li> AFter using this product for about a week or so, I noticed my oral&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hygiene had gotten a lot better. My gums had turned pink and the pain of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some of my teeth/gums had gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing alone can&#x27;t get into the part where the gums meet the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have over 3 mm deep pocks in my gums. My tooth brush can&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get into it. And as for using mouth washes like listerine. First off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;listerine is quite paintful to use. I tried different brands of mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;washes and all of them are quite paintful to use and on top of that the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad bread still presists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After when you used this product for the first time instantly, you&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feel the difference of your mouth. You&#x27;ll noticed a lot of left over food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comming out while using your waterpik that your toothbrush couldn&#x27;t get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rid of. You&#x27;ll still have to use your tooth brush but, this product the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waterpik will take your mouth freshness to the next level and maintain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product I noticed that I have bad breath every morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but after using this product I noticed that when I wake up every morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my mouth and breath feels like they&#x27;ve been brushed while I&#x27;m sleeping,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because my mouth stayed fresh without the bateria inside my mouth all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More detail review can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;pa0RoeoiEaE&amp;feature&#x3D;youtu.be</li>
    <li> This is the worst waterpik I&#x27;ve owned.  I have never had one that leaks before, and I think the leaking is inherent in the design.  One has to be very careful that the nozzle is seated properly or the water leaks out all over the counter.  The nozzle is also very easily unseated.  This product is not worth the bother, I would not but it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else--regardless of what Hammacher-Schlemmer says.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  We liked that this one came with 2 tips for personal use.....so you could call it a two person device.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job it is supposed to do very well.</li>
    <li> My mom had a Waterpik growing up, and always raved about it.  I never really put much thought into that for years as an adult....but after using this product IN COMBINATION with regular flossing (which should not be overlooked), it&#x27;s amazing just how much extra crud it will find that regular flossing just can&#x27;t get.  Additionally, it leaves your gums and entire mouth actually feeling invigorated and clean.  I cannot recommend this product enough - well worth the price....and knowing what I do now,I would actually have paid a lot more for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Waterpik!  (and thanks Mom)&lt;br /&gt;~e</li>
    <li> Trim, easily managed, changeable strength etc. Nice product. Easy to keep clean. Water pick heads are easily changed and maintain &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; for a long time.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a water-flosser you&#x27;re missing out. I grew up with one, back in the 80&#x27;s. That thing was built like a tank, and finally crapped-out on me a few years back. So a few months ago I came on Amazon to replace my beloved relic. As usual, prices on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat. It works the same as my old faithful, except the reservoir in this one is a decent amount bigger. The lid doubles as a handy place to store your extra pics. Nothing bad to say about this thing. It was packaged carefully and shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful!!!!!!! It cleans between teeths, leaving no particles of any food.&lt;br /&gt;Wii recomend to anyone who wants to hear.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flosser after I got braces as I found regular flossing to be a major pain and time consuming. Works great and is keeping my teeth clean. Even after the braces are removed, I will continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/22/14: Waterpik still going strong. I wash it once every couple of weeks and run some vinegar through it to clean out the internals.</li>
    <li> Needed a new Waterpik flosser and this one fits the bill.  The design is much nicer than the one I previously had and it works great.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without one for super clean feeling teeth.</li>
    <li> This flosser works great with braces. I like that it holds a good amount of water and has storage for the extra tips. With the ability to adjust pressure it can be used by anybody. My 9 year old even uses it. A great product!</li>
    <li> The controversy - use floss before or after you brush? The solution - use this Waterpik Water Flosser BEFORE you brush to blow all the debris out of your teeth... then brush... then use string floss... then rinse with a quality mouthwash.  I have been using this procedure - twice a day - and my teeth have never felt so healthy and clean. Months after my last cleaning with the Dental Hygienist, I still have NO TARTAR... NO PLAQUE.  My teeth used to bleed all the time... not anymore... no bleeding whatsoever.  Just fill the container with warm water, snap on your nozzle, adjust the pressure to a comfortable level, and watch the debris drop onto the sink basin... brush with very small circular motions... floss, rinse, and whala... a super fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Received in good time.  Item as indicated.  This is a great appliance.  Ordered this one to replace unit I had had for  20+ years. I really missed it before receiving the new one, which has some very good new features.  Smaller unit takes up less space.  Tips on board in unit that covers the water container when not in use.</li>
    <li> I recommend that everyone get a water flosser.. it is a product that will pay for itself in decreasing your dental cost (filling, cleanings and other major work)... never  thought that I would promote this product but I think it works wonders and the Waterpik company stands by its product.  I called about another one of their products and the customer service was OUTSTANDING.. I give this product and their company *+++ because the word customer and service goes hand in hand along with a great product....&lt;br /&gt;Stepphanie H.</li>
    <li> I have oral issues due to tongue cancer years ago and loss of saliva, as well as a deep pocket from the removal of an impacted wisdo tooth and its neighbor. I really liked the extra-clean feeling I had after each use of the Waterpik. When I first started using it, I could withstand only the low-pressure tip, but after a few weeks I was able to start using the high-pressure tip. But....the dang thing only lasted 4 months! Dead as a doornail and would not take a charge. At least Waterpik customer service was responsive to my call and immediately offered to send a replacement unit at no charge. Let&#x27;s hope it will last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I use t his product every day. Would highly recommend it. It gives the gums a workout. I would purchase again. Shipping was very speedy.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time tonight and I am sold. The instructions are easy to read and there were little bits of stuff in between my teeth that came out after I used string floss. A+ product.</li>
    <li> Works like expected.  Wish we didn&#x27;t have to write X number of words when three can do the trick. ok</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I buy one of these and I love it. I only wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
    <li> I like the Waterpic. This is 2nd one I&#x27;ve had. The first one was broken when dropped. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the water pressure is not high enough for my liking.</li>
    <li> I mouth feels so clean when I use it!  And my dentist is very happy with me for getting one to use.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From NZ (240v mains) so had to get a transformer and adapter, but no major issues.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my waterpik.  If I could change anything I would change the pressure just a little.  Easy to store.</li>
    <li> love it great product does a good job with no fuss would recommend to anyone who hates using dental floss or dental tape no more trying to hold on to dental floss</li>
    <li> You have to devote the time to use it, but it really works.  If your dentist suggested it, you ought to listen for your own sake.</li>
    <li> I looked at more expensive models at Target but decided to give this a try. It is powerful, easy to fit on our bathroom counter, and a great price!</li>
    <li> It works, but is messy and a bit of a hassle to use.  Water sprays everywhere.  I barely used it after about a month in.  It does a good job cleaning the gums and hard to reach spots between teeth.  Be prepared to change your shirt, though.</li>
    <li> My unit performs well but has a disturbing noise in the pump fan upon shut down. I suspect it is a bearing that will eventually fail before it should. Makes me wonder if this was a refurb?</li>
    <li> OK, so first off, yes, you&#x27;re right, flossing is always better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, who likes to floss? No one. If you do, you are not human, you&#x27;re an android. I think my girlfriend is one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at it like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we define flossing as 100% effective, and the waterpik as 50% effective, then which one is better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answer - the one you will actually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you floss only once a week (or month), versus using the Waterpik every night, which is better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this makes teeth time fun. You load it up with warm water and it really feels good on your gums and teeth. If it hurts, turn the dial down. If you&#x27;ve got some mega-gunk, dial it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, you will see all the food bits getting washed out from between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, next thing is comparing it to the Air Flosser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that, you have to press the button every second the entire time you&#x27;re using it. And the reservoir is tiny so you have to stop and fill it up several times. Lame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Waterpik, you fill it once, turn it on, and enjoy the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one and you&#x27;re partner will love it, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my brother had told me he was using a water flosser and that it had made a huge difference in his dental visit. It really has some power! The only thing I would change is that the on/off switch is on the body of the device instead of on the wand. It&#x27;s a little awkward when you have the thing in your mouth and you have to find the switch. There is a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; switch on the wand though but it&#x27;s still a little awkward for me. My brother has since bought the same model.</li>
    <li> 5 stars as a complement to regular dental flossing.  3.5 stars as a replacement to regular dental flossing.  When I first got this, I thought it was the greatest thing ever.  Mouth felt refreshing and it removed things that was left behind after regular dental flossing.  I liked it so much that I used it exclusively for 2.5 months without regular dental flossing.  When I went back to regular dental flossing, it proved to be a bit more challenging.  Floss string did not glide as easily.  That&#x27;s when I realized that the two products remove different things.  I think the water flosser is better at removing food particles that has recently been eaten while the string flosser is better at removing food particles that has been sitting in your mouth for the entire day.  Sure the water flosser can do the same but you&#x27;d have to keep the water flosser in the same spot for maybe 20 seconds to accomplish this.  So in conclusion, for the best result use it along with regular dental flossing rather than as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this unit, I have a couple of gripes.  The blue pause button on the handle gets stuck after a few months of use.  You&#x27;d press and hold it to pause the water flow but when you release the button, it remains depressed.  I no longer use the pause button on the handle, I just use the on/off button.  As for the lid that stores the tips, you can have mold build up from the moisture over time.  I now just keep the lid open overnight to let it air dry.  When the setting is on 10, the water will drain quickly and you&#x27;d have to refill a second time to get a complete cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it works for the price. When my dentist told me to get one he said that I could be looking at close to $100 so when I found this I was a little skeptical that it would work well. It is powerful and comes with a lot of attachments. I&#x27;ve got no complaints.</li>
    <li> Small, but effective. A little bit noisy, but it does the job. I recommend this model. Works well for the cost.</li>
    <li> This Waterpic is easy, clean and effective.  I use it every night and my mouth is fresh and in the morning it is not like an old sock..  The key is every night.  I have gone 7 years with just a cleaning at the dentist.  Paid for the waterpic many times over</li>
    <li> Same problem with all Teledyne Water picks. The hose is rigid and breaks where it leaves the device or enters the pick. Engineered to fail. You&#x27;ll probably get 6 months to a year usage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this particular Waterpik for about a year now and really like it. I don&#x27;t use all of the attachments, but at least they store inside the lid - out of the way. Compared to my old Interplak water jet this one is wonderful. Higher water pressure, better attachments, larger reservoir, cord storage area and a lid that completely covers the top of the reservoir to keep stuff out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if you think you&#x27;ll use it fairly often it&#x27;s a good investment - otherwise it will take up counter space &amp; outlet space in your bathroom, collecting dust and silently mocking your good intentions (much like my exercise equipment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my cat - hope you&#x27;re sitting down as I&#x27;m about to tell you a story. My Waterpik sits in the left-hand corner of my vanity slightly below a partition separating the vanity from the toilet. Next to the Waterpik is a decorative little jar/canister that I have cotton swabs in. My cat - he&#x27;s about 14 pounds of un-coordinated feline who thinks he is smaller than he really is. He&#x27;d climbed up on the partition to do some snooping (as he does) and managed to slip off of the partition, sloppily onto the vanity, knocking the lid off of the decorative jar as he fell. The lid came off, hit the power button on the Waterpik and all heck broke loose. You see, you must push the blue button on the handle to turn the flow OFF, not ON. Minty fresh mouthwash water pulsed out on my vanity, wall, mirror, some framed prints on the wall and me as I flew into the bathroom to see what kind of mayhem had occurred. I have discovered that the distance this thing can spray is pretty impressive, the air freshening qualities (while good) are not practical, those tilty oval mirrors we recently installed are pretty but a pain in the hind end to clean behind &amp; even fat cats can move pretty darned fast!</li>
    <li> Using it feels very good. But clean up after use it takes some time. Not to mention that you probably need to set it up every time before using it. To control the flow needs some skill. Otherwise, you easily splash water all over the place. BTW - once you master it, it is really comfortable in the mouth after use.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended because I was getting sore gums from stuff stuck even after I flossed. Good for the hard to get places. A warning though be careful when you first start to use it if you have never used one before follow the directions I hit myself in the eye a couple of times Lol</li>
    <li> I love my water pik great clean feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> Product worked okay but the water tube broke in less than a year of occasional use. Since that part is not replaceable, I lost an otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> The head is not.cleanable and if water gets in mold will grow. And trust me... water will find its way in... other than that it cleans better than flossing but the water runs out fast...</li>
    <li> I love this appliance.  I have tried all the different tips and find that I am much more attentive to my oral hygiene since I purchased this.  I have not experienced any problems others reported with leaking.  I rinse and dry after each use and thoroughly rinse the tips.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Ultra water flosser works well. Two improvements and it would get a five start rating. The tube that connects to the hand piece is too stiff and too short.</li>
    <li> Its cheap. ill give it that. however, I do not like the feature where it is always running, and to stop it you must press a button. shouldn&#x27;t it be the opposite?</li>
    <li> Flossing with regular dental floss is nothing compared to this WaterPik! I absolutely love this product, and I have started using it daily because of the clean refreshing feeling it gives my mouth my gums and my teeth.</li>
    <li> Works ok but a lot noisier than my last one which was the same model</li>
    <li> Waterpik has always been good for us!</li>
    <li> I think the headline says it all. I&#x27;ve tried other Waterpiks and products of similar ilk, but none compare to the great job this one does. Highly recommended. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Great purchase.  When the doc said as a result of my having dental implants they said that a waterpik might help ensure that my gums were ok.  By golly they were right.  This product did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I am very happy with it.  However, I agree with a reviewer that stated that the coiled tube could be a bit longer.  Not a problem, just an inconvenience.  Well worth the expenditure.</li>
    <li> I have never used a water pik before, but my dentist recommended that I start.  I like how my teeth feel after using it - very clean.</li>
    <li> Works very well, love that it ha lots of pressure and good size water tank to clean really good between teeth and the teeth themselves! Should have bought it a long time ago</li>
    <li> This is the first pik I have used and why? It cleans like there is no tomorrow! Truly a dentist fresh feeling everytime I use it! Buy this product.</li>
    <li> This has held up well to daily use for my three children.  We ordered extra heads so they all can use it.  Works well for braces and gets in those hard to get spots.  Price was better than any store.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars if the lid where the extra tips are stored did not open so easily when you remove it from the body of the Waterpik.  I have picked up the spilled tips too many times.  Otherwise, it is a great flosser</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a Waterpik, this is the one to get. My dentist and dental assistant recommended and I love it. I compared prices locally and other online and of course bought through Amazon!</li>
    <li> A quality product. I use it everyday and my dental hygienist says my teeth look better than ever. It has lots of attachments which are easy to swap out and has a nice ventilated storage compartment to keep them in so they don&#x27;t get lost.  You can set the pressure level from very low to very high. It does make some noise so don&#x27;t expect it to be silent but then it has a pump in it and those are rarely quite. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I should have tried one of these a long time ago! It does a great job of dislodging anything that may be stuck in your teeth and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh even before you have brushed. I haven&#x27;t done alot of accessory changes and can&#x27;t really comment on the extras. I just use the thinnest stream and crank the power up to get a very thorough rinse and floss. The only way it could be a little better would be maybe a little more length to the hose but not a huge deal. Well worth the amazon price.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, hard to get used to using and have a tendency to have water running down the unit, but that&#x27;s user error, not machine probs. (And is solved by having a wash cloth over the handle when using.) No complaints about this product - provides just enough water to thoroughly clean one time.</li>
    <li> why this article does not provide a range of voltage from 120 to 220V???&lt;br /&gt;His little brother (Waterflosser Waterpik for Kids) offers this possibility and is therefore compatible with European voltage. DO NOT BUY IT IF YOUR VOLTAGE IS NOT VOLTAGE 120V.&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik made ​​an effort! We are in 2013, internet affects a large part of the earth ...!&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it, fortunately Amazon Customer Service IS REALLY GREAT, FRIENDLY ET VERY PROFESSIONAL!!! THANKS FOR THE WAY YOU TOOK CARE ABOUT ME.</li>
    <li> Does its job with the different tips available to use. Bulky and not enough slots to put all tips. Works fast though!</li>
    <li> We were recommended by the dentist to purchase this water flosser for home use twice a day.  My husband had extensive bridgework done, and this model had multiple tips to use for the different types of flossing necessary to maintain his teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Replaced older Waterpik.  This one is very loud and so lightweight it vibrates and bounces.  Compared to original Waterpik, it must be a cheaper, lighter motor and pump.  Would not recommend to anyone until lightweight and noise problem is corrected.</li>
    <li> My old waterpik quit after about 15 years. No complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;This one is much easier to use and so much more attractive. I hid the old one after each use, but I can leave this one on the counter. It doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space and is attractive for what it is. So far, I am very pleased and I love how my gums feel after use. I did read other customer reviews to make a decision. I really wanted the hand held version but I feel I made the right choice in selecting the counter top version.</li>
    <li> Works brilliantly. My dentist and hygienist were very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It is so quick and easy to use.  I leave it on my counter and it doesn&#x27;t take up very much room, very convienent.  And my teeth feel so clean after each use.</li>
    <li> Very effective to floss. The adjustable power helps to adjust the pressure in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;Have a fresh feeling after I use it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job!  I&#x27;ve used the same product before and it doesn&#x27;t last forever.  At some point you have to buy a new one -- well worth it though!</li>
    <li> It is amazing how much debris comes out of your mouth with this.  I brush my teeth in the morning, and then use this before bed and in between.  I only use the pick part, I haven&#x27;t used the various attachments.  I empty the chamber each time and rinse it, to avoid buildup of mold or fungus.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it is so big it takes up a lot of room on the counter.  I never use more than about 1/4 of the water it holds, it seems like it could be smaller, but maybe the pump requires that size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this item is great &amp; it is certainly quality made. I&#x27;ve had an earlier model some years ago and it is a great product...but how dumb am I - when ordering it l forgot about the different power levels...cannot use it in my country...no wonder it was such a good price. oh well lesson learned, duh!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. The first one lasted for 8years. I highly recommend this to those concerned with good oral health and those that want to achieve a fresh cleansing to there teeth, gums tongue and entire mouth.</li>
    <li> works like a charm, so far, as I have used it for 2 weeks. It does what I expected. Hope it works as well for a long while.</li>
    <li> This new model from Waterpik is sweet.  It has a more compact design and is much quieter than the older model.  The handpiece fits nicely in the attached holder.  Looks better on the counter and has a great set of attachments.</li>
    <li> Helpful,cleans as promised,excellent product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product and loved it, but the button that controls the water flow jammed and won&#x27;t work. Company doesn&#x27;t give full refunds and I have to pay to return it.  They don&#x27;t make things like they used to.</li>
    <li> The life is changing after an item like this one.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second similar unit and saved a lot of money avoiding the dentistry visit, true !!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This device keeps my teeth feeling fresh and really does keep gingivitis away. I use it before sleep every day and although this is not a replacement for flossing I feel like I do not need to floss daily with this tool which is great.</li>
    <li> Very great and gets all the food stuck in your teeth. I would recommend being careful as it gets all over and cold water can make your teeth hurt. But overall, great product.</li>
    <li> Something very good, the effect is good.Each meal to use it, obviously feel very healthy mouth.Well worth buying.Would recommend friends to buy.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old waterpik so decided on this new Waterpik Water Flosser which is similar to my old Waterpik, but better. It has 10 settings which I like compared to my old model. Comes with a lot of different tools which I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but it&#x27;s nice to have a selection I guess. I use it at number 7 which is comfortable, not too much force. The water reservoir is a lot smaller than my old model, but it&#x27;s just enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to turbo-charge my flossing.  I find it helpful for getting debris out of odd corners that neither floss nor brush had removed, but it isn&#x27;t really a substitute for flossing.  And after using for a month or so, it still has an odd plastic smell that I find gross.&lt;br /&gt;I put up with the fact that I have parts of the product air-drying on the bathroom counter after using it.  The white lid on top of the water tank stores extra types of tips, but it is a bit of a hassle to to change them.  I&#x27;m giving it a three because, while it has its annoyances, I don&#x27;t know of another product that would accomplish the same goals without the fuss and mess.</li>
    <li> Does much better job of flossing than the old way with string.&lt;br /&gt;Some of my teeth are very close together and almost impossible to get the floss in between them for a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik has no problem getting in there. Does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;I put a cap full of mouthwash in the water and get a great tasting, clean mouth.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing so that&#x27;s why I ordered this water pik, now I love using it and makes my teeth and gums feel really clean.The tank is a llittle small but if its full when I start I finish just in time, or keep a cup handy to refill, I don&#x27;t know that I would want anything bigger since its sitting out on my sink!</li>
    <li> After only seven months, it is broken. I can get only a partial refund. The quality is questionable. I&#x27;ll never buy a Waterpic product again.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works just as well as the one I had in the good old days. Easy to fill and use. The top is a little hard to put on, but not really needed. Water pressure is easy to adjust. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of using this waterpik.  Unfortunately, the holder where you slide the handle into cracked and now it doesn&#x27;t want to stay securely in place.</li>
    <li> Have owned several water-pics over the years, and am impressed with the product improvements on this one. Nice compact design, operation much quieter, adjustable power level, and the coiled, stowed, connecting hose (which was always a failure point on previous ones I&#x27;ve owned) are welcome improvements. CR</li>
    <li> Over the long run the device should help people with gengivitis. It is easy to use and, so far, it has been sturdy.</li>
    <li> The great reviews on this product are correct.  Some of my teeth are so close together that food gets caught where it can&#x27;t be brushed or flossed out.  This water flosser is the perfect solution.  After cleaning my teeth as best as I can, I use the water flosser and I&#x27;m amazed how much more stuff is removed.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> MY dentist recommended I get a waterpik after I had a dental implant and a crown.  Regular flossing just doesn&#x27;t get in around the gum line like the waterpik does.  It is well worth the money and the little extra time to use it.</li>
    <li> works great.. does the job and works well on son&#x27;s braces.. I enjoy it for a deep clean as well</li>
    <li> I tried this product at the highest level 10 and my gum started to bleed (even though it didn&#x27;t hurt). I like it!</li>
    <li> use for the first time and loving it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone to try it&lt;br /&gt;my children also use it</li>
    <li> I really didnt need all the attachments and does take alot of space on sink.  the adjustable pressure is great but i winding cord could be longer......it does the job well though but i would have rather had the handheld one.  Another point is, if you keep your teeth flossed, bristle brush between teeth and brush well,,,,,you dont need this............if you have braces this is probably a good item to have.</li>
    <li> Really like this piece of kit for a thorough clean. Helps clear gum disease and clears all the gaps that your toothbrush won&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I just recently received it but have used it a few times already and love it.  I really like the storage top for all the different pick attachments.</li>
    <li> Makes my gums and my whole mouth feel good.  Takes a while learning how to hold it without getting a second shower though.</li>
    <li> If your like me and have permanent retainers, flossing is almost impossible. That is until I found the water pik. Works great!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXECLLENT.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 4 days - useless</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Love all of the attachments. I also like the variable pressure spray dial. I will use this alot.</li>
    <li> It started out great, but now I am having trouble with it....Don&#x27;t know if it will last...</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic, unknown BPA.  Has held up well for six months.  Good set of additional attachments.  Update October 2015.  The unit failed after being used four times a month.  It is junk in terms of longevity.  Not recommended</li>
    <li> Works great and fast shipping. A++++</li>
    <li> I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don&#x27;t think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.  Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can&#x27;t say it did much for me.  It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.  After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.    UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don&#x27;t want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a water pik for years and bought this one when my last older model finally started to fail (the handle was just coming apart. I could have taken the time to fix it but wanted a newer model anyway. I use my pik after breakfast and when I do my teeth before bed. It helps to remove food particles that a toothbrush doesn&#x27;t always remove and things caught between my teeth. I love the clean feeling. My dentist informed me this is no substitute for flossing (which I also do at night) and for brushing (which I also do morning and night) but I really like knowing I&#x27;ve done an excellent job of caring for my teeth and gums. The hygienist tells me my teeth always look great (twice a year cleanings). I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, it is wonderful</li>
    <li> So Far So Good.  A little messy, but works well for my needs.</li>
    <li> I use this religiously.  I that my mouth is cleaner and that my teeth are better.  My dentist agrees.  I use a low level because it&#x27;s quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those things I&#x27;d take with me to a desert island ;)</li>
    <li> Weird to get used to... you have to practice with it.&lt;br /&gt;Still working after two years, but I took back up flossing and rarely use this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just tired of the wet, the water, almost feel like you&#x27;re drooling on yourself sometimes and flossing, well I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Best purchased I&#x27;ve made this year.  Works great, was delivered next day as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this method of flossing, and I&#x27;m hooked!  Your first experience will be a little messy, but  as soon as you get the hang of it this is a great system.  Takes up very little room on your countertop.  Lots of different attachments to try.</li>
    <li> Worth the extra money over the battery operated clunker this replaced.  It seems that it really does eliminate the need to floss. My dentist will let me know otherwise!</li>
    <li> Our oral health has definitely improved since we started using this. Good pressure options. Makes flossing fun. Good capacity</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great........ Refreshes my mouth an d cleans around teeth.....</li>
    <li> Best one on the market. Easy, works great. I heard it was better than the newer model so I bought this one and am thrilled with it. The only reason it gets four stars is it is still VERY noisy. Not as bad as the clunky conair model we used to have but still too loud. Regardless, I&#x27;m happy, would recommend and definitely stick with the waterpik brand.</li>
    <li> Does the job but is a little messy because it&#x27;s hard to keep the pic in your mouth the whole time.</li>
    <li> Have used this for ten years.  They last between two and three years for us.  But, no cavities and no bad breath.</li>
    <li> Quick ship and love it</li>
    <li> This water-pick works very well and gets used daily good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife. she loves it. I&#x27;ve used it once or twice. i&#x27;ve never bothered getting one for me because my dentist told me my teeth are very tighter spaced together so this wouldn&#x27;t do me much good. He is mostly right, but it does help loosen things up before going to sleep.</li>
    <li> Works great, as advertised!</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving 2 Stars because it&#x27;s no where mentioned 110V .. I live where 220V is only mains available and had to buy a special transformer to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;Now imagine cables in the bathroom and transformer.. a big mess esp. when it comes to safety!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product itself is powerful, helps really getting tough spots you usually miss hitting using toothbrush. Unfortunately, stopped using this product due to Electricity issue being inconvenient to use on daily basis.</li>
    <li> Works great but ask me more after my dad&#x27;s appt</li>
    <li> This sounds like a great idea but in reality water squirts all over the place.  We have had two countertop floods after our kids tried to use it with braces.  The orthodontist said that he too was conflicted about recommending the Waterpik to patient families because of the mess and flooding caused in his home.  Even used successfully, the pik does remove debris but is not a substitute for brushing or flossing.</li>
    <li> Performs very well, particularly through its strong pressure/pulse effectiveness with my fully implanted permanent teeth which are ridiculously difficult to impossible to effectively floss mechanically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Draw backs are:  1. Extremely light weight, cheap feeling wand. Unstable connection of the tip/wand point allowing rotation of the tip, compromising the accuracy of trying to securely place the tip in the ideal position to clean between the bars(implants) and gums. While the lid to reservoir interface is eventually quite good, positioning it is clumsy. Seems a slide in place hinge could accommodate this much better but the lid essentially acts as an accessory caddy and is more of a nuisance than a handy feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. . . This does the job.</li>
    <li> This actually is a pretty good item and I &#x27;m glad I bought it, but I only gave it 3 stars because shortly after purchasing it, the round bracket in the front that holds up the flossing wand broke, so now the handle does not stay up and gets water dripping all over my counter.  I can unplug it and wrap it around the whole unit to keep it in place but it is a pain.  So, it is a little messy but a good concept, just wish that it had been made a bit more sturdy.</li>
    <li> This has been very useful to me. It cleans my teeth and mouth much better than just the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have had WaterPik units for years with no significant problems.Things are different now.Initially,the reservoir valve leaked;the company sent a replacement which also leaked.The process was repeated and the second replacement worked.The unit then began to leak from the bottom in the area of the handle connection.The rep wanted to send me a new reservoir valve but I finally convinced her that the leak was indeed  from the bottom of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent out a new handle which I dutifully and carefully installed only to have the leak continue.I once again called  the service number and when confronted with the problem,&amp;#34;Kelly&amp;#34; the rep told me that the leak occurred because I left water in the reservoir and that was the way the unit was designed.I replied that this was nonsensical and that we were dealing with a closed system.I went on to say that I was not stupid,and Kelly retorted that neither was she.I then respectfully requested to talk to a supervisor,whereupon she hung up on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irate,I redialled the service number and talked to Luke who was quite understanding and,after checking my service history,he stated that a replacement would be sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary the unit was defective from the start and the service experience left a bad taste.When a dog is peeing on one&#x27;s leg,one does not appreciate being told that it&#x27;s raining.If i sound &amp;#34;pissed off&amp;#34;,I am indeed !</li>
    <li> Well,  I bought this for my mother for her birthday.  She loves it.  I like the top part that holds the tips; the loses things easily, so this will be good for her.  This thing shoots water across the room pretty good.  It works great.  She will now use it every night before she goes to bed, and it really works. This is not something she would buy herself either.  our dentist recommended she use a water pick.</li>
    <li> I am having this water pick next to my toothbrush and use as before brushing my teeth. Works better than flossing for difficult to reach places. It is quick and effective. I was wondering at first if it would have enough power, but it is more than enough to clean and remove debris between teeth.  And as power is adjustable, I do select  7 out of 10, but it is still too harsh and cause my gums bleeding – I am having very sensitive gum around one tooth. This one replaces the flossing for me  and I like it very much !</li>
    <li> You know this is an amazing product when you use this after brushing your teeth and realize that the waterpik is blowing crap out of your teeth still. I seriously use this to clean the gunk around my tub as well as my bathroom sink in the hard to clean places. I use to scrub hard with a toothbrush between the faucets but now with the waterpik, it not only cleans my teeth, it also helps with my household chores. I always do this to demonstrate to my friends what this product is capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can set the water pressure from low to high depending on how comfortable you are with the high powered pressure in your mouth. I usually use the standard water jet tip on a medium pressure power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond 20%... you&#x27;re welcome</li>
    <li> I just recently got braces and 4 teeth pulled. So food CONSTANTLY gets stuck around my wires and in between my teeth so when I come home, i go straight to the bathroom and everything&#x27;s good again! I love this one and probably won&#x27;t buy another until this one breaks.</li>
    <li> Great price and worked as advertised! Good build quality too, I recommend.</li>
    <li> The product fulfilled all my expectations. As a matter of fact, I already new the product based on feedbacks provided to me by an acquitance that bought the product some time ago and gave me good references about it. I certainly recommend it to other Amazon&#x27;s customers.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully but have a tub of super glue handy. The front plastic holder part breaks on either side very easily. I&#x27;m not upset enough to lower the star rating because it works for what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Although the Waterpik does a great job cleaning between your teeth (even removing food that a toothbrush and dental floss misses), the design of the unit is poor. The cradle that holds the flosser to the base doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve had to replace the unit twice in three years because the cradle has broken. It needs to be constructed of a flexible material because the hard plastic cracks off easily and the unit is useless when the pik doesn&#x27;t stay mounted on the base. (Even when you think you&#x27;ve used all the water in the reservoir, some remains in the unit, and if the pik isn&#x27;t set securely onto the base, water leaks all over the counter.) When I contacted Waterpik to tell them about this problem, they suggested that I wasn&#x27;t replacing the pik properly in the cradle... that I should gently replace it from above. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing. The problem is with the design, not with my use of the flosser.  So why do I continue to buy this product? Because I haven&#x27;t found anything that does as good a job cleaning between my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool in our home. Every one uses it daily and our teeth/gums have never felt better. Our dentist even noticed. It is very easy to use, just go slow and dont increase the pressure to fast, its not good for your gums.</li>
    <li> I use this tool everyday.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, adjust and holds plenty of water. I personally use the pocket pik once a week and my oral pocket depth has been cut in half! I&#x27;m not super fond of the tongue cleaner, it just sort of shoots water downward. I use the regular pik, the toothbrush, and the pocket pik attachment. My mom also got one and after a month of using it, our dentist exclaimed what a big difference he saw in her teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little on the noisy side, but doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space. My dentist recommended about a capfull of hydrogen peroxide per tank of water, and I add a little mouth wash as well. There&#x27;s no alcohol burn and your mouth feels fresh when you&#x27;re done !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas the packaging was done well nothing was damaged. He loves it apparently better than flossing! His mouth never felt so clean!!!!!</li>
    <li> its great i would buy an other one from you in a sec.i will tell my famile and friends about this so they to can buy it  thank you</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Waterpik Ultra.  It makes my teeth feel much cleaner than brushing alone.  The design is aesthetically pleasing.  It is compact.  There are numerous settings as far as water pressure. I was pleased with the various heads included in their own ventilated storage case.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is our second water pik by same manufacture. This product is much quieter and contiues to be very easy to operate. we love it.</li>
    <li> Very low pressure... would prefer to have some more power.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific water flosser.  Everything fits on it and it&#x27;s easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little obsessive when it comes to oral hygiene, this Waterpik makes it easier to obsess less. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use, right out of the box. After a day or two on a lower setting, I was able to turn it up to full pressure and while it is a bit messy and loud (the cord bounces against the machine on mine), it&#x27;s worth it to have that nice clean feeling to start your morning and before going to bed. Dental visits have never been better! I purchased a second unit to replace one that was misplaced during our move.</li>
    <li> &gt; &gt; &gt; Very Beneficial As Part of a Total Oral Hygeine Plan &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Can I really say more than the 2500 positive Amazon Reviews establishing this oral hygeine tool as a most beneficial part of one&#x27;s total oral hygeine plan.  Expect a learning curve and each day focus at getting your technique better.  Messy (water everywhere) in the beginning and better in time.  Increase your pressure gradually and focus on gentle, yet thorough cleaning.  This comes with several different tips including a \\&quot;tongue scrapper\\&quot; to remove accumulated \\&quot;oxygen hating\\&quot; bacteria that work their way into one&#x27;s tongue crevices - a \\&quot;tongue scrapper\\&quot; whether this tip or a standard \\&quot;tongue scrapper\\&quot; will help clear out a great many of these \\&quot;oxygen hating\\&quot; bacteria, the ones that contribute to bad breath, cavities, and gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; [[ASIN:B000XPX2FM WaterPik BRP-2 Pik Pocket Replacement Jet Tips (Pack of 2)]] Consider at least checking out these Water Pik Ultra Pik Pocket Tips especially if your dental check ups are showing gum pockets in excess of 3 mm.  As a suggestion consider asking your dentist for a copy of your gum pocket chart so you can give careful attention to areas of your gums and teeth that need special attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I used the original waterpik and then there was a concern about the pressure injecting bad bacteria/virus into the gum and blood stream and reaching the heart.  From what I have studied and reviewed this is no longer a concern and the newest version (here) of the waterpik is beneficial.  Some now indicate that good oral health equates to good body health.

Guess what?  The teeth you need to check on most are the ones in the back, especially the sides next to your tongue.  You will also need a hand held mirror, one with double magnification is good, and the LED light will light up your mouth.  His statement about oral health is that you only have to take care of the teeth you want to keep.  He is not an advocate of flouride even though the ADA (American Dental Association) only endorses products that contain flouride.  My thought is if you use flouride products don&#x27;t swallow them; spit them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Along with spitting out and not swallowing flouride there appears to be evidence about also avoiding Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Alcohol can traumatize tissue in the mouth as well as other parts of one&#x27;s body it comes into contact with.  Alcohol also \\&quot;dries\\&quot; and \\&quot;Dry Mouth\\&quot; is something that needs attention and possible treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) is an ingredient in many personal care products, including soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and mouthwash. It is relatively inexpensive and foams up easily.  It is often described as a detergent or degreaser, but it functions primarily as a surfactant, so that oil-based ingredients can combine more easily with water-based ingredients. A secondary function of SLS is to provide the foaming action that makes it feel like something spectacular is happening in your mouth. There is little scientific proof that SLS removes tartar, plaque, or biofilm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; You will likely benefit from seriously considering not using SLS containing products in your mouth. SLS has been blamed for a number of different conditions, including canker sores and bad breath. The harshness of this detergent can aggravate existing oral problems, and cause some new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000052YED Rembrandt Premium Whitening Mint Toothpaste with Fluoride (For Canker Sore Sufferers) - 3 oz]] This product from Johnson &amp; Johnson works good for helping canker sores (the sores in your mouth and gums; not the sores on the lips).  It does contain fluoride; I use it at times and it makes my gum tissue and any sores get better.  The very fine light gray print on the back of the tube includes this:  \\&quot;If more than the amount used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.\\&quot;  My thoughts again are don&#x27;t swallow and spit it out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004CDA3VW The new generation US patented, non-nylon, tapered, soft, and ultra fine bristles - Yorum 5 manual toothbrushes --- for people with larger-sized mouths, please buy our AFT Multiple Pattern 5 Manual Toothbrushes]] and [[ASIN:B004CD8B2A bc OralCare New Generation Toothbrushes, Sensitive Medium, Ultra fine bristles, Deep Penetration]]  I like to use both the white and black to color code so each brush gets more time to dry out.

Consider using Alcohol and SLS Free oral products and don&#x27;t swallow them when you are done instead spit them out.

    <li> The product works great. It is used to clean around braces and the gum line. It is used once a day.</li>
    <li> This Flosser is wonderful i put the level to 5 and it was enough to give me a great cleaning. I recommend this for anyone. Good price and great functioning.</li>
    <li> We have been using Waterpik for about 20 years. This model is an improvement over earlier model because it is quieter. This unit does a good job of cleaning out particles between teeth. You will do well to purchase one.</li>
    <li> Saw this at Walmart for $12 more, bought at Amazon prime for $44 with no shipping charges either. Comes with 6 attachments, of which 3 are very useful: the classic tip, the plaque tip, and the orthodontic tip, 1 has some benefits: the toothbrush tip and 2 are hard to imagine the need for: tongue cleaner and Pik pocket. Seems to be built very solidly, and the new tips have eliminated the problem of the top of the tip separating from the base. I liked the new model much more than previous models I have bought over the past 32 years I&#x27;ve been using water piks. A definite recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as well as a[[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] back in 2010 based on a reddit post and still use both to this day. They have improved the health of both my gums an my overall mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossing with this requires very little work. All you have to do is refill the water reservoir and press on. Sometimes it feels so good, I do two cycles through all my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate the regular floss because it was such a hassle but with is product, no only is it easy but it feels great both during flossing and after your done.</li>
    <li> I received my water-pik a couple of weeks ago, and I love it.  I had a water-pik before this one, for about 40 years.  It still worked , but the tips leaked and I could not find replacements.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is more of the standard tips should be included for more than 1 user.</li>
    <li> Great product that does the job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpik products for almost 40 years...and give them major credit for good reports at dental checks.  Although the pros say not, I find them to be more effective than flossing.  A combination of both is probably the best preventive program.  My only wish is that Waterpik would allow slightly higher pressure on the pulsating water.  It seemed to me that the original versions had a little more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; than the newer models.  Aside from that, they do a great job.  A word of caution...they are not wired for use on 220v power (found in many European countries), and do not work well with a converter.  Not recommended for use on anything other than 110 volt, 60 cycle AC power.</li>
    <li> Purchased the waterpik after son had braces put on.  orthodontist recommend this for helping keep braces and teeth clean.  Priced one at wal-mart and it was like $15 more.  Son only uses the one attachment and it seems to be working just as described.  Have had for 2 months now and no problems.</li>
    <li> I love using this for the most part, but there are minor parts that could use some fixing to make using it a better experience. Actual rating would be a 3.5/5 if that were possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job at cleaning out your mouth and the various pressures vary from a light rinse to a fairly powerful jet.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple heads provide a variety of cleaning options. I primarily stick to one, but nice to have options and they fit well in storage. (Well there&#x27;s action not enough room for all the heads but I just tossed one).&lt;br /&gt;Can mix in mouthwash. I don&#x27;t do this all the time but I like having the ability, makes your mouth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to lock the head into place on its rotation is flimsy. I&#x27;d appreciate a more sturdy design structure where it wasn&#x27;t moving accidentally all the time. The ability to rotate is a plus but I&#x27;d almost prefer to lose that and gain a more sturdy device.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;hold\\&quot; button might be better as a switch similar to the power switch. If you&#x27;re adjusting your hand you sometimes lose the pressure on it and end up squirting yourself, your bathroom mirror, or something else in the room.&lt;br /&gt;Takes up a lot of surface area in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if who didn&#x27;t like conventional floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solved my problem of gums inflammation (gingivitis) and improved breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying more tips you can share with all the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use warm water if you have sensitivity to cold water.</li>
    <li> Geat product. I hate flossing, I mean HATE flossing. I should&#x27;ve gotten this a long time ago. My gums healed up and no longer hurt. Clean clean teeth!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist. The unit does a great job of flossing and cleaning. I wished I had started to use it years ago. Easy to use, clean, and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to friends and buy for other family members.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. The on/off button on the wand never worked properly.  Was always either stuck on or off. Would not recommend this product and will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I used Waterpik when I was a kid, so it&#x27;s only natural when it&#x27;s my kid&#x27;s turn to have one for the little one. The product worked as well as I remembered it except it came with a few more accessories. Very good price. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to review this, considering I purchased it well over 2 years ago. I purchased this for the man of the house since he supposedly has/had (does it ever go away?) periodontal disease. Long story short, I am the one who has ended up using it the most. Yes, it&#x27;s a little messy and requires a bit of a laborious routine, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine: I primarily use only one attachment (what I call the main one without a brush), and sometimes the pic-pocket. I fill the reservoir to the top with warm water (sensitive teeth), sometimes add some mouthwash (instructions tell you what you should avoid) and use on a setting between 4-5. Note: I used to use this at full steam (10), but read somewhere that it&#x27;s not necessarily good for gums to do so. Now whether that&#x27;s true or not is debatable, but I lowered it and over time, never really noticed. I think it&#x27;s just as effective on the lower setting, but that&#x27;s obviously a personal preference. Once the reservoir is empty, I shut it off, rinse and dry attachment, handle and reservoir. I do clean with vinegar periodically as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this dislodges more debris than regular flossing. Try flossing and then using this, and you will be surprised how much you missed. Also, I have had a lot of dental work (an implant and a few crowns), not to mention pocketing, so this is ideal for someone in a similar situation. It is fast and gets every last bit of stuff out. I still floss, although not as much, and I also use an electric toothbrush. All of these things in conjunction make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the last 6 months, I noticed that a leak had developed where the handle meets coiled tube. Consequently the pressure was affected, not to mention it was dripping badly. Tried tape as a temporary fix, but that didn&#x27;t cut it. As I was lurking about here on Amazon, checking out the prices of a replacement, I noticed that someone had mentioned a 3 year warranty. I promptly marched (and I mean marched..lol) up to the attic where I knew I still had the original box (yeah, don&#x27;t ask). Sure enough, it mentioned a 3 year warranty. I got on the phone with Waterpik and had a new handle assembly within a week. So if this happens to you, and more than likely it will, make sure you contact the company before doing anything else. Because I had purchased mine here on Amazon, I still had all of the pertinent information available; date of purchase, etc. All of the other info you need is found on the underside of the unit.  And even if you don&#x27;t have all the information, I believe you can purchase most parts through them (with codes for discounts) at a nominal rate. Replacement was very easy (only involves removing a couple of small screws from under the base), and I was back in business in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing some of the (shocking) customer photos of mold buildup in the handle, which frankly never occurred to me, I am glad I replaced mine. Even if you are out of warranty, the cost to replace the entire handle, including the coiled tube, is pretty cheap. Note to self and others, go directly to the Waterpik website for the best price. So there you have it. I hope this helps!n marched..lol) up to the attic where I knew I still had the original box (yeah, don&#x27;t ask). Sure enough, it mentioned a 3 year warranty.

    <li> Received the product for about a week now. It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, good first impression. It didn&#x27;t take a lot of space. Upon first use, I immediately felt my teeth were clean like out of the dentist office. I&#x27;d say it certainly beats the use of regular floss. After a week&#x27;s usage, I have no doubt I&#x27;d keep using it. One tip though: if your teeth is sensitive to cold, like I do, fill it with warm water. You&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted, great product, everything I expected including great care with shipping and instructions included.  It has solved my problems with hard-to-reach areas and feeling as if my I have performed a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> When my gum next to a molar swelled up and bled when I brushed it, I thought I was in for another very expensive dental treatment. Swelling is a bad sign: bacterial infection causing inflammation. Untreated gum inflammation can loosen your teeth, cause bone loss and loss of the tooth. Inflammation also affects your entire bodily system including your heart. Do NOT ignore gum problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $40-some dollars for this machine was a no-brainer compared to dental and medical treatments. If it does nothing else, it keeps the mouth cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as the most highly rated reviewer said: 2 weeks of diligently cleaning the gum pocket with the Pik Pocket tool, the swelling went down. I still clean it at least twice a day with a mild solution of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) and warm water. A dental hygienist told me that baking soda changes the pH of the water, making it less acidic, which helps to kill some germs. It&#x27;s cheap, safe, tastes a little salty. The only part of that I don&#x27;t like is it makes the water container and the tips cloudy. It washes out easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for mouthwash, its main active ingredient is alcohol. Read the label: 26% alcohol. I suppose it doesn&#x27;t hurt but I&#x27;d rather use baking soda.</li>
    <li> This unit works as promised. Note that I bought it for chronic wound care and not dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback to it is that it makes quite a mess in operation.</li>
    <li> After having 3 implants it was suggested that I get a water pik, which has been suggested over the years but ignored.  I decided after my investment in my teeth I should give it a try.  I was AMAZED at how well it works. A great investment and should have been thirty years ago.</li>
    <li> The best one I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I have had a few!</li>
    <li> loved it they were exactly what i was looking for, why do i have to write so many words, great product. wish it were closer....</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik flosser! My teeth feel just as clean as when I get out of the dentist&#x27;s office. I would recommend it to anyone who is not a flosser to those who floss daily like myself!! You will never go back to regular floss again!!!</li>
    <li> This waterpik is great!---My gums were bleeding very badly every time I brushed my teeth.  I don&#x27;t have dental insurance, so I decided to get this instead as an investment for my dental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In approx. 1 month, the bleeding is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now practice extremely great dental hygiene, in that I brush &amp; floss 3x a day, using this waterpik every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a mix of ice-cold water, 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide &amp; mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Handling this machine is awkward at first.  You end up getting water EVERYWHERE---but with a little perfect-practice, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Great, I love it and no other way one get the teeth so clean, gums and all.&lt;br /&gt;An must have in every household. For young and old.:)&lt;br /&gt;Monika Nilles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using waterpiks for years. After mine stopped working, I found this one that is so much better than the last one I had been using. The last one I had had the power on the handle itself and it use to slip and spray very hard when you did not want it to...this has the gauge on the unit itself and the on/off switch. Nice push button to release the brush too.</li>
    <li> Waterpik is good at clearing random bits of food from your gums.  Use warm water, not cold water or it is unpleasant.  There is an attachment that shoots a very narrow stream which works well for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Really glad I bought this.  My ex girlfriend is a dental assistant and she highly recommended this over some sonicare thing that cost twice as much!  It works really amazingly...  I hate flossing and using this thing is much more effective and easier to deal with.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I get tonsil stones. Sick and tired of having horrible breath, I found myself on different websites looking for a solution. Many pointed me to a Waterpik. I immediately ordered the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser based on others reviews saying that they blasted their tonsils with the water to remove the stones. Once I received my Waterpik, I filled it with water, turned it onto the lowest setting and attempted to aim the tip towards my tonsil. At first it was extremely awkward and I was practically gagging on the water, but it did the trick and completely cleared out all of the gunk in my tonsils. I have been using it almost every morning to prevent any stones from forming and I could not be happier! My breath is 100x better. While it takes some getting used to, it definitely works to remove tonsil stones. I would recommend this to anyone that is sick of having horrid breath due to tonsil stones.</li>
    <li> This was a second order for gift.  When I ordered waterpik ultra water flosser at first time, I just hope it worked okay.  Actually it worked more than I expected.  My mom loved this product and her gum was getting healty, clean and fresh.  She recomended to all family.  My second order was came fast, too.  You&#x27;ll not regret your choice.</li>
    <li> I have bridge work and the flosser does an excellent job of cleaning out food particles. It takes a little getting use to it, but works great!</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended this to me. I am so glad I bought it. Does an awesome job cleaning the nooks and crannies from my 2 bridges I have.</li>
    <li> The product was defective.  I was replacing another of the same model that worked great for years, but this one did not work correctly.  Even if you had the strength of the stream all the way up, water came out at low preasure.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is for a present but I&#x27;m sure he will love it.  It&#x27;s really nice.Will do a great job .</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the one I broke. It is better than the so-called portable one that I bought as a set.</li>
    <li> I have always been so worried about my sensitive gums. Every time I brush my teeth, they easily just bleed. And since my dentist told me to keep using those with softer bristles in order to prevent them from bleeding, he has also advised me to use gentle teeth cleansers as well. it was a good thing that I found out about the Waterpik. They can be tough on dirt, but then they are completely gentle on my gums. Also, it cleanses 93 percent more than brushing and using dental floss. It really is effective, it is worth all the money I spent on buying it. All those who have teeth and gum problems should definitely use this product. It is very easy to use, you won&#x27;t even have certain problems in cleaning up your teeth even if you&#x27;re wearing braces because the kit is complete.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful water pick.  My only qualification is that on the highest end of the water pick power level I could have used a bit more power.</li>
    <li> Love, love it, glad I finally got one.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Ordered this water pik from amazon great price got the free shipping. But when i got it in the mail i hooked it all up and hit the on button and nothing. It&#x27;s brand new and didn&#x27;t even work so unhappy that i waited over a week for a non working piece of crap. So i called the company an they are going to send me a new one. I hate to have to wait another week and half but oh well.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is amazing! My denting could not believe the results i have after starting to use this product. My gums are not bleeding at all any more. It cleans up all the stuff that floss sometimes misses. The results are incredible.  I went ahead and bought a portable system as well so I can take it with me when we travel.</li>
    <li> After a number of years with older model Waterpiks, I was very disappointed when I could no longer get a simple replacement pick and was &amp;#34;forced&amp;#34; to settle for buying a new, different model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic. All of the former faults have been reinvented and I love the new model . . . wouldn&#x27;t consider another older model.</li>
    <li> 3 days to san diego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fired right up...weird how there&#x27;s only 5 spots to put tips, but they give you 6 tips.</li>
    <li> This unit comes with a cover which hold 4 different tips. But the unit comes with six tips. So where to put the others. This is single use - only. If you are married or have a family, you need one for each person!?</li>
    <li> If you hate dental floss, but know you need to be flossing, this is for you. No more paper (floss) cuts on your mouth or fingers! I bought it for myself because I recently had to get a bridge put in, but my husband uses it even more religiously than I do. Good news is that there are enough of the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; device for everyone to have their own.</li>
    <li> Works very well.....makes my mouth and gums feel clean...recommended by my dentist .I recommend to anyway one who has gingivitis and gum problems</li>
    <li> jUST HAD MY TEETH CLEANED SO WANTED TO STAY ON TOP OF THEM, BOUGHT AN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AND THIS WATERPICK TO USE INSTEAD OF FLOSS, I CAN ADJUST THE SPEED OF WATER AND USE WARM WATER AND I LIKE THAT.</li>
    <li> Really cleans between teeth well.  It&#x27;s important not to aim at an angle at the gum line so water goes between the gums and the teeth, however, as the pressure can widen the pockets, exposing the area to inflammation.  Very helpful removing particles below fixed bridges.  I rely on my flosser prior to brushing, as it does a better job than brushing alone.</li>
    <li> I like this machine.  It seems to do what it is supposed to do.  I&#x27;ll know for sure when I see my dental hygienist.  It has varying levels of intensity and a nice selection of tips.  The directions are clear.  The water reservoir holds plenty of water. the tubing coils nicely and tucks away and the handle slides into the cradle easily.  It looks fine sitting on my bathroom vanity.  The reason for the 4 stars is the noise.  Although it isn&#x27;t any noisier than the last one I tried, it is still noisy considering other people in the household are trying to sleep when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought this years ago,After brushing the required 2 minutes, with sonicare easy clean, which I love. The waterpik gets more food between teeth.nd, so easy to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift for my son and he has convinced me to get one exactly like it for myself.</li>
    <li> Such a help was recommended by my dentist for my oral needs.  I found this one on the site which I had seen in a store and it was $5 cheaper.  I really liked the video someone had posted which helped me know how to use it.  I am very please with the results I feel after flossing with the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I have had 4, yes, four Waterpik Ultra Water Flossers in the last 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;I love using a waterpik but this model breaks easily. I am not typically hard on equipment.  My electric toothbrush is three years old.&lt;br /&gt;But the Ultra is not durable and I have had to replace it frequently because I can&#x27;t find a better machine.&lt;br /&gt;They last anywhere from six to nine months.&lt;br /&gt;What breaks?&lt;br /&gt;1) on off switch.&lt;br /&gt;2) bracket that holds the handle.&lt;br /&gt;3) leaks after short time.&lt;br /&gt;4) water force slowly dies and adjusting the dial does not help.&lt;br /&gt;5) cover cracks.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, so perhaps if it is not used so often it would hold up better.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my daughter that has braces.  Her orthodontist &amp; oral surgeon had recommended I get this for her.  I bought 2 of these, one for my daughters and one for my husband and myself.</li>
    <li> One of my friends introduced me to this one. I never liked flossing as it takes so much of time, but with this water flosser, flossing is fun and I would be done in like 2 min. Best part was when I went to the dentist for my regular check up, he said my teeth are clean and asked me what I am doing and to continue doing it.</li>
    <li> It works great. It is easy to use and very quiet and powerful. I just wish it held a bit more water.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed as I hate to Floss and this takes the place of flossing. It delivered in less time than was quoted to me. I bought one for my Daugter and my Daughter-in-law bought one for me.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works great as expected.  This is not the 1st Waterpik I&#x27;ve owned.  My 1st Waterpik had the pump fail after a few years of service.  That&#x27;s why I purchased this one. This newer style Waterpik was designed with an easily replaceable hose and wand assembly.  It&#x27;s a good thing, as I&#x27;ve replaced this assembly twice since I&#x27;ve owned this model.  The wand does not break or leak, just the hose develops a pin hole leak, which sprays water all over the user when it happens.  I use ONLY water and no other solutions in this Waterpik. The hose has never been kinked or bent. Seems like the hose wall thickness in too thin to me. I don&#x27;t own any other products where I&#x27;ve had to replace and/or repair the appliance 3 times in less than 10 years. I would rate the quality of the product low.  But, with few competing products on the market, this is just about the only game in town if you like using a Water Pick type device.  And it does do the job I expect it to do.  If I hadn&#x27;t had to repair/replace this product so many times, I would rate it higher (5 star).  Customer support was very friendly, but not real quick.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because my last Water Pik lasted 7 years with two people using it daily, and I was very happy with it.  The new one looks nice and fits on the sink better than the older model (very small pedestal sink).  It is also quieter (though the older one might have gotten noisier over the years).  The different types of picks that come with it seem a bit too specialized, though. I would gladly turn in the tongue scraper (the only one that seems useless) for another standard pick. I am very glad I purchased another Water-Pik .... this product rocks!  I would give this produce 4.5 stars if possible, subtracting 0.5 star because I think it should come with 2 standard picks.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure here:  I have an overcrowded mouth, many teeth and just not enough room.  So my teeth are a bit crooked making flossing/cleaning them difficult.  Food has an easy time finding it&#x27;s way nestled in the nooks and crannies.  The result: bad breath, unhealthy bleeding gums, soreness...basically gum disease and increasingly weak teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a slob though, I have never had a cavity or a major dental issue and really do want to make sure my mouth is healthy.  Like most people, I just HATE flossing (it hurts, it&#x27;s awkward, it&#x27;s hard to get in there) and/or forget or just am rushing out of the door in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution?  Make flossing easier, fun, and actually effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik is great.  I used it for the first time last night.  I could actual feel it hitting places between my teeth and below my gumline that I&#x27;ve only ever felt while getting facially abused by my dentist :-)  After only one use my mouth feels WAY cleaner, my gums feel a lot better, and my breath has improved dramatically.  I am confident after using this everyday my flossing problem will be solved.  The best thing about it is that I actually want to use the waterpik not just because it really works, but because it&#x27;s fun to use.  If I was a kid, I&#x27;d feel like I was playing dentist.  The waterpik comes with 5 or so different attachments for different uses so no matter what special need you might have it can cover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to get the portable waterpik instead of this more stationary one, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  1. This has a good sized tank, so you can take as long as you need to do your cleaning (I was able to go for about 10 mins on one tank).  2. This plugs into the wall, so no worries about corroded charge ports commonly associated with the portable options.  This is very smartly designed to, the tank cover doubles as a holder for your attachements, the cable is coiled so it goes back into place easily, the applicator header can swivel if you need it to so you don&#x27;t have to adjust your hand grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you need a solution to the flossing problem, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I have a sonicare toothbrush, this waterpik completed my dental cleaning needs.  If you get a sonicare and a waterpik you should be totally set and on the path to an above average clean mouth!</li>
    <li> Our original Pik was wearing out, age; I saw this one and knew it would be easier for us to handle.  It has exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and powerful.</li>
    <li> This item cleans teeth very well, leaving nothing stuck anywhere, and so chances of having cavities or bad breath are greatly reduced.</li>
    <li> I returned it. Given 3 since its a neutral rating. It was not of much use to me. So returned it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited this long to buy a Waterpik.  I&#x27;ve always flossed on a pretty regular basis but its still an annoying thing to do.  Waterpik solved that problem and the first time I went back to the dentist she said it was a huge noticeable difference during the exam.</li>
    <li> My mouth has never felt so clean.  After brushing &amp; flossing the waterpik removes so much that I never realized ewmained between my teeth.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun waterpick it was great but after years it broke, they don&#x27;t make it anymore. I purchased the Ultra Water Flosser It is every bit as good as the Braun, arrived quickly and works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Lasts about  years  then starts to leak</li>
    <li> I hated flossing the traditional way, and when I would do it I would usually only floss my front teeth because it really was uncomfortable to me. I bought this on a whim, and only a few weeks later my teeth are noticeably cleaner and feel great. I can easily and conveniently floss all of my teeth in around one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little noisy but not bad. It&#x27;s quieter than most bathroom exhaust fans. With the bathroom door shut you won&#x27;t disturb anyone&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days that I had it I used the different attachments, but now I only use the standard one since it seems to do everything effectively. A full tank of lukewarm tap water allows me to get all of my teeth from the front and the back at least one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion; even if you vigilantly floss every day the traditional way, you probably don&#x27;t do as good of a job as this machine does. Plus this thing makes flossing incredibly quick and low-effort. For the health benefit this gives you, $50 or so is an absolute bargain.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Very easy to use. It has varying speed and you can choose your comfortable speed. Simple and compact design.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good one</li>
    <li> this Waterpik quits working and I buy a new one.  I use it after using an electric toothbrush.  I see Walgreen&#x27;s now has a model by a manufacturer that is NOT Waterpik.  These flossers are good for the gums and one can get away without using flossing threads.</li>
    <li> This model is much quieter than the old Waterpik it replaced when the tubing sprung a leak.  It removes more plaque than flossing, and makes my gums feel much better than flossing, and better by far than not flossing.  It&#x27;s quiet enough to use even when my wife is asleep, so I&#x27;m using it twice daily, with excellent results.</li>
    <li> Product works well, and water pressure is great. (I like my water pressure set to the highest setting). However, I wish the tank was bigger so that way I don&#x27;t have to refill water like 3 times per session. (Probably because I always use it on the highest setting and water runs out faster). But great otherwise. I suggest everyone get one of these. Way better and farrrr less damaging than traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 11 yo son who just had his braces...it helps but does not completely clean in between teeth. Too messy to use. Regular flossing is still recommended.</li>
    <li> Workes as described, thought about purchasing the kids version as well, but honestly this one has 2-10 setting and the kids love it to and I can turn it down for them, Works well and really helps keep you teeth clean, I hate to floss and this is the best alternative and does a much better job, no more bleeding gums fighting to get floss out of teeth, etc.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I get a water flosser, and I chose the WaterPik. I&#x27;m enjoying ease in cleaning food from those small crevasses with ease!</li>
    <li> I had one of these growing up (not the same model) and thought it was SO cool.  As an adult, I still hate flossing, but know that I need to.  If I had more self discipline, I&#x27;d just save the money and floss.  But I don&#x27;t have more self discipline.  the waterpik is a sort of 1st world guilty pleasure for me.</li>
    <li> Does the job - my dentist recommended I use one but it is a pain and gets water all over.</li>
    <li> This model is superior to others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  No more fussing with the water tank placement and the water pressure is more than enough to allow for a through cleaning.  I also appreciate that the on/off switch requires less force than in older models, making one-handed operation a breeze.</li>
    <li> This waterpik has been wonderful since I got it. I tried the handheld one before this, and it was not nearly as good. I took it back the same day I got it. I ordered this online and I am so pleased with it! It has wonderful control settings and many different tips to help you. I am an adult with braces and am prone to gum irritation and infection. This has been wonderful for keeping my braces clean and keeping my gum line clean. Yay!</li>
    <li> When I see my dentist at my next appointment, I will know if the Waterpik flosser was of value to me.  I am having some problems with water draining out when using.  Perhaps there is a special method for usage that I am unaware of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years, almost yearly as the darn tubing keeps breaking off.  In the earlier days, there was no replacement hose, so I had to buy a new unit.  The newer ones have a replacement handle, but it is not inexpensive either, with the freight to Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;As for getting the job done, it is marvelous.  I use a sonic brush, brushing for that 2 minutes, rinse out, then use this unit on my gums, with an ounce of hydrogen peroxide mixed in with a full reservoir of water.&lt;br /&gt;Always, always, always, no matter how well I brush, there is debris flushed out.  I do have deep pockets and there is probably where the problem lies.  However, it beats having to go to a dentist and have him clean out those pockets.  I do see my dentist twice yearly, and he still has to get way down there and scrape.&lt;br /&gt;It would be much more painful, and longer, without this tool.  It&#x27;s just a shame that the hose has to keep breaking on them.  .</li>
    <li> I was expecting this Waterpik to have a more powerful water flow. It is not adequate to take care of plaque. I would not recommend this to someone</li>
    <li> Waterpik has good pressure, nice that its adjustable.  I like that the head pivots so that you don&#x27;t end up with a tangled mess of tubing.  I havent used 5 of the 6 tips they sent with it and am having a hard time finding regular replacement tips for a reasonable price.  Still, it beats string floss, especially for tight spaces between crowns.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist told him he needed a device such as this so I found this one and the price was right. He has had no problems with it and it seems to be doing the trick.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfu!  A must for periodontal issues and anyone with braces.  It will prevent alot of problems down the road.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned a Waterpik. This one has more attachments than I need to use.The lid/attachment holder seems to fall into the water reservoir for too often. It would be wise to make it a different shape or put an over-sized rim around it.</li>
    <li> Apparatus oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Very good, but its price could be lower and the kit comes with a complete case replacement or to use double.&lt;br /&gt;Also the container into the water could be greater, for use by two persons.</li>
    <li> Get the one that will last the longest. You need to use this everyday. Don&#x27;t mess with gum disease, I waited to long to understand. This product works but I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as the better models.</li>
    <li> Great. My husband wanted to replace his older one that broke. It works perfectly and he uses it every day.</li>
    <li> This product does its job of cleaning the space between teeth and around the gums very well.  One still needs to use dental floss, but this device will clean the area of food particles well.  It has a selection of tools, is easy to set up and use, and is sanitary in a small footprint on your counter.</li>
    <li> The perfect replacement for regular flossing. Initially you don&#x27;t want to have the pressure to high but after a while your gums get used to it and you can work your way to healthier gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> l never used one before. it seems to do the job as promised. i am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Great way to maintain clean gums. Orthodontist recommended as opposed to antibiotics in gum pockets. It&#x27;s working. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have periodontal problems.  At my last checkup, my dentist suggested I start using a water pick.  This one does the job.</li>
    <li> I have had an electric toothbrush for years and thought that did a good job. Amazing all the stuff that gets cleaned out of your mouth using a Waterpik after you&#x27;ve brushed.</li>
    <li> We really like the fresh feeling after using the flosser.  One comment is that I wish it came with more than one of the basic cleaning tips included.  My husband uses one of the other tips becuase I keep forgetting to order the extra tip.</li>
    <li> It is nicely packaged, but the storage on top always has to be minus one tool.  Most of the tools are superfluous, two pics would have been preferred to anyone of the other tools.  The reservoir empties quickly if you want to use enough pressure to really stimulate gum tissue.  It is very messy as a result in terms of trying to keep water in your mouth or just having it flow rapidly into the basin, making it difficult to focus the pic.  My old water pic was much more efficient the water stream was more narrow which also, helped increase pressure and also, flush out and firm up gum tissue.  Not getting that from this tool it never really completes the job.  It is an expensive item and it seems it was reengineered to be less effective in case you might not know what you are doing is the feeling I get.  I gave it away actually, I want to brush my teeth and floss in 5-7 minutes  and that&#x27;s a long time so the ultra just  can&#x27;t perform well enough and you must be mindful to dry all the orafice&#x27; so you don&#x27;t get mold build up, way to time consuming once a day let a lone twice.</li>
    <li> This helps my daughter get into all of the places that braces and her pallet appliance have blocked from access by just a toothbrush.  Definitely a plus for our smaller kids with no appliances as well.  The 3 year olds think this is so much fun that they don&#x27;t realize how much it works at getting in between the teeth just like floss would :)  Happy kids + clean teeth &#x3D; happy mom!!</li>
    <li> Ordered and received in less than 24 hours - PRIME is an awesome program.  Price was good.  This is a good size for one person or a couple.  I think the supply line (coiled and a bit stiff) would be awkward for youth.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and in working order.  I felt the price was fair and my son loves his new water pik.  Work great with Orthodontic appliance where dental floss failed.</li>
    <li> Water Pic works great. I love the adjustable power setting. It does a great job at cleaning my teeth. Much better than just brushing, and healthier.</li>
    <li> Devise does a great job cleaning between your teeth. It is not too loud &amp; have had no problems with it leaking.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for four months, and it has worked OK the entire time.  I bought my first Waterpik MANY years ago when they first came out, and I have to say it... they just don&#x27;t make them like they used to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is constructed of 100% plastic, and it just feels like a product that WON&#x27;T last many years.  The pressure on the higher settings (8-10) is not as strong as older models I have owned, and I fully expect this unit to be a candidate for planned obsolescence down the road.  Then again, it is no different than many of the products produced overseas these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, but for the money feels cheaply built and don&#x27;t look at it as a long term product.  3.5 stars - if it were sturdier and better built I would rate it higher.  I will continue to use it, and update later on with performance.  Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Works great got rid of my gingivitis</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a most the I use my waterpik daily. There for I was very please to be able to purchase what I needed from amazom.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of my own for several years now and love it, but my daughter got braces about a year ago and between this and a sonic toothbrush, our hygienist is much happier with what she is seeing during the cleanings.  I just wish it was easier to take with me when I travel.  I miss mine while I am gone and the first thing I want to do upon returning home is using this on my teeth.</li>
    <li> the waterpik is easy to use and help clean my teeth very well. it comes with many tips but i just need the basic one though,</li>
    <li> I have other Waterpik flossers with plenty of power to clean your gums more than adequately.  Unfortunately, this product is not one of them.  I purchased it for traveling and left it at my destination rather than bring it home because I did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> This is a neat device. I use it on the lowest pressure setting and still get a great pressure head to clean. After having used it for a month, here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: (vs flossing)&lt;br /&gt;1. Takes about half as much time for a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easier to clean hard to use areas. If you have big hands, it&#x27;s hard to get at the last molar teeth with the floss. No problems here.&lt;br /&gt;3. Can clean all around the tooth pocket instead of just between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you have crowded teeth, it&#x27;s hard to get the floss into or out of the gap. In that case, you will really really LOVE this device.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Needs an electrical outlet. Obviously.&lt;br /&gt;2. In my opinion, there is a small learning curve to use this device. It takes a couple of tries before you get to be able to be fast and efficient with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I am amazed how well this cleans my teeth.  Reccomend starting on a low setting until your teeth adjust.  I make smoothies daily, and this works well to flush out tiny pieces of veggies and fruit left from the smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried battery flossers and they broke. Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
    <li> Works as described....lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; comes out!  Make sure you follow the directions to put in &amp;#34;lukewarm&amp;#34; water.  So many water &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; came with it I don&#x27;t know what to do with all of them.</li>
    <li> Easier than flossing-works great-.Adjustable pressure is excellent. This is my third Waterpik.It is compact and requires very little counter space.</li>
    <li> I like this way more than flossing, and for the price, you get a great set of tips with a large enough reservoir that you can floss fully without needing to refill.</li>
    <li> Our 11yr old uses this for cleaning and it works very well.  Takes a bit of practice...but well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks so much for having this product available. Simply Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend the waterpik product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Best waterpik ever.  Really gives your gums &amp; teeth a deep thorough cleaning. Easy to use...easy to fill water reservoir, easy to attach &amp; remove attachments which all stay neatly in the covered compartment on top. Easy to select water pressure. Highly recommend this waterpik.</li>
    <li> Everything that was said turned out to be true. What more can I say?  It works!  Why so many words?</li>
    <li> First of all I have never had trouble with water spraying all over. I have had this product sense 2010 and it still works great, it is not to noisy.&lt;br /&gt;I fill the tank with water and listerine. I have heavy plaque and set it on 10 and this blows it all away, and the attachments are handy to use.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. A super convenient setup and an efficient use of space.  I love the storage lid and the fact that it stays dry after use</li>
    <li> It took a couple of days to get used to using, but it is a very efficient tool.  It is much better than the older waterpik.</li>
    <li> Never used such a device before, works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, a bit noisy, and it can be messy until you are familiar with it.</li>
    <li> i choose this rating because i found the product excellent in what it promise to deliver and it did&lt;br /&gt;i would have given it five stars if i did my homework right and ordered it 220V</li>
    <li> as advertized and wonderful product. does what it said it would, and very well. would recommend it for those who want a good product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments, quieter than the previous model which I owned, and the water pressure is fully adjustable from a very gentle rinse for those pocket attachments to full on peel paint mode for those who like to feel it working! Very happy with it! It is also slightly smaller than the previous model which is nice because it takes up less precious counter space.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> It took a little to get used to, but I really like this device.  I hate to floss and now I get that same benefit.</li>
    <li> Allot quieter than previous Waterpik. Setting on number 4 and a full tank works for me. Would like to see a different color tank than blue...perhaps clear so one can see any blue mouth rinse that is added. Also, would like to see a tab or something to grasp to remove tank when done. Overall, very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is a great product. It&#x27;s easy to use and was an inexpensive purchase. It makes flossing in hard to get places much easier. I definitely recommend it. Soon I will see if my dentist is pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Machine hand is bad, the pressure no water, never used bad, can only be used to describe very bad!Failed shopping, I have been back to China, you can not return, bad luck!</li>
    <li> Product performs as advertised, a little clunky to work (filling the bucket and such) but it seems effective in dental care. After purchasing on Amazon, I found the item a few dollars cheaper at the local store so I advise checking locally if the 3 to 5 dollars is worth it to you.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well for me. I have been using for a few weeks and I can already see the improvement.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to get one of these about a year ago...I just recently purchased one and LOVE it.  It really gets into the crevices of your teeth to clean the gulk out!  I should have followed her advice a year but glad I did now!</li>
    <li> bought for hygiene after third molar extractions (wisdom teeth) and it works great. Food was getting stuck in the holes left by the molar extractions and it was impossible to clean until I bought this! two thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> Love it, hoping for better dental check UPS.</li>
    <li> If you ever use one, you won&#x27;t know what to do without it.  Amazing how helpful it is, removes items that you aren&#x27;t even aware are still in your mouth, and that is after a complete brushing.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of &#x27;flossing&#x27; and is easy to use.  My second Waterpik and the first one lasted a very long time.</li>
    <li> This device flushes food from the pockets between my teeth unlike floss that frequently drives it in deeper which makes the situation worse.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she was not too sure about it. A couple of weeks have gone by and she loves it now and missed it when we went on vacation.</li>
    <li> Awesome purchase!!! A++++</li>
    <li> I very rarely use floss now that I have the Waterpik.  My dentist has mentioned many times how very clean my teeth and gums are.  It&#x27;s soothing to use and my mouth feels fresh and clean after use.  The only time I use floss is if I am away from home and want to be sure nothing is stuck between my teeth.  I wish I purchased a Waterpik years ago!</li>
    <li> I along with most people who brush and floss their teeth regularly will be amazed at what comes out of their mouths when they use this.  It just works, and removes all those little particles, as well as keeping your gums in shape.  I discussed this with my dental hygienist, but she didn&#x27;t really have much to say about it.  I am guessing that she has never used one.  Buy one, your dental bill should go down.</li>
    <li> The product does what it suposed to do.  However, there will be a learning curve on how to use.  When I first used the Water Pik I had water all over the sink, morrow, and myself.  After several days I managed to figure out how to use.  The key is to make use of the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button and keep your mouth shut while using.  Use the pause button to allow you to empty your mouth of the water.  I found thayt the best tip to use is the one that has a small brush when starting to use for the first time.</li>
    <li> I love to use this each day on a low setting with mouthwash in the water. It provides gum stimulation and helps to get rid of debris on the teeth. I would recommend it to anyone. I have used this product for several years.</li>
    <li> I have owned this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for about 4 months.  So far I have accidentally tipped it over once with a full water canister and have accidentally turned the flosser on twice having water spray all over my bathroom mirror and floor which prompted me to write this scathing review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously owned an older model which had a switch that you had to push down as opposed to the new design that has a switch that you turn on by simply rocking side to side.  The old model was rectangular and more stable then the newer (less improved) model.  I never had a problem with the older model. It simply stopped working after 20 years of great service.  The new design is horrible and I will be replacing it something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The operation of the product is great.  I have had better dental checkups as a result of using this product but due to three accidents - it&#x27;s time to look for a different product.</li>
    <li> I am not blown away by this purchase, I do not really feel that it&#x27;s cleaning and when I increase the speed, I feel like I&#x27;m drowning... I am going back to regular flossing...</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Used Fental Floss and Oicks. Now I see why I should have used a Water Pick a long time ago.</li>
    <li> First few tries of this product.  This was bought as a gift, and so far my friend loves it.  He particularly loves the spray pressure.  His dentist recommended this product and we decided to try.  Will definitely be using this often and will recommend.</li>
    <li> this is great for people with braces and without! GET IT NOW!!!!! :D easy to use with multiple heads&lt;br /&gt;definitely 5 stare</li>
    <li> After having a popcorn kernel stuck in between my back molars for a week and after no luck using floss, I decided to buy this product.  After about three days of pain and even one meal of it hurting too much to eat, it finally arrived.  I hooked it up, and in about 1 minute of work and playing with the settings I managed to pop out the piece of popcorn along with quite a lot of nasty looking meat that had also been jammed up there with flossing.  By the time I left my bathroom and walked downstairs the swelling had already gone away and I feel SO much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> it would be better if it has a tube to fill water. But it is still a powerful flosser I have used</li>
    <li> I have braces amnd I tried everything from regular floss (HORRIBLE AND TIME WAISTING) Dentik picks that fit in between braces (did not really work) and a lot more. This works perfectly, the water pressure just shoots all the garbage out of your gum and mouth. it is pretty water resistant but watch the cable!</li>
    <li> It works fantastic! The only thing is, it is a little loud. But it works great! I love that I can pause it when switching places or positions to get to other surfaces of my teeth.</li>
    <li> The product works well if like myself you&#x27;re not really into flossing; yet the Waterpik Ultra Water Flo-&lt;br /&gt;sser  works great to leave your mouth really clean.  I wore my first one out.  I love the product</li>
    <li> Checked out other and more expensive flossers and saw this one demonstrated at a store.  Decided to go on Amazon and buy it.  Was not disappointed.  Made by WaterPik, this one has more attachments than your mouth and teeth will ever need.  Big reservoir for water/mouthwash and no splashing the water if you keep it on a conservative speed.  Thank you Water Pik and Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. My teeth are very tight, it&#x27;s always difficult and I often ended up with slightly bleeding gums. But since my teeth are so tight it&#x27;s even more critical to get the areas between the teeth cleaned. This thing does the trick and it does it fast! It took me a little getting used to using it, but now I can get through all teeth in about 90 seconds. It&#x27;s impressive to see how much small food pieces this thing gets out from between the teeth even after I brushed! I guess everyone&#x27;s teeth are different, but in my case, there seem to be several areas where the normal brush just isn&#x27;t able to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy this years ago.</li>
    <li> I love this product when it works but has stopped working after three months.  I use it once daily every night and now the pump has lost pressure and the power is sporadic.  It&#x27;s been three months so according to Amazon I cannot return.  I think if this was Wal-Mart I can atleast take it back for an exchange.  I don&#x27;t know what to do except write a review.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and my Dentist recommend a water pick ,to help with my gums. So far very satisfied,with the way it cleans.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily, sometimes more than just once a day.  It has lasted this long without fail.</li>
    <li> Very powerful tool to clean between teeth and gumlines. My 12 year old uses it after every meal since he wears braces and he hates to floss. This does the job easily and much faster than flossing.  Takes only a small amount of bathroom counter space. Great product.</li>
    <li> I never realized how good a water pic works until I bought one. It&#x27;s a great product and really helps with removing foodstuff from your teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have braces;make everything easier,but I don&#x27;t think you should stop using the regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this works better when I finish my treatment.</li>
    <li> I had one as  kid and now my kids love it. I may need to get another one for me.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best products. It is an excellent brand. it is my favorite. IT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
