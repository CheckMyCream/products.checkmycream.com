      <li>I noticed with other brands even if they actually removed my makeup, (which Cetaphil does wonderfully), my face still didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love that they are unscented / fragrance free.</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be worth trying.</li>
      <li>but these are great for lazy nights after work and quick washes. .</li>
      <li>My skin feels just right after using Cetaphil.</li>
      <li>My skin feels just right after using Cetaphil.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the cloth, maybe it&#x27;s a slightly different formula, but this has helped my skin look a bit better and more clear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of cleansing towelettes, and Cetaphil is by far and away the best.</li>
      <li>These make it so easy to have clear skin.</li>
      <li>They are mild and gentle to my skin, but do the job as required.</li>
      <li>Absolute favorite wipes for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>very gentle, clears well, softens skin</li>

      <li>They are soft and gentle on the skin and so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Great for a frequent flier, using these after a couple legs and a couple thousand miles makes you feel a little more human.  </li>
      <li>The cost can be a little pricey, but if you use face wash most of the time then you will not need to go through a lot of wipes quickly.</li>

      <li>No irritating  at all.</li>
      <li>I found these to be very greasy,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Gentle on my finicky skin, leaves no residue, takes all makeup off.</li>
      <li>Usually really like Metaphor products, but not these wipes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these on the go cleansing cloths - i can use for my pre-teen also for in her back pack at school.</li>
    <li> These are not as moist as when you purchase them from your local retailer.</li>
    <li> refreshing, no odor, handy.  especially good for sensitive and allergic skin.</li>
    <li> Cleanse thorougly, but are very gentle / don&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> Perfect for just getting a nice clean fresh face feeling.</li>
    <li> I love that they are unscented.  However, they are scratchy, somewhat dry, and not the greatest at makeup removal.</li>
    <li> Helped clear up an infection in the pores of my nose. Don&#x27;t know how I got it, but these cloths got rid of it.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea quite badly.  I bought these as an alternative to makeup removers.  They work wonderfully.  Makeup is gone, and they don&#x27;t irritate my skin like most cleaners.  Definitely a good buy if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I have extremely sensitive, dry, skin and have tried other brands of face wipes and always broke out. Olay and Simple were the other ones I tried. I didn&#x27;t have much hope for these but thought I would give them a shot. After working nights and a long commute I would go to bed without taking my makeup off because it was such a chore. These make it so easy to have clear skin. I haven&#x27;t had one breakout since I started using these. They are soft but rough enough to remove makeup and dirt. My skin feels clean and not dry. I rinse with water, pat dry, and moisturize afterwards. I will continue using them as long as they are on the market. Thank you Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Great for a frequent flier, using these after a couple legs and a couple thousand miles makes you feel a little more human.  The TSA let me through with them no problem.  We also used them on a winter trip to a waterless cabin, and again, a great way to clean up after a sweaty day.</li>
    <li> Long time user of this product</li>
    <li> Fragrance free! No alcohol!  Love it!  Use these to wipe off foundation prior to washing my face.  I like the soft cloth feel. Does not leave a residue. I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love that they are unscented / fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have rosacea on my cheeks and my skin is extremely sensitive, dry and oily and I have tried other brands of face wipes and always broke out. I still prefer Clinique facial wash but these are great for lazy nights after work and quick washes. . My skin feels just right after using Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> The most gentle face wipes I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of cleansing towelettes, and Cetaphil is by far and away the best. They&#x27;re extremely soft, large, and actually moist, unlike some other brands I&#x27;ve tried. They&#x27;re also unscented which is a huge selling point for me since I have very sensitive and dry skin. I noticed with other brands even if they actually removed my makeup, (which Cetaphil does wonderfully), my face still didn&#x27;t feel clean. Most left a tacky feeling residue. With these I feel like I just washed my face. They&#x27;re perfect for traveling or just keeping by the bed.</li>
    <li> I live in the high desert and winters are very dry. These get my face clean, including removing 95% of my eye makeup, without my having to use water and making my skin dry and chapped. I usually use half a wipe and it gets the job done. The package kept the wipes damp for over a month. I now have these on my subscribe and save list. Definitely worth the money especially if you have dry skin in a dry cold climate.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction. These are great wipes to use throughout the day to freshen up without completely washing your face. I have very sensitive skin and they work great for me, very gentle. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product...good quantity and packaging! Perfect for Fitbit Charge HR!</li>
    <li> I use these daily as a quick way to wash my face and remove my make up at the end of the day or after a workout. I have sensitive skin and some of the other face wipes have given me problems in the past. These work great! They remove the dirt/make up well and my skin has not had any reactions or breakouts from them!</li>
    <li> Great product but I hate generating so much waste.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ll definitely continue to order. Received the product within a few days. Definitely see the difference in my skin (less break outs).</li>
    <li> At last, I found a cleansing cloth that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  These cloths are very pleasant to use with a light scent.  My skin is left soft but not dry as some cloths do.  I will be stocking up on these because I don&#x27;t want to run out any time soon. I only use Cetaphil products on my skin.  They are mild and gentle to my skin, but do the job as required.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel like i just washed my face with water/ very gentle- easy to use on the go!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Does not irritate which is important for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have such sensitive skin I&#x27;ve tried other face cleansing cloths and my skin would either be to dry or to oily.  My skin feels just right after using Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I love Cetaphil but I&#x27;ve always found the cleanser a little clumsy to use. I was very happy to find these wipes. They are soft and gentle on the skin and so easy to use. Please put these on subscription because I will be buying them regularly.</li>
    <li> So convenient and gentle cleansing cloths for sensitive skin.  I am so glad that Amazon offers this wonderful product.  Try it and you will be glad  you did!</li>
    <li> I like Cetaphil products but these wipes were dry and not moist enough to remove and clean face. I misunderstood and thought you wet with water first. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better since I like their bars of soap.  The cloths are rectangular in shape, instead of square-ish like other brands I have used.  Soft enough, maybe too soft, kinda flimsy to use.  Sorry to say, I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Gentle on my finicky skin, leaves no residue, takes all makeup off. These are some of the best cleansing cloths I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> These facial wipes work great. No break-outs. No harshness or drying out. I would recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> These wipes are a little too rough on my eyes. They don&#x27;t irritate my eyes, so that is a plus because I have sensitive skin, but the cloth itself is a little too course. I prefer to pay a little more for the Neutrogena wipes.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t very damp, so it&#x27;s hard to pull them across your face. Even though I use the liquid Cetaphil as my main cleanser, I won&#x27;t be buying these again. They&#x27;re too frustrating.</li>
    <li> Takes all of my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t sting. I usually don&#x27;t use wipes as they leave my skin red and irritated. Glad I gave these a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cleansing cloths for about 2 years now.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil has great products that do not irritate skin.</li>
    <li> I keep a package near my bed, in case I get a little lazy, they are easy to use.</li>
    <li> One of the 3-packs I got only had 2 !  Annoying.  I didn&#x27;t know how to handle it, so I ended up processing it as an exchange, but then I was required to ship BACK the 2 packages.  The postage cost me almost as much as that one missing package.  Is there a better way to handle this kind of thing in the future?</li>
    <li> Usually really like Metaphor products, but not these wipes.  There are dry and do not remove makeup very well.  The best cleansing wipes are Lumens unscented which remove all eye makeup and are not irritating.  It is worth paying more for Lumber.</li>
    <li> Great for adults and kids.  Doesn&#x27;t sting eyes. Doesn&#x27;t bother very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been to a dermatologist for acne, they probably suggested cetaphil at some point. I&#x27;ve been using it and various generic versions of it forever for my annoying, stupid, awful adult acne (never had acne until after I had a kid). It does NOT really treat acne, it just plain cleans and does not dry out your skin, which then is primed for acne meds and good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are actually better than the plain Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser. I don&#x27;t know why. Maybe it&#x27;s the cloth, maybe it&#x27;s a slightly different formula, but this has helped my skin look a bit better and more clear. I would use these twice daily if I wasn&#x27;t so concerned about the environmental wastefulness. Generally I use the liquid cleanser. I have taken a few trips with these cloths and my skin always looks better after the trip since these are all I use. Also these travel well, I have taken them across the Atlantic and haven&#x27;t had a pack dry out or leak or anything funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus: the cloths themselves are really well-made, and there is enough cleanser to do face, neck, and chest. Probably back too if needed. Go crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these days, I&#x27;m going to ignore the wastefulness factor and just start using these instead of the plain cleanser. They are amazing.</li>
    <li> Very soft, cleans without drying. No irritating  at all.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight and gentle cleansing face cloths.  Comes in an easy storage bag with a top clip closure to avoid remaining sheets from drying out. I use this nightly while traveling and after long days when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face but need to take off my makeup.</li>
    <li> worked great on my trip to europe.  Gentle but really cleans...gets all the mascara off!  Love them!</li>
    <li> Love these toilettes! Cruelty free company so I encourage you to support them!</li>
    <li> very gentle, clears well, softens skin</li>
    <li> better than I expected</li>
    <li> I have used the Yes To Grapefruit wipes for a while, but these were on discount when I purchased from Amazon so I thought it would be worth trying. I love the fact that they do not have any scent. I have very sensitive skin and Cetaphil has always been great. The towel is a little smaller than I expected, but actually removes makeup including eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I found these to be very greasy,&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash my face with soap and&lt;br /&gt;water to get rid of the residue,&lt;br /&gt;just stick with soap and water&lt;br /&gt;and a washcloth,</li>
    <li> They worked like any other brand of wipes I have tried. I don&#x27;t like rubbing my eyes so much to get off mascara. I prefer washing my face. Would be good for traveling though.</li>
    <li> I was excited about getting these cleansing cloths because of the Cetaphil brand.  I was using the Ponds cleansing cloths.  I was disappointed in the Cetaphil ones because they were so dry....not moist enough to use easily.  I am back to using the Ponds.</li>
    <li> (Pack of 3) stated for price but received only one pack 😢&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed &amp; returning for refund.</li>
    <li> Love these! Super convenient, they don&#x27;t dry out my skin at all nor do they leave it greasy. My skin hates all of the cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, but these have worked marvelously.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic!  I&#x27;ve loved and used the Cetaphil cleanser, but always had to use it with a washcloth to get makeup off (the wash alone is too gentle to take off the primer and setting spray I like to use).  These are PERFECT and even take off eye makeup without the stinging I get from eye makeup remover pads (even &#x27;sensitive&#x27; mixtures).  Delighted with this product!</li>
    <li> These wipes are great when you just want to clean your face off quickly.  Cetaphil has always been great for my sensitive skin.  The cost can be a little pricey, but if you use face wash most of the time then you will not need to go through a lot of wipes quickly.</li>
    <li> Amazing wipes !!! A good product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These seem very dry compared to similair products, and didn&#x27;t remove makeup. I felt like I was just smearing the skin oils and make-up around instead of removing them. I&#x27;m so disappointed that I have to keep using these for several weeks because I bought a three-pack.</li>
    <li> Absolute favorite wipes for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice cleansing cloths!  Really like them!</li>
    <li> Great for removing makeup and keeping my face moisturized.  I also use on my 4 year old....gentle enough for her sensitive skin</li>
    <li> These were at a great price point....they are gentle but not very effective at removing eye makeup.  If you have sensitive skin...these will not disappoint you!!</li>
    <li> Great deal for a great product. These wipes work well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these makeup wipes. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they burned my sensitive skin. This works great - just like the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cleansing cloths and wipes and I&#x27;ve found these to be the worst at removing makeup. I have to wash with another cleanser to get any makeup off which defeats the purpose of these expensive wipes. I thought these would be good for my skin because it is a good brand but I&#x27;ve had more breakouts while using these. If they can&#x27;t remove any makeup (like the package says it will), they&#x27;re probably not doing much for dirt or oil either.</li>
    <li> As a Makeup Artist I am on the hunt for things that make my life easier during my jobs.  These wipes...are the MOST gentle and unscented things I&#x27;ve used in my 12 years of doing this.  I have them on a subscription order now...they&#x27;re that good.</li>
    <li> These are the only quick make-up wipes that don&#x27;t bother my skin which says a lot cause I&#x27;m ultra sensitive to products on my face but these are the first ones I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t burn my face. I love them and so glad Amazon had these in multiple packs! They are great to use if your too exhausted to do a typical face washing with soap and water which is when I usually use them. They get all my makeup off even mascara and eyeliner too! Would definitely recommend.</li>
