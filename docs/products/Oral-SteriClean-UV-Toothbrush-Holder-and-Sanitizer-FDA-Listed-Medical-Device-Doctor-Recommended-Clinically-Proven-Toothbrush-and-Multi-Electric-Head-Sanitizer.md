      <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>The one that did work works fine.</li>
      <li>These sanitizers are easy to use, and clean</li>
      <li>I reached other products and found this company and this device to be very good.  </li>
      <li>And the blue light is kind of neat :)</li>
      <li>My friend always uses this thing to clean his toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Nothing like a clean toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>LOve this, it is made much better than some of the other models I&#x27;ve tried, and I feel so much better keeping my toothbrush in here.</li>
      <li>Thought we had to buy another one when the first one broke after 4 months of use..contacted the company and they replaced the unit!</li>
      <li>This was a Christmas gift to my husband that the whole family gets to enjoy.  </li>
      <li>It not only sterilizes my brushes, but also gives them a clean and safe place to be stored when not in use.</li>
      <li>My smile is so much healthier now that I got the oral stericlean toothbrush!</li>
      <li>Great item, I like the fact that it only comes on after it has been used (not multiple times a day/night)</li>
      <li>I am in love with this christmas present - it cleans my teeth like brand new pearls!!!</li>
      <li>I did received a defected family devices unit; however, the company was quick at resolving my issue with a new replacement.  </li>
      <li>I just hope, it really does kill all those germs.</li>
      <li>My advice, save your bucks for when the product is ready as this is definitively a beta.</li>
      <li>Door is finicky when it wants to work.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an absolute must for my home.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this for your teenager or adult in your life with teeth that need that little extra push for that great big smile -</li>
      <li>We liked the idea of using ultraviolet light to sanitize our family toothbrushes, but this thing has a flawed design.</li>
      <li>He says it really works and nearly kills all the bacteria.</li>
      <li>It might have been possible to crack the thing open and clean it out, but we didn&#x27;t want a mold farm to host our toothbrushes going forward, and having to clean and disinfect the inside of that thing regularly is not something we&#x27;re prepared to do.</li>
      <li>It is very nice, plenty of room inside that allows me to disinfect other small items like head of the brush for face etc.</li>
      <li>I have checked out the studies that have been done with these products they are pretty extensive and prove they are killing the bacteria that are on my brush!</li>
      <li>brush keeps falling down slot and is not fully exposed to the uv light</li>
      <li>These little things are great for small bathrooms.  </li>
      <li>we are returning the product to have it fixed or exchanged.</li>
      <li>Would give the product a better rating, but only one of the two I ordered worked, I did send the broken one back, and was refunded quickly.</li>
      <li>The curved blue cover is hard to close, many times not shutting all the way.</li>
      <li>It barely worked for about a week.</li>
      <li>I ended up returning this item and am back to using my old $20 version from Wal-Mart.</li>
      <li>I got the oral stericlean ultravoilet family toothbrush as a christmas present, because I have really sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>If I had known how dangerous it is to not sanitize your brush, I would&#x27;ve heeded products like this more!</li>

    <li> Door is finicky when it wants to work.  Sometimes I have to really press it hard for it to work.  Also, if I do not crack open the door after the process is completed, it will continue to cycle on and off.</li>
    <li> does not hold brush from electric tooth brush in position .... brush keeps falling down slot and is not fully exposed to the uv light</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Oral SteriClean toothbrush sterilizer.  It not only sterilizes my brushes, but also gives them a clean and safe place to be stored when not in use.</li>
    <li> Every home should have one and you&#x27;ll be less sick.  Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> Like this and it works good.</li>
    <li> Great item, I like the fact that it only comes on after it has been used (not multiple times a day/night)</li>
    <li> We purchased this product in December 2014 and six months later it stopped working for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;Since the start, we noticed what others had to say about the door locking being a bit flimsy was true.&lt;br /&gt;Now we are returning the product to have it fixed or exchanged. Even though the guaranteed for less than a year covers its costs, we&#x27;re still left to pay for round shipping which is basically half the price we paid for it. My advice, save your bucks for when the product is ready as this is definitively a beta.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I have all three of the oral stericlean products and have been using them for over a year and a half and have been nothing but impressed! I have never had an issue with them working and I feel healthier knowing that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the germs that could grow on my brush. I have checked out the studies that have been done with these products they are pretty extensive and prove they are killing the bacteria that are on my brush! Satisfied and healthy repeat customer! As a Chiropractic Physician that promotes health this is a must have! I recommend it to all of my patients!</li>
    <li> Worked great for a month. Then started shorting out. Can hardly ever get it to work now, bought it two months ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Family unit for a month now, and I love it .  A great device that sanitizes and also stores our toothbrushes.  It looks and fits great on the bathroom counter!  And my grandkids are still loving the Duo I bought them a few months ago!  These sanitizers are easy to use, and clean and I feel better using a clean toothbrush.  10-20-2016 I have just purchased another DUO sanitizer!  I gave my  one to my friends daughter to take to college for her and her roommate.  These little things are great for small bathrooms.  The girls are loving it .</li>
    <li> I am a return customer and I love this product. I have the travel one also and then bought this one for my family and I love it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this superior product to all my patients.  As a Dental Hygienist as well as cancer survivor it&#x27;s an absolute must for my home.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a clean toothbrush.  Much better than the battery operated one we used before.</li>
    <li> We liked the idea of using ultraviolet light to sanitize our family toothbrushes, but this thing has a flawed design. The toothbrushes stand upright and the heads face a UV lamp, which may work as advertised. However, the bottom of the brushes goes down into the bottom half of the unit, which is hollow on the inside. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my toothbrush is wet when I put it in this thing, so inevitably there is moisture pooling in the bottom of the inner chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, after a few weeks, it bloomed with black mold, growing all around near the handles of our toothbrushes. It might have been possible to crack the thing open and clean it out, but we didn&#x27;t want a mold farm to host our toothbrushes going forward, and having to clean and disinfect the inside of that thing regularly is not something we&#x27;re prepared to do.</li>
    <li> My friend always uses this thing to clean his toothbrushes. He says it really works and nearly kills all the bacteria. I&#x27;m planning to get it soon!</li>
    <li> Grew mold in it. Horrible product</li>
    <li> If I had known how dangerous it is to not sanitize your brush, I would&#x27;ve heeded products like this more! Note I know and I have one of these, excellent product!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Our family can have all our toothbrushes sanitizing at one time! Works great and highly recommend to anyone that wants to stay healthy!</li>
    <li> Would give the product a better rating, but only one of the two I ordered worked, I did send the broken one back, and was refunded quickly. The one that did work works fine.</li>
    <li> Don&amp;#34;t think it does  anything.</li>
    <li> Two words....love it!!  I purchased two devices- one a travel size and the other a family size.  I did received a defected family devices unit; however, the company was quick at resolving my issue with a new replacement.  As my friends and family claims I am a germaphobe, but as I see it....I just want to stay healthy.  I reached other products and found this company and this device to be very good.  Not only that it is FDA approved compared to the others on the market place.  Strongly recommend.  Stay healthy!!..</li>
    <li> It is very nice, plenty of room inside that allows me to disinfect other small items like head of the brush for face etc. I would highly recommend it over just small individual UV cleaner.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to my husband that the whole family gets to enjoy.  It makes us feel so much better that our toothbrushes are getting sterilized every night.  And the blue light is kind of neat :)</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m sure this product worked as described I was not at all happy with the design. The curved blue cover is hard to close, many times not shutting all the way. I had to pick it up and hold it sideways to hear the door click shut.&lt;br /&gt;The holes for the tooth brushes were at an odd angle and not easy to get the brushes in or out. I ended up returning this item and am back to using my old $20 version from Wal-Mart. It looks very nice and I wanted to like it but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> We love this product and the great company that makes it! Thought we had to buy another one when the first one broke after 4 months of use..contacted the company and they replaced the unit! that is what all good company should be!</li>
    <li> Had it for two months and then it stopped working.</li>
    <li> it is not good is not valio in it</li>
    <li> LOve this, it is made much better than some of the other models I&#x27;ve tried, and I feel so much better keeping my toothbrush in here.</li>
    <li> Worked great as soon as I unwrapped it. Easy to put, light work great. All 4 colgate toothbruses fit perfect and window firmly shut. I just hope, it really does kill all those germs.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use. Kids love putting their toothbrushes in it to clean them</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of junk.  It barely worked for about a week. The unit is supposed to activate when the door is closed.  Initially worked about 50% of the time. Eventually didn&#x27;t work at all.  It ended up in the trash where it belongs.  Don&#x27;t waste any money on this.</li>
    <li> I got the oral stericlean ultravoilet family toothbrush as a christmas present, because I have really sensitive teeth and my family knows this. I am in love with this christmas present - it cleans my teeth like brand new pearls!!! My smile is so much healthier now that I got the oral stericlean toothbrush! I highly reccomend this for your teenager or adult in your life with teeth that need that little extra push for that great big smile - I will never use another toothbrush again. Thank you !!!! Best price around from google</li>
