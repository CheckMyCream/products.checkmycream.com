<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Starts working immediately.  Lasts for about two hours and seems to turn off when it has used up all the water.  Good price and prompt delivery.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing!!!! I use it every day. Anytime I am doing the dishes I pop it on and relax immediately with my essential oils. My kids love it because it comes out like smoke but its a diffuser!! So cool. Everyone should buy one!</li>
    <li> I love this defuser .....I use it daily in my bedroom.</li>
    <li> Great...when it works.  For some reason it shuts off randomly, sometimes right after turning it on, maybe an hour later, maybe two. Other times it runs the full five hours until it runs out of water.</li>
    <li> Awesome product good price</li>
    <li> Worth the money I use it 5 or more times a week I use Doterra enssenctial oils and mix up my own blends helped so much with flu and cold symptoms using Onguard</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars, I would.  Despite following all the instructions I could find online for how to take care of this diffuser, this still discontinued to work after 4 uses.  This was my second try with the ZAQ Allay diffuser…  I guess I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson with my first.  I thought I just got a lemon the first time and sent it back for a refund and immediately ordered another.  It worked for four uses.  I put it away for the summer and just got it back out this week and now it won&#x27;t work (and now I&#x27;m past the return date).  I even cleaned it with vinegar swabs before storing, like I&#x27;ve read to do to remove any oil build-up.  I used distilled water and only used 3-4 drops of oil per usage…  all per the instructions.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this diffuser unless you enjoying throwing your money away.  So frustrating.</li>
    <li> This is a neat little diffuser.  I&#x27;ve been running it in our great room, so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the room with scent.  My husband thought it was a little much for our smaller bedroom.  I really like it though--I&#x27;ve been using it for several months, and it makes my house smell like a spa.  I&#x27;ve been thinking of picking up a second one.  The light is pleasant too, and it&#x27;s nice that you can turn off the light but still have it diffusing.</li>
    <li> So far I like it. Small, simple, easy to fill, quiet, puts off a nice steady stream of vapor. I wish I&#x27;d known before ordering it, though, that the base is not white as it looks to be in the photos. It is actually a light, dull, clayish gray. (And it&#x27;s not a modern, stylish gray- Think, &amp;#34;1998 computer tower.&amp;#34;) With such bright, fun lamp colors and the pretty, sleek shape a white base would have been 100 times more appealing. I am glad I purchased this to use in a room that doesn&#x27;t get a lot of natural light. I would be sending it back if I&#x27;d bought it to showcase in a bright area.</li>
    <li> works as expected. the light in it makes it look red rather than yellow. Wish I had gotten one that last longer and fills a larger room better but or a small space this would be great!</li>
    <li> What a great way to enjoy my oils. Liked it so much,I bought one for my daughter-in-love,too!</li>
    <li> I have it on my desk at work and it truly relieves so much stress and anxiety by just a few whiffs in the air. All of my colleagues have found it to be quite delish as well</li>
    <li> A great diffuser.  Would be nice if it could hold more water, but it does the job very well and looks nice too.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use Plant Therapy and Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils with mine. It works very well for a small space. I have large rooms, but tend to place the product near me when I&#x27;m idol.  Easy to travel with!</li>
    <li> Very nice liked the way it looks also.&lt;br /&gt;this to get best effect I place it lower on table.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for a normal sized room.  I loved the one I had in the bedroom so purchased one for living area.  I have had no problems with either one.  They typically run for 3-5 hours and shut themselves off perfectly.</li>
    <li> I originally had the Greenair Spa Vapor Oil Diffuser but turned to this one after my dog knocked it off of the kitchen ledge and it quit working so well. I chose this diffuser based off of all of the wonderful reviews, but coming from using the Greenair I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed. It holds about half the amount of water but calls for the same amount of essential oil so I feel like I&#x27;m wasting... and I can barely smell it at all. I don&#x27;t like that the mist sprays straight up. Lastly, you can choose to turn the LED light off, but a red power button still glows much brighter than I care for when I&#x27;m trying to sleep. It&#x27;s okay, but I ended up sending this back and buying another Greenair.</li>
    <li> This is my first diffuser. It seems to work well/as expected. Love that it automatically shuts off. The light is more of an orangish red when on which I&#x27;m glad about because I wanted a red light. You can turn off the top light but the button remains lit and it is quite bright if you like complete darkness. You can always put tape over it. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Really pumps out the steam.  Works perfectly, just as described.  The scented oil really infiltrates the house.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser.  Works great. Pretty.  Does the job at a much better price than most I have seen.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser!  Works wonderfully &amp; is very quiet.  Turns off after a few hours when all the liquid is gone.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint, the red light is not soothing, a white or yellow light would definitely be better.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, does what it says &amp; functions well.</li>
    <li> Works great, better than the 100 dollar one that came with our oils kit</li>
    <li> Great little diffuser for the price especially. Easy to use and set up. Runs for hours. The only thing different from the description is that there aren&#x27;t color options for the light. If the light is on on my orange unit the light is always red which isn&#x27;t a big deal to me because normally I have the light off anyway.</li>
    <li> this is my third purchase of this diffuser...works great, place 4-5 drops of essential oil (and water)...house smells delicious...not too strong...great alternative to candles, plug-ins, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these, and took it to work, since I have bought 3 more for co workers, and one for my twenty year old son, dorm room, and I need still to get one more for my house, and one for my best friend as a gift..everyone loves it. Best thing is it shuts itself off when empty, and it glows which is really cool!! This is a great buy, you will love it, I should buy stock in this company!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the best diffuser. It&#x27;s my first one, I normally simmer oil with water in a pot on my stove. I was told getting a diffuser would make the scent last longer, it doesn&#x27;t. Definitely not worth $50.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser.  It runs for about 4 hours, I only put a couple drops of good quality essential oils in and the whole space smells wonderful.  I use it mainly in my massage room, and also in other areas, seems to infuse scent to a pretty big space. I&#x27;ve had it a couple months and have had no issues. Will be ordering more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I use my oil diffuser every day and I love it, it&#x27;s perfect.  I have recommended it to a couple of my friends that diffuse oils and they have purchased one as well.  They also love the ZAQ Allay LiteMist Oil Diffuser, it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Like many other comments, it is very small. But I love that it is completely silent and I really like orange color. This is my first diffuser for oils, but going off the reviews I think it was a good choice!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had it since Christmas and use this in our bedroom. It works really well and have no problems.  It fills up the room within mins of turning on. The only enhancement I would suggest is to have the top part double as a measuring cup to fill it up with water.</li>
    <li> The BEST thing that ever happened to my lungs! I use this diffuser daily and sometimes nightly. It&#x27;s amazing. Works just like they said it would, it&#x27;s almost invisible because it blends into my decor. My ONLY regret it that I didn&#x27;t get 2 or 3. going to remedy that soon. I keep a small container of water near it and that way I don&#x27;t have to carry the base anywhere to refill it. It lasts for hours, which is nice. I use Sandlewood and Lavender to help my son calm for bedtime and it works SO well. I use &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; by DoTerra to keep my lungs happy, especially during allergy seasons. This is a great product and a work horse. I never had one problem with it.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this diffuser. I have one in several rooms in my house, in different colors.</li>
    <li> Great little diffuser! Works as promised, orange light is slightly garish but thankfully can be turned off on the translucent upper part. Handles my oils like a champ and fills a large size (15x15) bedroom, etc with aroma.</li>
    <li> This is a good little diffuser. I mists really fast and does a good job, no condensation. It is small so doesn&#x27;t last really long, maybe an hr or so. Worst thing about this diffuser is it didn&#x27;t come with ANY directions. It has one button that says nothing but has several settings. There is no way for me to know w/o directions how many times I am suppose to push it for what setting so I just have to guess and hope it does what I want.</li>
    <li> With the maximum amount of water, it is supposed to run for 3-4 hrs according to description,but switches off in atmost 1.5 hrs..after the initial 5-10 mins of turning it on, I get a burnt smell...I don&#x27;t get the aroma of essential oils I use...bought this for my bedroom to use with essential oils.. But am very disappointed. I tried this product with 3 different oils( eucalyptus,peppermint,lavender) and 2 different brands...just to make sure it is not an issue with the oil I&#x27;m using...</li>
    <li> I have tried several different diffusers and haven&#x27;t had great luck but this one is very cute and pretty awesome!  It seems effective and is very pleasant to have around.  It isn&#x27;t obnoxious or anything.  The only complaint I have is the amount of water you can put in is small, but really it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product for small rooms, difuses oil effectively and is nice to look at. I will buy another and recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I love it!  So far it&#x27;s great .. it&#x27;s compact and does a great job.  I have only had it for two day so I will come back and let you know how well it holds up.  I am so loving it.  I got the orange because it was a few $$ cheaper and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love this style of Diffuser.  Liked it so much that I bought another one just like it.  Hoping it proves to be a good purchase and lasts a long time.  Best diffuser for the money.</li>
    <li> I love-love-love this little diffuser. I am used to high quality, far more expensive diffusers from Young Living, and this is nearly as good. The longevity of the product is yet to be seen, but I have been using this almost daily for a month now and am very pleased with it. I bought the yellow model, but when turned on it glows red. Kinda&#x27; weird, but not off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;One hint: Run it with the light off(push the start button twice instead of just once when you turn it on). Otherwise it heats up the spout toward the end of the diffusing cycle, which heats the oils on the way out, and heating essential oils changes their beneficial properties. You don&#x27;t want that. This issue alone is the single reason I did not give the product five stars,</li>
    <li> I am just getting into Essential Oils and have done a lot of research for a good quality, low cost diffuser and I believe I chose the right one!  I got the orange one since it was least expensive, but my room is painted a camel color with white trim and with the light off the diffuser matches pretty good (when the light is on, it has a fiery orange red glow).  I especially like that it has an automatic shut off when it is out of water.  I mainly use it at night when I am sleeping, but think it is running for a good 3-4 hours.  I have this exact same diffuser in my &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; because am planning on getting another one for sure.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price!  works beautifully with my essential oils.  I like that you can turn off the light or leave it on for a calming ambiance.</li>
    <li> This diffuser works well and the orange one goes nicely with my decor. The problem I am having is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t reach very far, perhaps all my rooms are too large. And with high ceilings it is even worse. The fragrance is alot more pronounced in my small study. So in that regard I am a little disappointed. Maybe I need a bigger diffuser. I ordered oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden and they are very good. I went on their website and with the 6 oil starter kit you can choose all your own oils, whereas the one here on Amazon you do not have a choice. Cost is about the same.</li>
    <li> After buying one of these diffusers for my home and loving it I bought two more as gifts. I have recommended this diffuser to countless people. One of my favorite things is that it shuts off when it runs out of water. It runs for around four hours. Very simple and effective!</li>
    <li> I bought this diffuser to use with essential oils. I love it. It is very easy to use and clean. Just fill with water and add the drops of EOs you are using and turn on. Diffuser will run until out of water - usually about 3 to 4 hours. Turns off automatically after the unit runs out of water.</li>
    <li> A very nice diffuser and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works good and easy clean up.  Looks like a Jeanie in the bottle coming out to play.  I have ordered every color true to picture.</li>
    <li> Several people at my work bought one of these, but the blue version. It works well and diffuses the scent nicely. The only problem is it is not orange when lit because the bulbs are actually red, so it gives off this strange reddish hue. You can turn off the light, fortunately.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my D-I-L, because I loved the one I have.  Real easy to use, great mist, minimal parts and easy to clean!  Great item and would purchase more of them as I need them!</li>
    <li> The item is bigger than it looks in the picture.  Works perfectly!  Using lavender oil with a touch of peppermint in the air....so nice.  My husband likes it too!  I want to get one for each room in the house!</li>
    <li> I lie this thing.  The other kind I bought was messy, made the counter wet w too much water coming out the top.  I bought a second one for my daughter.  Very nice.  Kinda cute.  Not noisy.  Shuts off automatically.  Lasts for several hours.</li>
    <li> Has worked very well since purchase.  I use it daily.  I do wipe it out frequently to keep the oil residue from building up based on previous reviews.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this item a few months ago, basically right after I purchased it. At the time I had been using the diffuser for the duration of it&#x27;s run time (three hours) once or twice a day. About a month after I had received the product it began turning off after running for only a few minutes. I immediately checked other reviews on Amazon to see if anyone else had this problem. I found PLENTY of people with the exact problem. Some had suggested cleaning the little ring found in the bottom of the water canister and so I did that. I cleaned it first with some mild dish soap and water and then tried to run the diffuser with just water. Again it shut off after a few minutes so I cleaned the ring with rubbing alcohol and tried to run it again with just water. It still shut off and so I contacted the company about getting a refund or a replacement. Amazon&#x27;s policy is that the company has two business days to respond. By the afternoon of the second business day I still had not heard a response so again I e-mailed them and asked for some action to be taken. They finally e-mailed me back shortly thereafter and promised to send me a repair kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks passed and I had not received a repair kit or any more information from the company so I contacted them for the third time asking for a solution. They said they had sent the repair kit but would send another with a tracking number. Another week passed and I finally received one repair kit in the mail (never was e-mailed a tracking number). The repair kit was a new ceramic insert with shoddy instructions. The repair kit also said that the ceramic insert would start to show signs of use after 3,000 hours of use. There is no way that I ran my diffuser for 3,000 hours so there shouldn&#x27;t be this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed the new disk and the same problem occurred so I again sent an e-mail to the company informing them of the persisting problem and asking for next steps. They refused to respond again (seeing a pattern) and finally contacted Amazon about the problem. Amazon was quick to offer a full refund if I sent the diffuser back. They even paid for my postage! They apologized up and down for my hassle and were so easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, nearly two weeks after the last e-mail I had sent the company, I finally received a response. They asked me to send FIFTEEN DOLLARS to them to cover shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I declined and said that Amazon was taking care of it and that there was no way I would send $15 for a product that is likely not going to work. They responded immediately, defensive of their company and their products, stating that one out of a thousand products is defective. People. Read the reviews! So many people are experiencing shoddy products made by this company and even shoddier customer service! Do not purchase a ZAQ diffuser! Do not do it! It&#x27;s not worth the time and hassle and especially not your money!</li>
    <li> This little thing is great.  My whole living room smells like whatever essential oil I&#x27;m using at the time.  It lasts a couple hours and that&#x27;s fine, just refill and turn on.  I like that the plug comes out of the unit for easy refill.  Planning on purchasing more of these for other rooms in my house.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than many others and we love it so much. Shuts off automatically and does the job greatly! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Great aromatherapy diffuser, can take a beating and misuse without missing a beat</li>
    <li> This diffuser works great! It has a lot of output, and is very simple to use. There are only 3 settings. On with both lights, on with only the power button light, and off. It&#x27;s not too loud, but it does give off a light humming sound. My only real complaint about this item is that in the picture the base looks white, but it&#x27;s actually a light gray color.</li>
    <li> Have used almost a month with no issues. Looks nice.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the diffuser. Use it almost nightly for the last month. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Works great....oils seem to last longer than pricier model. We love it.it was a bit smaller than we thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Just pulled it out of the box today. Cute packaging. Using Eden&#x27;s Garden EO (Four Thieves Synergy Blend) and it smells amazing. I got the orange one which actually looks more red than orange. May have to ask santa for the blue one for christmas. Hope this lasts a good time Will try to remember to update if and when it goes out.</li>
    <li> I had seen a short video on this from an Amazon reviewer, and that pretty sold me on how simply this worked.  The reviews, in general, are excellent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the orange one and it puts off a soft, beautiful AMBER lighting...  I&#x27;ve had the diffuser for about a month, I use it every day/night.  I&#x27;d say it runs for about 3 hours (I&#x27;ve never timed it tho).  And if you&#x27;re not around when it needs a water refill, no worries because it shuts itself off.  It never gets warm like it&#x27;s overheating.  You can play around with different essential oil fragrances, and simply use tap water for filling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super simple!  Safe!  And deliciously soothing, or energizing (depending on the oil(s) you choose, and I will be purchasing another one I love it that much.  I bought the orange because it was the least expensive and I gotta say, it&#x27;s really pretty.  More of an amber light.... (maybe I could help with their marketing :)  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend.  (but it looks like the price went up a couple of dollars over the past 4 - 6 weeks??  Not sure.  I thought I paid $39 for mine so it&#x27;s in the current ballpark....</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the scents you plug into the wall outlets (because they are a waste of money) and candles, so I did  purchased this to compensate. I like how it distributes the scent, but it&#x27;s only covers a small area and only stays on for about 3 hours before you have to refill it. That being said, the more scent you put, the greater the output. I wish it&#x27;s holding capacity was larger, but it&#x27;s doing better than the wall scents for now. For what I paid for this, it will offset the cost of wall refills in a month, so if I get that much use out of it, I won&#x27;t be too mad.</li>
    <li> It is small, easy to use and very quiet. I like that it automatically shuts off when water is gone.</li>
    <li> We use it for Spark essential oils and it works great! Great price for the diffuser, and love the option to have the night light on or off!</li>
    <li> RIDICULOUS! 5 star rating for what? My diffuser never worked and mist never came out. The amount of oil i wasted trying to get this thing to work is ridiculous as well. This is unacceptable. RIDICULOUS!</li>
    <li> This little guy works wonders with essential oils. Used it all winter and even took it travelling. LOVE IT! I wish it was a bit more attractive, but it serves its purpose.  Update: After 11 months the unit is not working. It has a one year warranty, so I have contacted the company, but have yet to hear back.</li>
    <li> Love this item! I originally purchased a blue one for my home and I loved it so much I purchased a second one. I was using a tart burner to diffuse my oils but I found it was overpowering. This diffuses just the right amount, as well as adds moisture to the air, who can complain about that? I find it lasts about three hours and then (automatically!!!) shuts off. Which is a dream for someone who is as absent minded as I am. If I forget to turn it off, I know that it will shut off on its own.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I now want one for every room. Amazing with the oils... better than the $160 oil diffuser that I bought.</li>
    <li> Really like it - bought one for home, and one for office - they work well - office one gets more use because it works best in a smaller space. I&#x27;m diffusing at home in a master bath - and it&#x27;s too large an area to cover - so just keep that in mind when buying.</li>
    <li> I like this diffuser and it is not as expensive as other options.  i haven&#x27;t cleaned it once and it still works 100%...i&#x27;ve had it for a while now too.  very simple structure.  just be careful not to get water on the button.  I highly highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser and actually own two of them. I like the option of being able to turn off the light while still leaving the diffuser on. It&#x27;s easy to clean and transport.</li>
    <li> Works well and quiet too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, and highly recommended for essential oils.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is super simple to use. I love the option of turning off the light at night for sleep. The light does not change color, but has a warming cozy glow.  The diffuser is very quiet.  I am very happy with this diffuser.  However, I should mention that the literature claims this diffuser runs continuously for 3-4 hours.  My experience is that it runs for 2, shuts off, and runs 2 more hours once I turn it back on.  After those 2 cycles, the diffuser is ready to be refilled.  I love the ZAQ diffusers.  ZAQ provides efficient diffusers for essential oil lovers like me.  I own several diffusers by different brands.  ZAQ stands out from my others.  Consider the ZAQ Mirage for 8 hour continuous use.</li>
    <li> This diffuser does just what I wanted it to do. I just wish it blew out a bigger amount of vapor to fill my room better but that&#x27;s ok. Its really cute and I like the light up feature.</li>
    <li> I uses a lot of oils for healing and staying healthy. I diffuse different oils all winter and I have 4 of these diffusers. I have one on the main floor of my home and 1 in each bedroom. They all work incredibly well and I swear by the diffuser for keeping my children healthy during the cold and flu season months.</li>
    <li> Love it. Going to order more. Want to put all over the house. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in January and it worked for 4 months and just stopped.  I really liked the diffuser and am trying to reach out to someone as to any warranty but am getting no where.  So if given the option of purchasing again I would have to say no.</li>
    <li> This is the best Diffuser by far.  Great quality for the price.  I have three of these and they are amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the looks, love how it comes out in a pretty heavy stream but it doesn&#x27;t hold much water at ALL.....other than that it works well and i would recommend for someone who doesn&#x27;t need it long periods of time!</li>
    <li> This little diffuser does the job right! I love everything about it!  It has a warm little light that you can turn off if it bothers you. I leave it on because it&#x27;s calming.  It turns off when the water runs out and my room smells wonderful.  I use the mint and eucalyptus oils when I&#x27;m congested or have a headache. This is great when I come home from a stressful day at work, very calming.</li>
    <li> cute, quiet, convenient. you can have the light on or off during use. I use much more essential oil than it suggests. love this thing!</li>
    <li> This diffuser works very well, it makes my whole room smell amazing. The only reason I&#x27;m leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was hoping the orange color would glow orange. Instead, it glows red - which is not horrible, I was just hoping to match my decor. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for use in your office, but not quite powerful enough to diffuse for a room in your home. Other brands have a more &amp;#34;directional&amp;#34; option to get mist where you want it, this one just kinda goes where ever the breeze takes it. But when placed in my office at work, it does the job! And it&#x27;s quiet, which makes it better for the workplace.</li>
    <li> I have just started aromatherapy for my wife.  Don&#x27;t actually think it will do much physical good (except for clearing sinuses) but the fragrances are pleasant.  I read previous reviews on this diffuser and bought based on those.  Good reviews it turns out.  Easy to use, cleans quick, no fuss, no bother.  I also agree with one other reviewer about paying a premium for a different color... Why?  If you are allergic to the color orange, pay the extra $10.00 or so for another color.  Couldn&#x27;t see the point myself.  Filled, with a bunch of oil(s) (a dropper full of two to four scents) it puts out a pretty white scented vapor for about 4 hours.  Appreciate the automatic turn off.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser, it works very well and is quiet. You can turn off the light on it so that you can run it all night with lavender for great sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the scent would cover a larger area, but I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s not too strong as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now. When I first got it, I was using it daily and it was wonderful. It started acting up though and would stop working when only half the water was still in there. That started only after a month of using it. I started unplugging the diffuser and I gave it a good cleaning. It started working better again but would sometimes stop after only half the water was gone. I would unplug it again and clean it out and it would start working good again. It has since been working good ever since. I occasionally just clean it and I do not use it everyday anymore. I don&#x27;t think this diffuser can handle heavy use. But cleaning it out and drying it with a paper towel has saved it and it just keeps working. I do like this diffuser quite alot. It works good when it does work but just need to take good care of it and clean it out and dry it with a towel or paper towel after you use it. I don&#x27;t know if this will help at all but it has worked for me so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Great little diffuser. I was looking at the lotus, and I just could not justify spending double the amount for one, but then I saw this and it works fantastically. I was slightly worried it would look cheap or silly, but the glow and the orange color work nicely into my home. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this, it works just a well as the really $$ Doterra diffuser and I use it about 4-5 times a week and have not had any issues with it .</li>
    <li> My first diffuser, seemed to work well.  After six weeks it turns on and vibrates but quit making vapor.  Contacted ZAQ for help and they do not respond.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! Totally easy to use, lasts for hours, and soundless. Love that it has the feature to have it glow or not. I am a big fan of this product because now i can enjoy my essential oils! :)</li>
    <li> I use it all the time and it works great. Has a soft nightlight option (red) that can be turned off.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, good price through amazon.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but it stopped working after 2 days. Needless to say I returned this and went with Smiley Daisy diffuser that I am super happy with.</li>
    <li> I loved this thing while it worked, which was approximately 8 hours.  I ran it through 1 cycle, it worked beautifully.  I refilled it, it ran, but the lights didn&#x27;t come on.  The third time I went to run it, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  It simply stopped functioning.  I was so disappointed.  I contacted Amazon who refunded me, but now I need to find another diffuser that won&#x27;t do the same thing and doesn&#x27;t cost $100+</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this diffuser.  I have used it every night since I received it with no problems.  I am considering buying another one for my daughter.  She loves it too.</li>
    <li> I am glad I finally bought a diffuser. I have been using it every day, and it makes my RV smell fantastic. I love the automatic shut off function and the fact that you can turn the light off. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love it! So relaxing, my Mother even comes over just to unwind, So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, Its been about a month, I use it ever day. I only wish it could hold more water, lasts about 3 hours. I did have to buy a bigger one that would last all night, and very pleased with that one also. I use this one for during the day, and the other for night.  Just like a Jeanne in a bottle!</li>
    <li> This diffuser is great.  The scent is not overbearing, and the mist is nice during this cold, dry weather.  It will only scent one room at a time.  I move mine around.  People come into my house and say, &amp;#34;MMM, it smells good in here!&amp;#34;  Will buy another soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser that let&#x27;s out a steady, cool mist. It has an automated shut-off feature, making it easy to use while going to sleep. I only wish the reservoir were larger and could last longer.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Replaced the candles I always burned. Its easy and safe to use and I let my kids fill it and turn it on. They love it to and ask me use it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product and love the fact it has an auto shut off after 3 hours, its perfect for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using doTerra Essential Oils and this is the first diffuser I have purchased. It was a good price and I liked the look of it (although it was smaller than I expected when it arrived).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial plan was to use this in the main living space of our home (living room that opens into the kitchen). It really works much better for a small space. I have used it in both my small bedroom and my sons&#x27; even smaller bedroom and it is more effective in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it in our bedrooms and look for a more powerful diffuser for our main living area.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser! It is easy to use, puts forth a very strong mist and smell and the light is really nice when it gets dark.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone - we have 4 of them. They are perfect for the kids bedrooms, the bathroom and my office. Easy to use and clean. The described by manufacturer just as it actually is!!!</li>
    <li> I love this little diffuser!  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and so far I&#x27;ve had no issues with it.  I would however caution it&#x27;s use with any oil blend that contains a carrier oil in it.  The carrier oil can cause problems with the part that makes the vibrations.  Use those with care and don&#x27;t let it go &#x27;dry&#x27;.  I also only use it with RO or distilled water as I don&#x27;t want any mineral deposits to affect the disc.  I intend to buy one like the Whisper so that it will diffuse longer.</li>
    <li> Wow, I never thought I would ever feel I NEEDED to have something like this, but since I got it I have been using it every night. I put a drop of tea tree, a drop of peppermint, and a drop of sweet orange for a great aroma. It helps me with my sinuses in the night and puts moisture in the air so it is easier for me to breathe. I love this thing. I havent had any problems with it either and I have been using it every night for about 3 months. Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> Great little diffuser.  I use it daily at work and it works wonderfully.  Easy to clean and maintain.  Love it.  My co workers like it so much, they have bought them as well.</li>
    <li> I use my diffuser daily with my doTerra oils. It works great! I was also happy to buy it on sale.</li>
    <li> This is great, it really allows my whole flat to smell like peppermint and get the soothing effect of the oil. I would recommend. It keeps oil enact.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these on December 19th.  Here it is February 9th and one of them no longer functions.  The window to return is very short...expired on December 31st.  So...less than 10 days after the window to return the item expired, I am not able to return.  It is a great product when it works, but to have it break this soon is a waste of money. When you turn it on, it shuts itself off after 20 to 30 second.  I will have to contact Amazon to see if they will still allow the return or whether the company will stand behind the product.  I will update this review and let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I contacted Amazon customer service...and they were great.  They will accept both back in return.  After reading all these reviews...I see others have had similar experience with the product so I decided to return both.  I always read the reviews before I purchase something, but I thought in this case the good reviews outweighed the bad enough to go ahead and buy it. However my experience has been more consistent with the bad reviewers&#x27;.  Amazon, being customer oriented as they are, is making it possible for me to still return both of them.  BRAVO Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have had it for two days and I love it, just wished it lasted longer. Seems like i&#x27;m redoing it every 3 to 4 hours.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my daughter and she loves it very much. The size and shape are exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> Works great! It automatically shuts off when the water runs dry.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser. I bought one for my daughter &amp; she loves it too. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, works well &amp; you can have it glow like a night light or turn the light off. I love that it does the job &amp; turns itself off.I think it is an attractive style as well.</li>
    <li> Both are still working great and get regularly used. The light can be on or off.  Great little diffuser for a bedroom or traveling.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is exactly what I needed.  It lasts for hours, then shuts itself off when the water is gone.</li>
    <li> This works great! My only complaint is that its tapered design from a wide base to a thinner top makes it really easy to drop and spill. It slipped out of my hands a few times the first week. The instructions stress not getting any liquid anywhere other than in the designated area, so with is being a little bit bottom heavy with smooth sides, it&#x27;s easy to slip and spill over. Other than that, it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> amazing products very good seller on time as expected</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i take this thing everywhere with me, work out of town ect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great and lasts a pretty good while. Easy to Clean. Small, easy to transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for 6 months for far and have had no issues. it is quite and pumps out a lot of smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using it with Tranquility Blend (Rocky Mountain Oils) every night! I use Purify Blend(Rocky Mountain Oils) for hotel rooms and its AWESOME! will never go to a hotel without this puppy! I also Run Immune Strength when there is is illness in the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do only use Distilled water, I would never recommend using hard tap water in any Diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is you cant turn the power button light off, I cover it up with a book or something but its still weird you cant turn it off cause its pretty bright.</li>
    <li> I love my Oil Diffuser so much that I bought one for a friend. I get so my compliments when I use it .</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this, I am a beauty therapist and use this for my massage and skinCare treatments.  The aromatherapy essential oil I use is pharmaceutical grade from Swissjust I only use 3 drops. It is easy set up, comes in a beautiful Blue serene color. [...] you can find a wonderful distress  Essential that smell wonderful! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The best money invested!!! I use lavander oil and works great. Super Easy to set up and clean after. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting a diffuser where you had to add water or change parts or anything, but I wanted something quiet to use in the bedroom at night.  I have the Advance Aromatherapy Oil Diffuser where you just screw the diffuser cap onto your oil bottle, but I find that one is a bit too noisy to use at night.  So far this one has been great...just add some water, a few drops of oil, turn it on and go to bed.  It automatically shuts off when the water gets low.  It only has one output setting and lasts for about 3 hours, which I wish was a little longer.  But, it diffuses well and is nice and quiet.  And it was a lot less expensive that some other diffusers I was looking at.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Looks great.&lt;br /&gt;2. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;3. Pricing is affordable&lt;br /&gt;4. Smells vary ( depending on what you use for oil )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Little water tank</li>
    <li> Save yourself the trouble and just order a quality diffuser from DoTERRA. Really a disappointment. I thought that this would be a great diffuser for my doterra oils, but it turned out not to be. It worked well the first day I had it, but after that it has only operated once or twice. It turns on every time but then will run for any where from 5-30mins, regardless of the water level. Will be contacting amazon for return.</li>
    <li> This item was returned because it got too hot and turned itself off after about 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;They quickly returned my monies.</li>
    <li> This broke after 6 months… it was great until it stopped working.  I cleaned it and used only as it was directed.  Sadly, it broke AFTER the date I could return it.</li>
    <li> ...but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  But, the cool, slick design makes up for it.  Really great for aromatherapy diffusion in small spaces, like your bedroom or bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great product, it arrived on time, runs very quiet and for about 3 hours, and the color is eye catching and calming. Works so good I bought a second one (waiting on delivery) to put in my office at work. I would highly recommend this product. My friend has a fancy diffuser that cost $150 and I don&#x27;t think it works as good as this one (I used it for a few days). 5 stars for the product, cost and performance!!</li>
    <li> It works noiselessly and easily and turns off by  itself, whent he water has evaporated. I would definitely encourage anyone to buy it  and use essential oils (preferably doterra) to seasona dn protect your environment&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Very aesthetically pleasing, great quality, excellent functioning, easy to clean. I can tell this will last. Not too strong, but noticable in a good way. Get the orange one, it&#x27;s less expensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical on products that receive one star reviews. Understanding that all items can have a flaw is the first part I was able to get over once I plugged in the ZAQ Allay Aromatherapy diffuser.... Not only is this thing top notch I have plans of putting more in the house. It&#x27;s small, lightweight makes it portable and it&#x27;s design is modern to accent any room. It puts off a great deal of vapor to fill a 16x16 room full of essential oil aroma! I&#x27;d recommend this product to any smelly snob! Wish they made a larger version at a average consumers price though.</li>
    <li> We received the diffuser and had it diffusing within 15 minutes! This is so wonderful! I would love to buy another! Filling and cleaning is a cinch. Love the light. Vapors fill the room quickly! Would definitely recommend this to anyone..in fact, I will!</li>
    <li> Best diffuser I have tried with DOterra oils.  I bought three of these and they all work perfectly.  I make sure to use our R.O. water or bottled water each time I refill.  LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased three of these and told many people about them. The two that I purchased for my house work great! BUT I ordered one for my mil for her bday and hers s***s off when there is still water in the reservoir. :( My friend also has two (she purchased bc she loves mine) and one of hers does the same thing! Really annoying!! They are supposed to shut off when empty and I&#x27;m annoyed that the one I gave as a gift is defective.</li>
    <li> The ZAQ Allay Litemist diffuser was my first diffuse that I purchased for use with essential oils in my home. It has worked consistently well and I like the option of having the light on or off during diffusion. It is also great that it shuts off automatically when it is empty.  The reason that I gave it four stars was because the output from the diffuser seems to shoot straight up in a steady small stream and I can see it fall as well. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to disperse into the air as well as another that I&#x27;ve used. We use this in my sons&#x27;s bedroom when he is having allergy issues and it definitely does the trick.</li>
    <li> An affordable diffuser for use with essential oils to purify any space or room.  A mini volcano without the ash.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to receive this and to use it, but only for one day. It worked like a charm for a couple of hours before the mist began to diminish to a lesser amount. When the water was gone, it did shut off. I then cleaned and put it away. Now today it will not mist at all and will only stay on for a couple of seconds. I am returning it for a refund, but repackaging and taking it to the UPS store is aggravation I do not need.</li>
    <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t last as long as other diffusers. Does not get surrounding area wet</li>
    <li> Want one in every room of my house&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery great price&lt;br /&gt;like the 2 different settings and that it shuts down on its own</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for my boyfriend. About 3 months now and is still going strong. I love the automatic turn off feature, adds a great touch. I also love how you can choose the setting with the light or you can turn it off and steam still comes out. Only down fall is this doesn&#x27;t come with the oils, so a purchased KIS oils and they work great with it. Makes the house smell great and works perfect. Some people complain about the sound but it doesn&#x27;t make that much and can easily be blocked out. No need to spend $200 on a machine because this one works perfect. I mainly got to use it for the benefit of the smells so if you want a humidifier you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is perfect and works great!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good diffuser for the price, works instantly, love the&lt;br /&gt;color.  Would be great if it had a timer, but still runs for over an hour&lt;br /&gt;so no regrets, very happy.</li>
    <li> This works great!!  I wish is lasted longer than 4 hours thou!  I did purchase a second one so that I could have one up and downstairs!!!  I even bring one to work!  I also bring one along to hotels and such!  It is small and easy to maintain!</li>
    <li> Love this item...product arrived promptly and in perfect condition...easy to use. Love using in the evening with lavender. . .helps us to fall asleep!</li>
    <li> Have recently found that the diffuser will shut off without emptying the water reservoir.  Am going to have to call the Mfg to see what their policy is on replacement.  Loved it until this happened.</li>
    <li> So far, I LOVE this diffuser. My friends compliment me on it, it works GREAT (not like others I have purchased) AND I am ordering another one as I love to have these in all my rooms. I also love that it comes in colors ...</li>
    <li> I love it!  Have had it since January with zero problems.  I clean it out with rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball, making sure not to get any inside the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to use citrus oils for this diffuser, but it will definitely harm the device.  I filled a plastic spray bottle with lemon myrtle EO and the plastic slowly disintegrated.  I recommend heeding the warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering a couple more.</li>
    <li> It stopped producing mist the next day.  Then it completely stopped working two days later.  I cleaned it as instructed and tried again, the thing &amp;#34;bubbled&amp;#34; but still no mist.  Then I dried it out for 3 days then tried it again but it didn&#x27;t work, only the lights worked.  So I had to return it.  Now I&#x27;m hesitant to try anything by ZAQ again.</li>
    <li> I love the product. However it has stopped working already. Not even 60 days. There must be a problem since I read other reviews that say the same&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll check out other brands</li>
    <li> Loved it a lil smaller than expected but nevertheless a very good product the smell from the oils  you put in come out so good and its a  really nice look</li>
    <li> I got the yellow one, but the light lights it up red. I got it because one of the previous comments said it looks like a volcano, and it totally does. The steam didn&#x27;t go up as high as I thought it would, but I&#x27;m in a large top floor apartment with very tall ceilings and this little unit would fill the entire apartment with beautiful scent. I love it as much as I thought I would. It is an ideal product for dispersing essential oils about your living space.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is much cheaper than the doterra diffuser but gets the job done. The expensive oils can be smelled throughout my classroom and are not destroyed by burning them with, for instance, a tart warmer.</li>
    <li> bought 2 as gifts at christmas.  the recipients loved them and said they emit a lot of scent.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday!  Love it!  It&#x27;s easy to use.  The only reason I did not give this a 5 is it occasionally shuts itself off even though there is plenty of water.</li>
    <li> I had this product delivered to my office and immediately prepared it with some peppermint, lavender, and lemon oil drops. Within minutes I heard my coworkers outside the door wondering where the fragrance was coming from. One colleague ordered hers that day, and when my son came home from college a few days later, he had to have one too so he ordered one as well. My daughter has asked for one for her room as well. We all love it! I love that it cuts off automatically and that you can customize your fragrance for therapeutic uses too. Plus, it is very attractive and easy to move around. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats, all of whom live inside and I am always conscientious about maintain a fresh smelling environment. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Again defective after a couple months use.</li>
    <li> I like this, bought it for my kids&#x27; room.  It freshens the air, provides a nightlight.  However, it generates more heat than I believe is safe to maintain the therapeutic properties of the oils. I&#x27;m not sure how long it runs before before it shuts off.  In the beginning, it seemed like only 30 minutes, but now it seems like it almost runs itself dry.</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone looking to de-stress, though there are alternatives in the Seattle area by purchasing local alternatives, but the price is slightly on the higher side, yet worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I have owned this diffuser for three months now and have mixed feelings about its performance. I give the product 3 stars because shortly after I purchased it, it started making a whistling sound for at least two weeks, and then the noise stopped one day. I would have returned it, had I not had the flu at the time and was using it to diffuse Thieves oil. Of course, I am concerned that the sound will return any moment, and that is a rather annoying by product. When I submitted a &amp;#34;user question&amp;#34; about the product on Amazon, other users did not report a whistling problem. I use the diffuser around the clock and move it frequently, thankfully, the whistling has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It diffuses anywhere from 3-4 hours. I started with 5 drops of EO&#x27;s in filtered water, and have since graduated to 9 drops. It runs and runs, does not make a lot of noise, and comes in three uplifting and vibrant colors. I chose orange and quite love the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is very affordable and there are plenty of positive user reviews to read over, too - which was not what i found when researching the do terra &amp; YL diffusers.</li>
    <li> I guess I have been lucky to have no problems with this litemist this is the 2nd one I have bought I love it! I use one in my massage room and the other at home.  My daughter also bought one and loves it!</li>
    <li> Keeps shutting off even though there is still water in it.</li>
    <li> Same thing with this one ordered two at once the mirage and this one both would run about 10 to 20 min and quit</li>
    <li> I use this every day in my office (massage therapy). Clients like it and I like it too. We have air pollution here so walking into an office that has Eucalyptus diffusing is very refreshing. I just ordered another one for a client to use at her house. Keeps the air clean and fresh and it helps your mood stay on even keel. This is an affordable, effective unit.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have ordered. My daughter has the first one, and  I ordered a replacement for me because of the ease of use and performance of the diffuser. It glows red when in use and has an auto shut off. Easy to fill, empty, and clean. I&#x27;ve ordered other, more expensive diffusers, but I keep going back to this simple, effective model.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is great for very small spaces. Right now I have it in my cube at work. That&#x27;s about all the space it covers - so I wished it covered a bit more space, but for its purpose it is a fine diffuser.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much, I bought another one. Great gift idea. Works well. I have one in the kitchen and another in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works great and makes my house smell yummy. I&#x27;m going to get one for my classroom to see if it will soothe the savage beast. :)</li>
    <li> This is a good diffuser.  It gets a little gummy from the oil but other than that it works great.  I love that you can choose to have the light on or off.  The automatic shut off is helpful as well.</li>
    <li> I think its great it makes my entire bedroom smell like my chosen essential oil in about 10 minutes. My bedroom is an okay size [14Ftx10ft]. Its nice that you can press the power button once to turn off the light for the cone, there is still a little light from the power button, but you can turn it to the wall and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t work all night only 3 or 4 hours, but you can assume that when you buy it knowing it only hold 80ml of water. I wish I thought it out and bought a bigger one.&lt;br /&gt;But I was not surprised in a negative way about the product and it exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> I got this primarily to use with Young Living&#x27;s \\&quot;Clarity\\&quot; essential oil in my classroom in the hopes it would help calm and focus my students. So far it&#x27;s had the opposite effect because they&#x27;re all fascinated by the diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very pretty; I bought the orange one and it looks like a little volcano. It&#x27;s the perfect size- doesn&#x27;t take up any more space on my desk than a coffee mug. It&#x27;s the easiest thing imaginable to use, just take off two plastic lids, fill water to the line, add 2-5 drops of oil. Replace caps, push the power button and the steam stream starts puffing out right away.&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing is that I can keep papers very close to it and they won&#x27;t get wet. It holds its water very well.&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought it I was worried the smell wouldn&#x27;t travel far enough to reach all ends of my room, but it&#x27;s powerful if you add enough oil to it, and it&#x27;s economic, too: three drops is almost too much. I have a large classroom and my desk is at the opposite corner as the door, and students stop by to tell me they can smell the oil in the hallway. Good! They need to calm down out there, too!&lt;br /&gt;They couldn&#x27;t have made this better unless they added a battery-powered feature in addition to plug-in cord. But now I&#x27;m just getting greedy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying one for home, and a few for Christmas gifts, too. My students all want to know the name of this thing so they can get their parents to buy them one, too.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;3 months to the day later, this little guy is working perfectly. Students will occasionally pick it up, spill the water over the sides, and overfill it, and just treat it roughly (the manual warns specifically against this). Somehow, it still looks and functions as if it were brand-new. I wouldn&#x27;t blame it if it had broken down by now! Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is my first diffuser but cleanup is simple! Love that! My die hard oil friends think its great &amp; I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 2 weeks, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I really like this but didnt realize it does use some heat. I was looking for no heat. ALSO,  it shuts off once in a while for no reason. Dont get that one. But otherwise satisfied with it. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 as gifts.  Decided to purchase 3 more for myself!</li>
    <li> zero stars&lt;br /&gt;sent back&lt;br /&gt;worked 5 min (or less) and stopped&lt;br /&gt;yucky.&lt;br /&gt;want a great diffuser? here: http://www.rona.marketingscents.com</li>
    <li> I love doterra essential oils but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price for their diffuser. I ordered this one, the price was very good and the quality is awesome. I thought it would be alot smaller but it is a good size and lasts for a good 3 hours!!! Love the automatic shut off and I can definitely smell the aroma even only using 2 drops of oil. I&#x27;m very happy and plan on buying two more to have in other rooms.</li>
    <li> great little diffuser</li>
    <li> Does a great job!! I love it!! Reasonable price! I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and effective!  With some tap water and a few drops off essential oil, it puts off enough scent to make an entire room smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moWJIMKYJ36WWD]]Scent diffuses for a good 3 hours. I don&#x27;t understand the technology behind it, but the aroma is just as strong as the burners with fire. check out the video I took of this awesome product.</li>
    <li> I really love this Diffuser. It is simple to use, just fill with Filtered water add the oil, and press the start button.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m comparing this diffuser to the Puzhen Lotus and it is by far a superior (and less expensive!) product - easy to clean, auto shut-off when the water runs out, and great &#x27;distribution area&#x27; for such a little item. I like the fact that you can use it with the light on or off and it is virtually noiseless. I was so frustrated with the Lotus - it leaks and it&#x27;s tricky to clean (even with it&#x27;s own brush, directions also recommend using a q-tip). The ZAQ is awesome!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, it&#x27;s quieter than the other ones I have had which were more expensive.  I have bought two from another company and had trouble with both of them.  So far so good...I am thinking of ordering another one for my office at work!</li>
    <li> I was sceptical of this oil diffuser, but a friend had it so I purchased it. I must say the packaging was lovely that I got excited when I got it in my prime box. The diffuser itself had great directions with it. The diffuser works WONDERFUL and exceeded my expectations . No need for a $100 one, this one is great!</li>
    <li> I liked this diffuser while it was working. Broke shortly after purchased...just stopped working. So while it&#x27;s in working order it&#x27;s great. If it stops working you will need to unscrew the ceramic disc cover and wipe out/clean everything underneath and put it back together to make it work again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister, she uses it with doTerra essential oils and really likes this product.</li>
    <li> Instantly works beautifully. Easy to clean, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Update: after owning this diffuser for a few years I have decided I will never pay more than I have to for one. This diffuser over time (just after your warranty expires) ceases to function properly; sometimes it shuts off when it&#x27;s full- sometimes it goes on without stopping even though it is empty. The button now sticks and I am generally displeased w/ the purchase. I&#x27;ve replaced it with an Innogear Diffuser at a third of the price with better features and an array of colors (not just the one your get because of the color of the shade). I like that one so much, I will go buy a second one of those :D. This seems to be an unnecessarily overpriced item, for people who think you have to pay more for a snooty name. The innogear diffuser is just better.  Today, I downgrade this review from a 5 (initial impression) to a 2 (after owner experience).   Original review: This mister is a nice addition to a small bedroom, we found that in a room larger than that... it didn&#x27;t seem to help much (as in for health purposes/you can&#x27;t smell it).  It&#x27;s good to keep it there anyway, since that&#x27;s the room you want to use it in when you&#x27;re sick and can&#x27;t sleep! Mine is right on my headboard, and the glow can be turned off if you like. The button still has a some light coming from it however. The &amp;#34;misting&amp;#34; has a small hissing type sound, the bubbling water inside the device can also be heard but is pleasant like a fountain would be. The motors noise is very slight and not a deterrent at all. I would gladly purchase again, but would consider a different model that could be used in a larger room.</li>
    <li> Do you love Christmas? Then buy this product. Because now that I own one, everyday is like Christmas. It&#x27;s one of those things you didn&#x27;t know you need until you have it. And then you can&#x27;t stop using it. The soothing stream of succulent moisture. The soft bubbling that lets you know everything is going to be OK. Now I know there&#x27;s a reason the word &amp;#34;Essential&amp;#34; is in the product name. K, gtg. Time to sniff heaven.</li>
    <li> After much research, I purchased the ZAQ Allay Diffuser. It shot to the top of my list because of the quality for the price. So far, it&#x27;s been 3 weeks of heavy use and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems. It has an option to use the diffuser with or without a soft light--similar to a night light. Often I turn off any other lighting, diffuse my lavender essential oil by its orange glow and chillax. For the price, it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Great diffuser for the price!  Our kids can even fill &amp; start it.  We love the auto shut-off feature.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product. I find I need to use more than 3 drops of oil and it is definitely more effective in a smaller space, like a massage room or bedroom, but I still use it in my living room area. The light feature is nice, as is the size &amp; look. It lasts about 2 hours before shutting off,a great feature. So, it is a good value all in all.</li>
    <li> Its nice looking, but the scent output is so-so.  The water reservoir is so small.  I can only get an hour or two out of it before it shuts off.  I would only buy this for a very small room.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that you can turn the light on or off.</li>
    <li> I bought this diffuser for my kitchen. Love that it looks like modern art. It works great, too.  My only complaint is I wish the water reservoir held a little more water.  Also, probably because it&#x27;s plastic, I find it absorbs the scent of whichever oil blend I use the most. Because of this, I only use 1-2 oil blends in it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! I love this product, just put water, and a few drops of the oils, and it starts working immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using DoTerra essential oils and I LOVE THEM!  I didn&#x27;t want to pay their high price for their diffuser so I turned to my fav Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was all set to order this in blue at $15 higher when I saw the orange.  I figured I would save myself the $15 and I&#x27;m so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seriously works wonderfully!  Granted I&#x27;ve never owned another diffuser, but this is very, very easy to use and works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did Prime shipping and it was here in a few days.  The packaging was beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser comes with 4 parts.  1. The base. 2.  Electice adapter. 3.  Inner cone. 4.  Orange outer cone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very simple to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base holds about 1/4 cup of water and 3-5 drops of essential oil.  I&#x27;ve used 4 and it is plenty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite benefits of this diffuser is that it shuts off automatically when the water runs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orange color of the cone tends to take on a bit of a reddish hue at the bottom where it&#x27;s closer to the lights, but it still looks great.  I do think the blue color would have a better ambience but I&#x27;m glad I saved $15 because I may buy another one for my family room,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off button can be pushed once to turn on completely, twice to turn light off and a third time to shut off entirely.  Therefore you don&#x27;t need the light on at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t fill an entire house.  It&#x27;s pretty small at about 12\\&quot; high and maybe 5\\&quot; diameter.  You will need one for every room.  I&#x27;ve just been moving mine from the living room then to the bedroom at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It puts off a huge aroma with just 4 drops and I&#x27;m thinking it runs continually for about 5-6 hours before needing to be refilled.  The fan is very quiet.  I can here it running but it doesn&#x27;t interfere with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions point out several times not to tip it over. If you have small kids, you will need to keep it well out of reach as the 2 cones just sit on top of the base and the water would run out very very easily if tipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will be buying another one soon so I don&#x27;t have to change rooms.  I will buy this same product, but might splurge on the blue color for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  Jan. 19, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a short update!  The lights went out within about 4 months of use but the rest of the diffuser still works like a champ!  Love it!on top of the base and the water would run out very very easily if tipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will be buying another one soon so I don&#x27;t have to change rooms.

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one or what. I love the look of this diffuser. The water bubbling in it looks like lava. I love the shape of the vapor coming out -- looks like a geyser. I like that it only needs 3-5 drops for diffusing. But after a week or so of use, I noticed that the unit was getting very warm while it was diffusing. (When you heat the essential oil, it may destroy the oil&#x27;s therapeutic properties). So I was bummed to return it, but I returned it. Maybe if you get this diffuser, it won&#x27;t heat up?</li>
    <li> This essential oil diffuser works as expected.  Its bright orange color and shape make an interesting addition to any decor.  The automatic turn off feature is key - I place it on my nightstand with a few drops of lavender oil and it helps me transition into a relaxing sleep.  The scent is strong and pleasing if you are very close to it, but I have found that it does not leave a lingering scent in the room.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I like it. I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;Main pro - Nice and quiet - the noise of the water bubbling is soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Main con - After 3-4 uses it began to shut off early (in 15-20 minutes, still with a mostly full reservoir.) :(</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser!  It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean.  I am new to using diffusers so I don&#x27;t have much to for comparison.  It&#x27;s easy to put the water in. I read other people&#x27;s reviews saying how the water chamber is hard to get to on other diffusers, but this one is really easy.</li>
    <li> This is a great size for our kitchen and small sitting areas. It was a bit smaller than I expected but I love it that way! I use it every single day. The light alone is calming.</li>
    <li> Broken with in a week</li>
    <li> this diffuser is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of them. It diffuse the essential oils mixed with water for a long time, leaving an amazing fresh scent to my entire home.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with product and seller.</li>
    <li> Works great, fast prompt delivery (arrived a day early even during the Black Friday rush). I use more oil than instructed, but it smells wonderful, and I really enjoy the humidity effect in my dry climate.</li>
    <li> I bought this diffuser a couple months ago and I absolutely love it. I use it in my room at night and it runs a solid 4 hrs. I will definitely buy a second one</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser.  The light mist dies not make anything damp but the oil is definitely diffused throughout the air.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a couple reasonably priced diffusers.  This one does well and easy to use. Four more words here. Geez, really?</li>
    <li> I bought the ZAQ Allay LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser, Orange and it no longer works. I push the button to start it and the button went all the way in. I am SO VERY UPSET. The moment I got it in July and then I was away pretty much all summer. A few weeks ago we started enjoying it with our oils and then broken. I did not push it hard either. I can&#x27;t recommend this product and now I stuck with a diffuser that doesn&#x27;t work and plenty of oil....</li>
    <li> I purchased this diffuser to use with my essential oils. It&#x27;s perfect. Love the fact you can turn the light on or off. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fabulous diffuser - easy to use and works great. This is the second diffuser I have bought - loved the first one so much I wanted another one to run in the kids bedroom.</li>
    <li> This works very well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this little thing! Just got into essential oils/aromatherapy.  I use Tea tea oil in the day to clean the air and lavender at night to relax.  It runs about 2 hours or so and shuts off on its own.  I love the orange color because it matches my salt rock lamps.  Very relaxing at night time.</li>
    <li> Pretty then I thought and smaller  but very nice gift for my mum to put in her zen room instead of burning incense</li>
    <li> It was very fast to receive it.  It was excellent service.  I will definetelly use it when I need to place an order.  Easay to use and very effecitive and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Amazing ! I purchased four total ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son to use at night. It works great and he also loves the soft light that it gives off. Highly recommend for beginners in essential oils.</li>
    <li> Easy and awesome. My first diffuser and perfect for a starter diffuser like myself.</li>
    <li> I like this diffuser - you need to check to see that there is adequate water fairly frequently, but it works nicely and consistently.  I used a simple diffuser with a glass bowl on a stand that was over a tea candle for years - the last time I used it, it &amp;#34;exploded&amp;#34; while there was water and oil in it, and caused a small fire that could have become a bigger one!  This one is safe and that is well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Best diffuser for essential oils every.  I only use DoTerra quality oils in it.  Never clogs.  Been diffusing for months with no issues.  Aroma fills the whole room.</li>
    <li> I have used this diffuser every night since it has arrived.  Easy to use, easy to clean, great effective diffuser!</li>
    <li> All natural essential oils can be pricey. I am not a rich woman but I like to scent my home with them. This product is the answer to everything for me! You only need 4 drops after you fill it with water to get that scent going. It&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s vapor not smoke, the vapor is cool to the touch and you can have the light on or off as it operates. It shuts off by itself and doesn&#x27;t leave a wet mess. This is just awesome.</li>
    <li> It worked you a little bit but now it just doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore, and after reading though the manual their are no instructions on how to help my situation, which is disappointing because I did enjoyed it when it was working. But when I pay $50 for something I expect for it to work for longer than two weeks. Especially since I followed all the instructions and clean it after i used it with a cotton swap and it still broke on me, making me think that it was never worth the $50 to begin with. Of course the brand ZAQ has a website but no phone number to call them at only way to contact them is though email which is helpless. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. I plugged it in, filled with water, added 5 drops of Lavender oil and it immediately started misting when I turned it on. It also has the option to turn the orange (blue, or pink) light off, which is great since I plan on running it at bedtime. The mist is very fine, it smells GREAT and It&#x27;s perfect for my little apartment! Score!</li>
    <li> no issues so far with this product, does a nice job and i like the auto shut off. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great.  Was a gift for my wife.  She loves it.  Has been used quite a bit and still working well.  Seems a tad pricey but I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this only for about 2 weeks, but so far it works fine.  The other diffuser I&#x27;d gotten broke after 2 uses, not this brand. I am hoping it will continue as I really like how long it diffuses and the option to have the light on or off. I have the orange one.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to essential oils and this is the first diffuser that I have purchased.  It is super easy to use and covers a larger area than you may think.  I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> These are so good!  I have 3 of them!  Easy fill and lasts a good 3 hours!  I went for the orange, which was a bit cheaper.  Works great!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Have used a friends but it didn&#x27;t put out as much aroma.  I only have to use a small amount of oils.</li>
    <li> This was my very first foray into diffusing essential oils and my main criteria was price.  I researched reviews here on amazon and decided on this one.  Plain jane easy fill, completely diffuses the water/oil.  Your function choices are diffusing with or without the light, that is all.  I get several hours (I don&#x27;t know why 1 oil diffuses for 3 hours and another diffuses for 4, etc) at which time it shuts off.  I have since purchased several other diffusers and they all have their good and bad points.  With all the intervening choices (some good, some great), this ZAQ Allay LiteMist may still be my overall favorite.</li>
    <li> Love our new diffuser! Great price point and perfect for our room at night!</li>
    <li> Stopped turning on after a month use, I cleaned it and maintenance just as directions told me. ZAQ will not return my e-mails and so even though it says 1 year warranty there is no one to fulfill that. I am left with a piece of colored plastic. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonderfully.  Many other reviewers mentioned this item may not work after several uses, however with all items that use water I found that running vinegar through insures optimal performance.  So please with this product I bought more!</li>
    <li> not sure what the trouble is---keeps shutting off and there is still water in it.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep trying to keep it going</li>
    <li> Had product for 6 months. Only worked in small spaces, often smelled hot while diffusing. Quit working today after very light use. This was my spare for use in bedrooms when kids were sick.</li>
    <li> SMALL! This is a tiny humidifier. It stays on for 45 min to 1 hr tops then it stops working. I did notice that it gets hot about 1 hr into using maybe this is their way of auto shutoff to prevent from burning out (not sure) I had to wait until it cools down before it worked again. It&#x27;s NOT worth the price $10 maybe. Drugstore humidifier works j7st as well and it can stay on for 8 hrs+ with no issues. I drop my EO  in it  no problem. Too m7ch trouble to even return. Not worth my time my effort wasted Money.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t run for more than an hour or so... Then I find I have to restart it and it&#x27;s not always empty when it shuts off. I wish it would run for a longer periods of time. It&#x27;s a perfect general room freshener, but I will spend more money to get a better diffuser that runs all night for my kids rooms when diffusing their essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love my diffuser!  Wish it were a little larger so it would run more than four hours.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this diffuser. I searched around on Amazon a bit before settling on this diffuser to use with my Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t had any problems. It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected, but the size wound up being perfect. It&#x27;s a little bigger than a 16oz glass, and fits perfectly on my nightstand. It came packaged very nicely, and would be great for a gift. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. Nowhere did it say you couldn&#x27;t use citrus oils in the diffuser. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this diffuser all the time; works great.  Love the auto shut off too.  Probably will be ordering another one soon as I like to have it in more than one location! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just as described. The mist that comes out of the diffuser isn&#x27;t hot, but a room temp mist. Love it so much I&#x27;m planning to buy my kids one for their rooms. It really fills the room with a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Love it. Small, doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room and functions as it should. Small capacity, so it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or so, but shuts off when it runs out of water.</li>
    <li> I have had no issues with this diffuser as others have said.  It works beautifully.  Love the soft hum and you can have the option of having a glowing light or not.  Would definitely recommend this for others.</li>
    <li> Lasted 10 months before it stopped working. Other than the broken part not a bad product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this diffuser, just go with the ZAQ Noor Litemist diffuser instead.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a design flaw that allows water to get into a spot that causes it to turn off before the water runs out.&lt;br /&gt;The Noor one is a million times better and not that much more expensive.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Been using it about a month. It&#x27;s simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This diffuser has served its purpose perfectly in my home.  When I started diffusing essential oils, I wasn&#x27;t ready to invest in a more expensive option.  This diffuser provides the same features as more expensive ultrasonic models and is about half of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run one nightly in my bedroom with a calming essential oil blend and I can definitely notice when it&#x27;s not running.  I&#x27;ve experimented with using a lesser amount of oils, moving it further from my bed, and even not running it.  On the nights, when I don&#x27;t diffuse my oils I grind my teeth, the dog paces, and the husband snores.  When it is running, we all get a full night&#x27;s rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to set up so there is no excuse for not setting it up every night.  The cord easily connects and disconnects at the base so you just need to carry to base to the sink, fill it up with water, add 2-4 drops of oil, plug it back in, and turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a built in night light that can be turned off by pressing the power button.  With a full cup, the diffuser runs about 3-4 hours.  You only need a few drops of oil to get the affect, so I&#x27;d warn against using too much.  Anymore than 2-3 drops of oil, and the aroma will become very strong and unbearable to some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple downsides to this diffuser though.  The button light is very bright so I keep it turned away from me at night.  It also makes a dripping sound every once in a while, and to me it sounds like my dog licking his thigh.  If the room is large, this will not be enough to also serve as a humidifier.  It has hardly any impact on the humidity in our bedroom so we have to run a separate humidifier in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced such great success with my first diffuser, I ordered a second one and keep it on top of my dog&#x27;s crate.  In the morning before I leave for work, I set it up to diffuse a blend for the dog.  I use a very light blend of oils (1-2 drops of oil) and the vapors fall right into thecrate.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a diffuser and decided on this one. It is really simple and easy to use and it works well. It is nice to fall asleep to the wonderful aromas knowing the machine turns itself off when done. That&#x27;s it. No fuss. If I could only get my boyfriend to be this easy...</li>
    <li> could use variety oils n smell feel like HOME clean .... is also great for cold remedies Oils too :-)</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend that is new to essential oils.  She loves it.  The mist is cool and the oils smell wonderful.  I bought this for her with the Essential Oils for Dummies book.  I really like this unit.  It is a little on the small side so you have to refill the water somewhat often.  That is the only drawback.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is easy to use, and automatically shuts off when the water mixture has been entirely used.  Also, the led light is a nice touch; not too bright, but just right for a night light.  Recommend</li>
    <li> My daughter requested this for her birthday. She was very pleased when it arrived quickly and said it works great. She lives in the Seattle area and wanted to freshen up her house because of the damp air odor.</li>
    <li> fun and a beautiful gift item.....looks like a little alien...love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great just wish it lasted more then a few hours. 3-4 to be exact~</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and great packaging, thanks!  I love my diffuser!</li>
    <li> The packaging is really nice. I love the features. Press the power button once to turn off the light and twice to turn off the unit. I used real sandalwood oil in mine today since I just got it an hour ago. I have a huge room and it only took 3 minutes to fill the whole room with fragrance. Buy from this company! I just noticed that my counter is damp from the machine running. Make sure you place it onto a waterproof surface or a plastic mat . Here is a YouTube link to a video I made about the dimensions of the diffuser that someone else questioned about. [...]</li>
    <li> Some friends recently turned me to the use of essential oils to help stress and general well being.  Long story short they had a diffuser for their oils and I wanted to get one so I asked them.. Hey paid $200 for theirs and I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  This product is every bit as good as a more expensive model and I would argue because of its cost its better. I have used it about 4 hours a day every day for the 4 weeks and have had no issues. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very satisfied. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that complain about the smell diminishing after a while but I use doTERRA oils and smell is good all the way through. This unit shuts off itself and uses about 1/3 cup of water (79ml). Top part that&#x27;s orange doesn&#x27;t snap on so be careful with kids or cats. It makes a soft, bubbling sound that&#x27;s soothing. Makes my bedroom (which is pretty large) smell lovely. Clean up is a breeze; just pour out remaining water if any and soak up left over droplets with cotton swab. Worth the price. Runs for about 2-3 hours. Will probably be buying another one for birthday gift coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Well, week, well, diffuser is making a strange high pitch buzzing sound that is super annoying when you&#x27;re trying to sleep. Not happy. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears but it sounds like an annoying little alarm clock. Original 5 stars now dropped to 3.</li>
    <li> I love this mister.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, and it&#x27;s effective.  It puts out a nice amount of scent, but it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm (however, if you overload it and are in close quarters, it can be strong).  I also like how it automatically shuts off when the water runs out.  I would buy another and have recommended it to others who have actually purchased one.</li>
    <li> We love our 2 diffusers.  We get 3-4 hours and an auto shut off!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to diffusing essential oils. This was a FABULOUS way to start. Easy to use, clean and diffuse. What more could you need? Its very quiet while running, and the color is just the cherry on top! I just bought another one, blue, for another room in my house. Lasts for the entire evening after work. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I get this in a larger size?</li>
    <li> Diffuser only runs for about an hour before empty. There is some condensation and it requires more drops of oil to generate an aroma than other diffusers. Overall, OK. Decent for price.</li>
    <li> Got it today.  Ran for 15 minutes, then ran for 10, then 2, now dead.  I&#x27;m not going to try to get a replacement, as I see many people have had the same problem.  It is going back.</li>
    <li> Just as the other reviews stated, the diffuser stopped working just under 30 days out. I did get a full refund. I loved this diffuser until it broke. I&#x27;m still tempted to buy a new one, hoping it won&#x27;t break, but I really think there&#x27;s something wrong with the mechanism. It is just great while it works, but then...it stops working.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing diffuser:D.  Love the design, the automatic shut off and how this works.  I have a friend who has had one for over a year and it&#x27;s still going strong -I expect the same</li>
    <li> Ordered late February, now late August and it had stopped working. We didn&#x27;t use it daily or for many hours each day, so pretty disappointed! Even it worked, it worked well but only 6 month life? Not great.</li>
    <li> Day 1: delivered on a Sunday by USPS. Ordered on Friday. Works simply. Instant aroma. Love it so far!  Day 3: It&#x27;s going back. It has programming to automatically shut off once the water is low. Well, this thing shuts off after an hour - sometimes less than - and it&#x27;s full of water (But not overfilled.) Last night, I went to bed with it on, woke up this morning to find it off and full of water. It&#x27;s super cute and when it&#x27;s on, it works well - but unless you want to babysit it... you can&#x27;t depend on it being on. It just turned itself off again. I turned it back on less than 20 minutes ago - and there is still plenty of water in it.     I&#x27;ve already printed my return label.</li>
    <li> this is the first &amp; only (so far) diffuser I have. it does a great job in bedrooms &amp; even in our larger open rooms. it&#x27;s quiet &amp; the light can be turned on or off. It also has a built in voltage adapter for 110-240V, which is awesome if you travel overseas!</li>
    <li> I am new to essential oils and didn&#x27;t want to invest a giant amount of money in a diffuser if I wasn&#x27;t going to like the results.  I ordered this ZAQ Allay LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser in Orange, and I LOVE IT.  It&#x27;s quiet.  The light can be on or not.  It is powerful.  It turns itself off when it has emptied the chamber.  It is easy to fill and clean.  It&#x27;s not large and bulky, it blends into the decor of any room.  I can move it around the house based on the need - living room when the whole house is awake, kid&#x27;s bedroom when someone is sick.  It is definitely a good investment and I love that I am getting a quality piece for a more reasonable price.  I have recommended this brand to a friend, and I will be purchasing at least one more in the future.</li>
    <li> Puts me to sleep every night. Love it with lavender oils.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser! I have a young living diffuser as well it broke within a week of using it and this one has held up strong for three months now! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK , you have to be standing over the diffuser to enjoy the aroma. Another disappointment is the LiteMist aromatherapy essential oil diffuser leaks!!!!!!!! Would not recommend this diffuser.</li>
    <li> Works great exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself. I love it. The color is more of an amber color and the light is actually dim enough to leave on when you sleep. Read many reviews stating theirs quite after 6 months. Mine is working fine.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, easy to fill, virtually quiet compact diffuser. Lasts about 4 hrs &amp; has auto shut off when it runs out of water. Also a plus, you can turn the light off if using @ bedtime. Easy to clean if using distilled water so your not scrubbing the calcium build up from tap water use. Recommend this especially for first time users.</li>
    <li> Love it! Just the perfect size and the orange is so pretty!</li>
    <li> I think everyone should have one of these. Seriously. I love using sweet orange or lavender water soluble essential oils to freshen my home and watching the smoke is actually relaxing. Keeps my home office space serene. It does have to be filled after 4 hours or so but I do not mind. It automatically switches off when empty. I bought the orange version and I like the light it emits. Again, relaxing, but there is an option to turn the light off. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser. It shipped fast, is totally simple and easy to use. And it&#x27;s not that big so doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room. I&#x27;ve used it every nite and love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this diffuser. Thinking about getting another for my home.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I work in an office with students - many of whom are in crisis at the time they stop by. All  who enter (teacher&#x27;s included) immediatly take in the sense of calm that the diffuser emits. That same sense of calm helps me as a worker to respond in a more focused and responsible manner when providing assistance to my students and co-workers.  I wish the water capacity were greater, so that I could keep the feel of a serene enviornment for longer intervals - the well is so small, that the water must be replinished several times throughout my 8 hour work day.</li>
    <li> I looked around at all the reviews to choose my first diffuser. Shopped many sites, many brands, many price ranges. I could not expect any diffuser to work better than this one, unless maybe I was spending $150+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts to release diffused oil within 2 or 3 seconds of turning it on. Just to test it on the first use I left it on in the kitchen to see how far it distributes the oil/aroma. I used 1 drop Lavender, 1 drop Eucalyptus, and 2 drops Sweet Orange. I didn&#x27;t think to time it, but it was running for around 4 hours and I hadn&#x27;t quite filled it all the way up with water- I wasn&#x27;t sure if the &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; or whatever would displace the water thus causing a spill (It does not- you can fill it all the way up to the max fill level). I could noticeably, but not overwhelmingly, smell the oils in the kitchen, throughout the living room, in my bedroom (I did leave the door open), in the hallway, and bathroom. That&#x27;s the entire apartment, though I can&#x27;t speak for my roommate&#x27;s bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you push the power button it turns on the diffuser and the light. Push the power button again to turn off just the light, and again to turn it all off. I love that it turns off automatically when the water is gone, that way I can fall asleep without worry. It is almost completely silent, the only sound is an ocassional very faint sound of water dripping, and even that is almost soothing. The smell distributes very evenly. I can touch the base whether it&#x27;s been in use for 5 minutes or 4 hours without it being hot, and the same goes for the orange cover. Super easy to use and put together, literally anyone can do it with virtually no thought at all. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good, this little guy makes my entire apartment smell nice especially when using Edens Garden essential oils. I like that it has a light and it&#x27;s not too bright.</li>
    <li> I really love my new diffuser! It&#x27;s really cute, it works great and quickly...the only reason I give it a 4 is because I wish it was bigger or worked for a longer time. It might diffuse for maybe an hour before the reservoir is empty and it shuts itself off.</li>
    <li> I use my diffuser everyday and ordered one for my daughter. It definitely meets all our expectations!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work all that well.</li>
</ol>
