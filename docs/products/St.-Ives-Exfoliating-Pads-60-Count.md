      <li>These are so effective.</li>
      <li>They smell nice and citrus-y</li>
      <li>They have a kind of fruity scent to them, and you can also pick out the lactic acid.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it an overtly nice smell, but it isn&#x27;t offensive, either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These pads are nice.</li>
      <li>to be effective.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for someone new to using chemical exfoliants.</li>
      <li>It leaves the skin feeling fresh and it is a perfect way to clean your face before bed without leaving a sticky feeling on your skin.  </li>

      <li>So glad they are just as effective as Philosophy and Skyn Brand ones</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome and pretty cheap, however I did decide to try upgrading the amount of lactic acid I use and switching to Silk naturals</li>

      <li>I was happy to see that the first ingredient in the St. Ives Exfoliating Pads was lactic acid.</li>
      <li>This is a great gentle exofliant!</li>

      <li>I was introduced to this product by a friend - and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>: I had been using cleansing pads from drugstores but was looking for something a bit more healthy for my skin.</li>
      <li>will say that I think the recommendation of utilizing two pads a day is a bit over the top.</li>
      <li>These work okay, but you have to use more than one.</li>
      <li>but this, I love it</li>
      <li>Even after cleaning, these pads are still able to pick up some residue.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your face, it feels airy and light!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Love the convinience of premoistened pads.</li>
      <li>My skin feels okay afterwards.</li>

      <li>so you get more bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>The smell of these is not my favorite, but they do seem to work to even out my skin tone and keep it looking healthy.</li>
      <li>At most, it can itch around my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>These are ok</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smaller than I expected and the pads are very thin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT CLEANS MY FACE EXCEPTIONALLLY WELL. IT HAS A CLEAN SMELL AND FEELS GOOD GLIDINGOVER MY FACE AND NECK, I WILL BE BUYING IT AGAIN AND I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Great astringent pads that wipe away what your cleanser left behind. Does not sting for me.</li>
    <li> Have only used twice so far.  Non-irritating to skin.</li>
    <li> Nice touch of removing residue left from skin and dirt.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t made a difference for me, but it smells great and it didn&#x27;t break me out, I&#x27;ll probably look for something with a stronger AHA. Seems like it would be great for someone with sensitive dry skin, my skin felt softer and plumper a few minutes after swiping it on. But having oily, acne prone skin this just wasn&#x27;t the thing for me.</li>
    <li> Great skin care product at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Excellent Skin feels fresh like new skin</li>
    <li> I love these pads. I bought my 3rd jar of the exfoliating pads the other day, I have no more dry skin and people always stop me and tell me my skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> Eh. I don&#x27;t really think it makes a difference in my skin when I use this.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product, but my over 40 skin needs something a little stronger.  Would be good for 20 and maybe 30 year olds. I think it maybe a good maintainence product as well.</li>
    <li> seeing people rave about these on r/skincareaddiction had me curious. i had a gift card that had $3 left on it so i decided to add this onto a purchase. did absolutely nothing for my skin except make it red and inflamed from the insane amount of lemon juice in these. i almost thought i had been sent a fake but theres no way st ives is popular enough for wholesalers to make fakes of, right? lol i honestly would not recommend these to anyone, there are far better products out there to experiment with chemical exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This is a great AHA product. It&#x27;s perfect for someone new to using chemical exfoliants. It&#x27;s gentle, but very effective. For me it works best when using every other evening after washing my face. Remember to use sunscreen while using this (and other AHAs), as it may increase skin&#x27;s sensitivity to sun.</li>
    <li> These are the best cleansers at the price. Ingredients don&#x27;t irritate like many others. I bought 2 to save on shipping as I use them every day.</li>
    <li> Awesome :) I&#x27;ve bought this a couple times now I would definitely buy it again.  The AHA properties of these pads are awesome at improving the overall texture of my skin.  My skin has gotten so much smoother while using this and some PIH has improved!</li>
    <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I had been using cleansing pads from drugstores but was looking for something a bit more healthy for my skin. St. Ives Exfoliating Pads earned a moderate score on EWG.org so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Glad I did! These pads are loaded with AHAs but free of parabens and other questionable ingredients. I use it as a part of my evening routine. Even after cleaning, these pads are still able to pick up some residue. My skin always feels fresh and clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: The pads have a mild, fruity scent. I like it but those with sensitivity to fragrances might want to reconsider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The pads themselves are a bit flimsy in that they are thin with a smooth surface (see pic). So this is more of a chemical exfoliation than a physical one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I really like these pads - great ingredients with excellent results! I will be sad if they are discontinued &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Great mild AHA formula for daily use on sensitive skin.  Exfoliates without all the irritation that comes from scrubs and brushes.  Just be careful to use sunscreen while using this treatment.  All AHAs make skin more prone to sunburn.</li>
    <li> I Love these with a capital L. They don&#x27;t over dry my skin and after only a few uses I can tell a difference- my skin is soft and smooth. These are chemical exfoliatation, not a rough scrubby pad that isn&#x27;t as good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard these are being discontinued and I really hope that&#x27;s not true. There is nothing else like these, especially in this price point.</li>
    <li> I Normally ADORE ST. IVES products but with this one didn&#x27;t experience any improvement on my skin or any difference at all. Won&#x27;t buy ever again.</li>
    <li> Reddit sent me because I suddenly couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. Sadly they are stopping production on these! These are the greatest thing for my skin (next to Paula&#x27;s Choice AHA and BHA solutions) and fix most issue that arise. Sebaceous filaments, hormonal acne, and spots from touching my chin too much, are all kept at bay. I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier, and I recommend them to everyone. My hair stylist ordered five after I told her I use them and they&#x27;re stopping production, if that says anything (my skin was crazy bad, and slowly, with a good routine and the help of these pads, it became exponentially better). These are so easy to use, smell great (not too strong), and are priced reasonably. I&#x27;d recommend stocking up!</li>
    <li> just okay - very small and not too useful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed. They make my skin feel dewy and fantastic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an average product. My skin feels okay afterwards. I wouldn&#x27;t mind repurchasing if I needed to. Not sure what I was expecting but this is a great price for item.</li>
    <li> I opened this in my office, and someone remarked, &#x27;&#x27;what smells like toilet&#x27;? I need to try another scent to avoid the embarrassing remarks</li>
    <li> Chemical exfoliation at a bargain price! Gentle enough to use every day but effective enough to use for acceleration of deeper &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; products. When I do a quarterly deep peel, I use these after cleansing and toning, before applying a phytic acid lotion. Once the peel period is complete (usually about 10 days), continued use of these pads promotes rapid cell turnover and brighter, smoother skin. If your face gets red and irritated with the daily use of Retin-A or retinol products, this is a nice alternative.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. They don&#x27;t do much for the face.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It refreshes my face and accomplishes what I was trying to achieve, exfoliate my face. Heard it got discontinued, that&#x27;s unfortunate.</li>
    <li> but these at big lots for 3.50!!!</li>
    <li> Works great for the price, I was surprised exfoliates as well as they do for an over the counter product.  Did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love these! Quick shipping. These are so effective. I had been looking for a nice and gentle AHA for a while and these are perfect for my combo skin.</li>
    <li> I was hoping I could use these to wipe my fact before I go to sleep but they are drenched and too thin to work.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the facial pads size.  You need multiple pads to remove make up so you will go through the jar very quickly. I usually like St Ives products but this one leaves a lot to be desired.  I will pass on these and buy facial cloths instead which would better serve the purpose of make up facial cleansing.</li>
    <li> Sad these have been discontinued.  They are a great way to introduce your skin to AHA.  Very gentle!</li>
    <li> Good stuff And safe around eyes too ! No harsh Additives !</li>
    <li> Found out about chemical exfoliation via Reddit, specifically the sub SkinCareAddiction, and gosh am I happy I did! A thousand times better than physical exfoliators (scrubs), these pads brighten my skin and take care of dead skin in a gentle and mess free way. They are gentle enough for every day use, and Amazon has a great price, compared to the only Walgreens in my district that sells them. These might be the first and only item I sign up for automatic deliveries of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time users may experience a slight purging the first few weeks, but this is completely normal, due to the actives (AHA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am not too crazy about is the scent. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s sort of fruity, and some people seem to like it. I prefer scent-free products, which is why I took a star off. However, they rock, and I highly recommend them to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP IN MIND- AHA&#x27;s may increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun, so it is best if you use these in the evening. If you do use in the morning, remember to wear sunscreen- Well, sunscreen is always good, and you should wear it every day, but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: These ROCK!</li>
    <li> Order shipped ahead of schedule and arrived without damage. The pads are thin, but are saturated enough to cover my face and without additional saturation inside container. There seem mild but have been very effective to help brighten dark spots, decrease acne, and work as a great astrigent in my little facial care routine. I use them daily in the morning and at night time without any issues. I love that the ingredients are (mainly natuaral)  things that are familiar to good skin care, are limited in number, and I can actually pronounce I will definitely continue to use!</li>
    <li> works well enough, smells pretty strange though</li>
    <li> The scent is so bad, I needed to rewash my face to get it off! I will be tossing the remainder of these in the trash!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I have always had skin problems and I learned on Reddit that these particular pads had ingredients that would slowly heal red spots from old acne. It&#x27;s too early to tell on that front, but as an exfoliater, they work splendidly. They have a beautiful smell to them, and a slightly harsh scrub that gives you a full sense of awareness of whats going on with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for the last week, which is a good period to tell whether or not your skin will respond poorly to them. So far, my skin (oily) has taken to them and I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction. I can tell there has been a reduction in oil since I started using these. It&#x27;s recommended that you use them x2 a day, but so far x1 has been perfect for me, plus it saves pads!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people who love this product, but I found it to be too strong for my skin, which can get kinda dehydrated. It would sting my face if I had a slight sunburn.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like these, or that they would make a big difference in my routine. Well, actually I&#x27;m not entirely sure that it has made a BIG difference in my routine, but I have tossed the daily exfoliating cleanser I used for years in lieu of this product. My skin looks radiant and fresh after using this product, kind of like it would after doing a &#x27;deep&#x27; scrub before. My skin&#x27;s normal state is dry, a little bit flakey, and has redness issues. It works well with my dry skin, though I did end up switching to the oil cleansing method to wash my face because normal facewash had become too drying after switching these pads. But all in all, I&#x27;m quite pleased with how these work, especially given the price point.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim from a suggestion on the subreddit r/skincareaddiction. I figured it was so cheap I couldn&#x27;t really lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin care is a fickle science as everyone&#x27;s skin and body reacts differently to products. All I can say is this product has greatly improved my skin tone and clarity. As a dude, I don&#x27;t like working to hard to make my face not look like a motorcycle accident and these pads make it super simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just rub it on your face and let it dry. Then do whatever else it is that you do to take care of your skin. Personally, I use these at night after cleansing with oil and don&#x27;t use a lotion after it (I go straight to bed and it will just end up moisturizing my pillow). I just let it dry and I&#x27;m good to go. Sometimes I use a spot treatment, but after about a week or so of using this product it became unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, when either my diet gets bad and starts to create problems for my skin, I use this morning and night. Otherwise, just using it at night is perfect. I had oily/dry (a terrible combination. doesn&#x27;t make sense, stupid skin) and unevenly toned skin but these pad have helped with both of these problems. Give it them at least a week of continuous use to see results. It takes time for skin to get acclimated to new products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, don&#x27;t use them if it causes irritation. I&#x27;m not a dermatologist and odds are neither are you, but I can&#x27;t imagine someone thinking drying and breakouts are a good sign. If your one of these people, just stop using things that cause pain and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pad are so cheap, you might as well give them a shot. Skin care doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive, difficult, or time consuming.</li>
    <li> after using just once, my skin burned and became irritated.  Would not even try again, and would not recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> The exfoliating pads were easy to use and have a nice clean smell to them.  It leaves the skin feeling fresh and it is a perfect way to clean your face before bed without leaving a sticky feeling on your skin.  I didn&#x27;t break out after trying them and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> The pads are very small &amp; thin but they have made a huge difference in my complexion!!!  I have had minor problems with skin eruptions for years &amp; now it&#x27;s smooth &amp; soft!!!  Love this product &amp; will definately continue to use!!!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by SkincareAddiction on Reddit and I&#x27;m so glad. It really works on my acne, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin parched!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to incorporate more AHA into my skincare routine. I did not really experience a purging period however I did notice that my complexion cleared IMMENSELY from using this product, it&#x27;s amazing I recommended it to all of my friends and family! The hyper-pigmentation on my face also lightened and many others have noticed that my skin has become lighter and more even looking. This stuff is awesome and pretty cheap, however I did decide to try upgrading the amount of lactic acid I use and switching to Silk naturals, I do think that this stuff is great for anyone with sensitive skin and trying to begin to formulate a skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
    <li> good product but roc is better</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend - and I absolutely LOVE it. I use it every other day at night, and after a month my skin is much clearer, smoother, and more even. Great for those who are trying to stay away from physical exfoliation. The pads smell fruity and last longer if you cut a pad in half and save one half for a later use.&lt;br /&gt;A bit of a advice for those who have never used any sort of strong AHA products before or those with generally very sensitive skin - start slowly, patch test, moisturize like crazy, and please, please wear sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love these pads they really do remove all the dirt and makeup left behind after washing my face. I was getting breakouts but haven&#x27;t had breakouts since using pads.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives. inexpensive, but highly effective. These make my face glow and are simple to use. hurrah for alpha hydroxyl acids.</li>
    <li> These are ok but I dislike the smell.  It smells to me like a combonation of yeast and milk which is not very pleasant.  They are thin and it is hard to get just one.  I will not buy these again but I will use them until they are gone.  They do seem to help clean my face but they don&#x27;t seem to exfoliate.  They are smooth pads that are moist enough but they have no scrubing power or texture that would allow for scrubbing.</li>
    <li> I love these pads! I find them a lot more effective than my previous AHA creams, and easier to use at the end of the day. The acne scars on my face and upper back are fading much faster than they used to - within a week I was pretty taken aback at the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a permanent addition to my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> These pads are wonderful. They&#x27;ve definitely helped with exfoliating so I am not scrubbing at my face everyday with a washcloth, and make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am a new user of this St. Ives product. So far I like it. It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. Some people have complained about and obtrusive odor that bothers them. I don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. There is such a very faint fragrance, not offensive at all. I barely notice it and I have a great sense of smell.</li>
    <li> I love these and they are so cheap.  Keep my skin clear and fresh looking, not drying for me and I use 1-2x daily.</li>
    <li> This product as made my chest break out, but it&#x27;s great for my face. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as everyone says, but it&#x27;s definitely better than most other products.</li>
    <li> I was on the market for an affordable chemical exfoliant. I suffer from clogged pores on my forehead and cheeks. These are not acnes, but clogged pores filled with dead skin. I was happy to see that the first ingredient in the St. Ives Exfoliating Pads was lactic acid. I&#x27;ve been using these pads twice a day morning and night and used the entire contianer. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I quite like the smell. The pads are thoroughly wet and one pad seems to be enough to cover the entire face and neck. I used the pads in circular motions to ensure that the product went thoroughly into the skin to lift dead skin cells over time. After one month of use, my skin is slightly softer, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the clogged pores. They are still very noticable and have not reduced in number or size on my forehead. I have used higher-end chemical exfoliants and gotten rid of my clogged pores entirely, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I&#x27;m not sure if this speaks to the quality of the lactic acid or what. I am going to try one other drugstore-priced product before I go back to the higher end system I previously used.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Refreshing on my whole face.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these.  We will be reordering these for sure as they are hard to find in stores now for some reason or another. They work very well for cleaning your face.</li>
    <li> This is one of my holy grail products. I really can&#x27;t find a similar lactic acid product in this price range so I am very sad that this product is being discontinued. Hopefully another brand comes out with an alternative soon...</li>
    <li> I like these for what they are, a very gentle AHA. I use a stronger AHA once a week exfoliation (10%) and use these on all the other days. I believe these are 4%. AHA products are moisturizing so especially good for normal to dry skin, though of course oily skin can use these as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are small but hold the perfect amount of product so don&#x27;t let their small and thin size fool ya. I could easily use 1/2 a pad on my face and it would be plenty. I use the entire pad which covers my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a hard core AHA product. I think these would be gentle enough for sensitive skin, even for a tween or young teen.</li>
    <li> great product. unfortunately it was discontinued</li>
    <li> This is a great gentle exofliant! I always use this and Stidex Pads and the combo really helped soothe my skin.</li>
    <li> These are really great; very moist, thin, and effective.&lt;br /&gt;The smell takes some getting used to, but you really should only be using these at night. So by the time you wash and put sunscreen on in the morning. So the smell fades away.&lt;br /&gt;(Remember to always apply sunscreen! This is a chemical peel, so your skin will be sensitivefor a while after use!)</li>
    <li> Read about these on Reddit as well, and they&#x27;re gentle and fantastic for brightening skin and attacking closed comedones. I&#x27;m not seeing many results with PIH (&amp;#34;acne scarring&amp;#34;) just yet but they&#x27;re totally the best for the price.</li>
    <li> These pads have improved my skin in a major way, and I am so sad that they are being/have been discontinued.</li>
    <li> These pads work great.They really made my pores smaller. I would say that my only complaint is that the pads are so thin and stick to each other so I would frequently end up using two instead of one without even realizing it.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin when you do not want a heavier lotion. I use this at night and it does not dry out my skin but does not make my skin oily either.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! These are too small and way too thin. I cannot hold onto one to use it efficiently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a week now, but already I can see results from using it once and occasionally twice a day.  I generally put it on after a shower and before I go to bed.  There&#x27;s never any tingling or burning and my skin is looking much cleaner and clearer after using this.</li>
    <li> work great and exfoliate my skin very well, also they smell pretty nice. each pad is really thin and small but you only need one to exfoliate your face which is amazing!! the cost isnt too much for the value</li>
    <li> The pads really stick to each other, so make sure you are not using 2-4 at once. It smells great. cleanses gently and leaves skin soft. I got tired of using a face scrub and then having to wash it off. I just use this and throw it away and go to sleep. ships with 4-5days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with unsightly and sometimes painful ingrown hairs and red bumps along my bikini line for as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving and more recently, epilating the hair there. Over the years I&#x27;ve ended up with tiny scars reminiscent of acne scarring due to this, and I&#x27;ve always felt very insecure about wearing any kind of bathing suit that would expose my hips for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research about ways I could prevent future ingrown hairs, I decided to order this product as it was a very well-reviewed chemical exfoliant that I didn&#x27;t mind taking a chance on- I figured, worst case scenario if it didn&#x27;t help with my bikini line, I could use it on my face instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and it works SO well! I&#x27;m ecstatic and could not recommend it more. Within four days of starting to use it (applying twice a day, as suggested) I&#x27;ve already seen a major decrease in the occurrence of ingrown hairs and little bumps (which happen when hair is removed from a follicle and the now empty channel gets clogged, similar to how acne forms). Even more exciting is that since it&#x27;s a chemical exfoliant, it&#x27;s been lightening old scars and improving the overall quality of my skin. When I do get an ingrown hair, if I treat it with the pads it vanishes within a day or two and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any kind of scarring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of these once I run out, which should take about a month if I keep using two pads a day. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like this product because of the smell. It was a little too chemically fruity.</li>
    <li> Day 3 and I love these. I was recommended to them by /r/skincareaddiction which gave me a lot of tips. First use these at night after washing/drying/toning your face. I was recommended to wait 20 minutes after using these before applying anything else, and I have been. They&#x27;ve made my face smoother and are helping dislodge these blackheads and clogged pores I&#x27;ve had for a while. I&#x27;m told for these to help fade red marks you should wear sunscreen, so I&#x27;m waiting for that to arrive as well, but for now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these pads.</li>
    <li> I have a fair, European complexion. My skin is combination in that my T-zone and chin are oily and prone to breakouts, yet sometimes dry and flaky. I do not tolerate products with alcohol or heavy scents in them at all. I was pleased by this product. It is much gentler than Alpha Hydrox cream, and yet the results are there. My skin is smoother without being over-dried. My skin isn&#x27;t as flaky or oily. I am happy because the cost of this product is reasonable. The scent is something like soapy fruit, but barely registers to me, even though I&#x27;m used to sneezing numerous times after attempting to use most scented cosmetics. I will attempt to use this on other acne prone areas to see if there are any results, but so far, for my face, I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Prevents zitts and those little white bumps if you use it consistently. Seems to help wrinkles too. I can&#x27;t use it every night, but once or twice a week is good if your not a teenager.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now, every morning 2-5 minutes before moisturizer, sometimes in the evening. I have very dry facial skin in some places and oily in others. When used consistently with a good moisturizer, this product has improved the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> pads are too thin for my tastes but it is gentle enough to even wipe across eyelids to remove all make up</li>
    <li> Very good value, cleans well. No complaints.  A new favorite and standard for my regime.</li>
    <li> I used peel pads for a while ( with lactic acid) for my rosacea bumps and they vastly improved my skin texture and glow. I gladly paid 30-45 dollars a jar (which lasted me half a year) so finding these at such a low price was awesome. So glad they are just as effective as Philosophy and Skyn Brand ones I have purchased in the past. Very pleasant natural scent, no alcohol. Tingle as they should(sign of effective levels and ph) but no burning or stinging, very cooling and soothing feeling. Work great on occasional back breakouts/zits as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of several people hoping for a good daily AHA to address some of my skin issues.  Unfortunately, the fragrance was much stronger than I expected (not unpleasant, but too strong for a person who always buys fragrance-free) and it made me break out across my forehead -- I never break out on my forehead. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed having this for those mornings or evenings when I don&#x27;t have time for a full sink cleaning. Gets off the day&#x27;s grime and leaves me feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
    <li> I had been using stridex pads in the red box -- this is so much better! Cleared up my skin almost right away and my skin is softer to boot! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it!  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that much of an exfolitation, but it makes my skin feel thoroughly cleansed.  It takes off all my makeup and has a little tingle to it, making my skin look really good.  I take it with me when I travel, the price is good and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> tried these for about a month or so. Didn&#x27;t see a real change besides some noticable redness fading. Decided to go with BHA pads instead as maybe my expectations for an AHA were too high</li>
    <li> Ive tried clarins and REN exfoliating toners and this hands down beats them both on a few things as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol free&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Amount you get/ how long the product lasts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally rate St Ives that much but this, I love it, it&#x27;s natural and gentle and also works better than others I have tried. I can actually feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to feel about these. I read raving reviews on them so I ordered them about a couple months ago and have been using them on and off. They smell nice and citrus-y but it seems that every time I use them, I start breaking out a couple days later. Now I use First Aid Beauty&#x27;s Facial Radiance Pads from Sephora which are like heaven in pad-form. I cut them in half or even in quarters (since it is still enough product for my whole face) and have seen tremendous results in the appearance of breakouts and the flakiness I was getting on my skin from other products that dried it out. I would highly recommend those as a chemical exfoliant if you have breakout-prone skin like me.</li>
    <li> Love the products hands down</li>
    <li> I also REALLY LIKE  this product, too! I believe it&#x27;s helping my skin look younger, fresher!</li>
    <li> Seems to work alright. Don&#x27;t love the smell though and the pads are a little bit difficult to get apart</li>
    <li> These work okay, but you have to use more than one. If you can peel them apart (which is difficult), the one cleaning pad doesn&#x27;t really clean well enough.</li>
    <li> They are really soft for &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; pads. A little hard to use since they are so soft and dont hold their shape.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Gives my skin a lovely, healthy glow :) smells refreshing as well.</li>
    <li> Great nightly product for those days when you&#x27;re too lazy to wash your face. So sad that it&#x27;s been discontinued. Hopefully they bring it back soon!</li>
    <li> Wish I could find this in stores, works.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything good for me. In fact, I started getting small white pimples on the sides of my face after using this product which was a shame because I really wanted to like this. A lot of other people like it, so maybe it just wasn&#x27;t a good match for my combination, slightly sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to really do much. Burns a little bit sometimes. I&#x27;ll finish it, but I&#x27;m not getting it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered these already. They help so much to keep my face smooth. Some reviewers have mentioned a weird smell, but the smell is so faint and it doesn&#x27;t linger and isn&#x27;t offensive. Great product!</li>
    <li> Best affordable chemical exfoliator out there.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in stores and i really like the results</li>
    <li> These are fantastic little things. Use them before bed to wake up with literally glowing skin. They have a soft scent of exotic fruits and are gentle enough to use daily on my moderately sensitive skin. Here are some of the ways I&#x27;ve personally used these and found them to be effective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Use as all over exfoliator at night&lt;br /&gt;(2) Use as targeted treatment for acne&lt;br /&gt;(3) Remove fine lines around eyes &amp; mouth&lt;br /&gt;(4) Exfoliate cracked lips before bed&lt;br /&gt;(5) Apply to just-shaved skin (bikini area) to prevent razor bumps / razor rash&lt;br /&gt;(6) Apply to existing razor bumps&lt;br /&gt;(7) Apply several times daily to help release severely ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a gentle yet effective everyday chemical exfoliant / almost a toner for sensituve skin, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: I like to apply this first in the morning, followed with a spritz all over the face of Thayer Rose Witch Hazel also here on Amazon to mousturizing, exfoliate, and keep a matte finish without the use of makeup. They make an amazing combo.)</li>
    <li> Nice and small, very refreshing &amp; pleasant fragrance&lt;br /&gt;There is no residual chemicals left on my face which feels very smooth&lt;br /&gt;A great price for a hard to find item</li>
    <li> It seems it works well on peeling off the old skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> why these are discontinued :(</li>
    <li> They are ok as far as cleansing/finishing wipes but don&#x27;t really exfoliate. I expected them to be a little rougher.</li>
    <li> The smell of these is not my favorite, but they do seem to work to even out my skin tone and keep it looking healthy. They also don&#x27;t seem harsh when applying. Disposable pads make using them very convenient.</li>
    <li> These exfoliating pads are a great part of my facial routine at night.  I love the way they clean off what my face cleaner misses.</li>
    <li> I will preface this review by saying that everything skin care is subjective-- what&#x27;s great for your skin, my skin may hate, and vice versa. So always be careful with new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said... I have extremely finicky skin. Sensitive both in breakouts AND allergic reactions. I wanted to find a chemical exfoliant but a string of BHAs (salicylic acid products) left my skin very angry, with breakouts galore. I read that AHAs, such as this product, can be a good alternate, and since this product was so cheap, I figured I may as well give it a try, fully expecting my skin to react poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m so glad I tried this stuff, because my skin has become SO much better since I started using it about three months ago. My breakouts have lessened, and the overall tone is a lot brighter and more even. I have super, super pale skin, and every single zit I develop, big or small, tends to leave an unfortunate purple mark behind, and these pads have noticeably helped lighten some of these marks. They haven&#x27;t faded altogether, but they&#x27;re most definitely better than they were before. The pads ARE quite thin and tend to stick together, but I have no problems peeling them apart, and they&#x27;re saturated enough to evenly cover my face. They have a kind of fruity scent to them, and you can also pick out the lactic acid. I wouldn&#x27;t call it an overtly nice smell, but it isn&#x27;t offensive, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I think the recommendation of utilizing two pads a day is a bit over the top. First, AHAs increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun and need to be used in conjunction with sunscreen; due to this, I also prefer to use them at night... and using two a day would mean one in the morning, right before sun exposure. Second, especially if you have sensitive skin, overuse may just prove counter-productive and irritating. I never tried to use these twice a day, but at the start I was using them once a day, and even this proved to be a tad too much for myhyper-reactive skin. I now use them every other day, and this seems to be a good amount for me. Of course, your own skin&#x27;s tolerance may vary. But I would recommend starting off slow with these as you figure out your tolerance level, and not immediately leaping to the recommendation on the jar. A final note: I read a negative review here saying that these pads didn&#x27;t seem scrubby enough to really exfoliate. However, these are a CHEMICAL exfoliant, not physical. That means they&#x27;re not supposed to be scrubby: it&#x27;s the ingredients in these that exfoliate, not the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend at least giving these a shot. They&#x27;re extremely affordable, and so even if your skin doesn&#x27;t end up loving them, it&#x27;s not a huge financial gamble. And if they end up working for you, well-- I&#x27;m never one to turn down an effective, cheap skincare product!</li>
    <li> Great! This product work really well for me, but as always, test it first. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Thanks to these pads, I no longer have to use a facial brush or scrub. These keep my face soft and smooth. I would recommend cutting these pads in half so you get more bang for your buck. I deducted 1 star because reviews and articles I read said these would unclog pores. While my face is soft, I still have clogged pores that only pore strips get rid of if only for a day.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives products and was excited to try these exfoliating pads. The first time I used them I was disappointed though. These pads are smooth and in my own opinion aren&#x27;t great for exfoliating. If you have sensitive skin or prefer very gentle exfoliation then this is the product for you. I prefer products that have a bit more &amp;#34;texture.&amp;#34; I have at this point used the whole pack of 60 pads and don&#x27;t plan to repurchase. I basically just found them useful to remove my makeup.</li>
    <li> smells so good. skin feels smooth and has a nice glow after using for about a month. i use it when I first wake up &amp; before bed.</li>
    <li> As described. I knew about the thin pads and smell going in. I am satisfied with everything about the product except the added fruit/floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> Although the pads are very thin, I am pleased with the outcome. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily take all my face makeup off with these, I choose to wash my face first and then use these as a follow up. My face looks refreshed without any drying whatsoever.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t work and I spent a lot of money on them &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> First time buyer, they were so cheap and worked well and then literally 2 weeks later I learn they are being discontinued and it was too late to stock up the price already shot up to 13+ dollars a bottle. Surprise, surprise. Ah well, time to find a new product.</li>
    <li> First off I love the light cucumber smell. I have used at night for over a month and I do see improvement with my discolored acne scars. I wash my face first, apply a pad, wait 15 minutes and then add my acne medication. I will defiantly buy again but I wish they sold this in regular stores.</li>
    <li> It does a good job of what it is supposed to do, but it is way hard to handle as it is too small and thin. If they come out with a bigger one and a little thicker one, I will buy it for sure.</li>
    <li> Changed my skincare game. Great for beginners who want to improve their skin, and it&#x27;s also not a huge monetary risk as if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it&#x27;s not a huge deal as it&#x27;s only like $5. It definitely helped to minimize the appearance of pores on my face and changed my skin texture for the better. My skin is a little sensitive but I find I can use these pads every day. They do stick together a bit when you&#x27;re peeling them off the stack so be careful!</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t sting or anything, and they had a weird but not unpleasant smell, but they didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my skin. I&#x27;ve had better results with other AHAs.</li>
    <li> I love these little pads. The chemical exfoliation works well on my sensitive skin. It burned a little at first but then after a few days my skin got used to it. These make my skin super soft and smooth. Very pleased with this, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably not appropriate to rate these only after a few weeks of use, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I bought these because they contain AHA, and I wanted to encourage my skin to regenerate new cells faster. I have a few discolorations around my chin from old scars. Nothing big or too noticeable, at least not to anyone but me! These pads are nice. They have a decent smell, and there is plenty of the liquid/solution on each one to cover a few faces! I am super hopeful that they will help, but of course it&#x27;s hard to say in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought they would be, but pack a lot of punch. I could probably cut the pads in half and still coat my face well. They smell like fruit!</li>
    <li> Received just what I expected. Works perfectly! Take note that this is a pretty weak exfoliator, so if you want to fight acne you&#x27;ll need a stronger one.</li>
    <li> These are nicer than expected.  They definitely can be used for anyone with very dry or acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Love the convinience of premoistened pads.</li>
    <li> love it, smell good, and make my skin soft</li>
    <li> I havent noticed any difference in my skin</li>
    <li> When I ordered these exfoliating pads I expected them to be a bit rough but they are relatively soft/smooth and feel nice on my skin. They are very very thin &amp; kind of hard to separate initially so be careful that you aren&#x27;t wasting them by grabbing a thick stack. They sort of made my skin break out the first few uses, but as soon as I stopped using them at night and only used them in the morning before I put on my makeup the breakouts stopped. The fragrance isn&#x27;t abrasive and there&#x27;s no stinging sensation or tightening of the skin after use.</li>
    <li> Reddit approved! This is on the list of top products to buy for basic facial care. I bought it and agree!</li>
    <li> On advice from Reddit&#x27;s sub skincareaddiction, I ordered this, along Cerave&#x27;s Hydrating Cleanser, and Cerave&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and so what works for me may not work for you, the reader. Also, this is my first chemical exfoliater (these pads use lactic acid, an AHA). I had used physical exfoliaters like St. Ives Acricot Scrub back in high school, but I quit when r/skincareaddiction alerted that physical exfoliaters produce micro-tears and make the skin more vulnerable to infection. So I am by no means an expert on exfoliaters; I&#x27;m just giving my skin&#x27;s reaction to this new regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first night trying this, I didn&#x27;t see much effect. This was probably because I applied moisturizer immediately after using a pad. I only exfoliated twice a week at max. Then I read further, and found one has to let the AHAs sit a while on the skin, to -- guess what -- exfoliate. The lactic acid makes the skin shed, but the acidity also prevents the skin&#x27;s acid barrier from getting broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel a bit of tingling of the acids after five minutes of application. The tingling is not painful or burning for me. At most, it can itch around my eyebrows. The liquid becomes dry after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I let the liquid sit for a full 30 minutes. Then I applied Cerave cream, and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today at work, I COULD NOT STOP TOUCHING MY FACE. I know, I know, one shouldn&#x27;t touch one&#x27;s face! But I couldn&#x27;t help it, I honestly don&#x27;t remember a time when my skin&#x27;s texture felt this... delightfully plump and squishy, I might say. I guess normal skincare marketers would use the term &amp;#34;supple&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers mention a strange scent from this product. I agree that there is a bit of a floral scent upon opening the container, and after application of a pad, this scent dissipates and brings along scent, similar to sour milk. It is likely just the lactic acid (which incidentally is also found in sour milk). This scent is not particularly overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, skincareaddiction!</li>
    <li> These pads are a really great way to chemically exfoliate your skin. They don&#x27;t dry out your face and they leave it feeling clean. They do make your face more sensitive to the sun, but as long as you wear a good sunblock, these pads work great.</li>
    <li> These are one of my all time favorite skincare products. The only problem is that they&#x27;ve been discontinued so the price is way more than it used to be. I&#x27;ve tried products that are similar, with glycolic acid, but they don&#x27;t work in the same way. I hope that St. Ives will remake these, my skin misses them. :(</li>
    <li> At first the smell was almost too sweet for me, but after a while I&#x27;m used to it. It&#x27;s gentle enough where I use it once a day and haven&#x27;t had any issues. My skin looks much better after about a month of using it.</li>
    <li> these are a great way to exfoliate chemically. with regular use my skins texture has definitely&lt;br /&gt;improved.</li>
    <li> These do what they are advertised to do so much so that  I bought them repeatedly for a while.  I ultimately stopped using in my efforts to reduce the (toxic) chemicals in my personal care products.  I must say that I am happy with the reduction in the dark-spots on my face.  If I used this again it would be for a  limited time.  Just my personal opinion from the research I have done.</li>
    <li> I love these exfoliating pads.  You can feel just enough of a tingle to know they are doing something.  And I&#x27;ve used them for over a month now and I do see a difference. I use them before I put on others night creams/treatments to exfoliate first. And also use them in the morning. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> There is no exfoliation.  These pads are smooth.  I don&#x27;t feel like they do anything other than make my face wet.</li>
    <li> These pads have a strange after smell using them.  Not really my cup of tea.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> This products whacks you over the head with its cloying vaguely-citrusy smell. The fragrance is so irritating it broke me out, and I don&#x27;t even want to use it on my body because of the smell. I would try Paula&#x27;s Choice instead.</li>
    <li> Opened these and forgot about them for months and they still haven&#x27;t dried out. Nice product, doesn&#x27;t cause any issues for me with other products and doesn&#x27;t feel bad on the face.  Seems to work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a great product because it&#x27;s one of the few skin care products that exfoliates your skin while maintaining the natural pH of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it 2-3 times a week nightly after I washed my face, and I do feel like it greatly improved my skin. I used to have pretty bad acne and now I have virtually none, thanks to the help of this product in my daily regime.</li>
    <li> This is a great beginner&#x27;s AHA. It was the first chemical exfoliant I ever used, and I love it. It really helps to even out my skin tone and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive, dry skin, and I can&#x27;t normally tolerate fragrance. I was really expecting some sort of a reaction or irritation from these, but it&#x27;s been fine! Not my favorite fragrance, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Any exfoliant can be drying, so make sure you moisturize. Wait 30 minutes or so between the pads and your moisturizer if you can, or at least until the exfoliant dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: AHAs (including these pads) increase photosensitivity, so wear sunscreen if you don&#x27;t already, and aim to use these at night if possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple weeks and I think they might be breaking me out. I might be purging, though, so I&#x27;m going to use them a little while longer to be sure, since they have minimized my pores really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: These were causing me to break out. I do not have extremely sensitive skin, but I think the fragrance might be the culprit. Going to keep these away from my face. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> These are mild enough to use twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I use them after I wash my face, before I apply serums or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;One star off because I think St. Ives should work on the scent - it&#x27;s not truly bad, but it could be better.</li>
    <li> These do not burn my skin the way other exfoliating/glycolic pads do. I&#x27;ve been using every night, to every other night, based on my other anti-aging product usage. My skin looks cleaner, clearer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 60 pads in this little container. That&#x27;s quite a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> Not an exfoliant - more like moist cloth with a weird berry scent.</li>
    <li> I love these, I use them every night as the chemical exfoliation in my skincare routine. However, I wouldn&#x27;t use them in the morning, as AHA can intensify sun damage.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed that these are being discontinued by St. Ives. These pads were so reasonable and easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in the stores. I wish these were easier to buy because they work great for my skin. These are raved on reddit (/r/skincareaddiction). I cut the pads into quarters to extend the life of the tub worried I won&#x27;t be able to purchase these again. I don&#x27;t know what I will do if these become discontinued.</li>
    <li> When you try it, it feels really good. Nice, clean, and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your face, it feels airy and light! But. . . the smell is something you&#x27;ll have to get used to. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s 100% bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the greatest product around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it&#x27;s done drying, your skin feels normal - not tight or shiny. Just normal! Which is how you want it to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the smell was different, that&#x27;s all I would change!</li>
    <li> Dried up pieces of cloth might as well just use lemon juice on your face u would get better results!</li>
    <li> Convenient, smells good, travel helper.</li>
    <li> Easy peasy way to exfoliate. Very light and fresh smelling as well.</li>
    <li> I just received these cleaning pads and had to try one out right away. Well, it cleans. But exfoliating? Not. I love the St. Ives product line and so I had high hopes for this product. I&#x27;ll end up using them for my morning face cleaning, but it looks like I continue my quest for gentle exfoliating pads.</li>
    <li> It smells good and tingles a little bit when I use it. However, I can&#x27;t say it does anything.</li>
    <li> These smelled great but I would not say that they were exfoliating at all.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;d like to say that my skin has always been relatively healthy. I&#x27;ve never had acne in my life, with the exception of one or two zits on my face at a time. Over the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been using Clearasil Daily Clear exfoliating pads to take care of extra shine on my face every once in a while and haven&#x27;t broken out since using them. Last weekend when I ran out, I bought these on impulse because the only local store to me that carries the Clearasil wipes were out of stock and the St. Ives were on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the container and used these pads I was pleased. The scent was pleasant, my skin was left very soft, my face refreshed, and there was no irritation. So day number two of using these pads came and when I woke up from a mid-day nap I had a little red bump on my forehead. I thought nothing of it, used another St. Ives pad and went on with my life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon waking up the next morning, I looked in the mirror in horror to see my face FULL ON broken out in zits. I took a cotton pad that I had put rubbing alcohol on and wiped my face to see a disgusting amount of built-up oil soaked up on the pad. Thankfully I had a travel sized tube of my regular face wash in my travel bag and my skin was back to normal within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I pitched the container of these into the trash I got a glimpse of the ingredients of these pads. These pretty much consist of; sugar, sugar, sugar from fruit extracts, and more sugar. Shame on me for not looking at the ingredients before I actually purchased these, but the price tag was too attractive. I don&#x27;t think some people realize that spreading sugar into their pores is actually BAD for them, natural or not. Now I see why these St. Ives face pads are so cheap (and always on-sale) and why my normal Clearasil Daily Clear pads are more expensive and hard to find. You get what you pay for as far as skin care goes and these are a glorious testimony to that fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep yourpores clear and stay away from these at all cost.</li>
    <li> Great for removing make-up or after using your best make-up remover.</li>
    <li> this works wonders for my acne skin!!</li>
    <li> These do not dry my skin as other exfoliating products do. This product also has a nice scent and more importantly my skin is already looking youger</li>
    <li> These are a great gentle daily AHA product and my skin has reacted well to them, but I know that they&#x27;re not for everyone. There is a noticeable scent--it&#x27;s a soft but vaguely fruity/flowery smell--and I know some people have had reactions to some of the other ingredients, but this varies a lot by individual and no review can tell you if it will work for your skin. If you want to test out an AHA for the first time, start with these, then try something else if you aren&#x27;t satisfied. If you need something stronger, though, look elsewhere--these are a really low concentration of lactic acid, which is already a pretty gentle AHA. For me, though, once- or twice-daily use has given my skin less dry patches, more even skin tone, a glow, and has helped control my acne and similar issues.</li>
    <li> They seem to exfoliate, but I find myself passing them over due the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not a fan at all, I bought these exfoliating pads hoping I got a great deal with the price of these, It was like nothing!!!! With the ingredients in it, I was expecting more of a impact on my skin, but I guess if you have sensitive skin then this might be perfect for you, not to strong and all. Me and my skin have been through it all, and it&#x27;s not very sensitive but I felt nothing on my skin when I used these, I used them three weeks and seen no improvement and the pads are so super thin, and I did notice something that I was not a fan of at all, after your face dries from using these, the fragrance on these changes and it turns to some weird butterscotch or something in those lines smell, I don&#x27;t know what ingredient in it is making It do that but WOW, no bueno!!! I think St Ives should of fixed a few things before launching these!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I learned about these exfoliating pads on the subreddit, /r/skincareaddiction. If used correctly, they definitely work. This uses AHA&#x27;s to smooth the skin, no alcohol added and it&#x27;s the proper pH to be effective. I needed something that exfoliated but also added moisture to my routine, and this helped immensely to restore the moisture barrier on my face. I generally use it at night a few times a week. After I wash my face and let it dry, I apply this product and wait 20-30 minutes before applying moisturizer. The wait time is important in order for the AHA to do it&#x27;s thang to be effective. Also, my face isn&#x27;t on fire when I use this and it smells reeeeaaaallllly good. So frustrating that it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t discontinuing these!</li>
    <li> Ehh idk I guess it does the job right.</li>
    <li> Although they are exfoliating pads, these are very gentle. Many cleansing pads have that rough waffle weave, but these are soft and pillow-like. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel abused after use.</li>
