      <li>I originally ordered 16&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think 3 packs will do a full head.</li>
      <li>I used 3 bundles I ordered another bundle to make it full</li>

      <li>Thanks Hot Hair and Amazon!</li>

      <li>She states that similar hair in the local beauty supply store would cost waaay more.  </li>
      <li>Her stylist didn&#x27;t need to use all of it at once, so she will be able to not only wash and re-use the hair that she&#x27;s currently wearing, but also still has left-over hair for an additional application.  </li>
      <li>I guess all I could do now is be more careful when buying off line or just deal directly with the hair store in my area.</li>

      <li>Super soft, minimal shedding, it doesn&#x27;t tangle at the nape of your neck.</li>
      <li>so far ive just been wearing it wavy</li>
      <li>I have finally found some place to get hair at a reasonable price.</li>

      <li>But the 3 bundles create a natural look.</li>
      <li>Love it so thick can&#x27;t wait til install it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice hair just kinda thin at the ends</li>

      <li>It barely helped...</li>
      <li>Extremely soft, not the best but, but not the worst.</li>

    <li> Great hair... I love it.  Very soft and my bundles are great.</li>
    <li> Love it so thick can&#x27;t wait til install it</li>
    <li> Great product I will definaly buy again</li>
    <li> Hair was very soft ends also full not too stringy  even after co washing it, minimum shedding  I ordered the 16,18,20 and a addition &amp;#34;20 plus &amp;#34;14 closure from seller. So far so good</li>
    <li> A really really good hair. Little or no shed. Delivery was fast. Will definitely recommend and buy next time</li>
    <li> Amazing best hair I&#x27;ve every bought on amazon I&#x27;m so in love got so many compliments full bundles too. Hope my pictures are helpful ❤</li>
    <li> hair was not 100grams per bundle.  Also the hair sheds a lot</li>
    <li> No shedding, no tangle, its,the best weave on earth..</li>
    <li> Hair seems to be good quality. Shipping was fast but I could not give it 5 stars because the hair in packs where really thin and I don&#x27;t think 3 packs will do a full head. I will have to order more but plan on getting it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Hair was delivered on time! I haven&#x27;t installed it yet,but it looks gorgeous! Will give an update once I install it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received the package in the mail I ordered it on Friday and received that following Sunday... I originally ordered 16&amp;#34; 18&amp;#34; and 20&amp;#34;... But received those and a 22&amp;#34; bundle... Who wouldn&#x27;t be excited but each was thin and the ends were scarce.... Very thin... I brought this hair for graduation. The hair had a smell so I decided to co wash it... Using Giovanni&#x27;s tea tree treatment conditioner... It barely helped...</li>
    <li> Omg I so in love with this hair.....its very Good hair I recommend this hair for everyone</li>
    <li> Horrible hair! The texture feels as fake hair would! By the second day it was bushy. Im disappointed, because i thought i was getting a deal. Im a college student and i do not have much money. I wish i wouldve ordered something different.</li>
    <li> Very nice texture, minimum shedding but I was a bit disappointed that the wave pattern wasn&#x27;t the same after one co-wash.</li>
    <li> Loved everything about it</li>
    <li> OMGosh, this hair is everything. Super soft, minimal shedding, it doesn&#x27;t tangle at the nape of your neck. I&#x27;m in love with this hair. I wish I would&#x27;ve bought and extra bundle, I like my hair big. But the 3 bundles create a natural look. I will be purchasing again in the future. Thanks Hot Hair and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair. Will do business with this seller again!!!</li>
    <li> Great hair! I have received a lot of compliments!!!!</li>
    <li> So far I love  it .. good quality  and more then enough hair</li>
    <li> I really like this hair, but my order came late and I have not been able to use it yet. Had to use another hair that was bought because my even was the day that my order arrived late. Did not have time to wait for order that was supposed to have arrived days earlier. When I got home from my hair appointment it came! This was not good for me! I&#x27;ll keep it and use it for my next appointment. The hair does not have a foul odor and it is very soft. Can&#x27;t wait to install it. Wish it came on time. Please order at least two weeks before needed! 4 stars because of lateness.</li>
    <li> Made,a unit with this hair ..I love it .. Very good hair</li>
    <li> NEVER AGAIN NOT REAL VIRGIN HAIR IT SHEDS LIKE CRAZY amazon wont allow me to give it the starz its really worth to be honest its only worth 1</li>
    <li> Luv this hair. Extremely soft, not the best but, but not the worst. A little thin, but the price and shipment time was worth  it.</li>
    <li> This is not 300 grams of hair maybe 95 and the end and thin I&#x27;m real not happy</li>
    <li> Purchased this hair for my daughter, who seems to be very pleased.  She states that similar hair in the local beauty supply store would cost waaay more.  Her stylist didn&#x27;t need to use all of it at once, so she will be able to not only wash and re-use the hair that she&#x27;s currently wearing, but also still has left-over hair for an additional application.  Very good deal for the cost, and everyone is happy.  She hasn&#x27;t reported any shedding or tangling, and does use the flat iron on the hair, but not on a daily basis.  Hope this review helps and saves money for someone.</li>
    <li> Love the hair. Bought it twice already. Been using it for about a year now. Change the color multiple times. The shipping is great and the price is awesome. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Great hair for the price very thick bundles!</li>
    <li> This is not the real Ali Hot hair that comes from Quigdao. Never again will I order this mess...</li>
    <li> received hair on time installed and satisfied will buy hair again easy to style works great straight or wavy I&#x27;m a stylist so I wear it both ways I also dyed the hair and still have hair left and have received many compliments 😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Exactly what the seller advertised! It dyed very well.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst hair in the world or hair that I&#x27;ve ever brought.  I&#x27;m thinking that it&#x27;s not even human hair as they claim it should be.  N e ways so when I ordered it, it took 4 ever for them to ship or prepare any shipping details. So when I actually got the hair and installed it was nice to the touch but shortly after the hair was constantly tangling and it shed like crazy.  I think the hair only lasted about 4 to 6 days b4 I got so sick of it and took it out. If I could help u save some money I would suggest that u dnt buy this hair, it&#x27;s definitely a waste of time and money. I guess all I could do now is be more careful when buying off line or just deal directly with the hair store in my area.</li>
    <li> I love the hair, real soft and they gave lots of hair&lt;br /&gt;. I received it right on time.</li>
    <li> http://youtu.be/h2CMBncgz3g</li>
    <li> I was impressed. My package arrived early. I was pleased with everything.Thank you</li>
    <li> Awesome hair!!! I really really really love it and will be purchasing again for my sister.</li>
    <li> I just got the hair . I have a 16&amp;#34; 18&amp;#34; 20&amp;#34; and the hair is fab!! It came in a box with labels on there . I&#x27;ll give another discription in 4 weeks  To see how the hair is .</li>
    <li> Dont buy.... Horrible</li>
    <li> Hair is wonderful! Will be buying again. </li>
    <li> Just got my hair to day! !  Haven&#x27;t installed it yet but it seems as it&#x27;s some pretty good hair.smells good. Full nice lengtH&#x27;s and it also was package very very good. Will give an update when iget it installed on Monday!!</li>
    <li> The BEST HAIR ON AMAZON… I&#x27;ve purchased from other vendor&#x27;s it&#x27;s the best minimal shedding it took dye and it holds curls for days. I used 3 bundles I ordered another bundle to make it full the only bad thing is the vendor does not sell individual bundles so I ordered through another vendor or amazon wlecc hair both are good vendors!!!!! I Will not order anywhere else Thanks Amazon and Hot Hair </li>
    <li> I ordered the hair in the lengths 16,18,20 instead I got 4 thin bundles abs I don&#x27;t know the length of the 4 it&#x27;s nice hair just kinda thin at the ends</li>
    <li> Good at first and full. But not good quality hair at all. Tangles bad. Don&#x27;t shed that bad. Good hair for only about a 5 to 7 days</li>
    <li> Remember....... when you buy hair online your taking a huge risk. This hair is blended and mat up easily. Not a fan at all</li>
    <li> I ordered this bundle on Monday and got it extremely fast.. By Thursday I believe.. I&#x27;d like to say that I was very impressed with how it came in the mail... The hair looks amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to put it in my hair next week for my birthday!&lt;br /&gt;I was a little weary about buying hair online but I&#x27;m glad I did!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou guys for giving me my money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair on Monday night. The expected delivery was friday. I received it on Thursday the day before which was a plus! when I opened the package the bundles (18\\&quot;,20\\&quot;, 22\\&quot;) were packed nicely! the hair is thick , soft and voluptuous! I haven&#x27;t got it installed yet but I do plan on doing an ombre on the hair. overall so far so good ! *PICS ARE COMING SOON!*</li>
    <li> Excellent buy good hair so far ive just been wearing it wavy so i dnt know how it will be once its straight but so far so good mine gets a lil tangeled  i dnt know if thats because its wavy but does not shed. I will definitely be buying hair from the vendor again..</li>
    <li> So far so good, i ordered the hair on Thursday May 28th (before 5pm) and got it on Friday the 29th. I didnt order priority shipping just did standard shipping which was no more than $6. So far the hair is soft &amp; true to the photos. Im about to cowash and will do another review as well as make a youtube video for review.</li>
    <li> Quality was good but disappointed to find out that the tracks were cut in half there for making the hair thinner. This also requires more bundles to make apperance seem thicker.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair, I absolutely love it and I&#x27;ve just ordered 6 more bundles yesterday for my mom and cousin!!!</li>
    <li> What is the best caring instructions for this hair, what can I use to leave hair soft and shine?  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love my hair.. It colors really well.. I&#x27;ve been having it for about two months..</li>
    <li> I liked it. Might of been better if I didn&#x27;t dye the ends. It started getting dry. Photo was about 4 weeks after wearing. I&#x27;ve definitely paid more before and this was better then some. The only thing I wasnt too impressed by was how it came packaged. It was all together in one bag with no length numbers attached. So I had to stretch and figure out the length of each one, nor did it come with any tips for maintaining the hair.</li>
    <li> Hair is soft to the touch and truly is good quality. I have finally found some place to get hair at a reasonable price. Comments are true, little to no shedding and keeps its curl. Excuse the photo, no make up and extremly tired but had to post my experience.</li>
