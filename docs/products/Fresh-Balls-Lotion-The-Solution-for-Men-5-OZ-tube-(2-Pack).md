    <li> Keeps em fresh. it seriously works.</li>
    <li> Just the Best! I am writing for my spouse who has dementia. He has VERY sensitive skin and psoriasis. This works &amp;#34; better than anything&amp;#34; we have ever tried for the hot red sweaty skin beneath his scrotum.  He also has psoriasis at the top of his butt crack and this lotion is helping. Thank you, Jean S. WA</li>
    <li> Men, get this. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this product years ago.  Keeps you remaining fresh with a pleasant manly fragrance.  I bought it based on the product reviews.  My wife won&#x27;t be complaining about powder dust all over anymore.  Goes on as a lotion and dries quickly remaining fresh all day,  I put it on after I shower at night and in the morning.  I don&#x27;t think you would be disappointed.  I little on the pricey side.</li>
    <li> Did not get what I ordered and not happy with what I got. Its not fresh balls its fresh body and its not the same</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I work outside all day and during the summer the sweat was disgusting.  But I don&#x27;t feel nasty half way through the day anymore.  You don&#x27;t have the mess or the &amp;#34;pancake batter&amp;#34; that you get with powder.  Goes on a lotion and becomes like a powder.</li>
    <li> Ditch the powders, this is a product every guy should have and use.  Gold Bond has finally lost the war of the balls.</li>
    <li> Keeps my balls fresh, less chaffing from driving my wheelie machine in a field expedient manner, would recommend, 4/5. Slight powdery residue in underwear.</li>
    <li> A must-have for summer.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great for any ball type. Whether hung low or tied over your shoulder they are kept fresh all day.</li>
    <li> The best product for guys to stay &#x27;fresh&#x27; and cool down there.&lt;br /&gt;aside from the usual things you&#x27;ll read about on here, here&#x27;s another side effect that is awesome: when you go #1 sometimes you&#x27;ll dribble, and if you use toilet paper you get bits of TP on your junk... if you&#x27;re using freshballs it&#x27;s like rain-x for your bits and pieces, it just runs off and even if you wipe it off you&#x27;re still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly tho, is it helps keep your balls from sticking/chaffing/catching hairs etc.</li>
    <li> Works great. Starts as a lotion, drys like a powder. I highly reccomend this to anyone with undercarriage swamp problems.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  It comes out as a lotion, but rubs on like a powder.  Last all day.  I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for your junk. What more do want me to tell you? My balls stay comfortable you pervs.</li>
    <li> Goes on like lotion, then dries to a corn starchy silky smooth powder that is some sort of space age anti-friction formula that works wonders! I run an events company, and during long load ins and load outs in and out of hot trucks.......I&#x27;m prone to chafing when active, and this product keeps me nice and happy.</li>
    <li> Keeps em dry all day long. More effective than powder and way less itchy. I will always keep some of this handy.</li>
    <li> This stuff has an odd scent. Wonderful concept, terrible smell.</li>
    <li> This product  is as crucial as deodorant. Stops the sticking for the majority of an 18 hour day. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised - dry all day long.</li>
    <li> So far so good...no sweaty balls.</li>
    <li> I have the dryest ball bag in town.</li>

    <li> Keeps my balls from swamping</li>
    <li> 1. Not as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;2. Goes on wet.&lt;br /&gt;3. Dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;4. Good for active people.&lt;br /&gt;5. Minimal or almost no scent.&lt;br /&gt;6. Will get on your clothes or anything you touch until you can wash it off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;7. Have someone else apply this product for more interesting experience.</li>
