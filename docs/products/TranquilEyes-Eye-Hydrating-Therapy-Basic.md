<ol>
      <li>These are great!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product, it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>These have been a great help to keeping his eyes moist at night.</li>
      <li>My sister bought me a pair years ago - she had been using them &amp; happy.</li>
      <li>I love them!!</li>
      <li>After 3 or 4 nights he had remarkable improvement and adjusted to wearing them for sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Happy w/purchase.</li>
      <li>I tried them, and they are pleasant, but these do the  job without them, just by virtue of keeping airflow off of your eyes.</li>
      <li>Plus Ithink the hydrating is good for the area around my eyes anyway,</li>
      <li>It works great and is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>The tightening of the side straps should be able to be locked in place!  </li>
      <li>He said his eyes feel better than ever!</li>
      <li>but I sleep so much better!</li>
      <li>They are fantastic!!  </li>
      <li>These are amazing, though.</li>
      <li>and I am able to get a good nights sleep.</li>
      <li>Tranquil Eyes product is the best so far that Ive found on the market in terms of eye goggles for sleep :)</li>
      <li>These are very comfortable and keep my eyes moist.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I have these goggles.  </li>
      <li>I also like that I am able to sleep on my side in these as well.</li>
      <li>Cheaper and works WAY BETTER</li>
      <li>Great product, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to sleep soundly and not be woken up by RCE as much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Outstanding product and a life saver</li>
      <li>Took him a couple of nights to adjust to sleeping w/eye mask on, but loved the morning results, even after the first night.</li>
      <li>I love the goggles because they are easy to keep clean and very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to find comfortable night eyeware.</li>
      <li>EASY TO USE AND FINE QUALITY.  </li>
      <li>Shipped just fine.</li>
      <li>Unless you have a huge head, the goggles won&#x27;t stay on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The goggles adjust and sit comfortable on my face.</li>
      <li>I have been using the goggles for over a year now and pray the inserts will always be available.  </li>
      <li>It may sound like a lot, but its not.  </li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t work because the flickers of light would always bother me.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, the eye covers were comfortable.</li>
      <li>THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PURCHASE FOR ME.  </li>
      <li>any bit of light keeps me awake.</li>
      <li>Just sew the ends where they fit.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t fit my face and it wasn&#x27;t adjustable.  </li>
      <li>I find this product good for cool or warm compresses over the eyes, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that is going to keep your eye lids closed while you sleep, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>Looks like cheap quality...could do hot compress on eyes with towels instead</li>
      <li>Even if I didn&#x27;t have dry eye, I would wear them when I sleep in a bright bedroom or traveling.  </li>
      <li>Took a bit of getting used to wearing at HS, but felt good improvement w/symptoms of dry, scratchy eyes - Restasis user.</li>
      <li>, I find they improve the quality of my sleep, leave my eyes rested and calm.</li>
      <li>+ dollars for something that is worth about $4.</li>
      <li>I used the warm moisture also, which you get an extra set of inserts too.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness for these goggles I lubricate my eyes with the Munro ointment right before bed plug in my humidifier and slid my goggles on.</li>
      <li>It would be helpful if I could have covered one eye only, otherwise the product is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I tried drops, night ointments, and got the plugs, but was still aware of my eyeballs 24/7 and have to have drops everywhere I go and stashed all over the place.</li>
      <li>They felt sore after the first night</li>
      <li>(I followed the directions EXACTLY.)  </li>
      <li>they also doesn&#x27;t make your face hot like a sleep mask.</li>
      <li>The glue came off in the first week.  </li>
      <li>My dr said I also have large eyeballs and my eyes don&#x27;t close all the way at night, I tried masks but they fell off and would move to the side because i am a side sleeper.</li>
      <li>pure blackness.</li>
      <li>the inserts are large to where my eyelashes are squished....</li>
      <li>I expected relief from scratchy eyes, but am so pleased with the improved quality of sleep as that seems to affect me in positive ways.</li>
      <li>and these helped so much.</li>
      <li>Yes they are not a pretty sight on, but they do the job and are very comfortable to wear.  </li>
      <li>Not a complete cure, but definitely makes things better!</li>
      <li>but im sure they work better for people who have small faces and smaller eyes.  </li>
      <li>There is minimum fuss to preparing them for use (a quick squeeze under filtered hot water) and the reward is well worth the trouble.</li>
      <li>Maybe those having trouble with them falling off did not clean the goggles properly before adhering the cushion (alcohol works best).  </li>
      <li>The idea behind it is good</li>
      <li>Basically a set of soft goggles that completely shut out the light and keep eyes moist during naps or long sleeps</li>
      <li>Each month, I take them apart (remove the replacable padding and throw away), santize the rubber pieces with alchohol, wash the head band, then place on a new set of padding.  </li>
      <li>The first night I wore them to bed and left them on for three hours.</li>
      <li>These goggles are pitch black, soft, moist (I moisten inserts to keep my eyes hydrated), and extremely comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I feel much better now, less red eyes during the day.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sit close enough to your eyes for the cooling gel pads to do much at all.</li>
      <li>and it is some soft material not rubber that pulls hair or the elastic you get on my masks.</li>
      <li>Also, it needs frequent cleaning or it will get moldy, and cleaning it causes it to fall apart.  </li>
      <li>Since I have big eyes, the edges of the mask put too much pressure on my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I feel there is improvement so far</li>
      <li>You could make this product yourself in about five minutes from some old swim goggles.  </li>
      <li>band that holds the glass on your head is theoretically adjustable, but in truth slippery so that it always slides right back out to the largest position.  </li>
      <li>Use eye drops to add to the moistening experience, I wish I had bought the more expensive version, which comes with more than one extra set of foam inserts, because I plan to use these goggles for a long time.</li>
      <li>It came highly recommended on several websites, so I decided to purchase this.  </li>
      <li>I do also have really bad dry eye, and these help tremendously, so i&#x27;m doubly happy!</li>
      <li>unlike traditional sleep masks, these are LIGHT TIGHT.</li>
      <li>Doctor told me I had dry eyes, a condition that age can bring on as can certain eye surgeries; symptoms are relieved by humidity.</li>
      <li>But when you pull it tight to fit it slides rt back to the largest width again.</li>
      <li>so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know for certain</li>
      <li>, I actually wasn&#x27;t reaching for my drs in the middle of the night from my aching eyeballs and the next day didn&#x27;t seem to use drops as much or think about my eyes as often.</li>
      <li>It comes with extra foam inserts and each set lasts up to two months, depending how frequently you use them.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use the heat/cold inserts, nor do I wet the pads on a regular basis.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have severe dry eyes.  I purchased this product to help as my eyes don&#x27;t close all the way when I sleep (a hairline gap).  When I wake, my eyes were very red and scratchy.  I love the goggles because they are easy to keep clean and very comfortable.  They have resolved my nightime dry eyes so my eyes don&#x27;t feel scratchy during the day (not cured my dry eyes, I still use drops when needed during the day, but I can go all night without drops).  I definitely notice the difference if I don&#x27;t wear them.  Each month, I take them apart (remove the replacable padding and throw away), santize the rubber pieces with alchohol, wash the head band, then place on a new set of padding.  Each week, I wash the foam frame cushion on the goggles with antibacterial soap and let air dry.  Each morning, I remove and wash the foam inserts with antibacterial soap and allow to air dry.  It may sound like a lot, but its not.  Just like brushing your teeth and replacing your tooth brush, just maintenance.  The foam framing sticks to the goggles with double stick tape.  If you are careful when washing, they will stay adhered to the goggles for an entire month (maybe longer, but I always remove after one month).  Maybe those having trouble with them falling off did not clean the goggles properly before adhering the cushion (alcohol works best).  I have been using the goggles for over a year now and pray the inserts will always be available.  I buy a year supply at a time just in case.  Also, my husband likes to watch TV late at night.  Years ago, I purchased headphones in an effort to help me get to sleep.  This didn&#x27;t work because the flickers of light would always bother me.  These goggles are pitch black, soft, moist (I moisten inserts to keep my eyes hydrated), and extremely comfortable.  They don&#x27;t touch my eyes or lashes, which always bothered me with the masks.  Even if I didn&#x27;t have dry eye, I would wear them when I sleep in a bright bedroom or traveling.  They are fantastic!!  Plus Ithink the hydrating is good for the area around my eyes anyway, bonus!!</li>
    <li> My sister bought me a pair years ago - she had been using them &amp; happy. Took a bit of getting used to wearing at HS, but felt good improvement w/symptoms of dry, scratchy eyes - Restasis user. Haven&#x27;t used in a while. My son was having dry eye irritation since eye surgery, so I purchased a pair for him. Took him a couple of nights to adjust to sleeping w/eye mask on, but loved the morning results, even after the first night. After 3 or 4 nights he had remarkable improvement and adjusted to wearing them for sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Happy w/purchase.</li>
    <li> have to wet sponge to moisten eyes then black dye from mask bleeds onto pillow, very hard to remove stain. Not a good deal</li>
    <li> It is very helpful and I can wear it for several hours before it is too uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Shipped just fine. Tranquil Eyes product is the best so far that Ive found on the market in terms of eye goggles for sleep :)</li>
    <li> Since I have big eyes, the edges of the mask put too much pressure on my eyes.  They felt sore after the first night so I decided to return.  The idea behind it is good but im sure they work better for people who have small faces and smaller eyes.  I have not been able to find comfortable night eyeware.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry eyes, an recently had eye surgery.  I am so glad I have these goggles.  Yes they are not a pretty sight on, but they do the job and are very comfortable to wear.  I have had no problems with it at all.  It was delivered as promised.  I would recommend this product, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased tranquileye goggles and couldn&#x27;t wait to use them. The first night I wore them to bed and left them on for three hours. I felt no difference in my eyes. If you purchase all of the extra items that don&#x27;t come with it than maybe the goggles will work. I read a few reviews before purchasing them and there are people who feel it works for them. So I would suggest purchasing the goggles and giving them a try. It may work for you.</li>
    <li> I wear these goggles at night by Dr. recommendation to ease dry eye problem. Not only does it help with dry eyes but I sleep so much better! Great product, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have had bad dry eye problems, and these have not helped. I tried them for a month and had no positive results, so I&#x27;ve stopped using them. I&#x27;ve heard they work for some people, but they didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
    <li> The third time I heated up the little bead packets, one of them ruptured!  (I followed the directions EXACTLY.)  Beads everywhere, and now I have one-eyed goggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black foam pieces should be attached so they don&#x27;t fall out and get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band that holds the glass on your head is theoretically adjustable, but in truth slippery so that it always slides right back out to the largest position.  Unless you have a huge head, the goggles won&#x27;t stay on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $75 for these from my eye doc -- what a rip-off!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002C04ZM Lavender Basic]] After several years, Lasik surgery left me with dry eyes that burn when I read or use my computer too long. I was starting to get floaters and even flashing and felt that my eyes were strained. Doctor told me I had dry eyes, a condition that age can bring on as can certain eye surgeries; symptoms are relieved by humidity. I ordered the basic Tranquileyes on the Internet. It comes with extra foam inserts and each set lasts up to two months, depending how frequently you use them. Basically a set of soft goggles that completely shut out the light and keep eyes moist during naps or long sleeps, I find they improve the quality of my sleep, leave my eyes rested and calm. There is minimum fuss to preparing them for use (a quick squeeze under filtered hot water) and the reward is well worth the trouble. Use eye drops to add to the moistening experience, I wish I had bought the more expensive version, which comes with more than one extra set of foam inserts, because I plan to use these goggles for a long time. I expected relief from scratchy eyes, but am so pleased with the improved quality of sleep as that seems to affect me in positive ways. A possible bonus: It&#x27;s too soon for me to tell, but it seems obvious the prolonged humidity around the eyes will have a beneficial effect on diminishing wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than 1 week.  The glue came off but my guess is it was primarily due to the amount of moisture in the eye pads.  Otherwise, the eye covers were comfortable.</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable and keep my eyes moist.  It&#x27;s nice to sleep soundly and not be woken up by RCE as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headband does slip, so I had to knot it, but from then on it has been solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely the way to do for RCE or Nighttime dry eye issues.</li>
    <li> totally works. any bit of light keeps me awake. unlike traditional sleep masks, these are LIGHT TIGHT. pure blackness. they also doesn&#x27;t make your face hot like a sleep mask. I do also have really bad dry eye, and these help tremendously, so i&#x27;m doubly happy! I don&#x27;t really use the heat/cold inserts, nor do I wet the pads on a regular basis. I tried them, and they are pleasant, but these do the  job without them, just by virtue of keeping airflow off of your eyes.</li>
    <li> Looks like cheap quality...could do hot compress on eyes with towels instead</li>
    <li> This product is held together with glue.  The glue came off in the first week.  I do no recommend this product due to the low quality.</li>
    <li> It would be helpful if I could have covered one eye only, otherwise the product is very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> These things are thick and the band isn&#x27;t tight enough for my head. They fall off and even if it was fastened tight the pads are so thick that rolling around while sleeping will make them slip off anyway. I recommend consumers to keep looking.</li>
    <li> The tightening of the side straps should be able to be locked in place!  Otherwise, I do like the concept and goggles.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. This didn&#x27;t fit my face and it wasn&#x27;t adjustable.  After buying, I mentioned it to my eye doctor and she said she does not recommend this product or similar ones. I&#x27;m sticking to eye drops and fish oil supplementation.</li>
    <li> My son sleeps with his eyes open which is damaging his corneas. These have been a great help to keeping his eyes moist at night. He said his eyes feel better than ever!</li>
    <li> I had started to have problems with waking up in the middle of the night with extreme pain from dry eyes.  After doing some research I found this gem.  It came highly recommended on several websites, so I decided to purchase this.  I must say, it takes getting used to sleeping with something on my head, but other then that, these are a God send.</li>
    <li> These things are bulky and cumbersome. I sent them back to the company.</li>
    <li> This eye mask was recommended by a physician for dry eye and cornea issues. It works great and is very comfortable. Taking the center foam out protects the cornea from pressure at night.</li>
    <li> I have recurrent cornea erosion aka RCE. I purchased these googles based on a review I read from someone who had the same condition such as I.  I was so tired of waking up in the  middle of the night in pain or lubricating my eyes at 3 hr intervals. This ongoing process was driving my crazy. Thank goodness for these goggles I lubricate my eyes with the Munro ointment right before bed plug in my humidifier and slid my goggles on. No more pain and I am able to get a good nights sleep.The goggles adjust and sit comfortable on my face. They also come in different colors. I will soon be ordering a second pair  for a backup just in case I loose a pair.</li>
    <li> I had LASIK 2 years ago and ever since then my eyes have been not just dry but dried up looking in my drs words. I always have bloodshot red eyes. I tried drops, night ointments, and got the plugs, but was still aware of my eyeballs 24/7 and have to have drops everywhere I go and stashed all over the place. My dr said I also have large eyeballs and my eyes don&#x27;t close all the way at night, I tried masks but they fell off and would move to the side because i am a side sleeper. I even tried goggles and taping my eyelids shut I was so desperate for a little relief if that would help! I got these last week so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know for certain but I also got the bio tears supplements which I take 2 in the morn and 2 at night. I put the gel ointment in before the tranquileyes too. I feel there is improvement so far, I actually wasn&#x27;t reaching for my drs in the middle of the night from my aching eyeballs and the next day didn&#x27;t seem to use drops as much or think about my eyes as often. My review is 3 stars because it hasn&#x27;t been that long and idk if it&#x27;s this or the bio tears and you do have to do a little sewing on the strap. It spreads,out into a wide band in the back which I like and it is some soft material not rubber that pulls hair or the elastic you get on my masks. But when you pull it tight to fit it slides rt back to the largest width again. Even still it only fell off once at night.  Just sew the ends where they fit. I also like that I am able to sleep on my side in these as well. I used the warm moisture also, which you get an extra set of inserts too. I guess my only complaint so far is the need to sew the strap, which is not that big a deal, and I&#x27;m finicky about my eyelashes and the inserts are large to where my eyelashes are squished....I&#x27;m a girl sorry I don&#x27;t like things that make my eyelashes go in every direction. Maybe I can cut the inserts down a little in thickness idk. Last night I just took them out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sit close enough to your eyes for the cooling gel pads to do much at all. If your looking for a sleep mask get something else and if your thinking you will get relief from this being cold or warm....you won&#x27;t. You get a lot of stuff for the money but a lot of not much good is still not worth wasting your money on. I was very disappointed and went back to a cold damp washcloth and a headband to keep it on my eyes. Cheaper and works WAY BETTER</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist recommended Tranquil eyes because of my dryeye. It helps a lot. My eyes don&#x27;t feel scratchy in the  morning if I sleep with the goggles on at night.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful I ordered these. I had a bleph and these helped so much. I love them!!</li>
    <li> Following brain surgery and bells palsy, this is the only solution to replace tape to keep my eye closed. Outstanding product and a life saver</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  EASY TO USE AND FINE QUALITY.  THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PURCHASE FOR ME.  WITH THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> These are great! I sleep with my eyes partially open (always have), while these don&#x27;t shut my eyes, they do keep in the moisture. I feel much better now, less red eyes during the day. I should probably pair with eye drops, but I haven&#x27;t just yet. These are amazing, though. Not a complete cure, but definitely makes things better!</li>
    <li> Extremely flimsy.  Doesn&#x27;t stay on when you are sleeping.  Also, it needs frequent cleaning or it will get moldy, and cleaning it causes it to fall apart.  You could make this product yourself in about five minutes from some old swim goggles.  It is ridiculous to pay 40+ dollars for something that is worth about $4.</li>
    <li> I find this product good for cool or warm compresses over the eyes, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that is going to keep your eye lids closed while you sleep, this isn&#x27;t it. I had to revert back to tape :-/</li>
