      <li>and it tangles easily</li>
      <li>The scent is nice too - fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>Hair is more manageable and curls better with the curling iron and even when I just blow dry it, my hair shines more.</li>
      <li>Definitely better for someone with thicker or more coarse hair.</li>
      <li>I had gotten this years ago from my beautician and quickly made it part of my routine.</li>
      <li>I love that I can get a brush through my hair after shower and it does feel very soft</li>
      <li>It did make her hair very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>it is sulfate free) but it costs twice as much.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, I don&#x27;t end up with a huge handful of hair after I comb or use my Wet Brush.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner works well to keep my hair soft, smooth, and tangle free.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t comb my hair but jumped right in the shower and used this.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I do with lesser quality conditioners.  </li>
      <li>I tried combing the con-cleanse through my hair and even bought one of those detangling brushes (a &amp;#34;Wet Brush?&amp;#34;), but still had a head-full of tangles - until I used this product.  </li>
      <li>I first used this in Hawaii.  </li>
      <li>She has TONS of fine, long hair which is not cut often enough (her goal is to have hair like Rapunzel) and to top it off</li>
      <li>I have never had large flakes come out of my hair, until I used this conditioner.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is the only stuff I&#x27;ve tried that actually detangles my fine, easily damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like about this conditioner is that it isn&#x27;t sulfate/paraben free.  </li>
      <li>But even after using a con-cleanser, my hair was still very tangled - no matter what i did.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>her hair really takes a beating from the pool.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to spend the money, but I&#x27;m glad I did because it really does detangle - unlike other &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have a lot of long fairly fine hair</li>
      <li>This truly live up to its name - The Detangler.  </li>
      <li>I first used this at an upscale hotel where it was their standard guest conditioner.  </li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s just too heavy for fine hair.</li>
      <li>It detangles well and leaves hair soft.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much as I have short hair -- massage conditioner into my hair, rinse and IT WORKS!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for my 4-year old daughter&#x27;s hair too, and it works wonders.</li>
      <li>No one would know my head is covered with gray hair now, because the conditioner keeps it soft and managed.</li>
      <li>My hair was soft and tangle-free.  </li>
      <li>I put a little in right after I wash her hair and it brushes out so much easier.</li>
      <li>and she actually liked the fact that this seemed to weigh her hair down a little bit since her hair can get out of control.</li>
      <li>I have long, baby-fine, blonde hair that becomes one huge mass of tangles after shampooing and even tangles when it&#x27;s dry and just &amp;#34;hanging there.&amp;#34;  (Actually, I don&#x27;t shampoo anymore</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it was better (at least for my hair) than the other Paul Mitchell that I had always bought.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a large quantity at the salons discount and was down to the end of my supply.</li>
      <li>Normally, my hair is very tangled and hard to brush after being in and out of water all day, even after using conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got thin fine hair and this weighs it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for super tangly hair like mine</li>
    <li> I still have tangles after using this. It&#x27;s not as effective as The Conditioner. I will be going back to that when this bottle runs out. I&#x27;ve got thin fine hair and this weighs it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: This works GREAT for my curly girls.</li>
    <li> Did NOT detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> The Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner through Amazon burned my eyes and my scalp, smelled like chemicals, and made my hair feel like straw.  I ended up discarding the product.  If I were to try Paul Mitchell again, I would purchase from an authorized Paul Mitchell seller.  I would give this product zero (0) stars if I could.  I absolutely do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is excellent for my 6yr old daughter.  She has TONS of fine, long hair which is not cut often enough (her goal is to have hair like Rapunzel) and to top it off she is a swimmer... her hair really takes a beating from the pool.  If she doesn&#x27;t use this conditioner it is very obvious when combing.  The only other conditioner that works for her is Moroccan Oil (that is the brand-- it is sulfate free) but it costs twice as much.  I also like the smell of this-- it isn&#x27;t a baby conditioner, but the scent is such that it doesn&#x27;t make her smell like a grown woman.  It works well with the baby don&#x27;t cry childrens shampoo by Paul Mitchell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this conditioner is that it isn&#x27;t sulfate/paraben free.  This is the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have never had large flakes come out of my hair, until I used this conditioner. It detangles well and leaves hair soft. The smell is awful and it leaves a build up on my hair. I would rise my hair out well...it didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> I have long, baby-fine, blonde hair that becomes one huge mass of tangles after shampooing and even tangles when it&#x27;s dry and just &amp;#34;hanging there.&amp;#34;  (Actually, I don&#x27;t shampoo anymore - I use a &amp;#34;Wen-like&amp;#34; cleansing conditioner, which has made a BIG improvement in my hair.)  But even after using a con-cleanser, my hair was still very tangled - no matter what i did.  I tried combing the con-cleanse through my hair and even bought one of those detangling brushes (a &amp;#34;Wet Brush?&amp;#34;), but still had a head-full of tangles - until I used this product.

    <li> I have long, wavy hair.  This conditioner works well to keep my hair soft, smooth, and tangle free.  Most importantly, I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I do with lesser quality conditioners.  Would definitely recommend.</li>

    <li> I had gotten this years ago from my beautician and quickly made it part of my routine. I purchased a large quantity at the salons discount and was down to the end of my supply. I was happy to see this. The bottle is different but the results the same.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that I have found to help my daughters&#x27; long, curly hair. I put a little in right after I wash her hair and it brushes out so much easier. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great smell and detangle like a charm</li>
    <li> needs time to see if it works .</li>
    <li> The Detangler does the trick.  I don&#x27;t use much as I have short hair -- massage conditioner into my hair, rinse and IT WORKS!!  What more can I say.</li>
    <li> I just bleached my hair and it is the only thing that has worked. I blowdry my hair often and its so easy with this product. I love it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work on childs hair</li>
    <li> I had great hopes, as I like their leave-in conditioner.  But this did the opposite - it tangled my hair badly.</li>
    <li> Great, non greasy de-tangler when you are not using a conditioner.</li>
    <li> This definitely detangles but it feels very heavy on my hair. I have a lot of long fairly fine hair and I feel as though my hair is flat and weighed down with this conditioner. I love that I can get a brush through my hair after shower and it does feel very soft but I think it&#x27;s just too heavy for fine hair. My daughter has a head full of very thick, long wavy hair and she actually liked the fact that this seemed to weigh her hair down a little bit since her hair can get out of control. It did make her hair very smooth and soft. Definitely better for someone with thicker or more coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and it tangles easily this shampoo helps.</li>
    <li> I first used this at an upscale hotel where it was their standard guest conditioner.  I was surprised that it was better (at least for my hair) than the other Paul Mitchell that I had always bought.  I like it because it works a little like a styling gel without making the hair stiff.  I use it daily.  I have a lot of gray hair that is periodically colored, and this product works great with the stiffer gray hair and does not affect the color in any way.  No one would know my head is covered with gray hair now, because the conditioner keeps it soft and managed. Great product!</li>
    <li> It did nothing for my hair.  In the past few months I noticed that my hair was started to get really tangled, and I was getting really bad knots in the back of my hair. It was time to invest in a really good conditioner to prevent the breakage I&#x27;ve been getting from tangles. I found this detangler by Paul Mitchell and it has really great reviews, so I thought this was going to be a smart purchase. The conditioner is quite watery, bland-smelling, and just seems to disappear when I put it on my hair. I generally like a thick conditioner that coats the hair while you leave it in for a few minutes, but this seems to dissolve on my wet hair. After I rinse my hair, it&#x27;s just as tangled and knotty as ever. Plus, at the end of the day, I&#x27;m still getting those dread-like knots toward the nape of my neck. I&#x27;ll admit that my hair is a bit wavy, but it&#x27;s not super thick, and it&#x27;s not really processed anymore, but this conditioner really did nothing for my hair. It&#x27;s a shame that my search for a good detangling conditioner will have to continue.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair that has very little body. Love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> my hair notoriously tangles. this is one of the few conditioners that actually lets me tame my fro. i love it.</li>
    <li> Tried this product and hair just loved it!  Hair is more manageable and curls better with the curling iron and even when I just blow dry it, my hair shines more. Don&#x27;t use anything else now but this product.</li>
