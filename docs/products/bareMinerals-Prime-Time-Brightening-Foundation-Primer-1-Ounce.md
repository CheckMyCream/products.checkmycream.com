      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize this product was the Brightening Foundation Primer until I received it -- and I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Most Prime Time products I&#x27;ve tried are good, however.</li>
      <li>Liked the feel but did nothing to make the power look smother.  </li>
      <li>After contacting the seller, they quickly replaced the product and am thoroughly happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>My skin just looks better with it, more alive.........brighter.</li>
      <li>Love the tint.  </li>
      <li>Gives me a nice radiance under my bare minerals powders, but also great after moisturizer .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good deal,  fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>This goes on easily</li>
      <li>Provides a great surface on which to apply the next step.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Silky smooth , gives &amp;#34; mature &amp;#34; or any skin a nice glow .</li>
      <li>Great for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; formula made my face seem super shiny; almost greasy looking.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and getting refills on line through Amazon is fast, easy and economical.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other primers, some are lighter weight and have a pleasant fragrance but don&#x27;t control the oily shine and minimize pores like this one.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The primer extends the wear of my foundation, keeping me looking fresh longer.</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth the money and does exactly what it states it will do for your skin.  </li>
      <li>My first bottle arrived and the primer had leaked all over the box and bottle.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>It applies effortlessly and leaves your skins soft, smooth and ready for your make up.</li>
      <li>I really like the prime time.  </li>
      <li>I understand the concept of reflective minerals and/or highlighting elements, but this was a bit much....</li>
      <li>The feel is silky smooth, but the extra &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; I could do without.</li>
      <li>It is light diffusing and gives a wonderful base for your foundation even if you do NOT use BareMinerals makeup.</li>
      <li>maybe because I live in a HOT region (Arizona) and the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look is not necessarily needed.  </li>
      <li>I typically use the Original Prime Time primer.  </li>
      <li>I am on my second bottle of this product I like it so much.</li>
      <li>I use another brand of liquid foundation but highly recommend this product as a starting point for ANY foundation, liquid or powder.</li>
      <li>The reason, the first application was ... not as expected.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend even if not using bare minerals powders.  </li>
      <li>Really like Bare Minerals and will continue to try other prouducts</li>

    <li> This is a great primer. Works well with other cosmetics in addition to Bare Escentuals. Provides a great surface on which to apply the next step.</li>
    <li> 2nd time purchasing this. Like it a lot</li>
    <li> Good deal,  fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is definitely worth the money and does exactly what it states it will do for your skin.  I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I use it daily under a liquid foundation. I&#x27;m a 65 year old black woman of meduim tan complexion. I have visibly pores. The brightener reduced them greatly. That is why I use it. Also it moisturizes my skin making the foundation glide on so it&#x27;s easier to blend. I have combination skin. On days I don&amp;#34;t wear foundation I still put on the Brightener. My skin just looks better with it, more alive.........brighter.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gives me a nice radiance under my bare minerals powders, but also great after moisturizer .&lt;br /&gt;Silky smooth , gives &amp;#34; mature &amp;#34; or any skin a nice glow .</li>
    <li> Liked the feel but did nothing to make the power look smother.  Really like Bare Minerals and will continue to try other prouducts</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!  It applies effortlessly and leaves your skins soft, smooth and ready for your make up. Great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and getting refills on line through Amazon is fast, easy and economical.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> This gives a wonderful glow to your face before you apply your mineral powder. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really like the prime time.  It makes the application of foundation flawless!  I am so happy that I found this product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> A product I love...have used for quite a while.</li>
    <li> My first bottle arrived and the primer had leaked all over the box and bottle.  After contacting the seller, they quickly replaced the product and am thoroughly happy with my purchase.  I have extremely oily skin and the product prevents my foundation from looking shiny on my skin all through the day.  Also feels light-weight; somewhat shiny when you first apply it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this product was the Brightening Foundation Primer until I received it -- and I absolutely love it!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this product I like it so much. If you have &amp;#34;more mature&amp;#34; skin I recommend the Brightening Formula. It is light diffusing and gives a wonderful base for your foundation even if you do NOT use BareMinerals makeup. I use another brand of liquid foundation but highly recommend this product as a starting point for ANY foundation, liquid or powder.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in my make up collection.  Outstanding product.  Do yourself a luxurious favor and purchase this.</li>
    <li> Great for my dry skin.  Love the tint.  Would recommend even if not using bare minerals powders.  Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that it is tinted and it has a greasy feel to it. UGH. Face feels oily after I apply make-up/</li>
    <li> I  have been looking for a primer that works as advertised. This goes on easily and I do not have an oily shine later in the day. I got this in a kit and will order this again. I have tried other primers, some are lighter weight and have a pleasant fragrance but don&#x27;t control the oily shine and minimize pores like this one.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer is a mineral-infused, satin-finish makeup primer that combats rough patches and flaky dryness. The look of fine lines, excess oil, uneven texture, and the appearance of enlarged pores is diminished, at least on me. My foundation goes on flawlessly, creating a skin-smoothing complexion. The primer extends the wear of my foundation, keeping me looking fresh longer. I apply one pump for an even layer of primer all over my face. Once dry, I follow with foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 06-24-13</li>
    <li> Maybe too soon to rate ?  I&#x27;ve only used this item a few times since receiving. The reason, the first application was ... not as expected.  I typically use the Original Prime Time primer.  This &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; formula made my face seem super shiny; almost greasy looking.  I understand the concept of reflective minerals and/or highlighting elements, but this was a bit much.... maybe because I live in a HOT region (Arizona) and the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look is not necessarily needed.  The feel is silky smooth, but the extra &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; I could do without. For a brightening affect, I prefer Too Faced primer (thicker, less greasy sheen). Most Prime Time products I&#x27;ve tried are good, however.</li>
