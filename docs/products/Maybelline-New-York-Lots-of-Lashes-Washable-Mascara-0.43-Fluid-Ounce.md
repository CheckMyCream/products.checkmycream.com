<li> They are short and thin.</li>
<li> should I get it from the store instead because getting thick mascare is not fun...</li>
<li> Wash your face as usual and if there&#x27;s any remaining below your eyes, just swipe a Q-Tip across the area.</li>
<li> I usually use this with my Rocket mascara then comb though it with a lash comb(: hope I helped!</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>

    <li> I feel like my eye lashes have doubled in length and thickness! I love this mascara!!</li>
    <li> great mascara. works like a professional brand</li>
    <li> This mascara is a staple.  Good product, good price and good name brand.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  It&#x27;s also easy to remove.  Wash your face as usual and if there&#x27;s any remaining below your eyes, just swipe a Q-Tip across the area.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I do feel like it could have a better brush.  I find that when I use my Benefit mascara brush in this mascara liquid, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This has been my mascara for many years now. Applies easily and I really like the wand.</li>
    <li> I love love love the product. I bought it couple times already but sometimes I will got some really dry ones. like someone opened it and left it out, the mascara just really thick. that kind of make me think...should I get it from the store instead because getting thick mascare is not fun...ugh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and always love trying new products. I&#x27;ve used very high end mascara, low-end mascara and lots of in-betweens. I&#x27;ve used Dior, Buxom, MakeUpForever, UD, YSL, to name a few. For the price, this is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve used. The applicator is the best I&#x27;ve found for my eyelashes. They are short and thin. This wand is the perfect tool for me. It gets into the short inner lashes without getting all over the lid. Bulky wands always get mascara all over my lid and this one allows me the control I need. Great coverage, I only need a couple of coats to get the desired look. The only downside I find with this product is that after several hours, there generally is some level of flaking occurring. It&#x27;s not so much that I want to stop using it, however. This is my everyday mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mascara that flakes before, but this one actually does.</li>
    <li> My go-to mascara.  Easily washes off, never clumps.. except with this new brush.  I have to wipe clumps off brush before applying, not very convenient.  I will not buy with this brush again</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I get nice thick lashes, it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t give me &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling lashes, and washes off with no problem. I love that I can get such a great mascara for around $5.</li>
    <li> i like it. i will always use it</li>
    <li> By far my most used and enjoyed mascara. It goes on evenly and without clumps. The unique brush helps with hard to reach places. It lasts all day and looks great! I highly recommend. You don&#x27;t need the most expensive products for a great look!</li>
    <li> Worked GREAT for me! Extends lashes</li>
    <li> really like and it stays on</li>
    <li> This item clumps and does not go on smoothly. Spend the extra $3 for a different Maybeline mascara and avoid the clumps.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this mascara and still do.  I really like the new style of applicatore they have switched to.</li>
    <li> This works really good at making ur lashes longer. I recommend this if u have short lashes along with another mascara(:  u have to be careful though, it can clump if u use to much. I usually use this with my Rocket mascara then comb though it with a lash comb(: hope I helped!</li>
