      <li>Sunscreens protect your face from aging, and this SPF 15 mix is ideal for most guys.</li>

      <li>All in all a nice moisturizer.</li>
      <li>As a moisturizer though this lotion is quite nice.  </li>
      <li>sometimes greasy- that might not be helpful for most users, but for the men and women who wear makeup, it&#x27;s good to know.</li>
      <li>and I believe this Nivea cream is a nice way of pampering it.</li>
      <li>It is a nice size for him to have in his car</li>
      <li>It went from SPF 4 to SPF 15, which you&#x27;d think would be a nice plus.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled they have a mens line.  </li>
      <li>but I found this product incredibly oily and way too rich for most skin types</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and very light, I can&#x27;t smell it at all from more than an inch away.  </li>
      <li>some he liked, most he didn&#x27;t.</li>

      <li>As soon as I took a shower and washed off the moisturizer, my eyes immediately felt better.  </li>
      <li>but that is better than not having</li>
      <li>Most lotions branded for women tend to irritate my skin, presumably because they insist on putting perfumes or scents into them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The dermatologist told me to be sure and wear sunscreen even while driving a car.</li>
      <li>so I never gave a thought to having sunscreen protection on the top of my head.</li>
      <li>He says the fact it has sun block in it gives it more of a greasy feeling than he&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>The reason I say this is because many women&#x27;s SPF face products in this size cost $15 to $50 and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this lotion.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>I also tried it and both of us really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know :),</li>
      <li>Not a scent that I&#x27;d go for in a lotion, but it is better than a number of sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not obnoxious or anything :), but it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>think I&#x27;d better order some here at amazon.com for him.</li>
      <li>even with the scent, so, five stars from me. :)</li>
      <li>My dh has been using this for about a week and feels so much better.</li>
      <li>It feels great and works really well.  </li>
      <li>This is good stuff, with a nice gentle scent.</li>
      <li>very clean.</li>
      <li>All the confusion aside, it seemed like a pretty good product (for whatever it was trying to do).</li>
      <li>This will calm your pores and give your face a nice, dewy feel (though I doubt most guys care about their level of dewiness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lotion has a light and non-greasy feels and a very light unisex scent so it can be worn by both men and women.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell, very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This Nivea for Men Sensitive Protective Lotion is an excellent, mild moisturizing sunscreen (SPF 15) that goes on smooth and works just fine for</li>
      <li>bottle slips easily into a bag.</li>
      <li>It is non-greasy and easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Scent is very very mild too.</li>
      <li>Right up there with some of the best quality lotions I&#x27;ve used such as Eucerin.  </li>
      <li>The SPF could be higher, but this is better than nothing which is what most people are walking around with.</li>
      <li>I was overall quite happy with it until my eyes became irritated.  </li>
      <li>Yes, and if you care about your face then you&#x27;ll do well to use a light sunscreen every day of the year.</li>
      <li>it is a great time to give yourself a facial rub.</li>
      <li>It is no longer scent free, and it now burns my eyes.</li>
      <li>And with vitamin E and chamomile, it is sure to calm and soothe even the fussiest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product has the added benefit of a light Spf 15 which will help protect his skin from harmful rays.</li>
      <li>As far as the skin lotion goes it&#x27;s about as good as the stuff I got from the dollar store or free from motels.  </li>
      <li>This Nivea for Men smells great in that it really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all.</li>
      <li>- I used to like this product and have purchased it for years, but the new formulation is far from ideal.</li>
      <li>only good thing is that it washes off with water very quickly.</li>
      <li>I was excited to order this product as I couldn&#x27;t find it any store around me however this version is scented.</li>
      <li>There is no alcohol, which for me is great as I do not want anything that might dry me out before.</li>
      <li>In fact, this product would probably work great if I used it exclusively as a moisturizer for dry skin before bed even without the benefit of the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve been using their [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm]] for years and love it (bought it after decades of using Gillette when I couldn&#x27;t find that at Target anymore, and glad that I did).  </li>
      <li>However, he spends more time outdoors at work and says this really helps keep his skin feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nivea goes on like a mild lotion</li>
      <li>My goal was equilibrium, but it&#x27;s better than that - my hands are not only not deteriorating, but they are getting better.</li>
      <li>perhaps \\&quot;mildly glossy.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Absorbs fairly quickly, but when going on feels a bit greasy, but that goes away after a bit.</li>
      <li>and I believe this Nivea cream is a nice way of pampering it.acial rub it not only is enjoyable, but also very revealing.</li>
      <li>I jumped at getting a free tube of this cream because it&#x27;s exactly what I need for the wind and sun and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to take a finely balanced lotion to moisturize his skin without overmoisturizing it, and we may have found it thanks to this</li>
      <li>In a nutshell, I like it as a sunscreen (albeit not as strong as others), think it&#x27;s decent as a lotion, and wouldn&#x27;t choose it as an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>husband, who also has sensitive skin, says that he loves the formula because it is scent-free, non-greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make his skin itch, which most moisturizers do.</li>
      <li>This is not designed to be a go for a swim sunscreen because it washes right off.</li>
      <li>This is not designed to be a go for a swim sunscreen because it washes right off.</li>
      <li>(isopropyl palmitate is the #2 ingredient right after water...</li>
      <li>The proof is right there in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>So if you sweat, or go swimming, its going to wash right off you.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and break out easily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a boat that I usually go out on later in the day so I never gave a thought to having sunscreen protection on the top of my head. One day I went out early on the insistence from a friend, and my scalp got fried. It turned purplish. It finally healed back to normal looking skin but what arose were large oval black patches. Of course this upset me and I went to a dermatologist. She told me that it was a pre-cancerous condition yet wasn&#x27;t that alarmed about it and told me to keep an eye on it. I went home and got rid of shampoos that had sodium laurel sulfate in them, I started wearing a hat, and I enjoyed getting some use out of the aloe plant I had applying it daily. The condition cleared up never to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the moral of the story? And what does that have to do with this Nivea sunscreen moisturizer? Mainly that. The dermatologist told me to be sure and wear sunscreen even while driving a car. She mentioned that your left arm could be exposed for an hour, or two, or more depending on how long you are on the road. I started to carry a spray sunscreen in the pouch in the door and put it on if I was going on any long trips during the summer with a shot sleeve shirt on. The spray is a little hard to control, but this Nivea isn&#x27;t. It is way more ideal of a solution. You can squeeze whatever portion you need very precisely with no overspray. It takes up very little room in the car and I love the way it smells. It is hard to describe the way it smells but if I had to give it a shot I would say a faint butter cream with a tinge of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying it to your face it is a great time to give yourself a facial rub. The area right above the eyes is a stress center, and if you close your eyes (you’re not supposed to get it in your eyes and if you do simply rinse with clear water) while rubbing the area this Nivea lubricates the skin and you will be shocked at how the muscles in the forehead area contract due to stress and by doing a facial rub it not only is enjoyable, but also very revealing. I didn&#x27;t realize my face was taught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a combination of a sunscreen, and moisturizer. I really like it. I bought some Nivea hand cream a few years ago, and what is true of their hand cream is true here also; a very little bit goes a long way. The winters are dry, and I have natural gas forced air heat which is dry also. So having something like this that is just as good on your face as it is on your arms, and legs, and entire body is a way to keep your skin soft, and supple even during the harsh winter. During the summer the sunscreen protection is beneficial as well. This is not designed to be a go for a swim sunscreen because it washes right off. The skin is the largest organ of our body and I believe this Nivea cream is a nice way of pampering it.acial rub it not only is enjoyable, but also very revealing.

    <li> This is good stuff, with a nice gentle scent. It absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t leave a grease slick on your face. The SPF could be higher, but this is better than nothing which is what most people are walking around with. All in all a nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter now, and in New York it&#x27;s freezing, pardon my French.  I jumped at getting a free tube of this cream because it&#x27;s exactly what I need for the wind and sun and generally miserable conditions that  await me every time I go outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is soft and smooth and practically odorless - I don&#x27;t know exactly what makes it &amp;#34;FOR MEN&amp;#34; - maybe the other Nivea products contain perfumes?  Applied to the exposed parts of my face it has protected my from chapping and sunburn.  It feels great and works really well.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll use it at the end of a long day if I have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2.5 oz bottle is actually pretty big - if you order three for $20 it seems like a decent, if not great, deal.  I imagine that three tubes would get you through a whole winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come summertime I don&#x27;t know exactly how helpful this will be... SPF 15 doesn&#x27;t cut it for sunbathing, but it will be fine for daily protection.  I can&#x27;t yet vouch for the water-worthiness yet but I&#x27;ll try to get back to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, great stuff, doesn&#x27;t irritate, and protects  your skin in multiple ways.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing lotion works well for limited use on the face, neck and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes ingredients that provide an SPF 15 level sunscreen, without the that usual harsh sunscreen smell.  The mild fragrance is similar to that of a sporty or cool fresh aftershave splash or deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not at all greasy, but has a pleasant powdery feel after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are relatively benign and non-irritating and provide a slight cooling effect when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2.5 oz. bottle slips easily into a bag.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was but I found this product incredibly oily and way too rich for most skin types (isopropyl palmitate is the #2 ingredient right after water... go figure). It&#x27;s in a very thick white cream style and makes your face oily (but not much shine). Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off at the end of the day... only good thing is that it washes off with water very quickly. I like the individual ingredients (no harsh chemicals, not parabens, Vitamin E) but Nivea got the ingredient blend horribly wrong. Add more water, move glycerin up to #2 and make it more fluid so it actually is a LOTION rather than an oily and thick creme...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses [[ASIN:B00AHH00R4 Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Essentials Cream, 6.5 Ounce]] as a face cream so I wanted him to try this moisturizer.  I also tried it and both of us really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what we love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a broad spectrum SPF 15 and does not sting the eyes when used around that area. Of course, don&#x27;t get it in the eyes or it will probably sting.&lt;br /&gt;- This cream is thick and moisturizing. My boyfriend loves that it takes a while to rub it in his face because he says it sets the moisturizer and prevents him from missing a spot.&lt;br /&gt;- I did find it a bit greasy but he did not.&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s no alcohol in the ingredients, so there&#x27;s no drying effect.&lt;br /&gt;-  The price is reasonable for three 2.5 ounce tubes, especially if a woman uses this. The reason I say this is because many women&#x27;s SPF face products in this size cost $15 to $50 and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this does moisturizes very well leaving the skin supple and also protected from the sun.</li>
    <li> Men need moisturizer and SPF protection as well as women.  With this 2.5 ounce tube, he will get both.  The SPF is only 15 but that is better than not having any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a creamy texture and a subtle scent that I can’t quite place.  It is a nice size for him to have in his car console.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he doesn’t use it, I certainly will even if it says Men on the tube!</li>
    <li> I received this item to review, and as some others have stated, the branding of this product is quite confusing.  What is a &amp;#34;protective lotion&amp;#34;?  IT says in smaller font beneath that &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Sunscreen&amp;#34;?  I mean, if it&#x27;s a sun screen, just call it a sun screen.  But is also says &amp;#34;No drying alcohol&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m no aware of many lotions or sunscreens that contain a lot of alcohol, but I&#x27;m not really a bloke who uses a lot of &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; (in fact, I felt a little gross just typing that word).  On the back of the product is says &amp;#34;Skin irritated from shaving?  Don&#x27;t tolerate it.  It starts with you.&amp;#34;  OH!  Maybe it&#x27;s an after shave lotion?  Under that, there are &amp;#34;Directions for sunscreen use&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is an after-shave sun screen lotion...type...thing.  O.k.  Regardless, Nivea products have often agreed with me.  Another label on this lotion is &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;.  I have very sensitive skin and break out easily.  This lotion did not feel oily or like it left a film on my skin.  A tiny bit chalky, maybe, if not rubbed in properly.  I haven&#x27;t tried using it as a sunscreen, but it was o.k. trying it for a bit after a few shaves.  All the confusion aside, it seemed like a pretty good product (for whatever it was trying to do).</li>
    <li> The packaging of this was confusing.  I wondered if it was skin lotion or suntan lotion.  The answer I suppose is both.  As far as the skin lotion goes it&#x27;s about as good as the stuff I got from the dollar store or free from motels.  The suntan lotion I can&#x27;t really gauge right now since it&#x27;s like 20 degrees outside, so not much beachcombing happening.  For the price they charge, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea products for years, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s/unisex, so I can help define exactly why they market this product they way they do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Is it a lotion? Yes, in fact, based on the scent and consistency I would say this is a slightly reformulated version of Nivea Soft Creme. If you&#x27;ve never used that before then you will find it to have a silky consistency and do a very, very good job of moisturizing your skin. This would be excellent for winter months. You&#x27;ll also find that it takes a very small amount to cover your face. A pea-sized dollop would be far too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Is it an aftershave? Yes, and a darn good one at that. The proof is right there in the ingredients. Glycerin and witch hazel are your face&#x27;s best friends after a shave. This will calm your pores and give your face a nice, dewy feel (though I doubt most guys care about their level of dewiness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Is it a sunscreen? Yes, and if you care about your face then you&#x27;ll do well to use a light sunscreen every day of the year. Sunscreens protect your face from aging, and this SPF 15 mix is ideal for most guys. Unless you want to look like the Marlboro Man, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this lotion has been nothing but positive, and I think it&#x27;s just exactly what was missing from the Nivea for Men Sensitive line. Replace your aftershave with this lotion, and after a few days, your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> Be aware that the formula has changed.  It is no longer scent free, and it now burns my eyes.</li>
    <li> NIIVEA has been in the cosmetics business like forever, with so many products targeting several ages, gender, and needs. This new formula of a protective lotion for men is a moisturize cream that protects from the sun UV rays with a SPF of 15. I&#x27;ll admit that 15 is really enough, however, with the ozon layer being hurt, I&#x27;d prefer an SPF of 30. The cream is odorless, which is adequate because this is for men&#x27;s use, and the active ingredients it contains are avobenzone, octisalate, and octocrylene. All men older than 25 should be using a face moisturizer at least once a day (in the morning, with sunscreen, winter and summer), and ideally also before going to bed (no SPF needed, of course). NIVEA is a realiable company, and I recommend this very affordable and quality cream with no hesitations.</li>
    <li> Provides good moisture for dry sensitive skin. Absorbs fairly quickly, but when going on feels a bit greasy, but that goes away after a bit. Has a very very mild scent which is nice.</li>
    <li> My husband has long loved the Nivea for Men Sensitive Moisturizer, it is one of the few that he can use after shaving that doesn&#x27;t cause his face to break out in a rash. This product has the added benefit of a light Spf 15 which will help protect his skin from harmful rays. I like that it&#x27;s one-step for a duo purpose.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product if you want to burn the heck out of your eyes all day! I put this on my face (not close to my eyes) before going kayaking and an hour later I was trying to wipe it out of my eyes. Burned so bad. Threw it in the trash so I wouldn&#x27;t subject anyone else to the pain. Dissapointed with Nivea because I&#x27;ve been buying their products for years. This one sucks.</li>
    <li> I was excited to order this product as I couldn&#x27;t find it any store around me however this version is scented. I was disappointed I didn&#x27;t notice it in the description or in the comments at the time. So if you&#x27;re like me and your skin is sensitive to this you should pass.</li>
    <li> Without any notice on the label, packaging, or Amazon listing, Nivea changed the product dramatically.  It now has a perfumed scent and is rather oily/waxy.  Very disappointed in the lack of notice and will not buy this product again.  Too bad I purchased a 3-pack, as they will be going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nivea For Men products for several years and love them. I&#x27;ve used their Sensitive Protective Lotion for my face for at least the last 4 years. But, recently they reformulated the product.  It went from SPF 4 to SPF 15, which you&#x27;d think would be a nice plus. BUT! They also changed the entire product.  It is now very waxy, leaves a film on my face that is unpleasant. And something in the product gives off fumes that burns my eyes.  I never put product close to my eyes, but even though I&#x27;m very careful not to do so, within a couple of hours of using this product, my eyes are burning from the fumes it gives off.  What a horrible change. I used to recommend the previous formula to many friends. But no more. I will have to find another brand to use, this is terrible.  Now I have 3 tubes of this stuff to throw away.</li>
    <li> My husband has a dry face, but every time he uses lotion--even lotions made for men--he gets acne resulting from the oiliness. It&#x27;s going to take a finely balanced lotion to moisturize his skin without overmoisturizing it, and we may have found it thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He used this both after shaving and just randomly. As an aftershave lotion, he says it does not burn. No issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things he likes about the product:&lt;br /&gt;-He didn&#x27;t break out&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t sting&lt;br /&gt;-It rid him of dry, itchy skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s one point against it though, at least for him. He says the fact it has sun block in it gives it more of a greasy feeling than he&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, very clean and fresh. It&#x27;s very soothing to dry cracked hands and especially feet and legs with the dry winter. You need to allow it to absorb into the skin before touch anything as there is a bit of a greasy-ness to it when you first put it on. Just enough to actually feel a bit oily and you if you touch something like paper or a think cloth you can see a bit of the oil reside. But just don&#x27;t touch anything right away allow it to really absorb into the skin. The texture feels really nice, no more rough man!</li>
    <li> This Nivea for Men Sensitive Protective Lotion is an excellent, mild moisturizing sunscreen (SPF 15) that goes on smooth and works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family and I use sunscreen regularly if we&#x27;re going to a park, doing work outside, or swimming in our pool. Over the years I have grown to hate the strong smell of most sunscreen. This Nivea for Men smells great in that it really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all. There&#x27;s a slight, refreshing &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that I would associate with a moisturizing lotion much more than a sunscreen. In fact, this product would probably work great if I used it exclusively as a moisturizer for dry skin before bed even without the benefit of the sunscreen. According to the box, this is enriched with Vitamin E and chamomile, so it&#x27;s no wonder I find if soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many sunscreens, both cream and foam versions, leave a bit of filmy residue which I dislike almost as much as the smell. Again, that&#x27;s not been the case here. Nivea goes on like a mild lotion and I detected no stickiness or residue. Overall, I&#x27;d definitely use this again, particularly in the summertime.</li>
    <li> There was a period of time about 5 years back when I used exclusively Nivea products - aftershave soothing lotion (not the irritating alchohol based stuff), Nivea exfoliating cream for Men, Nivea face wash.  After I found my wife and got married - it kind of tapered down !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first Nivea product I am using after a pretty long time and rediscovering that they truly make good products - I mean really good products that just work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer gives a soothing effect effect on the skin like no other product does, not even Cetaphil.  It almost immediately dissolves into the skin pores without leaving any grease, I live in Minneapolis where we are exposed to -10 F regularly and this thing lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild perfume to it, not overbearing - but just for yourself to feel good about it.  I typically use it after a shave and apply it on my hands and face.</li>
    <li> This lotion is somewhat thick but goes on nicely. It has a very nice fresh scent....very clean. The scent is not overpowering, but smells like I just got out of the shower. The SPF is great for me, as I need to where sunscreen all the time. My skin does not feel oily after applying it. There is no alcohol, which for me is great as I do not want anything that might dry me out before. For background, I received radiation to my head and neck (35 consecutive days) which left me pretty charred. My skin will not tan and I have no natural protection in that area, so needless to say, my skin is probably as sensitive as it can get. This moisturizer does not irritate my skin at all....even with the scent, so, five stars from me. :)</li>
    <li> Winter is very harsh on my skin.  I think with all the artificial heat being used to heat our homes and offices it dries out the air a lot.  My skin takes a toll from this.  Hands, face and head become very dry and even painful at times. I definitely don&#x27;t experience this in the summer.  So each Winter I have to turn to lotion to keep my skin manageable.  I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin for quite some time now and it does a pretty solid job.  I was eager to try another brand to see how it performs.  This is definitely a quality lotion.  There is very little greasy feeling after rubbing it in to my hands/face.  Right up there with some of the best quality lotions I&#x27;ve used such as Eucerin.  Also this is not a scented lotion, so there is very little smell, although it does slightly smell like, well, lotion, which is OK in my book.  It soaks into the skin without a lot of effort, and after using for about a week my skin does feel slightly recovered from all this dryness.  I will continue to use this product to see how it performs over the long term, but I&#x27;m optimistic that it&#x27;s going to show some improvement.</li>
    <li> Since the place I live in place that has dry climate, I was looking out for a moisturizing cream that will hydrate me as well as provide some sun screen protection. This cream fitted the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;1) It is made with vitamin E, chamomile and witch hazel extracts that soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) It moisturizes my dry skin well and hydrates it.&lt;br /&gt;3) Provides fair amount of protection from sun.&lt;br /&gt;4) It is non-greasy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:-&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels refreshed and radiant after each use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it...I&#x27;m a little confused as to what this is actually being marketed as: lotion, aftershave, sunscreen, or all of the above?  They call it a moisturizer, the description on the bottle starts off with a statement of skin being irritated from shaving, but the bulk of the text talks about it being a sunscreen.  In a nutshell, I like it as a sunscreen (albeit not as strong as others), think it&#x27;s decent as a lotion, and wouldn&#x27;t choose it as an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few times, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a cross between a thick lotion and a sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white-ish haze like some sunscreens do, but it does take a bit of working into the skin to get rid of the white look from the lotion itself, and it leaves a shiny (for lack of a better word) look.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it greasy...perhaps \\&quot;mildly glossy.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not obnoxious or anything :), but it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like any aftershave lotion/balm that I&#x27;ve ever used before.  In fact, I&#x27;ve been using their [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm]] for years and love it (bought it after decades of using Gillette when I couldn&#x27;t find that at Target anymore, and glad that I did).  It&#x27;s very soothing.  I&#x27;ve used this product on my face as a sunscreen, but after using that balm first on days that I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t bad at all and not overly strong, but it is more \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; than I&#x27;d expect in a product marketed for men.  Not a scent that I&#x27;d go for in a lotion, but it is better than a number of sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used [[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate and Face Lotion, 1.69 oz.]].  It&#x27;s similarly priced per ounce and, if memory serves, has about the same feel and look after being applied.  That&#x27;s marketed as a facial lotion with SPF 15, whereas this is marketed as...well...I don&#x27;t know :), but I&#x27;m going to go with a whole body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the price, I think it&#x27;s decent and worthy of four stars.  I like other Nivea products and will certainly consider buying more of this as we move into the summer months when shorts and t-shirts rule the day and sunscreen becomes a bigger player.  Like I said, I do like it as a sunscreen, and SPF 15 is usually good enough for how long I&#x27;m outside.ke other Nivea products and will certainly consider buying more of this as we move into the summer months when shorts and t-shirts rule the day and sunscreen becomes a bigger player.  Like I said, I do like it as a sunscreen, and SPF 15 is usually good enough for how long I&#x27;m outside.</li>
    <li> Leaves a greasy film that needs to be wiped away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with dry skin lately -- flaky skin on my face, neck, and back.  And so the hunt began for a moisturizer.  The Nivea came at a perfect time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer did not fix my issue overnight, but I have seen gradual improvements over the past couple weeks.  I&#x27;m now using it daily and hope the days of dry skin are behind me.  This product seems to work well, and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff lol My dh has been using this for about a week and feels so much better. He uses it on his hands and arms. I rub it on his back and all feel so much better even my hands. He&#x27;s getting older so his skin does get dry more often and this is so soothing he says. He doesn&#x27;t stay outside for long lengths of time anymore and course it&#x27;s January but puts it on his neck just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d better order some here at amazon.com for him.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective moisturizer.  It is thick but spreads easily, so I only need a pea-sized amount to cover my face.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.  There is a very faint scent reminiscent of soap or shaving cream, but it fades after a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using this on my face, I also tried this on my hands, which are very dry and cracked because of the cold winter weather.  I didn&#x27;t find it as effective on my hands as some of the other lotions that I have.  It didn&#x27;t seem to sink into the skin of my hands as well as it did on my face.  So I&#x27;ll continue to use this on my face only.</li>
    <li> Nivea is a German company made famous for their cold cream, which is sold around the world. I trust their brand, and use their shaving cream. The sunscreen moisturizer, like their shaving cream, has witch hazel and chamomile extract, which gives it that &amp;#34;cold cream&amp;#34; smell, that&#x27;s bracing to the skin. NIVEA Protective Lotion contains a 15 SPF sunscreen, that works surprisingly well to minimize sun burn. I rubbed some onto me, and got into the tanning booth at the gym, to test its efficiency. (Its January in Pennsylvania, so even if the sun ever DID come out, it&#x27;s not going to harm me. Plus, I never tried a tanning booth before.) This product works great as a sunscreen. How I know, is that I missed an area on my back, and it got red. The NIVEA sunscreen prevented any redness from developing elsewhere. A lot of sunscreens only use one or two active ingredients, but NIVEA uses three, for broad spectrum protection.  I would warn you that this product is VERY water soluble. So if you sweat, or go swimming, its going to wash right off you.  So consider using this as a daily moisturizer that protects against your everyday sun exposure, but if you&#x27;re at the beach, or out bike riding in the summer sun, use a different product. And maybe wear a hat. (Plus, stay out of tanning booths. I felt like I was in a microwave oven.)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to test the sunscreen aspect of this product as it&#x27;s been a bit too cold to stand outside waiting for a sunburn.  As a moisturizer though this lotion is quite nice.  The cream is pretty thick, if you rub drys out with no sticky residue.  The smell is pleasant and very light, I can&#x27;t smell it at all from more than an inch away.  I live in the northeast, where winters mean dry skin.  This cream does a great job of moisturizing for most of the day.  I don&#x27;t experience any stinging or burning like I have from some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive for the size of the tube, but it works well.</li>
    <li> It may say for men, but it&#x27;s great for women too. I love the feel of this lotion. Very silky/soft. My skin feels great after putting it on. Now I don&#x27;t just put it on in the morning. I have been applying it a few times a day (it&#x27;s very dry where I am.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been snagging some for himself as well. He says it works and he likes it. High praise from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this will be a staple in our home. Scent is very very mild too.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and I have very dry and very sensitive skin and the winter is such a nightmare for my skin. Moisturizer is absolutely essential, I apply it several times a day. Most lotions branded for women tend to irritate my skin, presumably because they insist on putting perfumes or scents into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men provides great moisturizing that lasts all day without perfumes or dyes or drying alcohol. It has hardly any scent at all, which I love, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or clog my pores. It does contain witch hazel, which usually irritates my rosacea, but this formula didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula contains SPF, so it is great for every day use, and the moisturizing is great for all day care. It even works well under makeup, which not all lotion can claim. Some lotions sit on top of the skin, rather than absorbing, which makes makeup look strange and flaky and sometimes greasy- that might not be helpful for most users, but for the men and women who wear makeup, it&#x27;s good to know. But even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup, a lotion that absorbs fully is essential, because no one wants a greasy residue. And with vitamin E and chamomile, it is sure to calm and soothe even the fussiest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, who also has sensitive skin, says that he loves the formula because it is scent-free, non-greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make his skin itch, which most moisturizers do. It&#x27;s also a convenient way to get his daily SPF. Nivea is a reliably good brand and this is a good lotion - for all genders.</li>
    <li> I got this as an after shave cream for my husband but as soon as I got wind of the scent I wanted it for myself.The chamomile fragrance is so lovely, so pleasant that I knew we&#x27;d end up sharing this. This lotion is very smooth and non-greasy. Protects my husband from wind burn in the harsh WI winter. I love it for my hands and general body use. I am rash prone (and this is skin-gentle), he is not. However, he spends more time outdoors at work and says this really helps keep his skin feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like this so much I have added it on to our Subscribe and Save list. It is a real winner from Nivea.</li>
    <li> Nivea changed this lotion. It used to have a much smoother non-fragrance feel to it. It also used to be SPF4 - now it is SPF 15, thicker stickier and some sort of fragrance. TOO BAD - I used to like this product and have purchased it for years, but the new formulation is far from ideal. Will not be buying this again [Think new Coke versus original Coke]  - Bummer - it was nice while it lasted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on dry hands in the heart of a New England winter. So far (a few weeks of once a day), so good. My goal was equilibrium, but it&#x27;s better than that - my hands are not only not deteriorating, but they are getting better. Not quite summer-like, but not cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting (when I started I my hands were cracked) and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily. It seems not to linger too long - a big plus for when you apply shortly before putting gloves on. It is also a mild sunscreen, which would be GREAT for winter running, but 30 inches of snow on the ground make testing that a little hard to judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> i waited until my husband used this 3 times and i used it once to review it.  My husband has sensitive skin and lotions often feel like they burn him after shaving.  Yet he doesn&#x27;t like the feel of greasy lotion on his skin so over the years, i&#x27;ve picked up lotions some he liked, most he didn&#x27;t. he liked this one. he said first the scent is very soft, and it doesn&#x27;t clash with his cologne.  it sinks into the skin fast and it does make it soft and soothes.  As for the SPF factor, we both used it on our faces and we were hiking yesterday and neither of us got sunburned so it does it&#x27;s job.  I like Nivea products for me and I&#x27;m thrilled they have a mens line.  It gives me choices to get him for stocking stuffers etc.  This is the second Nivea product he has and he likes them both alot.  Nivea has great products.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a light and non-greasy feels and a very light unisex scent so it can be worn by both men and women.  I was overall quite happy with it until my eyes became irritated.  They felt the same way as when my summer sunscreen get into my eyes.  As soon as I took a shower and washed off the moisturizer, my eyes immediately felt better.  You should definitely try out this product at a store to see whether the ingredients irritate your eyes before buying it.</li>
