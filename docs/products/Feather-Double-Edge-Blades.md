      <li>I tried Derby and got razor burn, tried Wilkinson , they didn&#x27;t work so good.</li>
      <li>Good to have around for when you run out of cartridge razors.  </li>
      <li>Good Blades.</li>

      <li>The edge is good for about 5 days.</li>
      <li>The price for this pack is good and</li>

      <li>Work good with my shaver.</li>
      <li>They fit the razor perfectly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personas work just as good on my face</li>
      <li>The sound they make as they cut the hairs on my face give excellent feedback while I shave and these blades are probably easily good for four to five shaves.</li>
      <li>I am using these in a feather popular razor ( cheep but very effective)</li>
      <li>Very easy to put in and great price.  </li>
      <li>They are very good blades but its easy to give yourself razor burn.</li>
      <li>As you become more proficient you will probably learn to love a sharper blade and these Feather&#x27;s are a perfect choice.  </li>
      <li>Feather blades are exceptional against ANY blades from the store, saftey and multi-blade varieties included</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Delivered as promised, excellent blade very sharp works well with my beard and skin type in my DE89L and my feather popular razors. would buy again.</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp razors! Cause irritation and I&#x27;m unable to use them.</li>
    <li> For the double edge wet shaving fans out there, these are super blades delivered promptly at a good price. Note that general agreement is that these are quite sharply made blades, so be gentler/less aggressive in your shaving style with these.</li>
    <li> Every blade works differently on different faces. This blade apparently works great for many people. It does not for me, it may not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe these blades are on the harsher side of the spectrum, so if you have sensitive skin as I do, these blades may not be for you. I would recommend finding a double-edge razor blade sampler pack so you can find out which blade works best with your face and your razor.</li>
    <li> TL;DR — I wish I could give 3.5 stars. These are the sharpest blades around, yet they don&#x27;t provide the best shave in my experience. Wilkinson Sword Classic is in the same class but provides a far better shave for less money. Astra SP Platinum is a good medium-sharp blade for cheap. That said, with good technique you can avoid nicks using Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my review of the blades I&#x27;ve tried. There are a lot of sampler packs on Amazon, but after doing some research I chose to order around 30 each of just a few different blades to try, avoiding all of the lesser-quality &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll compare here and there to Mach-3 blades since that&#x27;s what I previously used before switching to electric, and now this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, Derby is what came with my razor. These you can practically rake across your face any way you see fit. They aren&#x27;t very sharp, on par with a Mach-3 that&#x27;s been used a few times. Shaving requires more strokes which leads to more irritation, especially on the neck. That said, I&#x27;d say these are a good blade if you&#x27;re super worried about cutting yourself, because it&#x27;s practically impossible. But even beginners might want to look elsewhere as these blades kind of ruin the &amp;#34;shaving experience&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t be disappointed if you just bought this razor and have only tried these blades! Keep reading...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a 100-pack of Astra SP Platinum (that&#x27;s Astra Superior Premium Platinum, not the regular stainless) since it&#x27;s under ten bucks at the time of this writing. These are great. Beginners, start here. They&#x27;re sharp enough that you don&#x27;t have to press the razor against your skin—which you shouldn&#x27;t have to! You&#x27;re supposed to let the weight of your razor do the work as you guide it along your face in short strokes. So naturally, these are sharper than Mach-3 blades, but if you do press a little, you probably won&#x27;t nick yourself. I love these blades because for me, they&#x27;re comfortable enough for everyday use and provide good, close shaves at a very inexpensive price. Easy on my neck with care. My go-to blade. Great for beginners and pros alike, and eligible for Subscribe &amp; Save!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson Sword Classic seem to be great blades for people who have their technique down pretty well. Compared to Astra SP Platinum, they are sharper. They provided the best shave of the lot, but I did nick myself here and there on my neck and below my chin the first time around. Do not push these blades against your skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much mastery to use these, and they&#x27;re worth working up to. Downside: more than twice the price of Astra SP Platinum. I&#x27;ll keep some of these around for days when I want the closest shave possible, or I just feel like something different. If you&#x27;re new to traditional shaving or think Mach-3 blades are sharp, maybe don&#x27;t start here, but definitely try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather &amp;#34;New Hi Stainless&amp;#34; Platinum Coated blades are exactly what the reviews say: sharp. My first shave I got a good amount of nicks, but my second I had almost none. I adapted well, and you have to; each brand is a little different and the best require good technique, but some are more forgiving than others. These are negligibly sharper than the Wilkinson Sword Classic but they aren&#x27;t forgiving at all and I didn&#x27;t achieve any better of a shave. They&#x27;re incredibly sharp compared to a Mach-3 blade. At 2x the price of the aforementioned and more than 3x the price of Astra SP Platinum, I won&#x27;t be keeping these on hand, but your mileage may vary. If you only want the sharpest blade around, this is it. Fun fact: these come ten to a pack instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m sticking with Astra SP Platinum for regular use and Wilkinson Sword Classic when I&#x27;m up for something sharper. I shave every other day, and either is priced reasonably enough that if I want, I can use each side of a blade just once for a fresh edge every shave. That&#x27;s about a 100-pack every year, so do the maths on price. Of course, both brands last much longer than this if you&#x27;re looking for even better value.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. Super sharp, Each one lasts me a week.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My husband has very thick facial hair but with sensitive skin, so most razors are torture on his face.  He had tried a safety razor in the past, but it would pull the hair and cause razor burn.  So, he was resigned to cheap razors and shaving less often than he would like.  Recently, he discovered these blades at a local market... they were highly recommended by a vendor selling antique safety razors.  The vendor gave him a razor to take home and try out.  It was love at first shave!  This blade provides a clean, close shave and does not cause any razor burn or pain through pulling the hair or cutting the skin.  And, he&#x27;s now able to shave every day if he needs to since the razor stays sharp and performs so well.  I bought him a 30-ct package, which will last him at least 2 years at this rate.  I know he&#x27;s very pleased with this blade, so I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best. Super thin and razor sharp. My face thanks me every time I use them.</li>
    <li> Will still compare with some others in the future, but so far the best I have tried and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Super sharp!  Great blades.</li>
    <li> Waiting a month and a half for these was really great.</li>
    <li> Great product, simply cant be beat.  The shave can actually be too close!  The single edge shaving experience takes some acclimating if you&#x27;re used to using a safety razor, but once you get hooked you&#x27;ll never go back.  Plus, it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying safety razors!!!</li>
    <li> Known as the sharpest blade in the industry for a reason, these (slightly unforgiving) blades are perfect to cut through any facial hair type. I&#x27;d recommend having a very solid understanding of your own facial hair and using a straight razor prior to jumping to these but once you start using them you really can&#x27;t go back. Pro tip: use some conditioner on your beard in the shower prior to shaving, it really softens the hairs and helps with the cut.</li>
    <li> I have been practising DE shaving for many months now using a more forgiving blade like Astra. Just switched to Feather and I am very impressed. Its sharper and seems to shave closer. Just be careful you don&#x27;t cut yourself, so take it slow.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES these blades.  After years of trying every fancy-pants, outrageously priced,  3-, 4-, and 5-blade plastic fantastic, he&#x27;s happily back to a single blade that he can replace  as soon as it starts pulling without tossing 3 bucks and a hunk of plastic in the trash.</li>
    <li> Holy crap! This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been using a double edge razor for only about a year now and I was on Shark razors. I didn&#x27;t realize how awful Sharks eye until I tried this. Complete eye opener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about all of the reviews that day you will cut yourself. I knicked myself far more often with the Sharks than with these. Just use a light hand and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Item received timely and as described.</li>
    <li> Work good with my shaver. I have nothing to compare them to.</li>
    <li> These blades are no good.  They may be fakes.  It&#x27;s hard to tell.  Whether there real or not they&#x27;re dull to an unusable degree.  Also, they took a long time to arrive.  I bought them not realizing they&#x27;d take so long.  In the meantime I bought a sampler box of other blades and so far the 3 other ones I have tried out of that set are all better.</li>
    <li> The blades are great. Much closer shave than others I have used. What bothered me was the extremely long time it took to deliver them.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
    <li> These are sharper than usual razor blades. Take care . Use short strokes at a small angle. They are very good blades but its easy to give yourself razor burn.</li>
    <li> Great blades very sharp. Better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It took me years to finally cross over from multi-cartridge razors to DE razors.  The biggest selling point to me was the savings you&#x27;ll have from the blades alone.  It took a bit of money to get started but once you have everything it&#x27;s really worth it.  I personally started out with Astra blades and learned to do my 3 passes with those blades.  I had to be trying to cut myself with those to be completely honest.  I could go with, against, and across and have no issues what so ever.  So why did I switch to these you ask?  Curiosity mostly, I had read so many reviews and internet sources that praised these cartridges like there was no other way to go. They are very sharp compared to the Astra&#x27;s.  On my face and beard anyways it was a night and day difference on how easily I could cut myself with these blades versus the Astra&#x27;s.  I had to really ease off on the handle of my safety razor, which is what most websites and reviewers on youtube will tell you anyways.  Once I got used to these blades though, I was finally able to get the underside of my neck closer then I ever had before.  That&#x27;s probably the toughest part to get baby but smooth for me and these blades accomplished that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All an all blades are really subjective and you should really be trying a variety pack to see what works best for you to learn first(if you&#x27;re new to this) and then branch out to blades that others have harped about.  The cost of this 30 count pack is less then what a razor and mult-cartridge pack would cost you anyways so it&#x27;s a win-win if you look at it from a cost perspective.</li>
    <li> Really like these blades. Have to take my time on my face but get the closest shave possible. Perfect for shaving my head. Cuts right through with no cuts or irritation</li>
    <li> I ordered these blades for my new Merkur safety razor after seeing them rated at 5/5 blade icons on shaving101.com. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t actually read the article, or I&#x27;d have seen that the 5 icon rating meant that they were the sharpest blade on the market, not necessarily the best. Well, I received these and my razor yesterday and I&#x27;m simply blown away. My facial hair is both sparse and thin, and I approached these blades with a great deal of respect and a little bit of fear. After a late night, single pass shave, I looked down at the sink basin, and was shocked to see honest to goodness stubble that had been sheared off, where I didn&#x27;t think such stubble existed. I&#x27;d shaved just the night prior. These really are the sharpest blades out there, and fortunately for me, they&#x27;re exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. Super sharp, and a great price. I will never ever buy a mach 9 or what ever they are up to now.</li>
    <li> I have tried Astra, Shark, Derby, and many other brands, and NONE of them shave as well or as cut-free as my Feathers.  There is almost no tug, guaranteeing a irritation free shave every time.  I will never buy another brand of blade.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. But don&#x27;t be intimidated. If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving with a safety razor, simply respect the blade. Sharp is safer than dull.</li>
    <li> I started traditional wet shaving over a year ago with a Gillette L2 razor. i tried several blades and did not like the feathers. Later on I learned a few things, mainly that you need to put some tension on the blade until it flexes a little. after learning this i decided to order some more feathers and really like them, they are super sharp and provide a good shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all i would recommend Feather double edges blade, i leave the qty to you.</li>
    <li> Damn close shave with these things.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp, close clean shave every time. Feather is the only blade I use, never had a bad shave with these blades.</li>
    <li> Shave depends on what razor you use.  I didnt like them with my Merkur Futur but they did well in my Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> I love my safety razor and I love these blades.  Whether you are new to safety shaving or these razors in particular, there is a learning curve to using them.  Go slow and use a very soft touch.  You may still get several nicks the first few times, but in my experience you get better very quick.</li>
    <li> It has been two months and I still have not got these stupid blades. I am pretty mad because I have had to use some Walmart blades for the last 2 months.</li>
    <li> Best blade on the market.++</li>
    <li> Being new to DE shaves, I did a lot of research...like 2 months worth, and found while many tell you to try out a lot of razors, they all tell you they ended up with Feather.  So figuring, &amp;#34;why waste the time&amp;#34;, I just jumped right to the Feather DE razors and can&#x27;t think of why I would try anything else.  These are super sharp and can cut through your whiskers like a hot knife through butter.  This cuts down on red bumps and irritation.  So with such a great shave and experience, why go anywhere else?</li>
    <li> These blades are the best I&#x27;ve ever shaved with. Most blades last two or three shaves, but I can get at least five out of these. The blade is.much sharper than most others, which makes for a smooth, consistent shave.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best blades, but they are incredibly sharp.  Most people agree that these aren&#x27;t forgiving of sloppy technique.  Slow down and take your time, and you&#x27;ll get a fantastic shave.  If you&#x27;re sloppy, or haven&#x27;t perfected your shave, there will be blood.</li>
    <li> these are the sharpest blades you can get, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the best. they haven&#x27;t been too sharp as to cause me to cut myself any more than any other blade.</li>
    <li> great item&lt;br /&gt;super sharp&lt;br /&gt;slices right through my thick beard&lt;br /&gt;i would highly recommend these double edge blades.&lt;br /&gt;i use them with a parker22R gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I was trying out a few blades just to see which ones agreed with my face. I found a few I liked that I considered going back to, but as soon as I bought the feathers, I saw no reason to continue trying new blades. Sharp! Even with my (really, really) coarse hair, I can get 7 shaves out of each blade. All other blades like Merkur, Gillette, and Personna only offered me about 4 shaves max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;m going to buy the sleeve of 100.</li>
    <li> First experience with double edge blades. In doing my research, the Feather name came up over and over as the sharpest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it&#x27;s true, but I have nothing to compare it with, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with the shave provided and really don&#x27;t feel the need to look around for other blades to try.</li>
    <li> I think feather blades are the best in the business,  I&#x27;ve tried several different brands, and I know now that I wont try any others.</li>
    <li> Super sharp blades.  The cases have a nice design where you can store used blades in the back before chucking them out.</li>
    <li> I love Feather blades. After dealing with Wilkinson Sword&#x27;s basically ripping my hair out, I opted for the often recommended Feather&#x27;s and low and behold they&#x27;ve given me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. I have not experienced any drag or catching on my beard when I shave and they seem to last several shaves before dull. Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick facial hair and these blades give me a smoother shave with less irritation than some of the other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Merkur, Persona, Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock &amp; Platinum, Derby Extra, Crystal, and maybe one or two others. The Feather High-Stainless blades simply suit my razor and beard the best. Smoother, more comfortable shave than any other. I use them in a Merkur 37C slant-bar razor, and with these blades it gives as close a shave as my straight razor.</li>
    <li> In the right double edge razor, they work best.  I&#x27;ve tried others.  These do the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good razor holds the blade and just the right angle and distance.  It&#x27;s the blade&#x27;s job to do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade is sharp enough to never grab or stutter -- and I have a tough thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this blade with a good razor.  You&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest DE blades that I have tried, by far.  They are sharper than Personna Labs and Astra Superior Platinums (which are the next sharpest blades that I have tried).  The Feather blades give me the closest shave of any blade, and I can get 7 shaves out of a blade before replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Sharpness; close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They will cut you if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest and thinnest blades around. I use them, my husband uses them, and now I&#x27;ve got my father in law using them too. They are cheap and you get a very close shave. I would never go back to those plastic 5 blade razors.</li>
    <li> Their blades seem to me like they are thinner than usual. Which is not the best for cutting, maybe its just me. But thats why they get 4 stars.</li>
    <li> sharpest double-sided blades I&#x27;ve encountered.  way better than merkur.  unfortunately they don&#x27;t last many shaves, but then again what does.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp but, I thought they might have been sharper. Also I got a couple dull/rough ones mixed in there too. I have just bought an Edwin Jagger razor to use them with and so far they have been fairly impressive.</li>
    <li> These blades are very good to the face and shave very well. I bought a variety pack; these were the best of the bunch.</li>
    <li> My husband has an extremely thick beard and so far these are the only blades that he can shave without a problem and at the same time last thru a whole shave.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The blades are the sharpest i&#x27;ve used, and gave me the best shave so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brands in my search for the best blade for my face, and it appears that my search is over!</li>
    <li> I know that feather is considered among the best, I think they are great. I also think that there are other fabulous blades out there that are easier to get. Most of the suppliers sending these are shipping from Taiwan. It took so long I forgot I ordered them. This is not their fault though because I remember seeing that it would take a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personas work just as good on my face and they have Amazon fulfillment so you can get them this week.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades and my husband loves them-  much cheaper than buying the disposables and a better shave too-  Just go slowly with them or you will cut yourself</li>
    <li> Sharp Sharp Sharp. Love these. My brothers use them when they&#x27;re over too and also like these the most.</li>
    <li> As soon as my razor came to be hovering one inch from my leg, lacerations appeared all over my body, each one gushing a gallon of blood per second. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> Best blades in the market and they last for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandson&#x27;s school to make slides for the  microscope. It took over 3 to 4 weeks to arrive.  If you are in a hurry, try the single edge razor blade which is not as good but more readily available.</li>
    <li> Shipment was a bit slow but the product came intact in secure packaging. Overall, the product met my expectations. .</li>
    <li> These are the best DE blades you can buy.  For me I get 10-14 uses out of one blade.  This purchase gives me blades for more than a year.</li>
    <li> I use these in a Feather razor and are the only blade I will use. These cost just a bit more but my face is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These blades are SHARP.  Smooth, too - it&#x27;s hard to tell sometimes if the blade is actually touching my face or not, and as a consequence sometimes I press too hard. I tried them in my Parker 99R and they pretty much exfoliated my entire face below the jawline - but I never felt the skin getting scraped away.  So, I bought a Gillette Tech (New old stock from 1973), because it has a milder blade gap than the Parker, and gave it a try.  These blades work GREAT with the Tech.  They have a reputation as being almost TOO sharp, but if you use them in a mild razor, they give a fantastically close shave without tearing up your face.</li>
    <li> I got all excited by the reviews of how sharp these blades are.  In real life, they aren&#x27;t so much fun.  They hack the hell out of my face.  Every raised part of my skin is sliced open and my face is a bloody mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Derbys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t bad blades by any means, but they will make you bleed.</li>
    <li> These suckers are surgically sharp and a light touch when shaving (especially when you are a newcomer to DE shaving) is required here! Keep your hands steady and take it slow or you could end up with some cool facial scars. That said, you can get an incredibly smooth shave with these if you know what you are doing.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a blade to get a better shave, I was told that these were very aggressive and I should steer clear of them. I decided to try them anyway and I am glad that I did. My beard is coarse and I can get three shaves from these blades with no issue. They are still cheaper than the cartridges and I get such a better shave from them. Now I understand why my grandfather was using a safety razor when I was younger. I wish I was old enough at that time for him to teach me the benefits of using a safety razor. Better late than never, huh? I will use no other blades but you must try them and others to find which is best for your beard. I am African American and I have not had new razor bumps and my face has begun to heal from the use of a safety razor.</li>
    <li> these are the best do believe the hype be careful these bad boys are not forgiving at all but they are great!!!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on these so called great Japanese made blades. All hype. Takes twice the number of passes to achieve a close shave like I get from my locally bought DE Blades from CVS/pharmacy</li>
    <li> Great blade! They are sharp and provide a smooth shaving experience.  Once in a while you get one that is defective.  If your razor jerks or jumps as you go then throw the blade out and replace with another.</li>
    <li> These are the cheapest Feather&#x27;s out there and Feather&#x27;s aren&#x27;t the only blades but you&#x27;ll like them, I&#x27;m almost positive. If you&#x27;re looking at the reviews on the blades you&#x27;re probably new to shaving or looking for a new blade for your DE Razor. Do yourself a favor and just buy this and give &#x27;em a try.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would like my fathers double edge blade but these work great. It really does take 3 weeks to get but worth it.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades that I have used. They are very sharp and stay sharp for several shaves. -- highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have used. Sharp and smooth edge. I have tried others but always come back to Feather blades.</li>
    <li> These are very good razor blades and I&#x27;ve been shaving for a very long time--I&#x27;m 78. When I ordered them I didn&#x27;t realize that they were of Japanese manufacture. For some reason they were shipped from Thailand so if they take a while to arrive, but don&#x27;t despair. Also though, don&#x27;t wait until you need to shave to order.</li>
    <li> Careful with these blades! They are past the point of sharp enough to shave with and can very easily cut you without even noticing it. With that said, I&#x27;ve never used a DE razor that made it feel like I was cutting through butter with a hot knife. I used to replace my old DE blades after eacg use but these last several shaves in a row. Highly recommended and will buy again.</li>
    <li> These blades are incredibly sharp! They&#x27;re really a little too sharp for my beard. I use a &amp;#34;milder&amp;#34; blade for everyday, but these are nice for when I want to spend some time and effort to get a really great shave.</li>
    <li> I shave every 2 days and replace razors approx. every 1.5-2 weeks.  These last about equally as long as the Pro Glide razor blades.  Simple design, yet work very well.  Would recommend, yet I have not tried any of the other safety razor blade replacements out there.</li>
    <li> These blades are very sharp and relatively inexpensive. I&#x27;m currently using them with the Feather &#x27;Popular&#x27; razor and they work great.</li>
    <li> It gives an OK shave with the Feather Double razor.  Just not as close as my old Gillette Mach 3.  The Mach 3 also lasts a lot longer. I get 5 - 6 shaves out of the Feather blades, where as I would get 10 - 12 out of the Mach 3. Just to test, I would first shave one side of my face with the Feather and the other side with the Mach 3.  No comparison, the Mach 3 wins hands down.  Close shave with not cuts.  I get cuts all time with the Feather.  I feel for the hype.  Newer is better.  I&#x27;m going back to the Gillette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> The last word in sharp, be careful</li>
    <li> Very good razors I recommend buying them their very good for the money they give you a close shave and when I run out I&#x27;ll buy some more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a DE razor for the past year and I love it. The savings compared to the commercial razors are amazing and the save is very clean. Looking for the adequate razor blade is a different story. I&#x27;ve tried different brands and ones are better than the others, but it is also something that varies between every person&#x27;s skin. The price for this pack is good and the shave that I&#x27;m getting with it is very very nice. I will definitely buy it again when I run out but there&#x27;s something important for people before buying: Theses are REALLY sharp. I can get 4-5 shaves out of these blades, whether I can only get 3 tops with other brand I&#x27;ve tried. If you&#x27;re not used to use DE razors, these really sharp blades may cut you very easily.</li>
    <li> I still have not received my order!  I placed it months ago!!!!  probably caught up in customs but i just want the best razors like months ago!!!  BTW Guys,  these really are the best razors!!!</li>
    <li> Very good shave, good price, nice qty need I say any more? Very happy with my purchase. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> As some, I was a little hesitant about ordering from this seller. Well, it was definitely worth the wait. $9.05 for 30 of the absolute best DE blades out there. I have used Feathers in the past and must say they are my go to blade for a BBS shave. Just plan ahead and expect about a month to receive from Thailand. Very well packaged and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave. I have been using this type blade and razor for years and these blades are some of the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Believe the hype, these are really sharp blades and well worth the money.  If you want to save even more you can get a bulk lot very cheap if you&#x27;re willing to wait for slower shipping.  I waited until I had been using these blades for about a month before I wrote a review, so here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these blades after reading many reviews here on Amazon.  I was converting from the 5-blade disposable cartridge world after being a loyal Gilette guy for 20+ years.  I have sensitive skin and get razor burn/bumps very easily, so I was shaving every other day to reduce irritation and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a safety razor and these razors, and I can now shave every day without any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take your time shaving the first few times, you really shouldn&#x27;t have any issue with nicks or cuts.  I saw some reviewers who said these blades are so sharp that its a problem if you&#x27;re a \\&quot;novice\\&quot; safety razor user, but I did not find this to be the case.  I shave very patiently, the way you&#x27;re supposed to with a safety razor, and have had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also made two changes to my shaving routine, which have also helped with my skin irritation:  I do not shave \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; any more (something I had to do with my Gillette cartridges--even with 5 blades) and I soak the razor in vodka after I&#x27;m done shaving and for a few seconds before I start shaving every day.  The feather blades and proper shaving technique completely eliminate the need to shave against the grain, and letting the razor sit in the vodka sanitizes the blade after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note, I&#x27;ve seen several reviews that have indicated they have been able to use 1 blade for more than a week.  I have not had that experience.  It may just be my sensitive skin, but I find that even with the vodka soak if I don&#x27;t change the blade every week I get skin irritation and I start to nick my neck.  Changing blades weekly eliminates this problem.  That&#x27;s thesame schedule I had with my Gillette razors, but I&#x27;m shaving daily with these blades as opposed to every other day.  Even with every other day the Gillette cartridges would irritate my skin and give me razor burn quite often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a half a dozen different blades, and for me the Feather blades are head and shoulders above the others when it comes to sharpness and longevity. Consistently outstanding quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and have tried numerous others before. I have used these for a while because they seem to stay sharp the longest and the initial edge is very good.</li>
    <li> The Best shave over any other blade I have tried. Very sharp and they stay sharp. Thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> I have used many different blades to shave with and these hands down are the best.  I get about 3-4 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and don&#x27;t get many shaves out of them.&lt;br /&gt;Frank</li>
    <li> Sharp! Been using Feather for several years, cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> Just get the best, and forget the rest.all razor blades are sharp, there supposed to be. Quit worrying about the wimps that tell you these are too sharp.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of razors since I switched to double edge safety razors.  For me these are the best.  I have really sensitive skin and course hair that grows in all different directions.  I found that these razors leave little irritation.  It helps to know your face and develop a shaving process that works for you.</li>
    <li> Lived up to is rep as the sharpest blade out there.  Great for the after-vacation shave, when the stubble is long.  Otherwise, be careful.  Make sure you let the weight of the handle do the work, otherwise you will find yourself using a styptic pen.  Not my favorite blade, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the consistent quality.  I find Shark and Personna(Made in USA) to be a nice, middle-of-the- road, blade.</li>
    <li> As someone who not only shaves the face, but also my scalp, this is the best blade...period. I&#x27;ll go through 3-4 shaves before I switch out to a new blade. Just take your time. If you want a quick shave, go back to the Mach 3,4,5 whatever cartridges. Safety razors are meant for slow careful shaves. These blades are crazy sharp. And 1 last tip...run a fresh new blade thru a wine corkscrew to help remove any tiny little burs. Passing that tip on from an old one I read years ago.</li>
    <li> I just completed my first shave with these blades and it was the most comfortable and the closest shave I have ever had! That includes straight razors. My face, chin, neck has not been this smooth since...well, since I was born I imagine. Let me say right now that I think I am the exception to the rule as I do not have sensitive skin and I do have a medium tough beard. I suppose if I had to, I could shave with a chain saw 😉. I&#x27;ve used many different blades and just about all of them are decent with maybe one that would butcher a blade of grass. Certainly even the only ok blades are much better than the multi bladed wonders they put out today, in plain language, they suck! And their cost is almost equal to the national debt, it&#x27;s ridiculous. As long as you have the right razor body to put these blades in, you can&#x27;t go wrong with a DE blade, I use a Edwin Jagger which I absolutely love. I had kind of settled in with the Astra SP which I had found to be a good general purpose blade at a very good price (around $10 per 100 as of this writing) but I got to tell ya, I am now a Feather man. I can&#x27;t say for sure because my skin has always been pretty sturdy but from reading the other reviews you may want to take caution with these if you have very sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t know but I would certainly recommend you at least give these a try, it would be a shame if you passed these by because you were a little nervous using it, after all, double edge \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razors are all pretty sharp. I think if you very careful, as you would be with anything new to you, you just may be happily surprised as I am. I am so very glad I gave these a try. I&#x27;ll keep the Astras I have left and maybe use them every once in a while, but I am going to stock up on these and use them from now on. Do yourself a favor and try as many as you can, you&#x27;ll soon find your go to blade as I just have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***quick update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just shaved off a five day beard growth with the same Feather I have been using, it was every bit as sharp, smooth shaving and comfortable as the day I unwrapped it. Had I done this with a cartridge type razor, it would have literally yanked every hair straight out of my face, it would have been painful at best. The only thing you have to do is make sure to clean the blade and dry it very well. Any blade left wet will degrade much quicker, become dull and maybe form some rust depending on the metal.&lt;br /&gt;I love these blades!</li>
    <li> When you start wet shaving one of the big questions is what is the best blade.  Honestly, what you prefer will likely change as you shaver more and become more proficient. When you start you may like a Wilkinson Sword or something similar because they hold an edge but they aren&#x27;t so sharp that you cut yourself incessantly.  As you become more proficient you will probably learn to love a sharper blade and these Feather&#x27;s are a perfect choice.  The edge is very sharp and they produce a fantastic shave but they take a little touch so you don&#x27;t cut yourself.  The edge is good for about 5 days. You can stretch it to 7 days or so but you will get much more razor burn.  This 30 pack comes as 3 - 10 packs so it is exactly what you are used to and you get some volume discount as a bonus.</li>
    <li> SUPER SHARP!!! Got razor burn the 1st couple tries with this blade, adjusted my method and can say outside of a straight razor this  gives me the closest shave yet. Still trying different blades but these are a go to for me. IMHO</li>
    <li> work great in my razor</li>
    <li> These are sharp, which may not be for everyone, but they give me my best shave!</li>
    <li> These blades are sharper and retain their edge longer than any I&#x27;ve found. You can skip the sample pack. People talk about different faces and razors like different blades, but seems like just about everyone settles on these.</li>
    <li> I am cutting myself more with these though.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades! i wanted a sharp blade, but was told you need to be a Super Master Shaver to use these. Not true After a few shaves, i got the hang of how to use these and rarely cut myself. Awesome blade!!!</li>
    <li> Wanted to try these with my new double edge razor and these are great.  Very easy to put in and great price.  I tried a cheaper off name brand and those work as well as these but I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend getting these.</li>
    <li> My first wet shave was with an edwin jagger loaded with a derby blade -- and I was extremely disappointed and got tons of blood everywhere and razor rash. Later I tried a Feather blade.... and then I saw what people were talking about when they said DE shaving is better than Fusion proglide. Really smooth, just glides through thick bristle-y stubble, no irritation. Lasts a good 6 or 7 shaves. TIP: Use your blade loaded as is, and on your final shave before retiring your blade, flip the blade over for a nice spike in sharpness that lasts through a shave.</li>
    <li> These blades are very sharp. They are not for the novice but they give a great shave.</li>
    <li> best blades never get nicked anymore</li>
    <li> Outstanding!  Suppliers are a little off center, but great product!  If you can find a reliable supplier, you will be more than pleased with the blades.</li>
    <li> Have only used one blade thus far but it has performed to my expectations and as advertised.Would order again when time comes.</li>
    <li> I bought a double edged safety razor a couple years ago.  After buying my razor I bought a sampler package of 7 different blade manufacturers which included the following: Gillette, Astra, Derby, Feather and a couple other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying all those I settled on Feather as my blade of choice.  Some reviewers stated they are so sharp that they cut themselves.  I have had no such issues and can definitely feel my face is smoother with these blades over the other brands I tried.</li>
    <li> I love these. Best razors on the market if you ask me. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and I&#x27;m sticking with Feather.</li>
    <li> Perfect, sharp and nice to use</li>
    <li> I get a about 4 shaves with a blade.  No complaints after switching from mach xxx disposable head razors.  Don&#x27;t press too hard or will shave a layer of skin off.</li>
    <li> Excellent Blades, Very sharp, much sharper than the Personna blades.  This translates into the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Blades look good but slow delivery from asia.</li>
    <li> Single blade not as smooth as the multi shavers but oh well the blades work as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> Good blades.  I had forgotten the joys and pains of shaving with a double edged razor.  I found my old Gillette fat boy razor and bought some blades so I could use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are just over 40 cents each if you buy 30 of them.  After the second day I would up using essential oils to stop the bleeding.  Good to have around for when you run out of cartridge razors.  Perhaps I just need more practice.</li>
    <li> I find these to be the best blades for my face. They cut close without pulling and I rarely get in-grown hairs or razor bumps as compared to other blades I have tried (Shark, various Gillette, Merkur, etc).</li>
    <li> These are very sharp but provide a very smooth shave if used correctly.</li>
    <li> Well ... Even when they r dull , they&#x27;re sharp. I like the shave it gives, don&#x27;t be scared of the cut yourself rumors. You will cut yourself! It&#x27;s not a rumor but are u after the closest smoothest greatest possible shave ever. U will get it! Just go slow and take medium to short strokes all about technique. And enjoy. Only negative I can say, pet peeve of mine, when u claim an item is in stock I don&#x27;t expect it to take a long time to ship. Especially from whatever foreign country it came from. Packaging said so. We (customers) expect it to be shipped if it&#x27;s in stock ...not international shipping which takes longer. Technically that&#x27;s not in stock... It&#x27;s at a sub contractors warehouse awaiting purchase. Anyway thanx</li>
    <li> These blades are sharper than most&lt;br /&gt;These blades they shave, they shave close&lt;br /&gt;No other brand I&#x27;ve tried can compete&lt;br /&gt;Helps my face stay clean and neat&lt;br /&gt;With my Edwin jagger in hand&lt;br /&gt;Double edged razors I am now a fan</li>
    <li> Good, sharp razor blades. Works well for me.</li>
    <li> My favorite DE blade.  Very sharp.</li>
    <li> Good buy on a good product</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time, but these are real feather blades, and the value was IMMENSE.</li>
    <li> I have to change the blades every 3rd shave, I have daily. Other than that, they get the job done!</li>
    <li> It is impossible for me to get a completely smooth shave unless I go against the grain, but I don&#x27;t do this because it irritates my face too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving with the grain I can definitely tell a difference between the Feathers and the Merkur blades, the Feathers are much smoother. The Merkurs required me to do at least 2 passes to get an acceptable shave, with the Feathers I can get away with just doing 1 pass and being fine (althought I still do 2 just because).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the end result between both blades is about the same. If you&#x27;re like me and cannot achieve a completely smooth save with the other blades (shaving with the grain) do not expect the Feathers to magically start doing so.</li>
    <li> After hearing that people react differently to blades I thought I would put myself through a blind trial of a few different brands to figure out if I could tell the difference.  I tried four different blades: Personna, Feather, Gillette Silver Blues, and a generic brand I picked up from Rite Aid.  I had my wife swap the blades out after shaving with each twice.  I kept track of the results and found the Feather blades were the second best overall for me.  The Silver Blues won out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather blades were probably the sharpest and offered a very good overall shave but I tended to have a couple extra nicks and cuts at the end than I did with the Silver Blues.  Not a major issue and it can probably be attributed to technique but if I had to pick one I&#x27;d pick Silver Blues.</li>
    <li> Best double edge blades I&#x27;ve used so far.  I have tried multiple brands and keep coming back to Feather&#x27;s.  Do yourself a favor and purchase a sample pack of blades to find the right ones for your beard and skin.</li>
    <li> Started off with one of the combo packs to try the common blade options available.  These blades easily outperforms everyone I&#x27;ve tried.  Shaves closer and lasts longer.  You will easily save the extra cost of these blades by getting twice as many shaves from them.</li>
    <li> Holds a nice sharp edge for at least 5 shaves- I&#x27;m picky so I change them after 5 shaves-- Overall, I think these are my favorite blades.</li>
    <li> Very sharp ! My husband&#x27;s favorite blade for shaving!~</li>
    <li> I agree with everyone else it is about the sharpest blade around.  If you have an adjustable, set it mild at first as it will cut skin promptly on settings higher than 5.</li>
    <li> Finally something thats sharp enough</li>
    <li> If you wet shave, buy the best razor-blades. Feather all the way. I have a sensitive face and since I switched to wet shaving i now longer get razor burn even though I shave well every day. I have tried other blades but Feather blades are the best. Get a large pack and you only have to buy them once a year.</li>
    <li> Feather blades are exceptional against ANY blades from the store, saftey and multi-blade varieties included</li>
    <li> Good blades - but too sharp.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, and very durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the major brands of blade, and these are simply the sharpest. I have a VERY thick/dense beard, and these are the only blades that aren&#x27;t painful/tug my beard hair.  I&#x27;m replacing them every 4-5 shaves, but again, I have a freakishly thick beard, so most people should get far better life from them.</li>
    <li> I dont expect them to last forever, but these only last 2 sessions.  If thats by design, then they are working according to design.  I bought them hoping to get a better shave and perhaps making my razors last longer.  No luck.  Back to Gillette M-3 for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of DE blades that I have tried. These work good but they aren&#x27;t for my face. They are actually too sharp for my face and the Merkur blades seem to be better for me. When I shave with these blades I always end up with about 4 spots bleeding. That doesn&#x27;t happen with the Merkur blades and I am sure it just all depends on your skin. I knew from reading other reviews that these were sharper and figured sharper was better. Not so in this case and I think you have to personally try them to see if they fit you. I have a mans face and don&#x27;t have the smooth baby faced skin like the new metro sexual generation.</li>
    <li> Great Blades, Ordered from Amazon. Bought other Feather blades, shipped from a company in Thailand, went right in to the garbage they were so dull. Those must have been fakes.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Very sharp razors. It&#x27;s always a good feeling when you open a fresh new blade knowing your about to get a great shave out of it.</li>
    <li> Great for a very coarse beard. No tugging with this blade. Use a light touch! Extremely sharp.</li>
    <li> Excellent Blades. Sharpest and highest quality I have tried.  Close smooth shave every single time without fail. Excellent blade manufacture and quality control.  This is even more apparent when comparing SEM images of various blades from different manufacturers.</li>
    <li> It shaves very well. Lasts a long time. Better than any blade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I think this review is most important for new users of Safety Razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every blade company&#x27;s blades are going to treat your face a little different. These blades are excellently priced and will be the blades I continue to purchase. They just seem to treat my face right and cut smoother than other brands. The sound they make as they cut the hairs on my face give excellent feedback while I shave and these blades are probably easily good for four to five shaves. I currently toss mine at three shaves. Three incidents of shaving. Each incident of shaving has two to three passes with the blades, so take that into account.</li>
    <li> I have facial hair which does not grow in thick, but the hairs are coarse. These blades are very sharp. They will simply glide through the facial hair without even feeling resistance. I can get at least 2 good weeks out of one of these blades, so a 30-pack will last me more than 1 year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a while now and I&#x27;ve tried most of the major brands. Feather blades are without a doubt the sharpest I&#x27;ve tried and will give the absolutely closest shave... But that&#x27;s where my praise ends. My facial hairs are very thick and coarse and grow in very densely on my neck. Unfortunately that leads to me only getting 2 shaves at best from a Feather razor blade. Sometimes, I have to switch blades in the middle of the 2nd shave because the blade was pulling so badly. They&#x27;re very sharp, but they just don&#x27;t hold an edge like some of the other brands and that&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t be using them as my every day blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep some around for special occasions where I want the absolute closest shave possible, but it&#x27;s just not cost effective to have to keep changing the blade every 1-2 days. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Astra Stainless for that reason. Not quite as sharp, but it&#x27;s sharp enough to give me a close shave and those last 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> just like advertise nice and sharp.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the other reviews.... These are NOT too sharp to use. These are the only ones I have ever used and the first I have tried since my Mach III days. Very good blades.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other brands (Derby &amp; Astra).  Each time I returned to the Feather&#x27;s.  They give a really great shave with no nicks.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades. I&#x27;m new to double edged shaving. My dad shaved that way when I was a kid, but he was eventually drawn to the dark side of disposable razors. I never even knew better. I made the switch earlier this year and will never look back. These feathers are the sharpest of the three or four brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Sharpest Blade available. Tried others and nothing compares. I have let several friends try one and their response was to place an order.</li>
    <li> Do not buy any other blade these are the only ones that last threw multiple shavers and work more evenly.</li>
    <li> I tried the Murkur blades as well (good), but these are so sharp and give such a shave as I&#x27;ve never had before. Almost effortless and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have used this product once before and really enjoyed the smoothness of the cut. I would caution those with sensitive skin in buying these in bulk first but to but a variety pack to find the right razor for your skin type.</li>
    <li> I shave 3 - 4 times a week and change blades every week. Feather Double Edge bladed give a close shave and hold up pretty well for the entire week.</li>
    <li> Love these blades. The seller thou is another things. Took over a month to get them from China. I will keep buying these, but from a local source.</li>
    <li> My hubby&#x27;s face is as smooth as the baby&#x27;s bottom. Thanks</li>
    <li> If you are buying double edge razor blades for the first time, try a sampler pack before you buy a large amount of one type of blade. That being said, I like using the Feathers in my less aggressive razors. The sharpness of the Feather seems to compliment them and give me a great shave.</li>
    <li> In my search for the perfect blade, I tried these. Having a coarse beard, i thought these would be just the ticket as Feathers carry a reputation for being the sharpest you can buy. I found the blades themselves to be much thicker than most and the sharpness just average. Considering the price, about 3X as expensive as Astra Platinums, I was not impressed. Being that these are made in Japan, it was odd that they shipped from China. Perhaps they are counterfeit?</li>
    <li> The sharpest and best double edge blade out there hands down.  You will get the closest shave with these!</li>
    <li> Best double edge blades, period. Shave slow if you haven&#x27;t used, but once you get used to them, you will not go back to others. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 is the time delay in receiving. It takes weeks to get them in and I have had an order that I never received, so that is frustrating. But the end product is solid.</li>
    <li> Feathers are sharp do not be afraid</li>
    <li> Very reasonably price and cut my heavy beard well.</li>
    <li> I love the feather blades. I use it with my Merkur razor. I initially used the blades that came with Merkur but they didn&#x27;t seem as sharp and I probably pressed too hard and cut myself. With these blades I don&#x27;t use any pressure at all and I get an extremely close shave. The package has a really great design as well. You take the packaged blades out from the top. When you are finished with the blade you &amp;#34;dispose&amp;#34; of it on the other side of the plastic box. It has a little slot that holds the blades for safe disposal. I hope you try these blades.</li>
    <li> Had only been using Derby so I tried Feather to see if they were as good as everybody said.  Well, they are!  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Seriously sharp, my only complaint would be delivery was a slow boat from Thailand, literally, a slow boat from Thailand. Great product though and would order again.</li>
    <li> If you are just starting out wet shaving DO NOT buy a big package of these.  Everyone&#x27;s skin and technique is different.  Buy a sampler pack with a few blades of various brands in there and try them all, then try them all again as your technique improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a variety of DE blades from an Amazon sampler pack, I initially disliked the Feathers (they gave a very close shave but I nicked myself repeatedly, they are SHARP!).  After a few months time and refining a lighter handed approach, I revisited the box of Feathers I had from the sampler pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They quickly became my favorite, as there is no sharper blade on the market and while a little more expensive than some of the others, they are still much cheaper than any cartridge razor refill.  Perhaps its the platinum coating but they also seem to last longer than any of the dozens of other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  My beard is very thick and coarse with some flat hairs so I usually dull blades faster than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 30 pack and they came packed very well, in a thick zip bag.  The feather box itself is higher quality than some brands, and the blades are wrapped in wax paper and there is a bit of wax sealing the paper shut and covering the blade (a bit different than most other blade wrapping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and try as many blades as you can, then try out these very sharp, ultra high quality ones.  I think you&#x27;ll be impressed.</li>
    <li> Not for the the novice double edge shaver.  Keep the styptic pencil handy because these are going to give one close shave shave.  Only down side is I only get two really good shaves out of a blade and maybe two more so so shaves.</li>
    <li> Nice blade..with other brands i used this one is smooth like a feather on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Apply some oil on your face before you shave and its really smooth</li>
    <li> After trying many different blades, I have decided to just use feather DE blades.&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp and initially, when I did not know any better, I kept on cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;If you are careful and apply very light pressure, these blades slice the hair right off, without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend pre-shave lotion (such as Proraso Pre-Shave Cream) to make your shaving experience a lot more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, after switching Feathers from the No name brand that came with my Razor, I am now getting the closest smoothest shave ever. These are exceptionally sharp and surprisingly they retain a really sharp edge even after several shaves, recommended.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get here but the merchandise works well. Have a wonderful week and may God bless you always.</li>
    <li> What can be said? Feather makes the sharpest, holds-an-edge-longer, razor on the the market. Second place would go to the German Merkur brand, but Feather reigns supreme. Clearly worth the very small extra money.</li>
    <li> Were recommended by my oldest son.  They really give a great shave.  No 5 oclock shadow! I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I recently went back to wet shaving after using an electric razor for a while, and then a Gillette Fusion razor.  I was glad that I did, and used some Astra blades I didn&#x27;t use up previously.  However, I was always curious about the Feather blades, from my previous run with my straight razor and ordered 30 blades.  My razor is a Merkur adjustable razor, and I set it at 1.5 and shaved my head.  I was careful, and got the best shave of my life with these.  I obviously will need to see how they will do on my face in the morning, but I expect the same results with a careful hand.  Barring problems with my face, I will use Feather blades from now on.  I did not cut myself tonight, and these did not irritate my scalp either.</li>
    <li> Definitely sharper than the sharks.  They&#x27;re not sharp to the point where it&#x27;s problematic, but you do have to be extra careful.  These blades are high quality.</li>
    <li> These are quite possibly the sharpest blades available. Be careful with them! They are a little too harsh for my skin though. Packaging is very nice as they come in a plastic box with a blade disposal slot.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the reputation of the sharpest blade keep you from trying these out! My face was being butchered by other brands. I use the Feathers in a Merkur Futur and a Muhle 89R - love them - no nicks! Everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
    <li> Some of the best blades I&#x27;ve used for my thick hair. I&#x27;ve tried Shark blades and Astra blades but always go back to these Feather blades as they give me the closest shave with the least irritation.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, but can be slightly aggressive to the skin if not careful.  I think I prefer the Personna in the blue box to these blades, but I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good, but definitely not as sharp as people claim. I have a very coarse and curly beard and these blades become dull very quickly. I don&#x27;t cut myself at all while using these blades like many claim...I think some people need to relearn how to properly shave.</li>
    <li> blades worked very well, sharp and effective, but the packaging was a hassle to unwarp, and place on razor with out risking cuts.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday to wet shave with my Merkur safety razor. These blades are sharp, smooth, and deliver a great close shave. They hold an edge for several shaves (for me, YMMV), and they are my go-to recommendations.</li>
    <li> I use these in rotation with Merkur blades as my 2 main blades for shaving my face &amp; head and have been for 10+ years now.&lt;br /&gt;  I often try packs of other brands but find these two are my main stays. They seem much sharper than the Merkur blades but if you have been DE shaving awhile you know sharpness isnt everything.&lt;br /&gt;  The old saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; applies here for sure, they are a consistent performer, blade to blade, pack to pack.&lt;br /&gt;  Try a pack, I think you will come back!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, sharper than any other blades I&#x27;ve used; lasts a long time before it needs to be changed. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Chose 4 stars instead of 5 stars because the blades were just a little too thin and not quite as sturdy as my previous Gillette blades....  HOWEVER , since it is virtually (pun intended!) impossible to buy double edge blades in any retail store, I was THRILLED to find these through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon - don&#x27;t know what I would do without you!!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the performance of the blades.  I did not get the smooth, clean shape I am used to.</li>
    <li> If you have switched back to double-edge shaving like I did, I do recommend this brand. According to various web sites on shaving, this is one of the sharpest blades available and the quality is extremely high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: Very sharp and comfortable. Mine lasts about 5 days of shaving. It comes in a plastic case with blade disposal slot. You can safely dispose blades this way. The overall cost is much lower than cartridges and also more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; as much less stuff I am throwing away than the cartridge systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No problems or issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to learn how to shave with double-edge blades and need to invest in high quality handles (or become a collector of them). It can take a bit of time for your skins to get used to the new method.</li>
    <li> Works great nice and sharp and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I would recommend to anyone requiring double edged razors.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. But don&#x27;t last as long as others.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample pack to try out different blades because I am new to double edged shaving.  I am using these in a feather popular razor ( cheep but very effective) I will never go back to disposable razors  The feathers are by far the best in this razor. I tried one of the sharks and threw the rest away</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say much more about these razors that hasn&#x27;t already been said so I will focus on the seller. I ordered Feather Double Edge razors from another vendor on amazon and was sent the wrong one (they had a silver label instead of the yellow). Needless to say I was disappointed and returning it was useless as they were in Thailand. I ordered 100 of them and the few I used were terrible so naturally I was hesitant to order another large quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to say this seller didn&#x27;t disappoint and send me the razors that they advertised. Great product and great seller.</li>
    <li> A bit slow on delivery but great product and exactly what I needed at a GREAT price-Thank you!</li>
    <li> These blades can Cut,for sure as a good samurai blades!&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#x27;t like them because any time i do the second pass over the hairs...i end all chopped and bleeding..so its my skin ? Probably yes!</li>
    <li> Provide a more traditional shave-------Back to the 50&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are very sharp and efficient--------Be careful when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for several months and have found them to really work well...better than some others I have tried.</li>
    <li> These by far are the best blades I have ever used.  Once I got used to them I found I actually cut myself less than the blades I was getting at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> One of the sharpest single razor blade razors I ever used.  Teamed with Murker Slant Razor extremely close shave.</li>
    <li> Great price. Supper sharp.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. Don&#x27;t even bother with the cheap drug store/wally world brands. Spend the money on these and never miss the overpriced new fangled plastic multi-razors.</li>
    <li> Provided the smoothest, and most comfortable shave</li>
    <li> these blades are seriously sharp, and just an all around good blade! from beginner to life time shaver, the only downside is it takes like a month to get to you...kinda sucks when ya need them soon.....</li>
    <li> A little too sharp in my Merkur Futur.</li>
    <li> as always, Feathers are simply the best</li>
    <li> Was expecting these blades to be sharp, but they jump and pull.  Can barely get one shave out of these.  Tried blades from multiple packages, consistently dull.</li>
    <li> Shipping took over a month but it was a great deal and these are great blades</li>
    <li> Great razor blades. Came in about four weeks. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Amazingly sharp! Awesome blades, but be careful if you are a beginner!</li>
    <li> Blades came in 5-packs not 10-packs as pictured, but other than that everything went great with my order.</li>
    <li> The sharpest blade there is.</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp. Not for the beginner. Upgraded to these from Shark Super Chrome blades and there is a noticeable difference. These are the best razors that I have ever used for my safety razor.</li>
    <li> Was what was advertised and are consistently the very best DE blade out there.</li>
    <li> These razor blades are great! They last for many many shaves and the magazine design is really cool. This is my first time using such razors as I recently switched to the Merkur safety razor, but I was pleasantly surprised with the used razor slot on the back.</li>
    <li> I have used about 4 different brands of razor blades.  These feather blades are in a class all of there own and absolutely the best blades I have ever used!</li>
    <li> search no longer for the bet blade on the market!</li>
    <li> Feather blades are sharp and smooth for me, and they last me about 6 or 7 shaves with my light beard growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says they&#x27;re the sharpest, and of the blades I&#x27;ve tried they are. I wouldn&#x27;t start with Feather blades, but if you have some practice and your technique down I recommend you try them. Lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Good Blades. I like them and they do a good job</li>
    <li> I heard that these were the best in the market as far as DE razors go and that is the truth. After using these razors I can honestly say that they have given me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. If this is your first time using double edge razors you might want be carefully because these are pretty sharp and you can cut yourself very easy. The only thing I did not like about the product is the wait time. It took a month to get these because they have to be ordered from overseas. But it is worth the wait. I plan to buy this again regardless of the wait.</li>
    <li> Love the razors, shipping form the vendor I ordered from took over a month...</li>
    <li> Got my Feather blades on time yesterday.  I shaved with them for the first time this morning with my Jager 89Bl and it is a great pairing. They are definitely sharper and shave cleaner. I have been using the Persona Blues and they are really good blades and I learned the proper shaving technique with them over 3 weeks. I was careful I must admit with the Feather after reading how sharp they were and made sure I used proper technique with them and had no problems. With 2 passes I had the same bbs cheeks it took the Personsa 3 passes to achieve, with, across, and against the grain. With the Feather I went with and across and I was just as smooth. Great blades if used properly or if you do not have the sensitive skin issues I read about. Wish they were not so much more expensive than the Persona. 30 Feathers were in the ball park of 100 Persona blues. I will see how many shaves I can comfortably get from each blade and decide at that point which to stick with. The Feathers are definitely great blades.</li>
    <li> These razors are so sharp they make an 8 piece suit look dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, these are some awesome razors.</li>
    <li> Super sharp! They also hold their edge very well. I usually replace my blade every two weeks or so, and I shave every two to three days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used maybe a dozen different DE brands, many of them quite good. But it is true that Feather is in a class by itself. Some find it too sharp, evidently. In my classic Gillette razors, they are perfect. Next best, IMHO, is Astra Platinum, and equally good is the Israeli Personna.</li>
    <li> These last a few days for me. Longer than I would have guessed for how incredibly sharp they are.</li>
    <li> Its sharp!  The edge holds longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever used.  I keep trying others periodically but always come back to feather.  I have been liking the blue Gillette&#x27;s lately as they have a very consistent shave for a week or more bit even initially, they are not nearly as sharp as the feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use a EJ DE89L, though I have also had some success with the open comb FA TIP. Although you must entirely devote your attention to correct angle when using a feather with an open comb.  I like the Feather most with the EJ and my Merkur HD</li>
    <li> These have got to be the sharpest, cleanest shaving, blades available.  I started shaving with a safety razor, then converted to an electric.  Now I&#x27;m back to a safety razor and Feather blades make anything else I&#x27;ve used or tried look like dull butter knives.  They last a while, too.  I get about three weeks out of a blade which makes them very economical.  I do wash and dry the razor and blades after each use, which seems to help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a really close, smooth, shave from a safety razor, give these a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Sharp, lovely blades!</li>
    <li> These blades seem to work well with my Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor. Definitely worth trying out. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these in the future. Each case of ten has the standard feature of a slot on the bottom for used blades, (something some brands do not have).</li>
    <li> Very sharp but don&#x27;t last as long as the Personna&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Best blades ever bit crazy sharp!</li>
    <li> Quite honestly I was almost afraid to use these after reading some reviews...however, 3 months later and no nicks. Oh, and my Gillette Fusion provides a much closer shave, admittedly at a higher price.</li>
    <li> Stupid sharp razor!  These are the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere and I typically get a full week of shaving out of a blade before I notice a little dullness or tug from the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for those who like a quick shave or shaving while half asleep.  You have to pay attention!</li>
    <li> Six packages of five blades, seems a bit ridiculous, but the came in a timely manner and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I was a little afraid of using these because of all the reviews I read about them being the sharpest blades on the planet. OK they are. I have been using Merkur and sharps. I tried Derby and got razor burn, tried Wilkinson , they didn&#x27;t work so good. I have been wet shaving for quite a few years using a brush and cream, but I have been using Mach3 Turbo&#x27;s and one, their super expensive and two you don.t get a good shave, so I decided to go to DE and what a difference. I used the Feather first time this morning and got the best shave ever. With the Merkur, I would make three passes. One down, one up and one cross and still have a few spots that had to be gone over and over to get clean. For this I used the good old Mach3 to avoid cutting myself. With the Feather, three passes and a BSS shave nothing left over. I used the blade in my Muhle closed comb. I might be a little reluctant to trying one in my Joris open tooth comb because it is very aggressive no mater what blade you use. What I&#x27;m finding is that blades are very different and the razor you use them in changes the performance also. So if your new to DE shaving like me , experiment, try different blades and different style razors, but don&#x27;t let all the hype on feather blades scare you away. Their great , just be careful, lets face it all razor blades are sharp. watch the you tube video&#x27;s on shaving. Got a lot of great tips from Mantic59 and Geofatboy. These guys are pro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second day update, used the Feather blade in open tooth razor today, got a couple of small nicks but still got a super close shave. I think the nicks may be me not being careful enough. The open tooth razor leaves a lot more blade exposure that I think makes it the closest to a straight razor. So I may go back to the Merkur in the open tooth and stick with the feather in the closed comb. One other thing, three passes with the closed and only two passes with the open,just one WTG and one ATG no cross needed. Super blades. Be carefulguy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does make a difference . Going to stick with the Feather in the closed comb and the merkur in the open. If you rotate your razors and are new to double edge wet shaving like me , experiment experiment experiment,  big differences, but great shaving. Also a good pre shave oil helps and washing first with a glycerin soap helps to get a close, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> These things are too sharp.  I get razor burn with them and hacked to bits when using Feather&#x27;s cheap $20 razor.  Not for me,</li>
    <li> After all the hype on shaving blogs and other reviews about how sharp these are and they&#x27;re are the best that money can buy, I was disappointed. These blades caused a lot of brush burn and did not shave me that close without pain. The higher price tag was the last nail in the coffin. Personna Blue pack and Dorco Red pack worked best for me. The fact that they are more affordable and the Personna&#x27;s are made in the USA, rendered them my best choice.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades for my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor and am very pleased. They fit the razor perfectly. I have been replacing the blade about once a week, shaving every other day. I have not tried to see how long they last before going dull, but they could probably handle a few more shaves. I would recommend a quality shaving cream to go along with the quality razor.</li>
