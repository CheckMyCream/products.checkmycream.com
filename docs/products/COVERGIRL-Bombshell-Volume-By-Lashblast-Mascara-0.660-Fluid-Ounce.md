### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
      <li>not soap, not lotion, not even the best makeup remover!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just perfect</li>
      <li>it is awesome</li>
      <li>It does not clump and it curves your eyelashes perfectly!</li>
      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>is an awesome find.  </li>
      <li>For me, having mascara that stayed on sounded ideal.</li>
      <li>After some work the end result is beautiful.</li>
      <li>I used to have lots of beautiful lashes.</li>
      <li>: when this mascara is good it&#x27;s very very good,</li>
      <li>The mascara stayed on all day and looked great.</li>
      <li>Great mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Covergirl makes a lot of great products, but this is not one of them.</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>So all in all a good mascara but...</li>
      <li>Good luck getting this off your lashes.</li>
      <li>It does not come off (and not in a good, waterproof way).</li>
      <li>the mascara seems to be good quality.</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t be good for eyes for mascara to stay on for days and trying to remove it takes some eyelashes with it.</li>
      <li>It also has incredibly good staying power and it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>They still aren&#x27;t any good.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t even a good mascara when you applied it.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s is probably why it wears so good.</li>
      <li>and I saw this one with a couple good coupons</li>
      <li>This mascara gives both nice volume and great length.</li>
      <li>And good luck if you smudge it while applying because  not even waterproof makeup remover will get this junk</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with it and couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even make my eyelashes look that great when I had it on, as my eyelashes were mostly stuck together.</li>
      <li>Is a great mÃ¡scara its easy to take off is really good ðŸ˜„</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Use at your own risk.</li>
      <li>Go figure it was CGs own website</li>
      <li>The 2 in 1 looks nice and all</li>
      <li>This one not only works great and look great, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>; Yes, I said glue because that is precisely what it is!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you already have mascara you like, this probably won&#x27;t be any better than what your using.</li>
      <li>though it looked okay</li>
      <li>So it was like I was just gluing them even more.</li>
      <li>It is much better than this.</li>
      <li>and then a department store mascara over the top of it.  </li>
      <li>Hours after application, my top and bottom lashes were still getting stuck together.</li>
      <li>Most of them Irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>I felt that most of my lashes were just clumped together.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Again, there are better options to achieve the look this mascara advertises that it does</li>
      <li>Many of them are falling out in the effort to get this tar off.</li>
      <li>After about 10 minutes of rubbing I was able to remove it all.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled and so excited to put on the second-stage coat.</li>
      <li>I received this Product from Influenster!!&lt;br /&gt;I liked it because the little brush is perfect for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many cheap mascaras before</li>
      <li>dont use mascara very often, but I loved this stuff..</li>
      <li>The smudges came off easily with a</li>
      <li>Removal wasn&#x27;t easy either.  </li>
      <li>This mascara is OK but the lashblast by covergirl is better, it was fun to try out</li>
      <li>I have applied both steps, and i have applied just the first and this product doesn&#x27;t do anything amazing to my lashes.</li>
      <li>Normally cover girl mascara works good</li>
      <li>I needed to use a combination of makeup remover, vaseline and coconut oil in order to get most it off, but even then, I&#x27;&#x27;m pretty sure that some still remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super  toxic!</li>
      <li>but rather they cause huge clumps of my lashes to stick together</li>
      <li>But since it was free for testing purposes i will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>mascara that is not longer available.</li>
      <li>I recieved this product for free from Influenster in my Surfs Up Vox Box</li>
      <li>so I was so excited when I received this mascara from Influenster to try out.</li>
      <li>and i felt that this didn&#x27;t do anything special for me.</li>
      <li>mascara will work for me for special occasions.</li>
      <li>A top coat of another mascara would probably accomplish what I want, but that almost seems to be too much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Loved how my eyelashes looked after applying but wont come off until several days after.  </li>
      <li>the look of wet and made up lashes looked actually very nice.</li>
      <li>Luckily I had waterproof make up remover on hand.  </li>
      <li>Finally got most of it off along with most of my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I then washed with mild soap and water, nope, still there.  </li>
      <li>When it came time to remove the mascara, I rinsed my face in hot water, and lightly rubbed/massaged olive oil on my lashes with my fingers.</li>
      <li>When it clumps I just run the tube under hot water and it goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>what I should of done in the first place!</li>
      <li>I now have no more beautiful lashes.</li>
      <li>I saw one user had success with baby oil...which made me think to use coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
      <li>I received it in my surfs up voxbox complimentary of influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>After using Neutrogena make up remover (which I have always had success with no matter what mascara I&#x27;m using) as well as</li>
      <li>First off I used wand #1, not bad, But as soon as I applied #2, everything clumped.  </li>
      <li>It is not labeled as waterproof but holds better than many other waterproof mascaras.</li>
      <li>It came right off without any issues.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The second-step mascara is thick and sticky, and made my beautiful newly-discovered lashes clump together in a nightmare of blobby viscosity.</li>
      <li>With a lot of manipulation using various makeup tools I was able to make my eyes look presentable, somewhat anyway.  </li>
      <li>My first use was with side 2.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had a reaction with mascara</li>
      <li>;, the first listing that popped up had it rated at over 4 stars ...</li>
      <li>Thanks ladies!</li>
      <li>At first, it seemed like it gave my lashes volume.</li>
      <li>It was on my eyes for 2 days the first time, through 2 showers, makeup wipes, and liquid eye makeup remover- didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
      <li>First off lets talk about its packaging.  </li>
      <li>I would more than likely not purchase.</li>
      <li>The first thing the Dr asked me was if I had tried a \\&quot;new\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I had to sit with two hot tea bags on my eyes to also help get it off.</li>
      <li>First, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between sides #1 &amp; #2.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t see it being a good everyday product.</li>
      <li>I suspect the positive reviews are people who haven&#x27;t taken it off yet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes much longer</li>
    <li> Worst product I have ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes stuck together.  It is basically impossible to remove and when you do, your eyelashes fall out! ;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Covergirl for releasing this crap!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2648553/A-chunk-eyelashes-fell-Covergirl-fire-woman-releases-photos-damage-caused-removing-Bombshell-mascara.html</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not trying to be a pessimist; I just want to warn you so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did! Save the $10 and DO NOT buy this product! It is a HUGE WASTE of money! It is SO STICKY, it SMUDGES ALL OVER ABOVE AND BELOW YOUR EYES, and worst of all, it RIPS OUT YOUR EYELASHES!!! You can see the HORRIBLE BREAKAGE in the photo! It is nearly impossible to remove; it is SO PAINFUL that it took very strong soap and SCRUBBING that chapped my eyelids to get this GARBAGE off! I used to trust Cover Girl, but I will NEVER buy their mascara again! I even tried this mascara a second time to give it another chance, and the same things happened again!</li>
    <li> I actually want to buy this make up because it won&#x27;t come off!! Thanks ladies! My mom has been shelling out $50 for the old &amp;#34;Marathon&amp;#34; mascara that is not longer available. I hope this does the trick because she likes her make up to stay on for days and never come off just so she can sit and pick it off. LOL!</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible! It&#x27;s like freakin glue! Impossible to get off. I tried everything gently rubbing downward with q-tips and half my lashes are gone now. DO NOT BUY OR TRY!</li>
    <li> This mascara is OK but the lashblast by covergirl is better, it was fun to try out but I would save your money and stick to the classic.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes clumped together even when only using one coat. Happened with both brushes used separately on both of my eyes. Make up wipes wouldn&#x27;t remove it. Baby oil hardly did the trick. Once I applied the mascara and once it dried it actually HURT my eyelids. The majority of my eyelashes fell out. Weird. Stick to normal non-flashy mascara. Save your money.</li>
    <li> My usual makeup routine is to use CoverGirl&#x27;s Lash Blast (the orange one) and then a department store mascara over the top of it.  I needed a new tube of CoverGirl and I saw this one with a couple good coupons so I decided to try it.  So far, I really like it!  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and I don&#x27;t really find that I need to use the high end mascara to get the length I want. There are two brushes: step 1 is a rubbery, stubby brush for volume and step 2 is a long bristly brush to lengthen and separate your lashes.  After using it, my eyelashes look thick and long.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that I don&#x27;t think it holds curl as well as the Lash Blast Waterproof.</li>
    <li> This stuff is impossible to remove. Zero stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how Cover Girl can put out a product so bad. I&#x27;m steering clear of them from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is day 2. A couple showers later, and at least 10 face washes with all kinds of soaps, and it&#x27;s still caked on my lashes. Many of them are falling out in the effort to get this tar off. I imagine if someone uses this for a few weeks, they&#x27;d have no lashes left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also the size of a small fire extinguisher.</li>
    <li> I never read reviews on makeup products, especially wouldn&#x27;t think to do so from a brand I regularly use. I was looking for something to make my blonde, barely there lashes stand out and boy, oh boy, is this something else.  First off, as other reviewers have said; the design is difficult to use, very awkward and I almost poked myself in the eye using side one.  My first use was with side 2.  It left my lashes clumpy and some even stuck to my eyelid, I don&#x27;t even know how that is possible.  With a lot of manipulation using various makeup tools I was able to make my eyes look presentable, somewhat anyway.  Later, when I went to use my makeup remover I was shocked it wouldn&#x27;t come off, I didn&#x27;t realize it was waterproof.  I then washed with mild soap and water, nope, still there.  I went out and bought a more expensive makeup remover and it still wouldn&#x27;t come off.  Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t have to reapply my mascara for DAYS.  I don&#x27;t have enough lashes to scrub hard enough to risk losing them, through daily face washing and showers the mascara eventually did come off.    When I was ready to try it again I vowed not to use side 2.  Side 1, while still awkward to put on was a bit easier to apply.  It went on much smoother and in my opinion is usable in a pinch, but I will be replacing it the next chance I get.  It washes off with my remover and doesn&#x27;t clump, so on days I don&#x27;t need to go public this might be my go to house mascara until it&#x27;s time to pitch.    I&#x27;m giving this a 2 rating for the limited usage, however if you spend a lot of time in the water, you can get it to apply properly and not run this is an awesome find.  However, I never used it this way and with luck chlorine is probably the only thing that would remove it since nothing else I tried did.    Use at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I returned it the next day. It will not come off even using make up remover, and actually causes eye lashes to stick together. It didn&#x27;t even make my eyelashes look that great when I had it on, as my eyelashes were mostly stuck together. If you do buy this mascara, prepare to spend at least a half hour trying to get it all off.</li>
    <li> First off lets talk about its packaging.  The container is to big, the wand with the brushes are to short, and I hit my nose every time I tried to apply it.  First off I used wand #1, not bad, But as soon as I applied #2, everything clumped.  I then tried to remove the mascara off! It does not state waterproof, and regular make up remover did not make a dent in it.  Luckily I had waterproof make up remover on hand.  Lets just say it took me about twenty minutes to get this crap off.  Second several of my eye lashes came off with it.  I finally gave up, and even days after I could still feel the waxy mascara on some of the lashes.  It took me about a week to get it all off.  I will not use this product again.  I was very disappointed since I love Covergirl make up.  This one seems to be TOXIC!~</li>
    <li> I used it several times and it never really seemed to come off completely. I tried several different makeup remover products that have always seemed to work for other mascara and it would  not work for this one.</li>
    <li> I had been dying to try this mascara so I was so excited when I received this mascara from Influenster to try out. While I didn&#x27;t absolutely hate the mascara, I didn&#x27;t love it either. At first, it seemed like it gave my lashes volume. Before my lashes dried, they began sticking together and were tacky before drying. After they dried, they had a crunchy texture. It definitely had staying power and lasted all day. Removing took a little work, but with oil free eye makeup remover, but came off just fine. I probably would not buy this mascara again.</li>
    <li> Loved how my eyelashes looked after applying but wont come off until several days after.  It started flaking off and ruining one my contacts bc it stuck on it as well.  My left eye swelled up, oozing tears and is now blood shot.  Will not be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I have been stuck with this mascara (GLUE) literally STUCK on my lashes for almost a week! I tried soap and makeup wipes repeatedly with NO sign of it budging. By today my eyelashes were a gooped mess! I googled this product to see if anyone else had this issue and if so how they removed it. I found TONS of awful reviews on this exact same thing happening. I saw one user had success with baby oil...which made me think to use coconut oil. Well...30 mins later, 2 sore (oil soaked) over rubbed eyes and down some eyelashes the poor excuse for a product is almost off my eyelashes. How this is still on the market is beyond me!! In the 18 years I&#x27;ve been buying mascara this has NEVER come close to happening to me. Shame on you Covergirl for continuing to sell this product. You have lost a customer for life!</li>
    <li> the mascara seems to be good quality. The design of the tube makes it very difficult to apply. I would more than likely not purchase. I received this through influenster.</li>
    <li> This mascara gives both nice volume and great length. I was very impressed with it and couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with the results. It also has incredibly good staying power and it doesn&#x27;t flake. In fact it has so much staying power that I almost gave it four stars because it is difficult to remove. I couldn&#x27;t remove it all with my makeup wipes and had to wash with soap and water a couple of times. I lost a couple of eyelashes in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the packaging and it does not say it is waterproof or &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; mascara. However, in fine print on the back, it does say &amp;#34;Removes with Covergirl Makeup Remover.&amp;#34; So you may want to consider that if you buy this mascara. I give it five stars for the luscious lashes it gives me, but I will only use it when I need mascara that is long-lasting. For me this probably won&#x27;t be an everyday mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! Only problem is that it&#x27;s hard to remove. And I always have issues opening them one at a time.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I love it! It does not clump and it curves your eyelashes perfectly! I wore this mascara today and someone asked if I was wearing falsies! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time with many mascaras. Most of them Irritate my eyes. This one not only works great and look great, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I rarely wrote reviews but this mascara is awful. Normally cover girl mascara works good but this one is the total opposite. First of all the number two side became very difficult to open because they open opposite ways and you can&#x27;t get a grip on it, second it doesn&#x27;t say water proof but it took me two makeup remover wipes, soap and hot water, lotion, and nearly ripping half of my eye lashes out to remove. Defiantly would not recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;ve bought many cheap mascaras before but I can say this has been the absolute worst &amp; it costed me $9.99 a tube.</li>
    <li> This mascara is horrible. I generally use water soluble mascara and have recently switched to waterproof but most mascaras do come off with soap and water and a little elbow grease. This mascara made my eyes feel glued shut on the corners and it was also heavy on my lashes. It was difficult to remove but also got into my eye during the removal process and took 15 minutes to flush out with saline. My eye was red and irritated. I&#x27;m going to go back to my Revlon asap!</li>
    <li> The design on the tube/brushes is awful, it&#x27;s so big and clunky in your hand it makes it hard to apply and get all the little lashes. And good luck if you smudge it while applying because  not even waterproof makeup remover will get this junk off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little issue with my lashes clumping the first time I applied, the second time I was just more careful which meant application time doubled. Good luck getting this off your lashes. NOTHING works short of pulling out your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time or money on this product, CoverGirl should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> Is a great mÃ¡scara its easy to take off is really good ðŸ˜„ I loveeeeee it  awsome  yes yes buy it</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free from Influenster in my Surfs Up Vox Box&lt;br /&gt;I dont use mascara very often, but I loved this stuff.. It only got a 4 star because I found it difficult to remove, but it is oil based, so you have to use a makeup remover that can take off this type of makeup.. regular soap &amp; water will NOT do it!&lt;br /&gt;Loved the length &amp; definition that it gave my lashes, I wont be using this on a daily basis, but It is my new go to for special occasions!</li>
    <li> I received this product for testing purposes, and i can say that i will never buy this. The 2 in 1 looks nice and all but when you go to apply it, i found it very hard to maneuver around to get the mascara on because the product is so thick in size and the brushes are not on a long enough stick. I have applied both steps, and i have applied just the first and this product doesn&#x27;t do anything amazing to my lashes. I have very long lashes and i felt that this didn&#x27;t do anything special for me. But since it was free for testing purposes i will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is terrible, simply because it won&#x27;t come off. I needed to use a combination of makeup remover, vaseline and coconut oil in order to get most it off, but even then, I&#x27;&#x27;m pretty sure that some still remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it looked okay when it was applied, it didn&#x27;t do anything over and above any other mascara that would sway me to continue with the ordeal of trying to remove it after it was applied. It truly felt like I had hardened glue on my lashes. I tried it once then threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl makes a lot of great products, but this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> WARNING!!!!! I never write reviews but I felt like I needed to warn other ladies NOT TO BUY THIS! This is the WORST mascara I have ever used! First, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between sides #1 &amp; #2. Both of them were unremarkable. My lashes did not flare out, rather my eyelashes had bonded together in little groups and were impossible to seperate. Plus, my eyelashes were hard by the time I unscrewed side #2. So it was like I was just gluing them even more. Hours after application, my top and bottom lashes were still getting stuck together. It was like it never dried, but my eyelashes were hard! And trying to get this stuff off? IMPOSSIBLE! Day one of washing, after face wash &amp; makeup remover liquid &amp; remover wipes until my skin was red and puffy .... My eyelashes had 50% less mascara and were stuck together. I decided to call it a night. The next morning, my eyelashes were still hard. And when I got out the makeup remover again, I looked in the mirror and my bottom lashes were noticeably thinner than the day before. Two days later, I can see and feel traces of this mascara around the eyelashes&#x27; bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I googled &amp;#34;CG Bombshell Mascara&amp;#34;, the first listing that popped up had it rated at over 4 stars ... Go figure it was CGs own website and there was no place to add a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I scrolled down the Google results further, I found out that my horrible experience is just one of thousands. I&#x27;m not understanding why Cover Girl is even allowed to sell this product anymore. I threw mine away immediately and plan on never trying any other new and extravagant CG creations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have stated, I really wish you could give a rating of 0 stars.</li>
    <li> I used to have lots of beautiful lashes. Thanks to this product I now have very few left, I could not remove it with anything, I even tried waiting a week, shower after shower until finally I scrubbed again and just burned my eye balls with massive amounts of different products and there is still residue. It wasn&#x27;t even a good mascara when you applied it. I&#x27;m quite appalled at this product to be honest and angry I now have no more beautiful lashes. Thanks covergirl</li>
    <li> OMG!! Covergirl has failed horribly in thier new product Bombshell volume mascara! Not only is it sticky and tar like it will NOT i repeat WILL NOTTT wash off! not soap, not lotion, not even the best makeup remover!! took 2 weeks for it to come off cudnt wear any mascara until this nasty tar came off!!! Save your self the torture PLEASE dont buy!</li>
    <li> The tube is huge and makes it hard to put the mascara on. Afterward, I felt like my eyelashes were sticking together. I would pass this mascara up and go for the the lash blast in the orange bottle. It is much better than this. Sad I bought this.</li>
    <li> After shelling out close to $10 bucks for this mascara, it is probably the worst designed mascara I have ever used.  The length of the application brushes are short making it very difficult to apply (unless you like wearing mascara on the side of your face).  The mascara was very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; making my lashes clump together and even with a lash brush was difficult and somewhat painful to separate the lashes.  Removal wasn&#x27;t easy either.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on it!!!</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. This mascara is awful! It makes your lashes stick together and doesn&#x27;t wash off!! I tried soap and eye makeup remover and nothing worked. I lost a lot of eyelashes in the process. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Just to save you time and money!!! I have never written a review before, but felt the need to because this product is SO AWFUL!! The short wands clump your eyelashes together like GLUE and you CANNOT remove this mascara without taking a few eyelashes out every time! Even with makeup remover, it does not remove all traces of this mascara completely!! TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could return this horrible waste of money. Clumpy sticky hard ashes is not what I wanted. Even after trying to remove with makeup removed the next morning my lashes are still hard and sticky.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, really lasts long but it very difficult to remove. That&#x27;s is probably why it wears so good. It is not labeled as waterproof but holds better than many other waterproof mascaras. I washed my eyes with soap and some of it came off (1/5) but not the rest. the look of wet and made up lashes looked actually very nice. However, as I said this thing is very difficult to remove even with make up removers specifically for waterproof mascaras. I tried two of them, oil based and non-oil based. After about 10 minutes of rubbing I was able to remove it all. So keep this in mind if you have sensitive eyes. Don&#x27;t get I fooled by covergirl saying that you must use their make up remover. BS. It will be as difficult as any other remover. So all in all a good mascara but...</li>
    <li> Wow, my lashes are gone.  From here on out I&#x27;ll read reviews before trying new make up products.  Hard, clumpy and I got so desperate to get this stuff off my lashes I ran to my pantry and grabbed some vegetable oil.  I don&#x27;t recommend doing that but I read some people used coconut oil and I figured oil is oil.  Finally got most of it off along with most of my eyelashes.  The last few days of hoping it would eventually flake off my eyes started really hurting.  The lashes were so stiff and hard it literally hurt to blink.  I was waking up with eye goop in the corners and unfortunately thought it was a seasonal allergy.  This stuff is scary hard to remove, Covergirl really really needs to pull it.  I might go see an eye doc tomorrow because I think the product got into my left eye and hope the pain goes away soon.</li>
    <li> The WORST mascara EVER! I cannot express how much I hated this mascara. Both formulas suck, one of the brushes feels like its made of wires from a grill brush, the brushes do not separate at all but rather they cause huge clumps of my lashes to stick together ( it is not poor technique, either) . Felt like sticky glue on my eyes. Worst of all, it WOULD NOT come off no matter what I did. It was on my eyes for 2 days the first time, through 2 showers, makeup wipes, and liquid eye makeup remover- didn&#x27;t budge. The second time I tried it, I literally had to glop straight Vaseline on my eyelashes and go to bed with a towel on my pillow to keep the oil off my pillowcase. That worked, but my vision was blurry for a while from the oil in my eyes. Terrible terrible terrible. Please do not waste your money on this awful product.</li>
    <li> I bought this masacara at Target. It is the absolute worst  mascara I&#x27;ve  ever used. In addition  to clumping  my eye lashes and creating a huge mess, it was nearly impossible  to remove. Everything  about this mascara is terrible. Once I  looked at the ingredients, it was clear why this product is so terrible... it&#x27;s super  toxic!</li>
    <li> I did have problems that other people say they did, but it&#x27;s not bad. It&#x27;s a little sticky and the brushes are a little smaller. if u want it to stay on, it definitely does. And its a little harder to remove. I did lk the way it looks though! It really isn&#x27;t too bad. I use it pretty frequently.</li>
    <li> This is HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT USE THIS MASCARA!!  I literally cannot get it off and my lashes look awful because they are all stuck together.  I am worried that I will lose all my lashes as some people are claiming happened.  I was told that vaseline may help but I literally don&#x27;t know what to do!  I am so disappointed in Covergirl and I don&#x27;t think I will ever purchase another product from them.  I never write reviews but this is so bad and I want to save others from making this mistake!</li>
    <li> Will never ever get this mascara again!!! I thought I grabbed the water proof one and didn&#x27;t! It will not come off for nothing! I have had it stuck on me for days now and still can&#x27;t find a way to get it off and make up remover does nothing! This should deff be taken off the shelves I never right reviews but I don&#x27;t want anyone else loosing eye lashes too :(</li>
    <li> Absolutely the worst nightmare you can imagine.  Once you put this on, you cannot get it off without ripping out your eyelashes!  Nothing worked to remove it.  This product should not be on the market!</li>
    <li> Great mascara. It really adds length and volume to my lashes. However, it is very difficult to get off.</li>
    <li> Not only did this mascara stain everything, even your hand, with a sticky, black tar, but it GLUES you lashes together!! Volume? Well now I only have one thick lash, so I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s volume. I&#x27;ll give them this: It IS different than any mascara you&#x27;ve used before, because I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s made with road tar and chewed gum. I was late to work scraping it all off, and lost more than a few lashes in the process...do they even test this stuff? I guess it&#x27;s not a total waste of $10, I was out of caulk....</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I have to warn everyone about this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have lashes, and this may have ruined the lashes that I do have. It does not come off (and not in a good, waterproof way). It just clumps your lashes together and then stays put for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because the packaging was pretty, but this is the WORST mascara I ever bought. It clumps all my lashes together so it looks like I have less, and then I lost eyelashes because it destroyed my natural lashes and wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> Horrible. It is so sticky and clumpy. Getting it off is a complete and udder nightmare. I pulled out tons on lashes trying to get it off. The picture I shared is after not using mascara for 3 days, baby oil, two different makeup removers and soap and water. You can also see the chunks of eyelashes pulled out and or still clumped together.</li>
    <li> I both love and hate this mascara and this is why: half of it is fabulous. And half if it is horrible. When I put on the first-step volumizer I could not believe I actually had eyelashes! I was thrilled and so excited to put on the second-stage coat. And that is when the Evil Twin emerged...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second-step mascara is thick and sticky, and made my beautiful newly-discovered lashes clump together in a nightmare of blobby viscosity. Even an eyelash comb could not penetrate the gunkiness. It is also nearly indelible and when I got some on my face I nearly had to sandpaper it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a very overpackaged product: the tube is very big and clunky, and the wands are a little too short for comfortable application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have given this 3 stars ONLY because the first-stage coat is so miraculous and wonderful, and I may continue to use it even though I hate paying for a product that is only half-useful. A top coat of another mascara would probably accomplish what I want, but that almost seems to be too much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I give credit where it&#x27;s due: when this mascara is good it&#x27;s very very good, But when it&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews but it felt it necessary to share the fact that this mascara was almost impossible to take off. It wouldn&#x27;t come off with any makeup remover wipes or face wash and I had to scrub at my eyes with soap and water a lot to finally get the gunk out which was still stuck in my eyelashes for a couple of days. On the back of the package in really tiny writing it says &#x27;Removes with Covergirl Makeup Remover&#x27;, which apparently is all that it removes with. The effect didn&#x27;t seem any better than any other of their mascaras. I would maybe use it if I need a mascara that I know will last a long while, but definitely not in any other scenario.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara after reading the negative reviews which said it was difficult to remove. For me, having mascara that stayed on sounded ideal. I first curled my dry lashes and then applied the #1 side starting slowly at the base of my lashes. The coverage is excellent and my blond lashes became long - almost like I was wearing false lashes. I went slowly and made sure to evenly coat the lashes. I only used one coat of side #2. The mascara stayed on all day and looked great. When it came time to remove the mascara, I rinsed my face in hot water, and lightly rubbed/massaged olive oil on my lashes with my fingers. It came right off without any issues. In the past I have used waterproof mascara that was difficult to remove, but not this. I will definitely purchase this mascara again.</li>
    <li> This actually went on my eyelashes really well, both steps 1 and 2 really added to the look and I couldn&#x27;t complain. As other reviews, I lost a lot of eyelashes trying to get rid of the residue. Makeup remover wipes don&#x27;t work either. I also noticed the day I wore the mascara, one eye was irritated so I thought it was from my contacts, but the next day I wore the mascara, both eyelids (right at my eyelash lines) were inflamed and itchy. I have NEVER had an issue with a formula in mascara. This is the first time I&#x27;ve had a reaction with mascara and I am really disappointed because it looks really good on. I didn&#x27;t have the clumping issue as bad as other reviewers. I will not repurchase and I will not use this product ever again. :(</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the same mascara with two different applicator brushes. So basically I can achieve the same look with two mascaras I already own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally just finished getting a massage and it smudged minimally. The smudges came off easily with a kleenex-- I&#x27;m not sure if that bodes well for its waterproofness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you already have mascara you like, this probably won&#x27;t be any better than what your using. If it&#x27;s on sale for less that $7, it might be worth your while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of these double sided mascaras. And this one was no different, but I decided to give it a try since it didn&#x27;t have the white coat that most of the double sided mascaras have. While it did add volume and intensity, it came at a cost. The 2nd step which provides &amp;#34;intensity,&amp;#34; was quite resilient. After using Neutrogena make up remover (which I have always had success with no matter what mascara I&#x27;m using) as well as the Covergirl make up remover version (that it states will remove this mascara), I still had black clumps throughout my eyelashes that I had to physically remove with my fingernails or tweezers resulting in the loss of lashes. I attempted to use just the first step alone, and while it didn&#x27;t leave me with the clumps, it was definitely lacking in the intensity. Again, there are better options to achieve the look this mascara advertises that it does (I prefer L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s telescopic mixed with a mascara from the L&#x27;oreal volumizing line.)&lt;br /&gt;The description also states that this mascara separates lashes... I felt that most of my lashes were just clumped together.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was not satisfied with this product and DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to purchase it.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara! I received it in my surfs up voxbox complimentary of influenster for testing purposes. When it clumps I just run the tube under hot water and it goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Definitely not waterproof; does thicken and lengthen but also clumps together giving &amp;#34;spider lashes&amp;#34;; took about 10 minutes to dry and even after an hour was still a bit sticky; removed fine with Neutrogena remover; the tube is entirely too fat. Returning!</li>
    <li> Love / Hate relationship with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The negatives: 1.) The wands are too short and the tube is too chunky. I had a very difficult time getting to my inner lashes and after all the effort, the application looked uneven and chunky. I had to use a lash/brow brush to correct. 2.) Very difficult to remove. I pulled the wrapping out of the waste basket to make sure I hadn&#x27;t bought waterproof. I don&#x27;t have thick lashes, hence the reason I bought this product, so I certainly can&#x27;t afford to pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;The positives: 1.) After some work the end result is beautiful. Length, fullness and...wow. 2.) No flaking, no smearing.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara will work for me for special occasions. I just don&#x27;t see it being a good everyday product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Mascara after using it for the first time, I noticed right away that it is very thick. I put it on my eyes any way (BIG MISTAKE). As the day went on, I noticed I started to get a gritty feeling in my one eye. I believe a small amount of the mascara got into my eyes or an eye lash. I went to the bathroom to wash it off, and the stuff does not come off! I did not buy waterproof. I just left it alone and went to sleep, when I woke up in the morning, I noticed that my eye lashes were falling off, I had also tried to rinse the product again and it still would not come off, no matter what type of makeup remover I would try. The only way I got it off was olive oil. I had to sit with two hot tea bags on my eyes to also help get it off. The worst part is, some of the product got into my eye and is still in my eye. I have had a gritty sensation for over a week. (and no it is not pink eye) it is from the mascara. I made an appointment with my eye doctor to see I could get some relief from the gritty feeling. The first thing the Dr asked me was if I had tried a \\&quot;new\\&quot; mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told her I had and she told me to throw it away. She said after examining my eye that I have some type of chemical/allergic reaction on my eye lid which caused my oil gland on my eye lashes to become clogged. She told me to never use the product again the only way it would cause such reaction is if it had a harsh chemical as she explained. And to make it worse my eye could take another 2 weeks to completely clear up and for the oil gland to become unclogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not USE This product and Cover Girl take it off the market before someone does serious damage to their eyes or looses all of their eye lashes!!!!</li>
    <li> I recovered my Covergirl Bombshell Mascara from influenster AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!! it is awesome especially is you&#x27;re going for glamorous it&#x27;s just perfect I will continue to buy this from day on....!!!</li>
    <li> This mascara does not come off with eye make up remover pads or liquid eye make up remover or baby shampoo. If you want to keep mascara on and never remove it, this is for you. It can&#x27;t be good for eyes for mascara to stay on for days and trying to remove it takes some eyelashes with it. If I had the receipt, I would bring it back. That is the only thing companies understand when they make a bad product.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Do not waste your money on this &amp;#34;gorilla glue!&amp;#34; Yes, I said glue because that is precisely what it is! It stuck my lashes together like glue, would not come of with soap, makeup remover or baby oil! It literally took scrubbing my eyes to get this off and I lost several lashes in the process! The wands are fat and clunky and unless you enjoy getting mascara on the side of your face while trying to apply this you will be greatly disappointed! Cover Girl should be ashamed they are selling this to unknowing customers for 10 bucks a pop! I wouldn&#x27;t pay a penny for this! In the trash it goes and from now on I will stick to Loreal cosmetics which it what I should of done in the first place!</li>
    <li> I received this Product from Influenster!!&lt;br /&gt;I liked it because the little brush is perfect for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to wear glasses so putting mascara on is hard for me, the little brush allows me to not worry so much about making a mess!! I like the dark black color. It was a little clumpy the first time but after that I put the tube in some warm water and it made the clump&#x27;s go away ( my tip ).</li>
    <li> Ugh. Fat brush on both ends, and while Step 1 looks pretty promising applied, all heck breaks loose when you put on Step 2. Smudges, clumps, no definition whatsoever, and the length disappears. What&#x27;s that about? I just had it with Step 1. Hard to get off too, as others have noted, which I don&#x27;t mind if a mascara looks good but this one doesn&#x27;t. Not fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to give Covergirl a chance to redeem themselves since my experience has been pretty poor with them for a few years... but this seals it. They still aren&#x27;t any good.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on and dries into sticky tar balls that you absolutely cannot get off of your lashes. I tried soap and water, makeup remover, and cold cream. All it seems to do is push the tar balls to the ends of your lashes into globs. I applied cold cream over and over, rubbing my lashes until my eyelids were literally sore. Eventually eyelashes started pulling out at the roots, and they would get stuck in the tar balls and stick in my eyes! When I finally got this crap off, I had lost a ton of lashes. Do NOT use this product! I suspect the positive reviews are people who haven&#x27;t taken it off yet. My tube is in the trash where it belongs! By the way, my wife is writing this review. I am not a mascara wearing man! Susan</li>
    <li> I actually like that it makes my lashes fuller.  I read the other comments and yes, it&#x27;s hard to take off but it does fill out my thinning lashes.  My complaint is that it takes a VERY long time to dry.  I will apply step one, then step 2 and then pray that I don&#x27;t move my eyes in such a way that it will make black dots above or below my eyes.  Even 30 minutes after applying, as I&#x27;m driving to work, I will look down and it makes mascara spots under my eyes - thirty minutes after!  Covergirl really needs to work on the drying agent they use in this formula.&lt;br /&gt;As stated in the other reviews, it&#x27;s hard to remove so when I get to the office, in order to get the black dots form my eyelids or under my eyes, you have to rub and rub and unfortunately remove my other makeup.  It&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other reviews, I cannot get this mascara off my lashes. They are stuck together. I have been using baby shampoo to remove my eye makeup for years and it won&#x27;t budge this mascara. I am throwing my tube out. Nowhere does this say waterproof on the tube. If it had, I would not have bought it. Poor marketing of a productt!</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara ever!  It clumps together and I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to remove it a week after using it.  My eyelashes look horrible and I have lost a few already from trying to remove the mascara from them.  Do NOT buy this product!  Save your money! I know that I will never buy any mascara by Cover Girl again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product</li>
