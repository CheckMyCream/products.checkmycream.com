      <li>I am one that spends many hours in the sun.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unique in many ways.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s not loaded with toxic chemicals and strong perfumes or scents.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would be an excellent product for someone with extremely dry skin either on their face or body.  </li>
      <li>i applied to my neck and face , and i can feel my skin is more smooth and hydrant.</li>
      <li>I could have easily given this 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t like the congealing of the coconut or whatever it is that won&#x27;t dissolve.</li>
      <li>but this product made it easy...</li>
      <li>This cream is full of good, natural ingredients, and has no scent whatsoever, and that is very important to me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for dry skin</li>
      <li>This is a miracle in a little jar :D</li>
      <li>The non-greasy formula leaves your skin feeling moisturized, supple, and smooth.  </li>
      <li>My face feels so smooth.  </li>
      <li>This was a great cream to help set my facial dryness for before and after being in the sun.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>This fabulous skin cream is certified organic and rich in moisturizing goodness.  </li>
      <li>and my skin looks much better by itself with a natural glow and a more even tone.</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive skin and finally found a face cream which is perfect.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s always been my thing, natural, or organic even better!...</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for women or men who have dry skin or normal skin.</li>
      <li>I will certainly make sure I have it on hand from here out.</li>
      <li>Purchased this through special promotion pricing to try it.  </li>
      <li>I was very lucky (well, actually my bf&#x27;s mother) to have received this product while on a promotion in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth after using it and the packaging is nice enough for gift giving.</li>
      <li>Super moisturizing and hydrating as it contains shea butter.</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant in getting this product, but after using it for 2 months I knowticed a significant change in the glow of my skin, and my gosh</li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to exchange my honest opinion in order to receive this product.</li>
      <li>a little bit on the oily side, it works great for a night cream.</li>
      <li>It looks grainy but its just the shea, it rubs right in and absorbs quickly, leaving the face soft, smooth and glowing!</li>
      <li>Feels lighter than baby powder, but I feel fresh with it on my face.</li>
      <li>So it is a good product for ingredients and very dry skin, but not so good when wanting a product less greasy.</li>
      <li>The first I notice is how soft the the cream was and how refreshing.</li>
      <li>and I always feel like I have to use too much of it to get full coverage on my face and</li>
      <li>Overall, I will gladly buy this again because it definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a promotional price for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
      <li>In the long run it is supposed to correct your natural glow and leave your skin nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Absorb very fast .</li>
      <li>That part I like very much.</li>
      <li>I just used this today for the first time.  </li>
      <li>However, it has made my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>After applying the serum once a day for a week I could see and feel positive results.  </li>
      <li>I just love this product ... been using it for over a month and my face looks younger and vibrant</li>
      <li>It does make my skin feel super soft</li>
      <li>have dry skin all over my body and would love to buy this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>fine lines around her eyes are not as deep as it was before</li>
      <li>But once it gets absorbed the skin is super soft and has a natural glow.</li>
      <li>So, the steroid took care of the swelling and most of the redness, but then the area was scaly and very dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Good ingredients. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to exchange my honest opinion in order to receive this product. My thoughts are unbiased and completely honest. I like the organic factor although I think it might be a tad too natural for me. The product itself is a cream like you would think and be used to. The cream has very small chunks in it that for me at least don&#x27;t really dissolve on my skin even when wet. I have to wipe off the excess after using this. I do love the packaging though. It&#x27;s very unique in many ways. It does soften my skin very well and the oil in it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all. That part I like very much. I do wish the actual product was smoother though. Other than that I do like it though.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for more organic products to use and this cream is a wonderful find. My skin feels smooth after using it and the packaging is nice enough for gift giving. Thank you so much for this quality product.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the product feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> Purchased this through special promotion pricing to try it.  It does make my skin feel super soft but unfortunately I started breaking out from it.  I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about shea butter, maybe i&#x27;ll try it on my hands and body instead.</li>
    <li> better than my expect</li>
    <li> This product is very waxy and hard to apply. I was hoping it would go on smoother and silkier. It reminds me of a Chapstick consistency but in a jar.</li>
    <li> This is very good!! I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
    <li> i applied to my neck and face , and i can feel my skin is more smooth and hydrant. All nature smell and gentle touch . Absorb very fast . Overall, it has lots of what skin needs inside the little box . I love it .</li>
    <li> Makes skin so smooth!</li>
    <li> I received this in and it is the Best cream I have ever used!  My face feels so smooth.  I also noticed It is not dry like it use to be.  I noticed less wrinkles also.  I was getting bad lines around my eyes and noticed the are not as defined as they use to be.  This product has done wonders for my skin.  When I run out, I will be buying more.  Nice and creamy and smooth.  You also do not need to use a lot.  It goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> so disappointed! It left my face greasy and shiny even though I have a normal skin&lt;br /&gt;Little to no absorption so  my skin felt suffocated and trapped within this cream.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even have a consistency of a cream , it&#x27;s more like a suger scrub !</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin so I was initially nervous to try this but all is well.  A very little bit goes a long way and easily glides across the skin. I also like the fact that this cream absorbs nicely and does not sit on top of my skin. All of the oils listed in the ingredients are great for all skin types and in combination, work wonderfully. I do notice a glow, not oiliness, and a brighter complexion since using this cream. I also use this as an all over eye cream and have noticed less wrinkles. My assumption is because of the hydration being added to this delicate skin from this Bare Naked Skin Cream. Overall, I will gladly buy this again because it definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a promotional price for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this cream for a couple of weeks after receiving it, then write my review....I&#x27;ve used quite a few &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products! That&#x27;s always been my thing, natural, or organic even better!...this one is fantastic! One warming, if you&#x27;re looking for something completely weightless, this might not be for you. (Depending on the amount you use.) However, now that I&#x27;m past a certain age, I like a little something more! This cream is very smooth and absorbs great! I ordered it because I wanted a day cream with a bit of SPF for summer, but I like it as a day and night cream both! My makeup also goes on nicely with this underneath. Makes my skin feel like velvet! Other all natural creams of this same type that I&#x27;ve used in the past tend to sometimes have a grittiness. (Only a guess, but I&#x27;m thinking shea butter must sometimes separate and get tiny chunks.) NOT the case here at all! This cream is very homogenized. There is just a very slight hint of an herb-y scent, almost undetectable, which I also like!  The only down side to this product might be the price. Honestly, I don&#x27;t usually pay this much for a small jar of skin cream, but, as mentioned, a little goes a long way. I use a dab somewhat larger than a pea for each use, so the jar should last awhile!...Shipping and packaging was also excellent!</li>
    <li> Love it, amazing cream</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a little jar :D I was very lucky (well, actually my bf&#x27;s mother) to have received this product while on a promotion in exchange for my honest review. This product is perfect for women or men who have dry skin or normal skin. My bf&#x27;s mother is in her late 40s and she has very dry skin (she&#x27;s also a smoker) and has deep lines around her eyes. I gave her this jar to help her skin hydrated and just last night she thanked me for it so OMG 10 points for the girlfriend lol. So here are the pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;2. lightweight blend&lt;br /&gt;3. don&#x27;t need a lot for the entire face and the neck&lt;br /&gt;4. it REALLY hydrates her face&lt;br /&gt;5. her face looks like it&#x27;s been saved (no more dull looking)&lt;br /&gt;6. it brightens up her face and gives her a glow&lt;br /&gt;7. fine lines around her eyes are not as deep as it was before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. wish this comes in a bigger jar&lt;br /&gt;2. the percentage of the sunscreen needs to be  a little higher (preferably spf 30, but spf 15 is also good)&lt;br /&gt;3. needs one for the body PLEASE&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin all over my body and would love to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would we recommend it? ABSOLUTELY</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this cream on my face. Feels lighter than baby powder, but I feel fresh with it on my face. felt refreshed after using this before a day in teh sun. This was a great cream to help set my facial dryness for before and after being in the sun. This will now be a staple in my makeup bag! *HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY*</li>
    <li> I love that you hardly have to use any of this cream to moisturize your face. It&#x27;s very thick, and if you use it on damp skin a very tiny amount will moisturize your skin ALL DAY LONG!</li>
    <li> I bought this face cream because is states to be organic and natural. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks, day and night. I really like this face cream. I do have very sensitive skin and it has bothered me at all. I have noticed my skin does get red after applying but goes away fairly quickly. the tub is quiet small but a little goes a long ways and I feel it will last a while.</li>
    <li> This product was WONDERFUL!  I just got back from vacation and got a bad sunburn on my face.  My skin was drying out and being to peel.  It was awful looking.  I started using this moisturizer before bed and under my makeup.  Not only did it give me dry skin relief, I stopped peeling!  My skin LOVES this stuff!  I had been using several different expensive after sun products and it didn&#x27;t do much to help my skin.  I will certainly make sure I have it on hand from here out.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely cream and every bit as good as an extremely well-known brand that I bought a few years back.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times but I can say that it feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It literally melts into your skin. I have tried a million different face creams but I now have found the ONE!!</li>
    <li> I really want to give this product all of my attention .When I stepped out of my shower, I opened this container and applied it to my face. The first I notice is how soft the the cream was and how refreshing. It is unscented also 100% Organic.In the long run it is supposed to correct your natural glow and leave your skin nice and smooth. No oily build up at all. So, I rated 5 stars ,This is truly an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is an intensive moisturizer.  I am one that spends many hours in the sun.  After applying the serum once a day for a week I could see and feel positive results.  Initially when I started using the cream it felt a bit heavy but within a few minutes the serum soaked completely in and hydrated my dry skin areas.  I really like that the product is all natural.</li>
    <li> This product works amazing I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! At first I was hesitant in getting this product, but after using it for 2 months I knowticed a significant change in the glow of my skin, and my gosh it did a fanominal job at preserving my skin to make look younger I am a make so it&#x27;s a bit more difficult but this product made it easy... So I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you like organic products!!!</li>
    <li> I really love bare naked skin face cream! Its all natural and organic! Super moisturizing and hydrating as it contains shea butter. It looks grainy but its just the shea, it rubs right in and absorbs quickly, leaving the face soft, smooth and glowing! It feels great! I am happy to have recieved this product to review. I will definitely keep using this!</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for my skin. No chemical ingredients, real natural/organic ingredients. My skin is very smooth since I am using this product. I have a sensitive skin and finally found a face cream which is perfect.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. product  smells great. really thick cream. not really good for oily skin. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for dry skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I normally use, but absorbs quickly. Made out of ingredients I trust, and smells great, too!</li>
    <li> I just love this product ... been using it for over a month and my face looks younger and vibrant</li>
    <li> This cream is full of good, natural ingredients, and has no scent whatsoever, and that is very important to me. It feels lovely on the skin. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell any difference in my skin, though it certainly can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> This is organic which is my main preference but it is like my homemade moisturizer that I personally make in that it is a little too greasy for me so was hoping it would blend in well as some reviewers stated. I usually put it on then take a cloth and lightly blot it off so it is not so greasy for makeup to be applied, also when putting on at night I do the same thing since your pillow can get pretty greasy after a few days. So it is a good product for ingredients and very dry skin, but not so good when wanting a product less greasy.</li>
    <li> Best applied when skin is damp. A little goes an extremely long way, and although the jar is small, I anticipate having it for months. Great face cream. Wish it came in a larger size to use all over the body.</li>
    <li> a little bit on the oily side, it works great for a night cream. absorbs well, my skin feels wonderful in the morning.</li>
    <li> This needs a little getting used to.. its more sticky than the regular chemicals I used on my face each morning, its more like applying honey to my face. But once it gets absorbed the skin is super soft and has a natural glow. Dont put makeup on top though... Its for people who do dare to go out with their &#x27;real face&#x27;. Or just use it as night cream. 2 weeks into this and my skin looks much better by itself with a natural glow and a more even tone. Although my combination tropical skin does get the occasional pimple still... Hence not all 5 stars.</li>
    <li> So great. Wish I bought more!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it on my hands, lips and eye area. It leaves my skin feeling so silky. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it. I usually am hesitant to try new facial products due to my skin&#x27;s sensitivity but this face cream has been amazing. Goes on so smooth, and feels great! I love that it&#x27;s not loaded with toxic chemicals and strong perfumes or scents. Will definitely reorder when this eventually runs out!</li>
    <li> I could have easily given this 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t like the congealing of the coconut or whatever it is that won&#x27;t dissolve. I tried using heat from my hands, but they won&#x27;t go away and get all over everything. If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would buy again and again. Also, Amazon says it has an SPF, but I&#x27;m not sure that it does.</li>
    <li> Love this product, Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and already see results.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this cream! About 5 weeks ago I had two areas around my eyes that started to get a bit itchy, then the areas turned red... and as I was trying to find something to heal and soothe the area, I was just making it worse until my face swelled up and was burning and itching. I was put on an oral steroid and told it was eczema... prob from all the crap I had been using on my face. So, the steroid took care of the swelling and most of the redness, but then the area was scaly and very dry. The area around my right eye was so bad, it made me look about 15 yrs older on that side. So, with the help of some hemp oil to start and then this Bare Naked Skin, my eye areas almost look exactly the same. I have only used the cream for about 2 weeks, but I have seen a huge improvement. I do use Eucerin facial lotion for sensitive skin as my base, and then I use the Bare Naked around my eyes, my mouth and my neck... I think it&#x27;s a little too thick to put all over my face, I have a tendency to break out. But I am very happy, my eczema is under control and my skin looks great... and I am turning 51 in August! I use this both day and night.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It combats my dry skin in the winter in New England unlike any product. This is truly a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Dry skin?  Nourish it with  Bare Naked Skin Face Cream.  This fabulous skin cream is certified organic and rich in moisturizing goodness.  Bare Naked cream actually melts on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The all-natural, certified organic ingredients mean that there are no adverse skin reactions.  The non-greasy formula leaves your skin feeling moisturized, supple, and smooth.  When you use Bare Naked, your skin&#x27;s elasticity and hydration is improved. Bare Naked skin cream is suitable for all skin-types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be an excellent product for someone with extremely dry skin either on their face or body.  Because I have dry skin on my body, this was very soothing and relieving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Just recieved  moment ago</li>
    <li> This product is literally liquid nutrition&lt;br /&gt;and hydration for your skin.  Keeps your skin&lt;br /&gt;superbly moisturized without pulling that disappearing&lt;br /&gt;act by midday. Smells mostly neutral with just a hint of&lt;br /&gt;mint freshness. The fact that it is stored in glass jar versus&lt;br /&gt;plastic also accounts to the products quality and freshness.&lt;br /&gt;Also works great as a makeup base and complements any&lt;br /&gt;serum treatments.  I highly recommend this product and&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering frequently.</li>
    <li> I just used this today for the first time.  So far, so good.  My skin feels and looks silky.  I hope this works for me.</li>
    <li> I was provided an opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I&#x27;m happy to say that I am very impressed with this face cream. I have very sensitive skin along with rosacea. I also tend to sweat if I wear any cream that is too thick and heavy on my face. This is a struggle because I also have dry skin in areas. I have been using facial oil for my skin in the warmer months due to the sweating problem. It&#x27;s kind of messy putting on though and I always feel like I have to use too much of it to get full coverage on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face cream has solved that problem for me. First, the cream has absolutely no smell. It&#x27;s very smooth going on and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using a ton to get complete coverage on my face and neck. It is a small jar, but I believe it would last me at least a month or more. It does take a little time to absorb into your skin, but there is a work-around for this. When I get up in the morning, I wash my face, use my toner, and then apply the face cream. I then go down to have my coffee and relax for a time before getting dressed. This allows time for it to absorb before putting on my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using this at night before bed. I have not found that this has made a mess on my pillows or covers like a previous reviewer suggested. However, it has made my skin so soft and smooth. I can also state that I have had no skin irritation or breakouts. This is definitely a five star product!</li>
