    <li> It&#x27;s dirt cheap bubble bath that smells nice.  Seriously, with stuff costing 3 times this much elsewhere, you gonna complain?  Srsly?</li>
    <li> While there are better and more expensive brands out there, I really find Dr. Teal&#x27;s gives you the most bang for the buck.  I have used numerous scents from Dr. Teal&#x27;s and found each to be enjoyable.  Dr. Teal&#x27;s will not fill your bathtub with bubbles, but you will have plenty of suds.  I actually prefer the lower level of bubbles in this bath.  Furthermore, the fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering at all.  As the title suggests, Dr. Teal&#x27;s is also a great value and is very long lasting with the 34oz size.</li>
    <li> More  than meets expectations; Mr Teals is real truth in advertising. Particularly recommend Chamomile foam for an escape from run of the mill bath additives.</li>
    <li> Needed the relaxation and the aroma of the bubble bath is nice and it does seem to help calm and relax my nerves a bit.  It&#x27;s worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Great smell, but for the size of the bottle (and price), I expected it to last longer.  My daughter loves bubble baths and I have to use quite a bit of this every time to get it bubbly enough.</li>
    <li> This is a hidden gem - I did not know about Dr. Teal&#x27;s until a friend mentioned it to me when I moved into a home with a soaker tub. I had been a shower person and didn&#x27;t &#x27;do&#x27; baths until I tried this product. Wow!  I have sensitive, dry skin and this product is such a boon. It moisturizes my skin for days, doesn&#x27;t dry it out and combines well with Dr. Teal&#x27;s lavender bath as well. One squirt of chamomile, one of lavender - heaven!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and itchy like most bubble bath products do. I used half of it while I was on vacation. Great product</li>
    <li> DR. TEALS Chamomile salt or bubble bath is great I have tried others and regretted it does not have that relaxing fragrance</li>
    <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s is only available as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; and when it pops up, I always make sure to add it to my cart!  Life is stress and a weekly soak in Chamomile can help in calming the nerves and mind down.  It&#x27;s a great way, too, when you just need to escape and are feeling overwhelmed.  A quick 15 minute bath with this delicately scented chamomile with loads of bubbles can refocus my unraveling nerves and reset me on a clearer course.  And here&#x27;s my special secret: Duct tape across the overflow valve gives an extra deep soak! I use the &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; duct tape, kept under the sink with a paper of small children&#x27;s safety scissors. Make sure the area is REALLY dry before applying and then remove AFTER the water has drained past the taped area.  Also, keep an eye on the tub filling up, if you have it taped, since you just removed the safety of the overflow.  Shhhhh! Don&#x27;t tell hubby!  If my review has been helpful, please give me a click!</li>

    <li> This foaming bath has great bubbles and a delightful smell at a great price!  And I don&#x27;t have to visit the mall to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the bath bubbles around and will never try another. Dr. Teal&#x27;s makes baths bubble like a TV commercial.</li>
