<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My mom loved the smell so much I had to get her a second one.</li>
    <li> Fame is soft ,sweet and a bit flowery. It won&#x27;t stay all day so plan to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my friend&#x27;s birthday, and he absolutely loves it. He is very happy, as he has been wanting this item for some time. He says it smells amazing and the bottle is super cool. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. This is one of my daughters favorite. It was a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new perfume, and tried my luck buying this because of all the positive reviews of its unique pleasant scent. I was not disappointed! They have somehow beautifully blended &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34; together. I&#x27;ve also noticed its sustainability, as i put some on in the morning (6 AMish) before i go to work, and my husband commented on how good i smelled when he got home that evening (6 PMish). So I still had enough on for him to notice 12 hours later. And hubby likes it, so there&#x27;s another plus! :)</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. . And a price I could  afford !!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, although it does have a color to it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes Great value for the size/amount of product. I will certainly be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I sampled many scents at a Sephoria store before I found this one.  My friend liked it so I purchased a bottle from amazon at a much better price. It is an easy to wear fragrance that compliments my style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance from the day it was released and it is still my favorite. Whenever I wear this, I feel empowered and at the same time I feel elegant. I can&#x27;t wait to buy a new bottle for 75% off!!</li>
    <li> I got this perfume for my sister&#x27;s bday and she really loves it, it&#x27;s a really elegant fragance... She recommends it</li>
    <li> I use this as a light room spray. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it in public though. Don&#x27;t trust that it&#x27;s unisex... This is for women. But I love Gaga... so whatever.</li>
    <li> Yes, that is what my family ladies said when they got the perfume. I said to myself \\&quot;it is an awesome buy\\&quot;. It came to my front door so I didn&#x27;t have to go shopping and the price was considerably lower than any store. Of course, if you take advantage of the free shipping, it doesn&#x27;t even cost you that additional expense.&lt;br /&gt;I definitively recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift and the recipient was very happy.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful. The bottle looks nice too. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. I noticed the sent does not last. Be prepared to reapply a few times in a day.</li>
    <li> Order arrived right on time. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom for Christmas. She&#x27;s a big fan of Victoria Secret perfumes, and it reminded me of some of those that she used to wear. She LOVED it. It was wrapped appropriately, came in the real box, and had the real lid, so I am sure it was the actual product and not some kind of scam. The price was phenomenal.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this perfume since the packaging is so extravagant... but I had a sample of it in a store and absolutely fell in love. Definitely a night time/date night scent! Amazing bottle, amazing scent, cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> this perfume almost has no smell to it, i have to spray on so much to get a scent, that fades after a few minutes</li>
    <li> This smells really good</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, excellent packing and product as advertised.  An excellent price as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of lady gaga, but I tried this parfum at a local store and I loved the smell! So I got it here at a great price, thank you!!</li>
    <li> I had just recieved this perfume today , i must say shipping was rather fast it came a week before the estimated delivery date so that was a plus.the only thing I would have to say negative is that the box the perfume came in was alittle squished not in the best condition but the bottle itself was absolutely fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim without testing it first but I actually really like it. One of my favorite things is that it&#x27;s super subtle, five minutes after I put it on I can&#x27;t smell it at all, but I get compliments on it so I guess other people can at least lol Bottom of bottle is a little unstable, wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it somewhere it might get bumped even a little bit</li>
    <li> I got this for my 13 year old niece. She likes the smell, I don&#x27;t care for it. Must be a scent for the younger generation.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and it was a bargain price I paid. I would recommend it to others to buy.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Huge bottle for such a good price. I would recommend to anyone. Lasts for maybe two or three hours.</li>
    <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great scent! Nice bottle.</li>
    <li> got this for christmas for my mom..the bottle is awesome looking and it smells great plus it was a steal of a price when i bought it great perfume wish the scent lasted longer tho</li>
    <li> There is NO other fragrance that comes close to seductive, sexy Fame! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> i am a Gaga fan .. didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason...the reviews were great so i made a blind buy,, love it .. doesn&#x27;t last as long as some of my other fragrances but long enough 6 hours or so..</li>
    <li> All very well. I liked the fragrance is sweet. When I get the perfume was well packaged and in very good condition brand new. Thank you so much, very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I love this smell.  it is sexy and alluring.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I received it for Christmas with the lotion and body wash. Being a rare perfume wearer..I wear this everyday because it is very crisp and not overpoweringly floral. This will be in my collection from now on!</li>
    <li> Smells good, but I was highly disappointed that I was not sold a real product even when I bought it from Amazon.com LLC themselves. The perfume spray is visibly black when it hits my skin rather than clear as it was advertised to be. The scent lasts no longer than an hour. Tempting price, but not worth the risk!</li>
    <li> Great perfum, my friends loves it on me</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing.  Everyone loves how it smells on me.  But it fades after just minutes of being applied.  Within an hour, I can no longer smell it at all.  If the scent lasted longer, it would absolutely be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The bottle itself is very unique. Loved the smell it is soft and a bit sweet. Lasts all day. And not only is a bottle unique but the perfume liquid itself is as well the perfume is black and sprayed on your skin clear absolutely awesome!!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of celebrity perfumes, usually I think they are horrible and the smell of alcohol never goes away. Ugh. I tried this in a store for the pure novelty of a black liquid which turns clear. I really liked it! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I decided to spritz a bit on my wrists and under my ears to test it out and see how long it would last. My husband said he really liked it (he is very picky about fragrances) and it lasted all day, so I decided to purchase a bottle. I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little young (if that makes sense... it&#x27;s sweet and floral), but I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s so I feel I can get away with it for now. I don&#x27;t think I could wear something like this over 32-35 though.</li>
    <li> Super happy and I love the way it smells. Fast shipping super easy.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a gift set for her for Christmas and this quickly became her favorite perfume.  The problem with those gift sets they always come with small bottles that don&#x27;t last very long, so she ran out and wasn&#x27;t a happy camper.  I found this here on Amazon at a price that I found to be extremely reasonable and the shipping was super fast as always.  Great product and great service and once again hats off to you Amazon!</li>
    <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
    <li> Gift to may daughter and she loved it. Wants more/</li>
    <li> Beautiful container, intoxicating scent.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected...bleckkkkk...now I have a full bottle and have no idea what I&#x27;m going to do with it</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was a small bottle, and it turned out to be a jumbo sized bottle for the same price that I paid for a MUCH smaller bottle at a local store. I was pleasantly surprised. This perfume smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews of Lady Gaga&#x27;s Fame Spray but the only thing I can agree on is that the scent does not last long at all. I&#x27;m sure this is the true parfum spray. The bottle &amp; the color of the fluid is the most original design I&#x27;ve seen &amp; I buy a lot of perfume. The scent seems spicy to me with fruit &amp; powder which is probably the incense. It is a good date perfume or to use when your time out is short or you will have to bring this scent with you for touch ups. A gave it 4 stars for that reason alone but all and all I am satisfied. By the way, I am not a Lady Gaga fan.</li>
    <li> I alsway love perfume of Gaga. It&#x27;s so good smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume on a whim, after hearing everyone talk about it so positively I figured it was worth a try. Worth a try it was, it was amazing. My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I wear it everyday. The notes stay with me all day. The bottle is awesome. Over all, I adore this perfume and I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, or good. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and am very sad that it was discontinued. I am extremely critical of perfumes and colognes, but this one is right up there with Burberry for me. It is the only celebrity scent I like, and was hesitant because of that, but the dark scent is perfect and I am glad I went ahead and purchased this large bottle.</li>
    <li> My wife is a huge Gaga fan, so she had to buy this when it first came out, and I wasn&#x27;t prepared to be impressed.  Once she wore this the first time, I loved it!  And now I want her to wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> I usually do not wear perfume...Strong scents give me headaches. Bought for the first time in January, before heading to the Born This Way Ball in Phoenix.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 4 or 5 bottles since then. I only wish the scent stayed on me longer.</li>
    <li> Smells divine! I am a boy and do think that this is a unisex perfume due to the darkness of the floral notes and the incense notes (that come out when you rub it on your skin). The seller was WONDERFUL! It shipped for free, it got to my house extremely fast, and it was legitimate. I WILL buy from this seller again and I will  continue to purchase this as my signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very nice packaging and bottle design. Sweet smell, I expected a musky scent or a scent that made you smell ,in lack of a better word, sophisticated but it still smells very good nonetheless!</li>
    <li> good heavy fragrance, stays on for a long time and is very pleasant. has a floral musk that&#x27;s very distinguishable.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchase this product what can I say I love it, I love it as I said before I love different shape bottles and scents and this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Brand new and official great buy!!!!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy that bought this... As it is a unisex fragrance but after all, scents can&#x27;t have a gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically wear Polo Black or Burberry, but I was ready for a change and something completely unique and different. I ran across this a few times in various stores and stopped to smell it one day and had to have it. Finding it on Amazon for 75% off of what the retailers are selling it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a luxurious and mysterious scent with multiple layers. It begins soft and begins to deepen and lighten as you wear it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty this makes you smell like an old rich woman who lives in a 7500 sq ft manhattan penthouse that drinks too much vodka and hits on the young doorman for the building. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it - male or female.</li>
    <li> This perfume is AWESOME. Manages to be both feminine and edgy at the same time, and is a great scent to wear out at night to go dancing, on a date, or anything like that. I absolutely love the way it smells, and the price is crazy! This bottle is huge, and it&#x27;s only $21?! I highly recommend this to any perfume lover.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells like heaven! its for guys and girls, not too over powering and is not expensive like it used to be, I advise you to buy it up before their all gone! LG</li>
    <li> Every time. I mean: every time I wear this perfume my boyfriend comments on how good it smells. I feel like royalty when I have it on. It smells differently on everyone and I think it just works for me. It can be used by men as well. Spicy, warm, distant flower undertones, and yes, it goes on as black liquid that turns transparent afterwards. The bottle is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good smell and last a long time. And the price is also quite good for 100ml size.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stand lady gaga but I can&#x27;t get enough of this scent! Bought if for my wife and I loooove when he wears it!</li>
    <li> amazing it arrived with just 1 day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love Lady Gaga and Im her big fan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . .</li>
    <li> love the smell of it...</li>
    <li> about 30 mL of this stuff in stores retails for anywhere from $25-$30 and I got 100 mL for $20! and free shipping! What could be better than that! And this stuff smells amazing. I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> Excellent article, the size is perfect, the package arrived closed and without problems, it is an excellent purchase, fully recommended</li>
    <li> although im not crazy about this perfume it fades a minute after you put it on,the seller is the best got this faster then the perfume i ordered before this one,i will by from them again just not lady gaga</li>
    <li> I know Lady Gaga is crazy wild and I though this was going to smell crazy but NO totally the opposite. I get great complements from man and woman even moms telling me I smell good. This is my favorite one so far, until someone make something that can top this one. I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes and this one is perfect, who ever doesn&#x27;t like this one is obviously allergic or doesn&#x27;t know perfume but instead eau de toilette.</li>
    <li> Great price on a perfume that my daughter loves. The smell is nice for a young girl or a grown woman.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of this perfume at Christmas last year and it smelled great but it was gone within an hour. I always thought it was diluted. I switched to this seller because this product is backed by Amazon. Right away when I opened this bottle of Fame I knew it was different. It smells amazing and I sprayed it early this morning and it still smells just like when I first sprayed it. Thank you seller.</li>
    <li> This is a very good deal for the quality &amp; quantity of the product. I would have ended up paying almost just as much for the smaller bottle had I bought it in the store I saw it in originally. I love this perfume and will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Smells so good but not stay longer</li>
    <li> I enjoyed it. Smells refreshing and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t too cloying, it&#x27;s a very wearable, classic, and unique scent. So you can express your little monster pride and smell great every day.</li>
    <li> The scent is very grown but beautiful! What caught my eye was the packaging! Its soooo glam dark esssk. The gold and black detail really is amazing and the structure that went into making it is great! I love this! The cap is metal and it holds in place well. The black liquid color is very intriguing but does not stain or come off that dark at all. The bottle is beautiful to look at and next to the scent probably the best part (:</li>
    <li> What is not to like? It&#x27;s an very pleasant and distinctive fragrance. By no means is it one of those smell once and move on kinds. It is also safe for guys who aren&#x27;t self conscious about how masculine they smell. It is truly one of the few fragrances they are really believe is unisex. Of course, everyone has his or her individual taste--so make sure you have smelled it first before buying!</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells so good. I wear it alot and always get compliments each time. The bottle is gorgeous and the black liquid how creative.</li>
    <li> Heavy, cloying, long-lasting run of honey and vanilla with late afternoon florals. Not a winner on my skin - now I just need to find someone else to give it too and I can go cleanse my soul with a little lavender.</li>
    <li> I bought this without knowing if I&#x27;d like it and I love it! It is smoky and sweet, with a rich layered fragrance that is almost addictive. I love smelling it on me. It is not cloying as some have said. I do not like sweet perfumes; the sweetness is balanced by the incense smokiness. One description says it is fruity - it is not fruity at all - at least not on me. It is more exotic and sort of oriental than anything. I definitely plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle and magnificent fragrance. Came earlier than expected and in several protective boxes! And no it does not contain nor does it smell like blood or semen. Just good ol&#x27; perfume!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL ITS AMAZINGGG! I was battling against taylor swift&#x27;s wonderstruck enchanted and Gaga won all the way!! BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome! Not what I expected when I bought it, but definitely a good purchase for anyone! Male or female....</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Such a classic scent!</li>
    <li> great parfum, arrived perfectly</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and great lasting sound.  I don&#x27;t really like the designer but she sure can make great perfume!  My second and won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
    <li> Got this because I tested it in a store and couldnt stop smelling my wrist. Ordered it off Amazon, got quickly, packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;black fluid&amp;#34;.... YES INDEED. It also says &amp;#34;turns clear when sprayed&amp;#34;. NO IT DOESN&#x27;T. When I went to spray it on my white shirt it left a bunch of tiny black dots. Not happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however LOVE the smell. Smells mysteriously sweet like you cant pin point exactly what it is so you just want to keep smelling it LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps at least one person :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume, its been my favorite for a while, lasts forever and NO the black does not stain your clothing or skin unless you literally crack open and dump the bottle on you! Used it for 2+ years now I have never had a problem with any staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only bad note is the packaging. The box was completely bent and screwed up when I arrived but luckily the bottle was perfectly unscathed.</li>
    <li> Fame is my new favorite fragrance! It is so classic and sophisticated! 😍</li>
    <li> this is my new favorite perfume probably will buy it again when i run out</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it</li>
    <li> smells great but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite perfume.....and will forever be....get lots of compliments about my smell on a daily basis.....love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves its smell .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It&#x27;s my signature scent for work and I get compliments on how I smell all the time!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and I wear it all the time!</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume once when it first came out in a dept. store. I just recently purchased this as the price was significantly lowered and thought what a great deal. Although the smell is what I remembered, it literally lasts on my skin for MAYBE 30 minutes.. being generous. I&#x27;m not sure if this is just watered down or just plain old (which explains the price, they want it out of their warehouse), but regardless, I can&#x27;t smell it on my skin after an hour. Very disappointing as I don&#x27;t see the point of wearing a perfume if you can&#x27;t even smell it...</li>
    <li> I read a ton of reviews before purchasing and I&#x27;m happy to say this scent is as awesome as advertised. Absolutely satisfied. Shipping was smooth.</li>
    <li> I liked Fame a lot when I first smelled it at the store.  I sprayed some from the sample and I could still smell it the next&lt;br /&gt;morning.  However, what I purchased from Amazon was no way as long lasting and the smell was lost within a short&lt;br /&gt;time.  I don&#x27;t know why the difference but for the price I will buy a different brand that I wear instead of this.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing however, I&#x27;m not sure if I just get very used to it during the day or if it fades fast.  I LOVE the smell! I&#x27;m just unsure about how long it will last because I seem to have to apply more of it than I do with other perfumes.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my wife after smelling it in a store. We love it because it smells very classic, like old-school ladies&#x27; perfume, not the fruity, overpowering stuff that is so standard these days. We also happen to be huge Lady Gaga fans, so it was a perfect choice.</li>
    <li> Ordered this in the height of Christmas shopping season, it arrived in less than a week(used free shipping option). It was the only parfum that my granddaughter wanted and she was thrilled when she opened it on Christmas. Smells really nice, not too sweet.  I&#x27;m considering getting a bottle for myself.</li>
    <li> Well someone love parfume. So I didn&#x27;t know it was a hint. But am so glad I did. Its really sexy and sweet smelling that will not burn your nose. And the price was one of the best around in stores or online. Again Amazon comes through again.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The scent is one that brings memories of tea, flowers and freedom.i always get compliments on this fragrance when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT GIVE IT A FIVE STAR IS BECAUSE THE FRAGRANCE DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG.&lt;br /&gt;STRAW-BRONX, NY</li>
    <li> This perfume smells incredibly sexy... the smell has lasted on me for hours and it&#x27;s basically stuck inside of my nose! (which isn&#x27;t a problem in this case because it smells absolutely amazing! Smells like amazing guy cologne...but with the sweet and subtle smell of a woman. I don&#x27;t even know how to describe that. maybe this would help.... belongs next to dior--- at the price of dior too! its a classy dark amazing fragrance. Lady GaGa, you are the bomb.</li>
    <li> I am a total scent snob and was skeptical when I ordered this out of curiosity for myself.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised!  Unlike many celebrity scents, Fame actually has the very sexy musky undertones of a much more expensive perfume.  Also, you can&#x27;t find a cooler bottle for the price if you get the 3.4 ounce! Had to get another bottle I love it so much!</li>
    <li> Loved the price , love the perfume and shipping didn&#x27;t take that long. Got one for my sister and I , she loved it as well</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the price is right!!!!</li>
    <li> Great bargain and wonderful scent!</li>
    <li> It was cheap considering others so I was afraid to get something else, but not. Clean delivery, exactly what I was ordered</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas.  The price is comparable to Department Store prices.  The fragrance comes in a nice, large bottle and is the first black liquid perfume that vaporizes clear.  The scent is full and nice.  Lady Gaga Fame is this years must have perfume!</li>
    <li> We purchased this cologne for our daughter and she absolutely loves it.  Not only does it smell fantastic, the scent stays on through the day.  It&#x27;s clean and rich... very nice.</li>
    <li> I FEEL LIKE GAGA, AND I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> It came as promised and it was packaged well. I&#x27;m glad I bought this product.</li>
    <li> Got a small sample bottle for my wife for Valentines Day and she LOVES it. Has a nice spicy seductiveness to it. Begged me to get her more. Bought her 2 bottles so she dosen trun our any time soon.</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas present for my g/f. She loves it. It does smell really good. She uses it often and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> i love this smell i love its really good would buy it again but now im good with one ^^</li>
    <li> This was a great price and great product for Christmas. Hope to see more fragrances for sale soon! ! !</li>
    <li> From the appearance of this bottle, I expected a fragrance that was musky or dark.  But what I got was something bright and fruity-floral!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use a little, so the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last all day, but what a start to my morning.  One spray of Lady Gaga Fame and I&#x27;m happy.  It&#x27;s a beautiful scent.  One that I don&#x27;t tire of (and one that my family doesn&#x27;t complain about at all).  It doesn&#x27;t create a cloud around me, like some other fragrances do.  It&#x27;s very personal and I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this perfume for anyone who enjoys a fragrance that&#x27;s on the sweeter side.</li>
    <li> I smelled this at my Walgreens, and I did not like it. After a couple of hours I smelled it on my wrist and fell in love. I knew I had to buy the real deal. Found out I could get the largest size on amazon for really cheap, so I jumped at it. I went back to Walgreens to see if I regret my decision, and i did. Until it came in the mail--- in the prettiest black box. The bottle is heavy but elegant. Yet I&#x27;m intrigued with the black liquid, and it smells amazing! i get so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. I seriously thought it was gonna smell like sweat, sex and smoke. But it smells so feminine and sexy. My new favorite scent!</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume, love this one!</li>
    <li> Purchased two bottles for Christmas.  They were a hit and for the price, it was well worth it.  Could not have been happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was only looking for purfume but i got a huge package . there are 2 other things along with perfume. and smell of the perfume is better than i expected so overall a happy guy here</li>
    <li> Bought this as a part of my girlfriend&#x27;s Christmas present. This perfume smells great and is inexpensive. Needless to say, it is now her go to perfume.</li>
    <li> I recieved a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; bottle...... NO claws, which , I have now been told, Is the most important part !  As this was given as a Christmas gift..... just a bit embarrasing</li>
    <li> Lady Gaga, famous for her strange wardrobe and catchy songs, now she is known for having the first black coloured perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is not black. In fact the colour black you are seeing is the colour of the perfume in a clear bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I first smelled this perfume on piece of paper and did not think too highly of it. The second time I sprayed it on my skin and I was amazed&lt;br /&gt;at the smell once it settled. Definitely not the same smell I was getting off the paper. I guess it smells better off the skin (which is how it should be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice, sweet smelling perfume. I was a little surprised because I thought Lady Gaga would go for a dark, strong smelling perfume like her image in the media.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it last&#x27;s a long time !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, once you spray the perfume, the perfume comes on invisible so you won&#x27;t have black stains on your clothes and skin.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance but do wish it had more staying power. I sprayed it on today just after 10am and it was longggg gone before 4pm. I plan to purchase a smaller, more &amp;#34;travel friendly&amp;#34; bottle to keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> Now i can smell like an expensive hooker! LADY GAGA</li>
    <li> i love this perfume! its smells a mix of fruit and incense. A lil powdery but a great mix! My brother and my father and my sister smelled this on me and they said they really loved the smell! and theyre picky when it comes to womens perfume!!! I sprayed this on about 3 hours ago and i just recently took a shower and i still smell it on me!! its pretty strong and can be overpowering if you spray too much of it. Just spray yourself once, thats all you need! Smells amazing. I am NOT a lady gaga fan, i could care less about her...I never cared for celebrity fragrances for a while cuz so many of them smell very cheap and or something a 15 year old would wear. I must say this is the first time that lady gaga has impressed me! it deff smells like something you should wear at night time, a lil too strong during the day. At it smells like something a woman can wear NOT a lil teenager. And the price is just great too! only $20! LADIES you dont need to buy expensive perfume to smell good! This does NOT smell cheap at all. I love this, one of my fav perfumes! Like i said before, i always hated the celebrity perfumes...Even including britney spears Fantasy which i never liked and never understood the hype about it. Now my top fav perfumes are mostly celebrity perfumes! (i still cant believe it lol). This perfume is good, as well as Paris hiltons Can Can, and taylor swift Wonderstruck...AND LADIES!!!... ive seen plenty of negative reveiws about this which confuses me...cuz plenty of guys i came across had nothing but positive things to say about this perfume ;)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!!</li>
    <li> I like this scent. It reminds me of &#x27;old school&#x27; fragrances. Not too fruity or floral.  Just nice. Good value.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, and lady gaga is my lady!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes. It just smells amazing. Mixes very well with my skin. Shipping was so FAST!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume when I first spray it on.  But an hour later I can specifically sniff the spots where I sprayed it, and I smell nothing.  I&#x27;ve even asked other people if they smell the fragrance and they say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.  I really feel like is was jipped on this purchase.  Buyer beware.  Try this on at the store first and see if the fragrance stays with you before you buy.</li>
    <li> exactly as stated great price</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t ship it to Saudi Arabia as the shipper is saying it&#x27;s hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases and cannot be returned to Amazon for the same reason so unless your in USA DON&#x27;T ORDER IT!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. The smell is very good and stays for all day. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I will buy this parfum again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this SEVERAL times. Because I love the way it smells, both on me and my bed/etc lol&lt;br /&gt;Always arrives in a timely fashion</li>
    <li> the perfume bottle is 100 beautiful it smells great I love this perfume</li>
    <li> I am used to wearing very sweet, candy-like perfumes such as Hearts and Daggers by Ed Hardy. I got this thinking it was going to smell a little more &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34;, and boy did it deliver. It smells like the transition in to &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; (super floral) perfume. It goes on very strong and moderately floral (which I DO NOT like). After a while it fades to something sweeter, and smokier, but it still has a hint of floral. Do not buy if you cannot stand any form of floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the scent . Its soft enough for me to tolerate and strong enough for people to notice. a few close friends who trade my gaga obessions say I smell like an old lady but I take it asa compliment. That is just a funny way of sayin my scent is classic. I can age with this scent if that&#x27;s the case lol</li>
    <li> I adore this fragrance and receive lots of compliments when I wear it, which is all the time.</li>
    <li> Love the design of bottle, color perfume and especially  the scent just wish it didn&#x27;t fade so fast.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  It is her favorite perfume of all time as she says!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this perfume. It&#x27;s a little too strong at first but when it dries, it leaves a sexy, sensual and womanly smell that lingers for more than 24 hours. I like how 3 sprays are enough to last me a day. I happen to be a Lady Gaga fan too so this perfume was the perfect choice when I decided to stop using Miss Dior.</li>
    <li> This product smells incredible. It arrived on time and in great condition, the bottle is lovely as well. I will definitely be purchasing more !!!</li>
    <li> She absolutely loves the perfume. It smells fantastic on her. Will probably get more after she uses this up . Thanks</li>
