      <li>My hair is short, thin, and fragile and the brush does not tangle or cause static.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read the description and thought this would slide through my hair but NO, it grabs onto the hair and won&#x27;t let go.  Painful!</li>
    <li> I tried this tool in a hair salon years ago and began what is now a loving and obsessive relationship with an amazing brush.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have about five of these scattered around, one in bag, car, bathroom, empty space between ears, and basically wherever I can find room for one. No tangles or static for my fine, straight hair while I fluff it up with a blowdryer. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush!  I wanted a brush where the nubs on the end were big enough so that it doesn&#x27;t scrape my scalp. That is why the 5 stars.  I have short hair, so it being small is no problem, and it is small.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and I have been trying to find a brush that is small enough to use when styling it with a blow dryer.  This brush is perfect.  I have one at home and one in my purse.  I absolutely love them.  They are also easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for years after being introduced to it by my hair stylist. It works perfectly for short hair and holds up very well. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> THis is my favorite brush...i have short fine hair and it works perfectly for it.  I carry one in my purse, keep one at home and one in the car.</li>
    <li> I have short hair so I need a small roller brush.  I have one that I use at home &amp; I&#x27;ve been taking back &amp; forth to the gym.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this in the local stores.  It arrived and is perfect.  I now have my older one in the toiletry case I keep in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> Good small round brush</li>
    <li> Perfect compact hair brush, great for keeping a few tucked in the car, desk, etc. Others I had were made of wood and didn&#x27;t last.  These are all synthetic. Does a great job and super convenient.</li>
    <li> After years of having my wife cut my hair in the same style I&#x27;ve had since the early 2000&#x27;s she forced me to go to an actual salon for a new do. I thank her for that since I look awesome now. The witchcraft that was done to me at the hair studio looks great.  As a guy I was used to low maintenance haircuts. This new style requires more work than I&#x27;m used to, but this brush makes it very easy to do. I&#x27;m no expert on hair tools, but this does the job easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of brush for many years, so for me to repurchase it was no brainer.</li>
    <li> This my second brush like this.  I wanted one for my purse.  I have short, stubborn hair, and this brush helps me to keep the ends turned under and working with along with the rest of the hairdo.  It&#x27;s sort of my &amp;#34;Mathatma Ghandi&amp;#34; brush, bringing peace to my hair.  :-)</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY! Fantastic Shipping!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush along with other \\&quot;shipping free\\&quot; items.  The brush is perfect, great quality, handles very well and just what I wanted.  The sour note came when I saw a price tag on the handle of the brush.  It was marked $4.95 and I paid $6.30, $1.35 more.  Is that a hidden cost for \\&quot;free shipping?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have any other brush. This is the second brush that I&#x27;ve had. The first lasted over 12 years and when the little red&lt;br /&gt;ends started coming off it was time for a new one.</li>
    <li> great for short hair,does not get static electricity,was was a little higher price then i wanted to pay but was worth it.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  Great service, great price.</li>
    <li> This was the wrong product for me.  The inside core is, perhaps, 1/2 inch in diameter.  Your hair would have to be less than 2 inches long for this to be an effective styling aid without the hair wrapping around the core and becoming dangerously tangled.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as promised &amp; described.</li>
    <li> Small roll brush for my short heavy and coarse hair.  Works perfectly and light weight for my travels.  Would buy this one again for sure.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, i use it all the time, very soft.</li>
    <li> perfect for thick hair, it is kind to the scalp too.  I can style my hair with very easily with it.</li>
    <li> I have a short bob and this brush adds volume and lift.  Good value and would recommend to others with short hair.  Couldn&#x27;t find one this small in retail stores.</li>
    <li> For short hair like mine it worked great.</li>
    <li> Not really static free brush.  Just another dryer brush.  Nothing particularly special about this brush.  Does the job but so do others.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush! It curls hair very easily, fast and free shipping! Not easy to find in the stores at this price!</li>
    <li> This brush is great for not getting tangled. I recommend it to anyone who has long hair. My old brush actually got tangled to the point I had to cut my hair. I love this brush.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great timely Delv.! Great Price! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is exactly what I was needing.</li>
    <li> I really like this round brush!  My hair is short, thin, and fragile and the brush does not tangle or cause static.</li>
    <li> !ich better product than I&#x27;ve been buying in local stores.  It is easy to grip. doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp, and works well with either wet or dry hair.</li>
