<li> i hve sensitive skin...a little burning sensation around my eyes tho</li>
<li> : KEEPS THE MAKE UP IN PLACE AND KEEPS MY SKIN DRY.</li>
<li> It ruined the look of my foundation giving it a clumpy overly dry look.  </li>
<li> Fairly easy to take off with cold cream.</li>
<li> After the product dried it left a visible film on my face.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this through extreme heat t</li>
<li> All it does is get my face and makeup wet!</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many different makeup setting sprays in the past, and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve tried by far.</li>
<li> You can find this for less than half the price at Target, Ulta and anywhere else that sells ELF.</li>
<li> It does make my face look a little shiny.</li>
<li> Kinda crazy that I have spent up to $90 on one makeup product and spent only $5 on this</li>
<li> Waste of money, just save up your money to get something else.</li>
<li> It smells a little weird, but the smell dissipates after a minute or two.</li>
<li> BUT it looked terrible and very unnatural.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different makeup setting sprays in the past, and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve tried by far. It doesn&#x27;t set anything! All it does is get my face and makeup wet! I&#x27;ve tried spraying it closer and further away, and it still sets absolutely nothing. Waste of money, just save up your money to get something else.</li>
    <li> i dont find that this makes my makeup last any longer..but if all you are going for is to get rid of that powdery look..this will do that for you and at an affordable price...also try rose water same price for more(which you can find at your local Indian store)</li>
    <li> Lovely product. There was no smell and it kept my makeup perfect all day and throughout the night. I slept on my makeup with only one application and it was ALL still in place. Fairly easy to take off with cold cream. Not harsh or drying, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> AWESOME works wonderfully!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I do have to say loreal makes a better one you can buy at your local rote aid.</li>
    <li> Great product! It also got here within 5 days.</li>
    <li> Once I apply this after finishing my makeup, it gives me a dewy summer glow.. If my makeup looks pales it brightens up my face. I won&#x27;t agree with it making foundation last longer. Because it doesnt</li>
    <li> Nice light spray. Feel great after make up applications.</li>
    <li> amazing use it everyday after i set my face with my rimmel stay matte translucent powder or my mehron setting powder. Makeup last all day through heat, makes makeup flawless!</li>
    <li> Works great -- first time in my life I can wear eyeshadow!!! But FYI it&#x27;s only $3 at T a r g e t!</li>
    <li> You can find this for less than half the price at Target, Ulta and anywhere else that sells ELF. I was foolish not to research that. It smells a little weird, but the smell dissipates after a minute or two. Works ok.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping set my makeup and make it last longer or not. If I have to wipe my nose or something, plenty of makeup still comes off. But I keep using it anyway. It does make my face look a little shiny.</li>
    <li> Best ever. Kinda crazy that I have spent up to $90 on one makeup product and spent only $5 on this and it holds its own</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this through extreme heat t and it kept all my makeup in place. I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look. I just spray it 3 to 4 times from an arm length away after I&#x27;ve done all my makeup and it works wonders. It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying. I&#x27;ll repurchase this for sure - soon!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I got it for a great price</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING THIS MIST AND I AM LOVING IT, I DO NOT LEAVE HOME WITHOUT ANY MAKE BUT I HAVE VERY OILY SKIN SO THIS SETTING SPRAY IS DOING A GOOD JOB ON MY FACE: KEEPS THE MAKE UP IN PLACE AND KEEPS MY SKIN DRY.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product after reading rave reviews.  I have oily skin and have always had trouble keeping my makeup looking fresh throughout the day.  I have started using primers before I apply my foundation which has helped, but I still have not found anything to keep eyeshadow in place.  I have only tried the ELF mist &amp; set once.  I was very disappointed.  It ruined the look of my foundation giving it a clumpy overly dry look.  After the product dried it left a visible film on my face.  My makeup did stay all day BUT it looked terrible and very unnatural.  I am going to give this one more try.  I plan to use it with a different foundation to see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> Its a good roduct even tho i hve sensitive skin...a little burning sensation around my eyes tho</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is amazing! I did not realize how important setting your makeup was until I used this. I even went for a run and everything stayed in place!</li>
    <li> Love this! It is my first makeup setting spray. It has no smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now. I spray it on in the morning and it last all day I&#x27;ve played tennis in it and my makeup is just as fresh as it was when I put it on in the morning! Gray product. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Listen I posted before about this product that I would purchase it again!!! I have, I love it, it works, I love it, must have product! Delivered right on time, I was really, really low on my last bottle and it came right when I used the last ounce of it! Thanks a million!!!!!!</li>
