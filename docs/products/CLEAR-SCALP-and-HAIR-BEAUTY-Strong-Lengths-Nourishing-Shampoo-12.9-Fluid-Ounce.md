    <li> There are better brands of shampoo, but it is a decent product.</li>
    <li> Fine all-in-one-shampoo for my teenage son. He likes it, it works, it doesn&#x27;t smell strongly - a win/win.</li>
    <li> my very picky teenage son loves this stuff, and now Walmart doesn&#x27;t carry it nor any place else I can find so you have to get it online. Wish it were a little cheaper. he likes the sensitive scalp formula with ginseng.</li>
    <li> My husband complained of an itchy scalp so I did some shopping around to see if I could find a product he might use that would help.  I have also tried this product.  He no longer has an itchy scalp.  Even though I use premium salon shampoos, the times I do use this, it leaves my hair clean, de-tangled, and smelling great. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Well This say 21.9 FL OZ. and I was sent 16 FL OZ. Please fix this.&lt;br /&gt;3 Stars for misleading title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is 5/5. Smells great and is the best anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Wrong picture. Made me believe that I was getting the one with tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Great for controlling dandruff. It combines a conditioner so when you have used it and rinsed it off you are through! On occasion I will use a &#x27;tar&#x27; based shampoo first and finish with this. Using this two or three times a week helps rid the &#x27;snowfall&#x27; that I always had in the past. This product is hard to find in the local drug stores and until I purchased from Amazon, I never found it in the larger pump bottles!</li>
    <li> This shampoo-conditioner is literally the only thing that has helped my boyfriend with his dandruff problem. It also seems to keep his hair soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like this old shampoo used to. It really is a good quality product and it honestly works for dandruff issues. I myself use it occasionally with equally good results.</li>
    <li> For the shampoo itself, I can rate it 5/5 stars, but the package just makes it terrible. There&#x27;s no protection under the release button so the shampoo will go out everywhere with the shake during transportation. I suggest consider to buy it from local store or walmart, they have better protection</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft, and my scalp itch free. So far so good. Large size should last a long time.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;little man&amp;#34; in our house started experiencing dandruff issues when all his hormones started going wild in puberty.

    <li> Best value in 1% Zinc shampoo on the market. Leaves my hair clean, soft and helps with scalp conditions.</li>
    <li> Good smell and seems to clean well.  I don&#x27;t have a dander issue but like the fact that it prevents/treats that problem.</li>
    <li> Overall very effective in keeping dandruff away.  Compared to Head and Shoulders, Suave Dandruff, and countless others this is by far more effective.  I also use it as a body wash and it works great.</li>
    <li> Helped to cure my dandruff! I only use Clear!</li>
    <li> Returned because the picture shows the old formula but Clear has repacked and changed the formula and it is NOT the same.  Totally dries out my hair.  The only thing I can think of is there is less tea tree oil...since it is no longer on the front of the bottle.  Looks like I have to find something else.  Always nice when you find something that works and it is changed.</li>
    <li> A lot of the shampoo was spilled in the box !!! Shampoo got spilled all over dvd covers. There was no protection around the bottles; poor packaging for the shampoo bottles. I would recommend not to continue packaging like this for other customers.</li>
