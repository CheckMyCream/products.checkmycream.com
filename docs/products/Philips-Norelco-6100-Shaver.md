<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The charging stand does not make reliable contact for charging.  To charge, the stand has to be upright and unfolded.  Then the razor makes touch contact with two prongs that stick out the sides.  Any movement and the charging stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In previous Philips razors the cord plugged directly into both the razor or the stand, so the stand was optional.  The charging connection was always solid and reliable, and worked at any angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why they replaced a solid workable design with a fancy-looking unreliable inconvenient piece of plastic I wish I knew.</li>
    <li> Worst trimmer I have ever used.This is my third trimmer and all my trimmers were from Philips and other low cost models that I have used are way better than this one. I went with the reviews seen here , but I got totally wrong with this one.May be the item that I received was defective , but i thought since instructions booklet attached mentioned to use for more than a month to adjust trimmer to our facial contours. There&#x27;s no improvement and worse ,now that its over refund period  that i cannot return it.Problem I see with this trimmer is , I need to use my razors to take care of hair in my neck and around that.AND THAT&#x27;S AFTER STRUGGLING WITH THIS TRIMMER FOR 30 MINUTES!!! by that time my hands were hurting using this one.Anyway , if you are like me and unhappy with this one , don&#x27;t hang on to this for longer to see any improvement and JUST RETURN IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile if any one of you can tell me if I can return this some way or contact some number , that would be great(I got this product around Jan 10 this year)</li>
    <li> very soon.almost one week</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut as close as my conventional razor, but is definitely more convenient. Not as good as I expected it would be though.</li>
    <li> Shave skin irritation. Estimated period of time to get used to</li>
    <li> Bought it for husband and he loves it. He says it is easy and gives him a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is the second philips 1150 x I bought, as always, good quality, especially can experience the best service in the world, very happy. The amazon&#x27;s customer service has good quality and service attitude more than the product itself, shopping here, it is a kind of enjoyment, in a word, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was traveling, unfortunately right out and plug it did not turn on at all, does not work and turn on the lights of the product, I&#x27;m in Mexico and I need to find someone who can review.</li>
    <li> Much improved over the &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; Norelco electric razor.  I&#x27;m happy with it and it seems to shave even closer than the old style.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing close to a razor blade. The design is really gorgeous but it is not what I expected at all!!</li>
    <li> THE SOUND IS A BIT LOUND.IN A WORD, IT IS STILL GOOD.</li>
    <li> Shipped really fast.  The only problem is that this didn&#x27;t come with the click-on beard styler.  It even says bonus beard styler on the box.  But it&#x27;s alright,  I just had to order the styler separately.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I am doing wrong but I&#x27;m not getting a good shave under the chin and neck area. It actually takes much longer compare to a razor to get the desire outcome. I&#x27;m not satisfied, the reason I gave it 3 stars was because it does do a good job on the face with less irritation and if you prefer to shave on the fly or in your car but don&#x27;t expect to have smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did a great job replacing the charging cord that was missing from my order, thank you for the excellent service Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my first order at amazon,good!</li>
    <li> Works well, but still requires multiple passes to get everything (and I still seem to miss some stubborn hairs). I haven&#x27;t used the beard trimmer yet because it&#x27;s too much hassle to switch the two heads. It would be nice if it was just part of the razor. Also, there is no carrying case, which might be nice.</li>
    <li> I recently lost my Panasonic Arc IV which I used for over 3 years.  I decided to try a rotary style shaver and this model had amazing reviews for its price point.  Maybe there&#x27;s a special way to shave with these electric razors but my skin was very irritated from daily use on my face.  I made sure not to press too hard and even used expensive shaving cream with brush.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is still recovering from razor burn and after 2 weeks of use, I have stopped.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another Panasonic Arc IV and my skin is not getting better without increased irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Once you find a good electric razor, stick with it.  Don&#x27;t switch from linear to rotatory if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for the 2 star is that it does have a pretty close shave.  I&#x27;ll still spend the extra money and get the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> good ,Can be clean-shaven.</li>
    <li> I really love this razor! I purchased this for $70 + duty fees which came to about $88 with a coupon which was a great price, considering it sells for over $150 here in Canada. The only problem I&#x27;m having is that it is missing some spots on my neck and I have to go over it multiple times. I love how you can shave in the shower with it and it gives no problems. I also used the beard trimmer and it is AMAZING. It makes grooming my beard so much faster compared to my old conair beard trimmer. I would recommend this razor 100% - shaves great wet or dry. I hope to one day get a razor that will shave my neck properly...</li>
    <li> Got this for our brother in law for Christmas.  So far so good ;)</li>
    <li> It is a good mustache shaver</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome I love it. I had a Remington shaver that I paid around the same amount for which pulled my hair and gave me a rash on my neck. This shaver on the other hand shaves my face and neck like nothing, cuts very close and is much more well made. Definitely sticking with nerelco shavers from now on.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that the trimmer has adjustable lengths, but have to get used to swapping the shaver and trimmer heads. Overall it works great and I will give it a 4.5/5 rating.</li>
    <li> Hard to fit on and clean blades and shaver.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver a good three week tryout and just became less and less satisfied with it with every shave. I found myself having to rake this razor across my face SEVERAL times just to cut visible hairs leading to more and more irritation. It seems like the razor just doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.&lt;br /&gt;It also needs a pop-up trimmer. You can&#x27;t trim up at all with the shaver head if you have side burns or a goatee and switching out with the beard trimmer takes too much time. I found myself spending more time trying to shave with this razor than if I had just done it proper and used shaving cream and a traditional razor. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The face is very comfortable</li>
    <li> I bought this several months ago and I do not like it. My previous model was a Philips Norelco 8240xl and even though I really liked the 8240xl, rather than buy new blades, I would just buy a new and improved model. MY MISTAKE. Norelco took several steps backward with this Sensotouch. In all fairness, the Sensotouch does everything it claims and it really looks neat. I should have known there would be an issue when the instructions said &amp;#34;it may take a few weeks for the shaver to adapt to the contours of your face&amp;#34;. How about 7 months and I&#x27;m still waiting for the contour thing. Maybe if I never used an electric shaver before, I would have thought that this shaver was &amp;#34;the norm&amp;#34; for electric shavers. But remember, I was comparing this to several previous Philips Norelco shavers that I owned.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD: It will shave your face. I really liked the looks.&lt;br /&gt;NOT SO GOOD: REALLY IS NOISY. My previous Norelco&#x27;s were quiet and hummed right along. The Sensotouch sounded like a thrashing machine.&lt;br /&gt;NOT A CLOSE SHAVE like my previous Norelco&#x27;s. The shave was adequate, but barely. I used the Sensotouch in a clockwise pattern, a counterclockwise pattern, up and down, side-to-side, all with the same result - not a close shave. (I did clean it after every use)&lt;br /&gt;I would put this shaver value in the $25-$30  dollar category.</li>
    <li> To awkward to clean , trimmer hard to use, requires assembly each time used, .. Sending it back to Phillips under guarantee.</li>
    <li> Very good, price is very affordable! Thinking of buying a few more to friends</li>
    <li> the razer does a great job on my face</li>
    <li> I got this as a time saver. The problem is that it does not seem to shave closely in a single (or even triple) pass. Further, it seems to get clogged over the course of a single shave. Its worth noting that I shave daily so there is no reason this should be the case.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVER I EVER HAD !</li>
    <li> I have been completely unhappy with this razor, the quality of the shave is horrible wet or dry. I find myself going over the same area of the face numerous times with very little results. Please keep in mind I do not have a heavy beard, I would not recommend this product especially at this price range.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just as ecpected and very useful, maybe i&#x27;ll get another one for my friend.I like it very much.OH YEAH</li>
    <li> Good machine. It is better if it can stand by itself.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend as his birthday&#x27;s gift. He loves it very much! It shaves clean and gentle.</li>
    <li> It did not work out for me. A day after a shave left my face looking horrible with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend said it is good.</li>
    <li> Definitely covers more area.  Smooth shave.  Didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34;  hair like previous norelco.  Not a fan of charging unit.  Cord must plug into plastic charger,  then shaver goes into charger.  I like a 2 piece system (shaver and cord only).  Less to transport for travel.  Overall,  nice shaver.</li>
    <li> I was looking for electric shaver and after good research, I have decided to buy this product as this is in the middle range better reviews than the basic models (PT724/46, PT730/46 etc.) from Philips and better in terms of price compared to the other high end models which are more than $200. Looking at the reviews of this products, decided on this and bought this. The initial couple of weeks were bad with skin irritation. I thought it would take sometime for my skin and beard to get used to the electric shaver as mentioned in the product description and believed that it would be better eventually and have been using at least once every week. But still having rashes on the skin resulting in black marks on the skin, even after following the way (use in circular motion to shave off your beard) to use the shaver. As I have been waiting that things would be better, I did not realize that its been more than 45 days that I could not utilize the money back offer from the manufacturer, ah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other bad thing with this is, it leaves off one off hairs during the shave and it is irritating that I realize it after going to work and it become uncomfortable until I come back use the freaking thing to remove those one offs, which never happens when you shave manually, this could be a thing with all the electric shavers. Overall, I am not satisfied with this purchase and moving back to manual shaving.</li>
    <li> Is a really nice product and worth the money. Both of us use it!!</li>
    <li> Does all I ask it to do with ease to clean and change heads. Woks as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers since I was 18 and this one is the best yet.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m JUST going to take it as a gift. BUT I believe that it can be a good gift.&lt;br /&gt;Such a nice design!</li>
    <li> Good  good  good  good good good&lt;br /&gt;) very nice nice very very goob) excelent.wonderful.perfect.very glad bying the goods from there</li>
    <li> This thing felt like a weak little pansy in the hand. It took me forever to shave my face with this object. I like that it was water proof but it does not have the power to do what it was made to do. I bought this thing to replace my Braun that I&#x27;ve had for 5 years. My Braun still has the original blade and it still does a better job. Maybe it is just my beard but it didn&#x27;t do it for me. One thing I will say for the seller. They made it so easy to return. I really appreciated how the seller set up the return process. I didn&#x27;t pay a thing and UPS came and picked up the package. So if you want to try this product and see it it will work for you I would say you should feel safe in doing it. Give it a shot. I didn&#x27;t want to give a bad review because it probably works great for some people. I give it three stars for being water proof and for the great customer service</li>
    <li> I DO love it.  Could use a travel Bag and / or case.  I understood that it came with one, but did not receive.</li>
    <li> Hubby says it shaves really cleanly and without pulling. He&#x27;s very happy with the attachments.</li>
    <li> Purchase this item for my boyfriend for Christmas. He enjoys using it daily and the beard trimmer came in handy for him. He loves it!!! Thank You</li>
    <li> Very good, Philips quality is very good, I the last Philips shaver in use for 6 years, and now I bought 1150 new razor, shaving is very convenient, clean. Thank Philips, thank amazon.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a gift.  high quality.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I used to really hate shaving.  With my old razor (also a Philips but cheaper model), if I didn&#x27;t shave every day or if I decided to change up the beard and sideburns, I would have to run through once with the clippers before using the razor, then I would get irritated skin from amount of time it took me to shave, going over same spots again and again.  I was amazed at how quickly I can get the same shave done with this product.  Not only can I shave more aggressively now and still not suffer irritation, I can shave longer hairs without needing to use clippers.  I love how easy it is to switch out the heads between razor and beard trimmer.  This thing is also looks cool and is pretty easy to clean.  Makes a mundane daily task more tolerable.</li>
    <li> This is the gift to my dad and he liked it.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED NORELCO RAZORS FOR 40 YEARS AND FIND THIS SHAVER NOT UP TO STANDARDS WITH PREVIOUS RAZORS. PROBABLY WILL SHOP AROUND NEXT TIME.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;the only problem i had is that it have no bag/case to it and it&#x27;s hard to find one at all</li>
    <li> great sturdy support board/ plank for wooden still on the bunk beds beds highly recommend for those big kids over 170lbs .light weight slim profile highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ve been a electric shaver user for 20 years and this is the worst product I&#x27;ve used to date.  My older razor is an 8240 I&#x27;ve had since 2012 I was actually going to buy replacement blades and saw this &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; item:  Here are my issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Totally different design done I suspect by a completely different team.  They started over and IMO made major design mistakes taking nothing from the success of the older lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Sound - this razor is loud, louder than the older razors and it does not shave as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Charger - terrible stand design making travel nearly impossible the stand does fold but is bulky and is not really a good alternative to the old plug into the bottom of the razor.  Also if you do happen to run the battery all the way down, too bad you can&#x27;t plug it in and shave you must wait for a recharge.  The old razor works when plugged into wall ( but you can&#x27;t with this wacky stand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Trimmer as an attachment is useless, the pop-up was good not great but this breaks any sort of useful work flow and makes the shave and the trim separate efforts.  The changing of the heads is not trivial and there is no place to sort the part bad design and missed the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Cleaning requires you to take the razor apart the flip up cleaning from the old model is gone,  another good design idea thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Shave quality:  Poor in comparison ( with year-old blades on the old razor) I&#x27;m not surprises is you compare side-by-side you&#x27;ll see the floating heads have fewer slots and the rotary blades have fewer cutting blades Shaving takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall perception is this is a clear move to cut costs and is a really bad entry in this market.  I used the razor for a week and went back to the old one I regret the purchase and consider this junk.  I write many more positive reviews than negative but this is so bad I&#x27;d like to help one person avoid a mistake.</li>
    <li> I expected this razor to give a better shave than it does.  I have an older Norelco and it shaves much better than this one.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Well, this item was a &amp;#34;Love´s day&amp;#34; gift from my wife, and i´m so happy to receive, but the problem is: the Razor Works so good that i look so handsome, and she could be a jealous.</li>
    <li> shippng fast  ,  good stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my father as for Father&#x27;s Day. Good products as well and my father liked it very much.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed in this razor.  It does not shave very close (i.e....I still have stubble once I&#x27;m done shaving).  Also, there were no directions included with the razor.  I have no clue how to switch out from the shaver to the beard trimmer, nor how to clean it, what the lights mean on the front, etc.  My other electric razor opens up so I can rinse it out between uses.</li>
    <li> Great Razor wiht nice quality and nice price, saved $30 by use groupon, very nice shaving feeling. I like it.</li>
    <li> Like the fast charging And the ability to shave dry or wet. Stand for charging and nice trimmer eliminates need for separate trimmer</li>
    <li> This is a gift to my father in law. He likes it very much. Thanks for Amazon to provide such a high performance product.</li>
    <li> Great quality razor for the money.  Bought for my husband started shaving again after having a beard for 10 years absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it shaved my face any better than the less expensive shavers which was a disappointment. It works well and holds a charge well but is not as easy to use as earlier, simpler, models.</li>
    <li> Very good, very comfortable to use!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Shave is so smooth and battery life is great</li>
    <li> It was Christmas gift for my husband and father and they love it smooth shave easy to handle my dad has arthritis so the easy grip makes his shaving an indepent pleasure again</li>
    <li> For 4 years I have been using a Panasonic ES8109 electric razor. It worked well for the most part but the auto cleaning system it has always gets clogged and my jaw and neck always burned a little bit after shaving. It was time again for new blades but I decided to research what is new and buy something different. I had never used a rotary shaver so this style became my focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set a budget of around $100, compared this that and the other, and ended up buying this Norelco 1150BT with the click on bead trimmer. I let my beard grow in for 5 days so I could really see what this thing could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow...just.....wow. I cannot believe I have been suffering for so long with that other razor! This thing cut through hair and gave me a great, close shave with ZERO razor burn! i didn&#x27;t even need to use any after shave gel to cool things down. It even got the hair off my neck  without having to use the trimmer first. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the way it feels, the way it shaves, the way it charges, and the trimmer is better than a stand alone trimmer I use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a goatee and like to keep it trimmed very tight. I have a beard trimmer with 5 settings that I have used for years to accomplish this but it never could get to that area right under my nose. I had to use a trimmer without any attachments to get that trimmed down. Well, this beard trimmer attachment actually gets to that area perfectly! It has 5 settings as well to let you adjust how closely it trims and you can also pop off the attachment to put a perfect line on your side burns. I can&#x27;t believe how precise the trimmer is on this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to all the problems I had with my previous self cleaning razor I won&#x27;t be buying one with a system like that again. But cleaning this razor is simple and takes 2 minutes, if that. They provide a couple of nice  little brushes to help with that and you can of course get things wet if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that my second shave did get me a slight burn on an area I over did things, but the instructions tell you this will happen as your face and skin get used to the new blades, etc. By week number 2 I was shaving without any burn what so ever. Anyway, I highly recommend this razor. I can&#x27;t tell you that opting for the 3D version and spending more money is worth the extra cash over this one but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s also fantastic. (I did read somewhere that you can buy the 3D head and it will fit on this model...)id get me a slight burn on an area I over did things, but the instructions tell you this will happen as your face and skin get used to the new blades, etc. By week number 2 I was shaving without any burn what so ever.

    <li> I give it away or own use are very good, it can dry and wet, can body wash, this is the place I love</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Performs similarly to other Norelco razors that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> very good!!!! Philips Norelco 1150BT/48 Sensotouch 2D Electric Razor with Click-On Beard...!!!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!!! Philips Norelco 1150BT/48 Sensotouch 2D Electric Razor with Click-On Beard...!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this gift for my boyfriend &amp; step dad. They both loved it. The razor was shipped very fast and in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. He said it gives him the best shave of any other razor he&#x27;s had.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my bf and he loved it. He said it works very well.</li>
    <li> I dont use it too often but I like it, by the way I like the trimming head, very powerful</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. They seem to improve them every year.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Philips shaver I used and by far the most comfortable one. The shaver head completely adapt to the face&#x27;s surface and it is a very comfortable and cozy touch. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this For my boy-friend&#x27;s birthday. At first he refuses because he had a razor and did not want to change. I told him to just try it, if he doesnt like it we Will return.  Well, all i can say is, he still has it so that goes to say how much he loves it!! Its an amazing invention!!</li>
    <li> Is very classical design, coveted gift, it is a great masterpiece, with it, the beard is no longer a problem, shaving is a enjoyable thing!</li>
    <li> My husband is very particular about his shaving tools, I ordered this for a gift and he couldn&#x27;t love it more. Close shave, minimal effort, no razor burn even when using dry. The charge holds for the full amount of shaving time and when necessary re-charges very quickly on the dock. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works wonderfully on my husbands face. So well he takes it to work and no more razors. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> First, lets start this right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT Buy this item, unless it is on sale, or you have a nice coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is great, shaves nice, no burn, and the extra attachment works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the 3 stars? why shouldn&#x27;t i buy this at full price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain and simple, its not worth the high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky and had a 30$ amazon credit, and a 30$ amazon coupon so i only paid around 29$ for this. Which was an amazing deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the lower powered shavers, the blades say they last for a year, but i can already tell, its gonna have to be changed out at around 6 months. I have to shave almost daily. You need to shave in small circles, then follow your hand and find the patches it doesn&#x27;t pickup and re shave the area in the direction against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, good shaver if you get it for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wouldn&#x27;t pay retail, but i would definitely recommend if you can get it at a bargain.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Price good. The real item is even better than pictures. I have no reason not to recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband love it so much!&lt;br /&gt;It is convient to use everyday and the color is pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the price is very nice.</li>
    <li> highly recommended. well designed, made in the netherlands. handy to operate, easy to recharge. DC can work in almost every country with a adapable voltage from 100V-250V, nice. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> I like the pivot capability, it allows me to glide across my face and leaves me with a smooth, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Nice razor . Bought it for my brother. He very likes it. It is easy to use during shower time.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I really like it. I  use it feel to great . I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The 1150BT/48 Senso Touch is Very good, cost-effective. Shaving very comfortable and very clean. Fast charging, fully charged.I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> not sure yet about the razor and the closeness of the shave</li>
    <li> Very good on time delivery.</li>
    <li> 3rd shaver bought from Norelco in last 25 years and they just get better</li>
    <li> awesome! like it! looks grand and Pro! thanks!</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave, the shape is easy to hold on to while shaving. Like the option of using shave cream too. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Good as it always to be. It&#x27;ll be better if price decline somewhat.</li>
    <li> very good product very good quality, I tested and I got very good results with the wet shaving face and dry face</li>
    <li> Wonderful feeling,this item let my skin so comfortable,the 1150BT is most famous model in all the same goods, and it&#x27;s price very nice,I like it.</li>
    <li> very good ，its a surprise gift , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A satisfactory shopping. Very good !</li>
    <li> I believe the quality of philips norelco, and introduce their shavers to my friends at good prices,such as usd49.99 or 59.99 with bonus.</li>
    <li> Gave her husband a gift. My wife said good use. Love it. Try to get the first moment on. ..</li>
    <li> it is very easy to use with a nice price. I will recommand it to you if you are considering a razor.</li>
    <li> Very good razor, the price is very favorable, and I gave my brother as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, especially at this price. For full disclosure, I do not have a lot of facial hair and use it every 1 to 1.5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Detachable head makes for easy travel, rechargeable battery, stylish&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak for those that have giant, grizzly beards, but it&#x27;s a great buy for those who do not have a lot of facial hair. I would easily buy another if anything happens to mine.</li>
    <li> Too much noise the，But the results were pretty good。In addition to feeling great noise, do not find particularly big problem</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described. It is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for men. Had a Very close, precise and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is a very good gift for father&#x27;s Day.I give this thing five stars quite easily, and without exaggeration. very good!</li>
    <li> sO FAR HAS PERFORMED AS EXPECTED.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the adjustable trimmer. It gives a close shave and is easy to charge.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor so I could have something to use everyday to keep myself clean.  So far its been nothing but great, cuts really close and doesn&#x27;t pull which always a plus.</li>
    <li> Useful, razor shave very clean，its a surprise gift , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A satisfactory shopping. Very good !！！</li>
    <li> Been reliable so far. Can go for a couple of weeks without recharging. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> We were very happy with the Item and my friend loves it,,,,&lt;br /&gt;It handles great,, and it does look good....</li>
    <li> Works wet or dry, holds a charge for a long time. If you are expecting a shave as close as Pace Dorco or other blades, you will be disappointed. I bought it to shave my head with. It is good for going around my head&#x27;s bumps and whatnot, but again, only for clean up. Overall, it is comfortable to use and easy to clean but not my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; way to get shaven.</li>
    <li> The price is a little expensive, can be a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Recharging stand is the worst engineering I have ever encountered and would be a valid basis to return the shaver. Strangely, the shaver is excellent. Whoever approved the charging stand design should be fired immediately.</li>
    <li> Wow......the best shaver I&#x27;ve used till date......super smooth and way way better than regular Mach 3 shave.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast! Husband uses it.  Noticed that it irritated his skin at first but the more he has used it the less it has irritated it!</li>
    <li> Great design. Offers a smooth shave both dry and wet. Very easy to use and easy to clean. Like the charging dock</li>
    <li> Adequate, but if I could do it again I would have gone with a better quality item. This leaves a lot of hair on my face.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality shave!!! I&#x27;ve had Norelcos for 12 years now and this one provides by far the best shave!&lt;br /&gt;The only con I would give it&#x27;s not the most attractive. The black models look far nicer...</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loved it. He&#x27;s a hairy dude and he loved the multi-functional trimmer feature.</li>
    <li> Satisfies entirely my requirements: convenient shape, useful wet/dry shave option, battery lasting longer that 40 min promised in manual :)</li>
    <li> keep getting razor burn on neck</li>
    <li> i think so...&lt;br /&gt;it is good&lt;br /&gt;i like the philips norelco 1150BT/48 Sensotouch 2D electic razor&lt;br /&gt;good job~&lt;br /&gt;u too~</li>
    <li> Very good value&lt;br /&gt;And very affordable, more than the domestic deal</li>
    <li> This was a gift for an older man.  charging case is very difficult for him to use,  shaver itself needed lots of instructions.  Would not recommend this for older person who lives alone, unless he has a lot of help and support available.. I regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is very well. The price is very well.I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very conforable.My girlfriend say it is valuable.&lt;br /&gt;oh,oh,oh,it is ok!</li>
    <li> Very good!I like it very much!&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful and conforms to our expectations,this is what i want products.I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> Worst shaver ever.  Can&#x27;t get a close shave.  Battery indicator is hard to read. Unit feels cheap and sounds cheap.  Norelco does not have email support.  Talked to a guy on their chat.  He wanted to blame it on cleaning.  I told him it was a brand new unit.  He said you have to clean this with alcohol every month.  Didn&#x27;t see that in the manual.  He didn&#x27;t offer a refund or replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for about 15 years.  Last year, I upgraded to this shaver.  This shaver, probably due to its heads, shaves way quicker and closer than any other Norelco that I have owned.  The downside is it sounds like you&#x27;re holding a small airplane, &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; is not an attribute one could apply to this shaver.  But for closeness, this is the shaver to get.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. He has used it every day since. He says the shave is very smooth and it&#x27;s nice to see smooth skin without razor burn! He said the pivot really makes it a comfortable shave. The click-on beard trimmer is a nice feature as well. The coupon made it impossible to pass up!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, he loves it. Very nice electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months, and remain delighted with this razor. I&#x27;ve been using the classic Norelco for the last 30 years, so the head took a little getting used to when I first got it ... it sits on a flexible neck, and has 3 lobes. I got past that quickly, the shape allows the cutter heads to get in around my neck and jaw better. The battery life has been phenomenal. I typically use it once a day, sometimes twice. I think I&#x27;ve only charged it maybe 3 times since purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can find 3 criticisms; it would be better if the cutters were closer  to the edge of the head, I wish that I didn&#x27;t have to use a special stand when I (rarely) have to recharge it, and I worry that eventually swapping the shave and trimmer head will break or wear something out. None of these issues factor in enough to keep me from giving this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Long time Norelco owner and daily user.  I was disappointed with the basic shaving ability of this model compared with what appeared to be similar (older) models.  If you zoom in on the rotors the outside circle does the shaving - this is fine and the same as my 10 year old model.  I also have a newer model with the three circles/rotor that does about the same job.  I was looking forward this one being as good of a shave and updated compared with the older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it for two weeks I&#x27;m back to my old model.  The problem is that the rotors are fixed in plane (2d-ness) which means the only part of one rotor can be on the skin over any curve.  Overall shaving quality and speed (!) was much slower.  Also didn&#x27;t do well between the top of my lip and the start of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros -&lt;br /&gt;lithium ion battery and small size and weight&lt;br /&gt;easy to assemble and clean&lt;br /&gt;nice beard trimmer&lt;br /&gt;cost of shaver and replacement heads (compared with now very expensive replacements for the &amp;#34;3d models&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons -&lt;br /&gt;inflexibility of rotors&lt;br /&gt;speed of shaving&lt;br /&gt;irritating due to many passes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have this model and like it you will really enjoy better model.</li>
    <li> beautyful and easy cleaning</li>
    <li> Love this and use it in the shower</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Philips Norelco. I purchased 1150 for myself two years ago, and lost it in a trip... then reorder this nice razor. I did not change the razor head in the past 2 years, it was perfect until it got lost.&lt;br /&gt;Other two are for my father and my wife&#x27;s father. They all love it. If you can get this razor lower than 69 USD then it would be a good deal. Check other stores you may get 49.99!!</li>
    <li> Great razor, not many options and tough to charge.</li>
    <li> I want to say that every man should have a philips electric shavers, not because of its reputation, but because it is really very nice, I bought more than once, because it as gifts to my friends and family, in the New Year, this is a great gift for family, we all like it very much. It is convenient to use, easy to clean, stable quality,</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the exact same model I had for 3 years.  I use this and the previous one as a wet shaver.  On the previous one, the seal around the output shaft started to fail and allowed water to short out the internal board.  Not sure if any improvements have been made since then but I still have a replacement head which goes for $30, so I figured I would get the same one again.  This version however, did come with a beard trimmer (for the same price at the time I purchased) so that helped justify the cost somewhat.  The overall shave is pretty decent, though you may get a better one with one of the 3D models.  However, they are considerably more expensive as well.</li>
    <li> perfect item, love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of electric razors.  The one before this was a simple Remington MS260 for $40 from the local drugstore.  It shaves closer but is very loud.  This one shaves OK but is very quiet.  If you have stray hairs, though, neither head (razor or trimmer) will do a good job at shaving them.  The Remington is also cheaper to maintain (cutters and foils) than the Panasonic - at least last I checked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is tremendous - lasts forever (at least a week) on a single charge.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the trimmer.  Also I don&#x27;t like that it can&#x27;t just be plugged in to a wall socket without being placed in its charger base.  Also the shave was not as good as I had hoped.  I bought a cheap Norelco previously and this one while more expensive was only a little bit better</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly has described</li>
    <li> Great! Battery life is good, close shave, great price. The trimmer is an extra bonus and works very well.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very clean shaven.</li>
    <li> Its quality is nice. The charge-up time is short and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Having used Electric razors of this type before and being totally unsatisfied with the results I was pleasantly surprised upon using this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first use, with a bit of a beard long than is seemingly recommended when using this type of razor, it worked flawlessly. While i did have to remove the head to get the hair that was being taken off out that was my own fault for not trimming my beard to a more appropriate level before using the rotary heads. The end result left my face with almost no visible hair and a clean shaven look without using a bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of facial irritation this was also a pleasant surprise for me. My neck especially gets very irritated when shaving and after using this i had no problems that I have had in the past with other electric razors that get as close a cut as this. That is not to mention my normal irritation after using a bladed razor of which the Norelco gave almost as close a shave with negligible irritation that may just be due to shaving shaving habits.</li>
    <li> This shaver has a number of things going for it:&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably quiet—not amazingly so, but not loud. Sound is lower and less buzzy than most foil-type shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Catches almost all hair—very easy cleanup, no mess in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Nice that it&#x27;s waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Beard trimmer is solidly built, although you can&#x27;t change back and forth as quickly as if it were integrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But bottom-line, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the shave I ultimately got. It took too many passes to clear at all thick hair, and had a tendency to leave a few stubborn hairs at nearly their original length, refusing to cut them even after 5 or 6 more tries. It also seems to pull slightly on a regular basis, giving a sharp twinge for a second before cutting a hair. I&#x27;d be okay with that if it meant it cut spectacularly close, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case...</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It is easy to hold, has long battery life, and cuts very well when beard is wet.</li>
    <li> Not very effective ,it leaves some heir ,not the perfect replacement of traditional shaver like Gillette march 3 .  Not satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> The shaver is fine, but not as expected.  I could have bought it from other store for cheaper price.  Too bad, that was my problem.  I did not shoppe around before buying it.</li>
    <li> Light, quiet, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First electric shaver and I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Able to shave 14 days in a row without needing to re-charge.&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;  Charging stand folds so this takes up little space when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;  On/Off lock feature so it doesn&#x27;t accidently turn on when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;  Beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;  Smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  Does not have a straight edge for sideburns.  (you have to get as close as you can, and use a razor every couple of days to clean it up)&lt;br /&gt;  Battery lights are non-functional (could just be mine)&lt;br /&gt;  Takes 2 to 3 weeks to &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; your face.  At the 2.5 week point I was back to normal (no irritation) with a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;  You can not shave with it plugged in if batteries are low. (it is supposed to have a &amp;#34;quick charge&amp;#34; feature, but I haven&#x27;t tested it yet.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d buy this product again.  For the price it is very nice.  Next time I&#x27;ll spend a bit more money and ensure I get a straight edge for sideburns.  Be sure to read the directions on breaking it in and the different light features.</li>
    <li> Just received it three days ago, but already very pleased with its performance and easy to clean.  Easy to hold and control.  Fits well in my hand.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve found to date.  Closet shave yet!  Strong battery. Have used this razor daily  for 4 months and only had to recharge it twice.  I like the goatee trim attachment as well.  Easy attachment on off, just pull off and pop on.</li>
    <li> Good item.fast shipping,delivery on time.I like it .I will recomand the item to my relative .</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband who is required by work to be free of facial hair and must shave daily. His skin is very sensitive and even  with an electric razor has to use shaving cream. Not with this one, he&#x27;s very happy to not need to use cream. It&#x27;s also very convenient that it can be used wet/dry and not need a cord. The head is very flexible and is easily removable to clean or use the beard trimmer.  Overall it is light and has a nice feel and gets a smooth shave. The Charging station can also be folded down for easier transportation. So far I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this product but most importantly the husband doesn&#x27;t either. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> when it&#x27;s disposed, you can buy one with 60. that&#x27;s a cheap price. and this razor can give you a quick and complete shave.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas 2013 and so far I really like it. It&#x27;s not as close as a straight razor but I have never used an electric razor that is. Nonetheless, it gets pretty close to a straight razor on the upper face. It is only on the neck that I can tell a noticeable difference. However, it is great at what I hoped it would be good at: a quick shave when I&#x27;m too lazy to lather up, or nice for taking care of my 5 O&#x27;clock shadow. I also love the attachable clippers for cleaning up my sideburns. It&#x27;s easy to clean and care for, and it looks nice. A great electric razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use, very good!&lt;br /&gt;The razor cheap, and the skin fit very well!&lt;br /&gt; Also want to buy a gift!</li>
    <li> I got this with the $20 off coupon Amazon had going for a while. If you can, get the beard trimmer. That piece, unlike most included beard trimmers on these sorts of razors, actually works terrifically well for trimming my beard. I then use the standard head to shave smooth up to my jaw line. Works great. No razor burn. Holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! All aspects of the comprehensive is very good, much better than my previous, I feel very worth it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the waterproof razor so you can shave in the shower. Buy it so you can clean it by just running it under the faucet in the sink!</li>
    <li> amazing, really good shaver</li>
    <li> It is a good Razor,you are worth to get one,</li>
    <li> Does a good job would order again.</li>
    <li> Is an excellent shaving machine, it adapata very well to the shape of the face allowing a perfect shaving sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My husband love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> Works great, better then I anticipated definitely worth paying the extra for the clippers, so far no problems with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost perfect except that the noise is louder than my expectation. But it&#x27;s also an wonderful product! I&#x27;m glad to buy it once more.</li>
    <li> This is one of the poorest electric razor I have ever had.  Very diappointing.</li>
    <li> My husband very like it!  It is very easy to use，And look pretty good handling。Its noise is relatively small，You deserve！</li>
    <li> nice one with great fitting to face.</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin after several weeks of use. Never experienced this with a new shaver before. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> shaver head started making a ratcheting sound and wouldnt cut hair after 3 uses. I had only had it a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/15/15&lt;br /&gt;Now the beard styler has started making the same noise as the shaving razor head made when I first got it.  I called Philips Norelco&#x27;s customer service and they denied it was defective and wanted me to PURCHASE a new beard styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP PRODUCT!!! IT IS TERRIBLE WHEN IT DOES WORK AND WILL BREAK BEFORE IT SHOULD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many electric razors over the past 16 years and never have I had so many problems in such a short amount of time owning the product.  Not to mention, the customer service department at Philips Norelco will not help you when something goes wrong and it&#x27;s their fault.  In the end, I ended up buying a new one and returning my broken one on the down low.  I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE SUPERVISOR AT THEIR CALL CENTER, HER NAME IS REDAWN.  BUYER BEWARE OF TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ASKED THE SUPERVISOR WHAT A PRODUCT IS DEFINED AS WHEN IT BREAKS SHORTLY AFTER IT IS TAKEN OUT OF THE BOX AND HAS BEEN USED NORMALLY 3 TIMES?  I DEFINE IT AS DEFECTIVE.  SHE WOULD NOT ADMIT THAT IT WAS DEFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SUPERVISOR THEN TRIED TO ACT LIKE THEY DID ME A FAVOR BY REPLACING THE SHAVING RAZOR HEAD WHEN IT BROKE A WEEK AFTER I GOT IT.  I TOLD HER THAT THEY DID THE RIGHT THING BY REPLACING THEIR BROKEN DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND IF THEY HAD NOT DONE SO, THEN I WOULD HAVE JUST RETURNED IT FOR A REFUND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, as I said before, I returned the defective beard trimmer head and got a new one in place of it at Best Buy.  I then called the supervisor back and told her what she had made me do by not taking care of her customers when it is indeed their fault and was not due to me abusing or dropping or not cleaning etc.</li>
    <li> I am a Chinese buyer, it did not expect to be so well received goods, will support the Amazon! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The razor and trimmer are both pretty good.  The charger base is pretty flimsy and will probably break.  Since the charger base is the only way to charge it, I can see that it will probably become an issue.</li>
    <li> I use it for my shaved head. Not a huge fan for that purpose as it doesn&#x27;t get close enough and it takes forever to get close to acceptable... BUT I do like the detachable head and the clippers work great to trimming my beard up.</li>
    <li> Razors are hard to buy. I love the Norelco products and this razor is an excellent product. Exactly as described and works great on the sensitive areas without burn.</li>
    <li> he size is just right, the express service is in place, dress up and feel very handsome, next time will come to buy</li>
    <li> Excellent - great in holding.  Very good close shave the best yet.  Great on my shaving my head.....  i recommend the razor to my sons.</li>
    <li> it is very worth to buy。so good。we can buy it for everyone。of course he must  be handsome man . do it</li>
    <li> I have used it and also send one to my friend as a gift, We are very like this watch. It has high quality and better style. But it is more expensive now.</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful gift for my husband. The extra beard accesory is great. He loves this product. The gift arrived 1 day late.</li>
    <li> None of the lights work on this unit...</li>
    <li> Easy clean and good for use</li>
    <li> boyfriend loves it so much</li>
    <li> Says for all kinds of hair, but i took me almost 15 minutes to 20 minutes to shave my face hair. Standard way takes me 4 minutes. I was really disappointed on the product. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> FAST AND PROFESSIONAL</li>
    <li> Really nice came in on time work great worth the money</li>
    <li> it is good and use well</li>
    <li> logistics is very fast ,good product .</li>
    <li> So far it works fine. I have not tried it for a long time to see how the battery lasts on it.</li>
    <li> I have received it ,it&#x27;s excellent.I love it！</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It does a great job!</li>
    <li> I had a corded shaver and this is a great replacement. My old one pulled and left me raw, not with this one.</li>
    <li> This Norelco is easy to handle, comfortable to hold, easy to clean and holds a long charge.  It has more then lived up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> Like all my norelcos it works perfectly and seems to get in the face wrinkles better than the standard models.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a Philips Norelco Electric Razor for my husband a few years ago and it was worn out.  I purchased this one and it is just better than the old one.  Head comes off easy and rinses off under hot water.  Easy use and easy clean up.  A great gift.</li>
    <li> My husband saw this razor in the store and loved it!  When I went on Amazon to buy it, it was actually half price!  He loves it and so do I!</li>
    <li> I liked the Philips shaver very much, it very easy to use and gives a very clean shave. I was very much excited to have it. The shape of it makes it very easy and convenient to hold it in my hand. The blades are also very good and they glide smoothly on my skin. I will definitely recommend this to my friend.</li>
    <li> New product, fast delivery, no problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year for my boyfriend for Christmas. He said it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had and likes using both the razor and trimmer connections. Holds a good charge and we like that it comes with a little stand for it to sit on!</li>
    <li> The shaver is my first electric shaver. I have pretty thick and hard beard and the first time i used it i loved the results. It took me less than 5 minutes to complete my shave which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem in the design is that to connect the trimmer or to clean it properly, i have to remove the heads. I find it difficult to put back the shaving head or the trimmer everytime. Maybe i&#x27;ll get used to it but i fear i dont spoil or break it.</li>
    <li> Very good razor, the old man is very loving, very satisfied! Support the Amazon, I hope there will be more favourable activity!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an ergonomically satisfying easy to travel with electric shaver that gives a comfortable almost as close as a Mach 3 Turbo with gel cream shave... This is for you!  I have a shaved head and use it for both the head and face. Quick to cut and &amp;#34;gets it all&amp;#34; with exception of neck.</li>
    <li> This electric razor works wonderfully. I don&#x27;t shave everyday because frankly I am lazy and it is not required by my work. With my last razor I would get red irritated skin when I shaved my neck. However, with this razor it doesn&#x27;t matter how long it has been since the last time I shaved because I don&#x27;t have any irritation nor red rash-like skin. The only downfall I would give it is that it does not come with a travel bag/case for when I go away for the weekend.</li>
    <li> wasnt what i was really expecting. Out of the box it worked fine. I can tell that the power is decreasing over time. Also when I charge it, there is a humming from the charger. I will probably try to return this</li>
    <li> Positive&lt;br /&gt;- stays for a good time without charging&lt;br /&gt;- clean cut, clean shave from the blades!&lt;br /&gt;- the extra head trimmer is diffenetly worth it. I wouldn&#x27;t of bought it if it wasn&#x27;t included as a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;- looks nice!&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet as it&#x27;s a wet dry shaver&lt;br /&gt;Downside&lt;br /&gt;- I did get some irritation and redness while using it under my jaw (near my nick) but it does say that on the manual and it should stop with time. Hopefully!&lt;br /&gt;- the trimmer doesn&#x27;t give you a clean cut like the blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the price is worth it. I would recommend this product specially if you want a fully clean cut!</li>
    <li> nice item, nice seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a month now and love it.  It&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have sensitive skin and this cuts closely without  pulling on the hair or making my face break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a very long time.  I can normally get 6-7 shaves out of it before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair, so you have to go over it several times.  This can make shaving take a little longer than normal, but less irritation is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> It is so much cheaper than the item sold in chinese website.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good shaver, a perpect gift to my father.</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco 1250bt that I have owned. The previous one worked well for quite a few years, and was replaced when it was no longer shaving as well. The new one failed out of the box. It would not shave close at all, and took an extended amount of time to get even a poor shave, even though I used a conditioner. Norelco&#x27;s policy is that once it&#x27;s you buy it, that&#x27;s it has made me return to the blade system, that rarely fails an adequate shave</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and I&#x27;m happy because he grew his beard back and keeps it trimmed nicely with the attachment.</li>
    <li> Why i am disappointed with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1) It does not save me time: It does not shave well, so it takes a while to reach a reasonable shave. Even after that, i will typically use a blade to finish the job. This is not the point of having an electric razor. The manual says it takes a few weeks of daily use for the skin to adjust so it shaves better, but they don&#x27;t tell you that before you buy the product. I didn&#x27;t get it for daily use, i typically shave once or twice a week, so this will not do.&lt;br /&gt;2) I specifically got this model because it has an attachable beard trimmer with adjustable length. This part works really badly. After less than a minute of use, it slows down to a halt, as if the battery has run out. Even after a complete charge! Putting it under water weirdly makes it go back to full speed for another 20 seconds or so, but then it slows down again. Replacing the head with the shaving head seems to work okay, so it&#x27;s not a battery issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d return it if i can, but i&#x27;m past Amazon&#x27;s return window, unfortunately. Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son for his birthday and he loves it. Says it is the best razor he has ever had.</li>
    <li> very nice gift for myself,using comfortable except a little sound large ,next I need to check its water washing if good!!!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely not the greatest shaver. Long story short: you hafta apply a lot of pressure on areas like the mustache, which is difficult with that small wobbly joint. It has acceptable performance on the neck and underchin contours. All other performance is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about electric razors that have no pivoting joint. You just move your hand around your face at the angle you want. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the beard-trimmer is more like a hair-cut trimmer because it has a guardrail that is impossible to remove. They shuda left the vibrating spikes exposed, but they put a guardrail on it instead.</li>
    <li> this purchase of the Norelco razor has been one of my best ones.  It is an awesome razor and I love the swivel head on it.</li>
    <li> 1, looks very cool, on the charging base feel very luxurious. 2, comfortable. Easy to use, can be used immediately after charging for a few minutes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s first electric shaver so we have nothing to compare to.  Works find, but he has corse hair and it&#x27;s hard to get a clean shave.  It fails to cut all the hair and you have to go over and over to get a clean shave.  Not sure if that&#x27;s just how electric shavers work for his type of hair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> My honey liked it so much</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 or 4 Norelcos in the past.  This is the first I have owned with this style of head.  I mainly shave with 3 or 4 blade Gillette systems in the shower, and bought this for the shower as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is the quietest Norelco I have owned.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an in shower shaver it is quite good -- not as close as blades, but close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again?  YES  Note that I paid $70.00 for this through a discount online, it sells in the stores for 90 to 100 dollars under the 6100 number in some stores.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely awesome!! I previously only gave it an OK rating, but after a bit more usage, I found that this product is \\&quot;THE CATS MEOW\\&quot;. One thing I have noticed is that the blades rotate a lot slower but that could be an asset as it would give a much better shave in the long run. I get a great shave hands down, I haven&#x27;t tried out the trimmer attachment yet, but looks like a miniature hair cutting head so I plan to try it on my hair and neck as well :)  In summary, this shaver is an excellent product and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband said this is the best razor he ever owned. I hesitated between this model and the next model up. The next model up has a self cleaning feature but I wasn&#x27;t sure that was worth it for the almost $50 more. My husband said it wasn&#x27;t.  Smooth shave, doesn&#x27;t rip out face hairs, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin if you use it dry. I lucked out and had a $20 coupon off of this - great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Very good price. Just one of those things you gotta get use to.  My boyfriend has never used an electric razor. But I&#x27;m sure this is one of the best. Deleverd very quickly!!</li>
    <li> Been using Norelco, after trying others, forever. If you&#x27;re thinking about going from &#x27;the blade&#x27;, to electric, don&#x27;t waste your time exploring/trying to save a few pennies, - which I&#x27;ve done, you will not regret buying this!</li>
    <li> Works and comfortable.</li>
    <li> bought this for my grandfather. He enjoys being able to sit in his recliner and shave. Took him a couple weeks to get used to the feel and train his face to it but he loves it. Obviously it takes a little more time than the traditional way of shaving, but it is not bad.</li>
    <li> appears to be good quality, takes a few shaves to get used to it.  I found that I have to slow down to get a good shave, but have not used an electric razor in years.</li>
    <li> I have exclusively shaved with Norelco razors for my whole life and this one by far, is the roughest. The shave is relatively close, but no as close as past models I have owned. The only thing that it truly great is the trimming attachment which is one of the BEST  I have ever seen or used. The only inconvenience is that it is not built into the razor itself.</li>
    <li> Its not all that :-(e</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and he loves it. I would highly recommend this to any one looking for a good razor.</li>
    <li> No longer be charged. Used for less than one year. The quality is bad.</li>
    <li> Good but very expensive. Acqa Tech series is cheaper and as good as this one.</li>
    <li> this was horrible purchased it for my boyfriend it was not as good as one of his cheaper facetrimmers we have not used it at all!</li>
    <li> great razor.  my husband likes it a lot and uses it frequently.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is one of the best I have used. I have a really sensitive skin, and with this shaver I haven&#x27;t had any discomfort at all.&lt;br /&gt;Really precise too, can cut the beard as close as a manual shaver !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is waterproof so you can use it in your shower or your bath, which is really good if you have sensitive skin like me !</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple of months and it is working great. It gives a close shave and is smooth on the skin - a lot better than the PT720, which I was using before this one.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought,It also needs to use and have a look.&lt;br /&gt;Next time i will try Braun shaver</li>
    <li> for my father,like it,except the charging stand is unsteady when comes the Shaver</li>
    <li> does not give as close a shave as my previous Norelco.model # unreadable but looks like special xl.. I bought this razor because the cutters are no longer available . I suppose you call that &amp;#34;marketing&amp;#34;.[&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, I think you have reduced the quality of your product and would not recommend it to others or give as a gift as I have your other razors in the past.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not bad product, but after only two mounts of use, it broke.&lt;br /&gt;I did not do anything wrong and kept it clean, and still it was broken very fast :(</li>
    <li> Very good！It ships to china only use 5 days。</li>
    <li> Bought this locally because i did not want to wait for the shipping. Came with the beard trimmer and an extra replacement head. Shaves perfect on the sides of my face. Not to well on my chin, apparently my hair is to thick and does not fit in the holes to be cut. Does not shave my neck ever well either. unable to get a clean shave like the picture on the box shows. On the plus side no more razor burn. Just minor irritation on my neck and so far one bump on my chin. only used it twice  and will keep using it but so far this is the best electric shaver i have purchased. will update after a month or two  It&#x27;s been a month and a half. Still gives me irritation when shaving dry. Can only get a good shave in the shower. Still won&#x27;t cut thick hairs or flat ones. Ended calling for instructions to return it. Was told to return from the store I had purchased it form with the 45 days they gladly refunded my card.</li>
    <li> I have bought two shavers as presents for my friend, both of them could not been used. I did open the product untill I sent them and find the problem.The custrom serviece told me they reject to change the products for me just because the return time has been expirted. I hate the products very much .I want my money back.!!!!</li>
    <li> Shaver is my third Norelco razor.  It shaves better than any of the previous models.  I am satisfied with its performance. The plastic cover for the head has already broken.  There was no bag or pouch to house the shaver in my suitcase when we travel.  I am going to order one for one of our grandsons.</li>
    <li> It gives a clean shave. But doest clean well in the area under the chin. Bit disappointing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
    <li> Chews up my face.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the razor, or my face.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Good results.</li>
    <li> I like it to much case my skin is sensitive ( but of corse it will not shave like the blade )&lt;br /&gt;Maybe u will need to use blade also but for much limited exposure for ur skin&lt;br /&gt;For me I&#x27;m happy , much less skin redness</li>
    <li> After one year the soft outer layer, on and off button outer case cracks making it unusable in shower or any wet area.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a great product. I love it!</li>
    <li> very good,it worth the price</li>
    <li> Very fast, the United States to China four days, surprise, surprise!  Husband like this blade is also very much to use, has been with philips, quality guaranteed.</li>
    <li> Great except you have to interchange heads for trimming.</li>
    <li> Great piece of equipment, works perfectly!!!!</li>
    <li> Very cool Razor, very nice and clean shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver works really good with the click on trimmer but as for the vibrating 3 circle razor, it cuts but does not leave the face feeling smooth as my norelco pt861</li>
    <li> Repond a mes attentes</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use,very good</li>
    <li> Finally an electric razor that can cut close andeasy to clean I&#x27;ve had many over the yrs I&#x27;m 63and this is the best and a low price amazon</li>
    <li> The product is very good, I like, but i&#x27;m not satisfaction  Courier service , thanks</li>
    <li> The price gap is very big in chinese</li>
