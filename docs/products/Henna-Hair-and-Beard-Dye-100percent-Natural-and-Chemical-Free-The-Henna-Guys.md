### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I used this every month and I am very happy with results.</li>
      <li>turned up to be all around the best solution.</li>
      <li>Even if u mix these two together they give excellent results even for stubborn gray.</li>
      <li>the best part is the hair loss also stopped.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>My sister and I are happy henna heads!</li>
      <li>And the best part, the henna felt soothing on my head.</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTEY LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>I loved this!</li>
      <li>but in the end I just wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
      <li>Also, I wasn&#x27;t happy with texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>Basically,the henna covered all my gray, which was great.</li>
      <li>I was happy with both the product and the service.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t freak out if your gray turns bright orange after doing the henna; the indigo powder will take care of that</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>I used the product with good results.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t need touch up for a good 3.5 weeks.</li>
      <li>Good product - each pack comes with instructions.</li>
      <li>It is a process but good things take time.  </li>
      <li>I bought a pack for my sister and then one for me,I will say though that the indigo washed out of my sister&#x27;s hair fairly quickly,I would say give it 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased.</li>
      <li>Warm coconut oil treatment</li>
      <li>Sure it was awesome at first.</li>
      <li>I emailed the henna guys, they said it was ok to do the indigo part again, but after looking at my head I kinda liked the reddish highlights.</li>
      <li>WAY BETTER then the lighter brighter bronze/copper I was getting before.</li>
      <li>Way better quality than stuff you find at the health food store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m feeling better about my hair now ..</li>
      <li>love love love</li>
      <li>/&gt;That actually worked the best.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Much better for your hair than chemical dyes,</li>
      <li>because the pricing has changed I have decided this time around to purchase the 300g of Henna and 300g of Indigo because I get more bang for my buck.</li>
      <li>Just make sure if u mix thev2</li>
      <li>It could be because my hair has been chemically dyed so many times</li>
      <li>I have never used Henna before; but I really love this.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>It smells fresh, is in the form of very fine powder and very easy to mix.</li>
      <li>Strong odor,  made my stomach hurt.</li>
      <li>The first time I did the henna and indigo two step and my hair came out amazing.</li>
      <li>I have tried other hennas but none smelled as wonderful and fresh as what I get from the henna guys!</li>
      <li>The result is a huge success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this henna because it is chemical free</li>
      <li>found the quality of the product by the Henna Guys is fantastic.</li>
      <li>After having salt/pepper hair for a good 9 - 10 months, ( when I stopped using the chemical dyes )  it seemed surprising to have so much black hair!  </li>
      <li>the best it turned my white hair copper using the 2 step process and sleeping on it with a cap.&lt;br /&gt;Roots still remained white even after 2 applications packing it on making sure it was pudding</li>
      <li>I mixed mine with apple cider vinegar instead of water, and the Henna developed wonderfully.</li>
      <li>After reading many good reviews here and other google research, I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>process of applying the henna and later the indigo is time consuming, and a bit tiring but the end result is good.  </li>
      <li>Always rinsed with cool water and no shampoo.</li>
      <li>now I know better to do it outside:)</li>
      <li>I received it quickly after ordering.</li>
      <li>I did not do the 2 step process instead i mixed indigo and henna and it worked great for the top of my hair but by mid length and tips it seemed to not stick and washed out?</li>
      <li>red(this is normal, henna should deepen in color the more you apply it).For me</li>
      <li>the process of applying it is rather lengthy, bbut thw greay coverage is worth it.</li>
      <li>The henna arrived smelling fresh.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist makes fun of me for ever using it.</li>
      <li>I was not crazy about the results of this dying method.</li>
      <li>Natural product works great and doesn&#x27;t burn skin like some commercial dyes.</li>
      <li>Now my hair is back to its beautiful black and shinny like many years ago.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have found such a beautiful solution to a scary hair dilemma.</li>
      <li>Amazon had the Henna Guys Jet Black at a fair price.</li>
      <li>I did the henna first</li>
      <li>also noticed that this time even though I use it only on the top of my head</li>
      <li>I lost them the first time I did my hair and that didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
      <li>First time 5 hours henna - 6 hours indigo.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions EXACTLY.</li>
      <li>First time using it so didn&#x27;t know how it would work on my hair.</li>
      <li>My first experience with hair coloring was Herbatint.</li>
      <li>I do the first step (henna)</li>
      <li>Maybe next time I will be able to apply it a bit faster.</li>
      <li>Thanks Henna Guys!</li>
      <li>I just used hot water to the mixture, let it stand for 4 hrs, put it in my hair and kept it in my hair for</li>
      <li>Second time ( to cover a little gray), I still cut corners and my hair was still damp for part two using indigo for black,but it was a great success!</li>
      <li>Applied: took only 10 minutes and almost fun as the dye easily passed through the tip of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I liked the product a lot, I would suggest you read and follow the instructions very carefully.</li>
      <li>The white hairs turned bright copper and still stayed white at the roots.</li>
      <li>but now I gotta turn my whole hair</li>
      <li>REALLY wanted this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Whites still very copper.</li>
      <li>mine REALLY is COPPER...</li>
      <li>together they produced a nice rusty red, but it was definitely not jet black.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
      <li>Even though it was more gentle than other chemical brands out there, my scalp itched for days after.</li>
      <li>It came out looking rich, healthy, thick, shiny, &amp; luscious.</li>
      <li>If anything is unclear, you can email them - they got back to me pretty quickly with clarifications about the particular shade.</li>
      <li>due to reviews I read online of using the mix, but it happily came out to a nice black after a few days.</li>
      <li>I basically did a 25%henna to 75% indigo mix using mostly vinegar/lemon juice with a splash of black tea as the \\&quot;water\\&quot; part to moisten.</li>
      <li>I was less than pleased about the consistency of the indigo</li>
      <li>and it came out a really vibrant orangish-red.</li>
      <li>This henna is high quality.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, I haven&#x27;t found one natural product that gives you jet black no matter</li>
      <li>but when I washed and dried my hair today the whites for the first time were a rich bronze.</li>
      <li>I Only had some white hairs on the top of my head so that was the only place I used this</li>
      <li>The Henna Guys are the first persons who had me dye my hair with a red dye and then dye it with the indigo.  </li>
      <li>the first morning and the second step (indigo powder)</li>
      <li>Then my hair began to fall out more than usual after each dye session.</li>
      <li>9 hours the first day &amp; had it on for 12 hours second day.</li>
      <li>It covered the grey hair pretty well; right now they have a reddish tint on them, but I think that the next time around it will cover those.  </li>
      <li>It seems like the other brand that I normally use would quickly run its course in about two weeks</li>
      <li>No mess at all!</li>
      <li>and they always got back to me in reasonable time and answered the questions I had for them.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels smoother, without losing its soft waves.</li>

    <li> I liked the product a lot, I would suggest you read and follow the instructions very carefully. I lost them the first time I did my hair and that didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
    <li> The only henna and indigo two-step process that actually gets my hair back to black when I&#x27;m finished. Even covers stubborn grays. I do the first step (henna) the first morning and the second step (indigo powder) the next morning. Don&#x27;t freak out if your gray turns bright orange after doing the henna; the indigo powder will take care of that &#x3D;) Much better for your hair than chemical dyes, and it&#x27;s 100% vegan and cruelty-free. I hate the smell of both (they smell like horse poop to me) so I just mix in some cinnamon powder to mask the odor.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s a mess I rather not deal.</li>
    <li> Sure it was awesome at first. My third time using henna on my naturally straight, thin hair. Thought I was &amp;#34;going green&amp;#34; by using the no chemicals dye in my hair. It came out looking rich, healthy, thick, shiny, &amp; luscious. Here I am a couple months later with dry, dull, redish, not so lush hair. I went to a professional salon for a change,- ombr&amp;eacute; involving highlights. My hair turned green because this just stains your hair forever, never ever getting the green out of your hair. I literally went green!!  Seriously I wash my hair everyday the green from the mix came through the blonde and turned my hair alge green. I had ombr&amp;eacute; green.  My stylist said the only way is to cut everything I&#x27;ve dyed off.. Which is 2 feet of hair &amp; it is not happening. So currently I&#x27;ll never use henna again &amp; im still in the process of making my hair look decent. It&#x27;s a brown to grey ish/green ombr&amp;eacute;.... Fml.. Just use the chemicals, it&#x27;s not worth it to ruin your hair over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW: 1-3-16&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m using chemical hair salon dye, I have to stay dark brown/ black . Never going back to henna. I just use Pantene and get my hair cut regularly. My hair stylist makes fun of me for ever using it. I&#x27;m feeling better about my hair now .. That&#x27;s the last picture is my current hair months after fixing.</li>
    <li> I used  Henna Guys on my AFrican American  natural hair. I wanted to cover my gray hair. This is my third different all-natural product try. I did the henna first and it came out a really vibrant orangish-red. Then I did the indigo. Basically,the henna covered all my gray, which was great. The indigo only darkened the henna to an dark auburn. Not even close to jet black. Truthfully, I haven&#x27;t found one natural product that gives you jet black no matter how well you follow the directions or tweak it with coffee, tea. lemon juice, or whatever else. I decided that if I want to keep using natural products that I need to give up on getting shiny black hair. BTW, I did 2 applications of this so far and have not gotten it anywhere close to black.</li>
    <li> It is a process but good things take time.  No irritation just the expected outcome w/following the correct directions. Good</li>
    <li> Useless. Will never recommend and will never again buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy Hannah Henna and Hanna Indigo n u&#x27;ll never regret it. Even if u mix these two together they give excellent results even for stubborn gray. Just make sure if u mix thev2 u sit for 8 hours. Also add the salt and follow all the other instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> First time using it so didn&#x27;t know how it would work on my hair. Strong odor,  made my stomach hurt. I&#x27;d buy it again tho,  now I know better to do it outside:)</li>
    <li> I used this every month and I am very happy with results.</li>
    <li> I like this henna because it is chemical free&lt;br /&gt;pro no chemical&lt;br /&gt;con it is messy and you have to keep it for at least couple hours</li>
    <li> First try was clumsy...didn&#x27;t follow instructions in detail.. Second time ( to cover a little gray), I still cut corners and my hair was still damp for part two using indigo for black,but it was a great success! Didn&#x27;t need touch up for a good 3.5 weeks. Usually dye starts fading by 2 week as I wash hair every day. My hairdresser was impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Also my eczema did not flare up as it usually does!!</li>
    <li> Even after I did the 2nd step, my grays ended up brown, not black, as expected.</li>
    <li> This is my second henna purchase and all I can say is OMG! The first time I did the henna and indigo two step and my hair came out amazing. This time I did the one step with 50/50 henna/indigo and I was surprised how dark my hair came out, I was planning on it coming out &amp;#34;brownish&amp;#34; due to reviews I read online of using the mix, but it happily came out to a nice black after a few days. I have tried other hennas but none smelled as wonderful and fresh as what I get from the henna guys! love love love</li>
    <li> I loved this! I bought a pack for my sister and then one for me,I will say though that the indigo washed out of my sister&#x27;s hair fairly quickly,I would say give it 3 weeks.For me,it lasted about 4 weeks give or take (I wash my hair less frequently then she does). Although I will say that the henna color has lasted since we put it in, which was February,2014. The color has faded, my sister had applied henna before and so her hair was a deep reddish brown color and when she put in the henna it was an even deeper red(this is normal, henna should deepen in color the more you apply it).For me I have dark almost black hair and so I never expected it to show very well inside, but when I stepped outside I got deep brown/almost reddish highlights). When I put the indigo in it was completely BLACK(my sisters results were the same) and I was very pleased.I will say though that because the pricing has changed I have decided this time around to purchase the 300g of Henna and 300g of Indigo because I get more bang for my buck. My sister and I are happy henna heads!</li>
    <li> I did not do the 2 step process instead i mixed indigo and henna and it worked great for the top of my hair but by mid length and tips it seemed to not stick and washed out? It could be because my hair has been chemically dyed so many times so I will try it again.</li>
    <li> I have never used Henna before; but I really love this.&lt;br /&gt;What I will say is that you MUST follow the two-step process!  (I tried short cutting the process, and I did not achieve the Jet Black color).  But I spoke with customer service and they advised me to use the two-step process.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t add anything else to the mixture.  I just used hot water to the mixture, let it stand for 4 hrs, put it in my hair and kept it in my hair for 4 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ABSOLUTEY LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I attempted to use this product 3 different times. Meaning, I used it 3 times each THREE times I tried to cover my grays. I have virgin naturally dark brown/black Asian hair. (All my life people asked if I dyed my hair since it really looks so black) Anyway, I started to get a few white hairs popping up on the top of my head and since my hair is SO dark they are very visible. I wanted to spot treat these and just darken the whites to mix in with the rest of my hair. I have virgin hair. I followed the directions EXACTLY. Did the 2 step process. First time 5 hours henna - 6 hours indigo. The white hairs turned bright copper and still stayed white at the roots. Next day did the same process and left it in for 8 hours with a cap. Whites still very copper. Always rinsed with cool water and no shampoo. Pretty disappointed by this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mind a little extra mess but the smell lasted for 2+ weeks on my scalp...kinda embarrassing smelling so funky.&lt;br /&gt;I had no bleeding issues like the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second time I tried a month later...same process as above but I added lemon and vinegar.&lt;br /&gt; A \\&quot;little\\&quot; darker but basically still turned the whites copper with 3 cm of white roots still showing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why people are saying it made their white hair \\&quot;black\\&quot;...mine REALLY is COPPER...never got any darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month, tried again and SLEPT with this in my hair with a cap.&lt;br /&gt;That actually worked the best. Still had copper hair but the roots turned copper too and were no longer actually white.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that this time even though I use it only on the top of my head it wasn&#x27;t coating the rest of my hair...I didn&#x27;t like how my hair was looking \\&quot;brown\\&quot; due to this product. I prefer my natural black looking dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this product works well on Virgin Asian WHITE hair.&lt;br /&gt;Never turned my hair black.&lt;br /&gt;At the best it turned my white hair copper using the 2 step process and sleeping on it with a cap.&lt;br /&gt;Roots still remained white even after 2 applications packing it on making sure it was pudding consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY wanted this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I contacted the seller with a lengthy e-mail hoping they might give me tips...I got a message back stating they would contact me within the next few days about my inquiry...NEVER HEARD BACK FORM THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty disappointed with the product and the seller customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:8/10/14&lt;br /&gt;I basically needed to sleep with it on my hair for 2 days...9 hours the first day &amp; had it on for 12 hours second day. I wore a cap both days. This is what I did that was different. I basically did a 25%henna to 75% indigo mix using mostly vinegar/lemon juice with a splash of black tea as the \\&quot;water\\&quot; part to moisten. I made it REALLY THICK. There was NO dripping possible since it was like MUD. I GENEROUSLY massaged it in the scalp combed through with a wide tooth comb and then packed it on thick over that. Grant you. I Only had some white hairs on the top of my head so that was the only place I used this but when I washed and dried my hair today the whites for the first time were a rich bronze. WAY BETTER then the lighter brighter bronze/copper I was getting before. Plus, there was no white showing at the scalp like I normally would still get. I think for stubborn whites we have to wear this stuff A LOT longer then other people and must add the vinegar/lemon juice/ black tea mixture and PACK it on the scalp and rest of the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna products for the last 5 years because I am severely allergic to regular hair dye. If I use regular hair dye I have to take a trip to the ER. It seems like the other brand that I normally use would quickly run its course in about two weeks and then I would have to spend a day again dying my hair.  While using Henna does take a day to dye your hair. I would not mind it if the results lasted awhile.  I read the reviews of The Henna Guys and decided to take the chance.  The Henna Guys are the first persons who had me dye my hair with a red dye and then dye it with the indigo.  So I made both of the mixtures and let them both sit for 2 1/2 hours then applied the red hair dye. I let it sit for a hour then rinsed it off and blow dried my hair until dry.  My hair was a light red (with some of my natural black there) but after blow drying my hair, I then put the indigo mix on (which is now about 4 hours of sitting there) and let that sit on my hair for 2 hours and then rinsed that off and blow dried my hair again and waited 32 hours before shampooing.  Its been 3 weeks and not a hint of gray popping out yet.  It looks like I&#x27;ve finally found a decent Henna product.</li>
    <li> Natural product works great and doesn&#x27;t burn skin like some commercial dyes.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length greying black hair. Am allergic to chemical dyes. I did research and decided to hive henna a try. There was enough henna for two treatments. The first time, I did the two step process following direction, and my root( long roots!) stayed a really pretty deep red. I emailed the henna guys, they said it was ok to do the indigo part again, but after looking at my head I kinda liked the reddish highlights. So I kept them. Also, my hair had been thinning ( prescription I am not taking anymore!) and it looks healthier and thicker. No flyaways, no stray hairs sticking all over. My hair feels smoother, without losing its soft waves. And the best part, the henna felt soothing on my head. I will definitely be back. And the color lasts for a long time.  I&#x27;m telling everyone I know to try it, it&#x27;s awesome. Way better quality than stuff you find at the health food store.</li>
    <li> Good product - each pack comes with instructions. If anything is unclear, you can email them - they got back to me pretty quickly with clarifications about the particular shade.</li>
    <li> five stars for the henna (red) and one star for the indigo. together they produced a nice rusty red, but it was definitely not jet black.&lt;br /&gt;it came in the expected amount of time. the process of applying it is rather lengthy, bbut thw greay coverage is worth it.</li>
    <li> I used the product with good results.  ( the 2 step process ) It covered the grey hair pretty well; right now they have a reddish tint on them, but I think that the next time around it will cover those.  I intend to use just the indigo next time while my roots are still red from the henna. After having salt/pepper hair for a good 9 - 10 months, ( when I stopped using the chemical dyes )  it seemed surprising to have so much black hair!  I corresponded with Henna Guys via e-mail and they always got back to me in reasonable time and answered the questions I had for them.  One of the instructions sheet was not in my packet and when I informed them about it, they wrote back about what to do and the following day e-mailed a scanned copy.  I was happy with both the product and the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of applying the henna and later the indigo is time consuming, and a bit tiring but the end result is good.  The process, I was told can be done over 2 days also, 1st day henna and then indigo the next day. Maybe next time I will be able to apply it a bit faster.</li>
    <li> My first experience with hair coloring was Herbatint. I used it in the past 6 months to cover 10% gray hair. Even though it was more gentle than other chemical brands out there, my scalp itched for days after. The worse part is I started losing a lot of hair... to the point I would consider going gray. In an effort to remedy my hair loss and restore my scalp heath, I started no-poo regimen by using only conditioner. While it slowly helps, it also sucks having gray hair. So went my search for an alternative...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna+indigo turned up to be all around the best solution. However I was concerned with the mess and the long process. After reading many good reviews here and other google research, I decided to give it a try. The result is a huge success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the quality of the product by the Henna Guys is fantastic. It smells fresh, is in the form of very fine powder and very easy to mix. Here is my process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Warm coconut oil treatment the night before, washed and air dried hair the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Prepared the mixture: I brewed a pot of black tea, added a bit of lime juice, a tsp of sugar for stickiness, a tsp of salt, a few drops of essential oils to mask the strong scent. I purposefully made the mixture thinner than instructed, about the same consistency as the conventional hair dye, and poured it in to a squeeze bottle. Let it sit for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Applied: took only 10 minutes and almost fun as the dye easily passed through the tip of the bottle. No mess at all! I let it stay on my hair for 5 hours with a shower cap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Rinsed out using a garden hose in the back yard, taking no chance of coloring my bath tub. The hair was a bit tangly after air drying, so I applied unscented leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Washed hair 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gray is completely covered, the hair appeared thicker, stronger and the best part is the hair loss also stopped. Now my hair is back to its beautiful black and shinny like many years ago.</li>
    <li> I have natural black hair. But since I will be hitting that horrible hill named FIFTY very soon, my lovely locks have been rapidly going silver. I was dying my hair over with black chemical dye for the past two years. The wicked chemical process always made me totally nauseated and sick for days after the process (I am sensitive to anything not organic). Then my hair began to fall out more than usual after each dye session. I went searching the internet for natural black hair dye. Voila! Amazon had the Henna Guys Jet Black at a fair price. I received it quickly after ordering. I will never go back to evil animal tested chem colours. This henna is a miracle- seriously. It left my hair midnight black with a starry sheen. It&#x27;s thicker now, too. The henna arrived smelling fresh. I mixed mine with apple cider vinegar instead of water, and the Henna developed wonderfully. This henna is high quality. I am so happy to have found such a beautiful solution to a scary hair dilemma. Thanks Henna Guys!</li>
    <li> I have been using henna +indigo on my hair for about 2 years now and although this henna + indigo did not seem to be the freshest, the result was very black which is what I wanted. I was less than pleased about the consistency of the indigo especially but it did what it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> (2 months ago, my bangs was dye red and also a red  layer, the rest of my hair is already black) the 1st step turned my bang and layer to a crazy orange color (not red) Next day, it just turned dark orange (no red anywhere) This sucks because I was planning on heading out today. but now I gotta turn my whole hair black, even the layers which I really wanted to keep.&lt;br /&gt;...What the hell Henna?! I put on step 2, followed the instructions to a T but my hair did not turn black. Does anyone know how I can fix this mess?</li>
    <li> I was not crazy about the results of this dying method. I followed the instructions to a t but in the end I just wasn&#x27;t happy with it. I didn&#x27;t get the intense jet black color I expected. Also, I wasn&#x27;t happy with texture of my hair. It did feel thicker but it was also more difficult to manage and the smell was a bit bothersome. The color did last a long time but the amount of time and effort it took just isn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t change my hair color at all and smelled foul.</li>
    <li> Did not dye hair black</li>
