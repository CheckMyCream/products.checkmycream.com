      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my choice.</li>
      <li>it worked great ONE time.</li>
      <li>then while working because the wand gets very warm.</li>
      <li>It is THE BEST for removing hair without strong hair-burning smells &amp; without discomfort or pain!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Absolutely thrilled!</li>

      <li>If the unit doesn&#x27;t have good contact</li>
      <li>I am a fairly tan person</li>
      <li>The product is in perfect conditions, I hope to be the i light ProPlusQuartz (30.000 flashes) because the manual say 1.500 flashes</li>
      <li>I have the recommended skin color and hair type for the Light Pro to give it&#x27;s best results.  </li>
      <li>If there was a quicker permanent alternative, I’d probably try it, but haven’t found anything yet that can offer anything superior.</li>
      <li>This may be a good sign that the device is working</li>
      <li>Noticed some redness around the follicles which may also be a good sign that the follicles have been kinda burnt.</li>
      <li>I think this seems to be a good unit.</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t call myself fair skinned at all.  </li>
      <li>There are skin/hair combos that are more ideal than mine for laser</li>
      <li>Also going to be a good way to find out</li>
      <li>but I also smell like burning hair so I am hoping this is a good thing..?</li>
      <li>I would say my skin tone is a shade darker than fair</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the week.</li>
      <li>will say that I&#x27;m a good candidate for this system, my skin and hair color match the recommended, and I followed the instructions.</li>
      <li>The light is very bright, but no eye protection is needed.</li>
      <li>The lint free cloth it comes with doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of cleaning it, but a q-tip worked</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>love it , seems to work great.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>They love it!</li>
      <li>Love this hair removal system!</li>
      <li>great product .. and easy to use</li>
      <li>Great product, works as advertised and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have seen a nice reduction of hair on sun exposed areas, as well as, lighter skin areas.</li>
      <li>If home IPL technology was even close to as effective as claimed</li>
      <li>but I am having great success.</li>
      <li>Yes it hurts slightly more but was much more effective for me.</li>
      <li>Great product, does exactly what they say it will.</li>
      <li>I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>The handle fits nicely into your hand and the button is easy to push.</li>
      <li>Just a good, cheap set of sunglasses will work fine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>so I can zap more.</li>
      <li>okay again.</li>
      <li>What more can I say.  </li>
      <li>My results after two months have been FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>This means DON&#x27;T expect to be able to throw away your razor after purchasing.</li>
      <li>After a couple more, the hair is noticeably thinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So that was not a sustainable option for sure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to cause excess heat buildup and shorten the bulb life, so I was making sure to keep it cleaned off.</li>
      <li>The wife is very happy with her Christmas present</li>
      <li>I am hopeful that I will be able to wear shorts and skirts more often with the help of this product.</li>
      <li>I love being able to use it at home.  </li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>I know this product isn&#x27;t approved for facial hair, but it worked wonderfully for me.</li>
      <li>This means DON&#x27;T expect to be able to throw away your razor after purchasing.</li>
      <li>So okay, I was hesitant and did A LOT of research.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m rounding; 1500/420 is a bit more than 3, and 35000/420 is a bit more than 80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>OKAY.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
      <li>Hair on face is more course than body hair.</li>
      <li>After 2 more treatments.</li>
      <li>, the rest of my experience has been an overwhelming</li>
      <li>so I wanted to make sure to find not just an affordable laser but one that is supposed to be safe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are supposed to treat every two weeks, doing it more won&#x27;t make a difference</li>
      <li>Used for upper lip at the lower settings (1-2), legs at the highest (5), and underarms graduating from 3 to 5; it&#x27;s awesome that it can be adjusted according to your skin sensitivity!</li>
      <li>they knock it from 1 to 7 or 8 on a top 10 because of price.</li>
      <li>I wish it were more of a permanent removal, but for $350, I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
      <li>I hope to use it for a couple more months to see if there will be any results at all.</li>
      <li>and I love the ability to do spot treatments without spending a fortune on going to the laser</li>
      <li>Seems that&#x27;d be okay,</li>
      <li>And being able to shave when you need to is also a plus compared to waxing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It stressed me out after dropping that kind of money but luckily Amazon let me exchange it at no cost with no problem.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a very light complexion with dark hair which made me the perfect candidate.</li>
      <li>Very good results, like the manual said, after the third session I start to see changes.</li>
      <li>- you have to carefully go over each area of your skin every two weeks to get the best results.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised and I am very satisfied with the product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works great for me. I am very pleased. I went into it with the knowledge that this is not permanent hair removal rather a longer lasting alternative to shaving - which I HATE to do :) Once I achieved the result I wanted it is now a matter of maintenance and I can deal with that over shaving any day!</li>
    <li> Broke the nose cone after one week and can not get the peace.  work well but bad service.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington IPL6000 ILIGHT Pro Plus Quartz after looking at online reviews and consumer reports for home laser hair removal units. I chose this unit and model because it seemed to fit my personal desires for a home unit. I have gotten some facial laser hair treatments at a professional office in the past, so I was wanting to purchase a unit geared more towards larger treatment areas. It seems like the well reviewed units are either more for use on the facial area or the rest of the body, but not both. This unit is not supposed to be used on the face or neck, which is something to be aware of before purchase. If I was wanting to do just my face and neck area I personally would have probably bought the &amp;#34;Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X&amp;#34; unit after looking at consumer reports just because it seems to be made for that use. The Quartz model of the Remington and the Tria are both FDA approved for home laser hair removal use, which was also important to me when I was looking at what model to buy. Though there are cheaper units with pretty good reviews, I also saw some crazy reviews about burns and exploding blubs and stuff with some models so I wanted to make sure to find not just an affordable laser but one that is supposed to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;So because of the safety and a few more key features... replaceable cartridges, about 30,000 zaps per cartridge, no charging and a larger head... I chose this unit. I was a little nervous because this is a IPL unit and technically not a &amp;#34;laser&amp;#34; unit. This just means that it really isn&#x27;t a laser which I believe can be focused to one wavelength but a concentration of broad spectrum wavelengths, works similarly but supposedly isn&#x27;t as concentrated or able to penetrate as deeply. So IPL units are supposed to take longer to see results, but the trade off is they are usually cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try out this unit when I ordered it. I also ordered some safety glasses to wear with it. Even though it says it issafe to use the laser without them I figure it never hurts to try to protect your vision... worse case scenario is I look stupid well I&#x27;m all by myself. When I got it I did a quick read thru the manual to make sure I knew what I was doing. If you have ever had a laser hair removal treatment before you probably already know the basic idea. Start with clean, dry shaved skin. Don&#x27;t treat skin that doesn&#x27;t pass the patch test or that has tattoos, pen marks or dark spots/freckles, that part is serious since you could cause some major burns. After reading the manual I plugged the unit in and went to town. The unit has a nice long cord for the wall and for the hand held portion which makes it easy to use. When you flip the power switch that is by the power cord the unit will require a patch test... you will have to put the skin that you will be treating against the blinking light on the base unit, the unit will scan the skin and if it is light enough it will unlock the unit. Then you chose your desired laser level from 1-5. I used the level 4 the first treatment, which can give a pretty good zap depending on your skin tone and how sensitive a area you are using it on. My skin is pale enough that I could have easily used the level five without it being painful, but I was worried about how my skin might react after the treatment. To do the treatment you have to make firm contact with the skin and wait for the unit to chirp and then press the button on the top of the handheld laser. Then move to the next area and repeat. If the unit doesn&#x27;t have good contact it will the skin you&#x27;ll have to get the angle right before it will zap you. This process can take awhile because even though the head on this unit is one of the larger ones, it still I believe takes four zaps to do a square inch of skin.&lt;br /&gt;After my first treatment I used some soothing lotion and wait to see what would happen... and waited... and waited... really It was a couple weeks but that can seem like forever when you want to know if something worked. Well for two weeks I continued to do my regular shaving on the areas I treated and didn&#x27;t notice a huge change. Which is probably why I lost some of my drive and didn&#x27;t do my next treatment after two weeks like I was supposed to. I waited an extra week and let my hair grow out instead of shaving it. The manual said at two weeks you are supposed to notice hair start to fall out. Well I don&#x27;t know if my hair fell out but at three weeks I have a noticeable pattern in my hair growth. You could see the little squares where I had zapped the laser... pretty much showing me how bad my first attempt at covering the whole surface area I was treating was. I was happy though to see a noticeable difference in hair growth between the little areas I had missed and the treated areas.&lt;br /&gt;So based off of the first couple treatments I think this seems to be a good unit. Only other word of advice is if you buy this unit be patient. You are supposed to treat every two weeks, doing it more won&#x27;t make a difference it will just use up your laser quicker so you&#x27;ll need to buy a replacement sooner. Like a professional would tell you when the hair gets zapped it continues to be pushed out by the follicle which can appear like regular hair growth. It takes a couple weeks to see results with each treatment and for your hair to start a new grow cycle and be ready for another treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see if permanent hair removal can be achieved with this unit comparable to salons. I guess I&#x27;ll see how it does over the next couple months.</li>
    <li> Works great on underarms!  After a few treatments, almost all gone, even after 6 months of no treatments.  As they say, doesn&#x27;t work at all on light colored hair so pretty useless on my light to medium brown colored leg hair.  Works well on my toes.  Worth the extra price to avoid buying additional light heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. Although the process is a bit tedious, it&#x27;s painless and effective.</li>
    <li> This thing is AWESOME!  I love being able to use it at home.  I have had professional laser hair removal 2x. Once 4 years prior to owning this and another at least 15 years prior.  IF there is a difference it is minimal and I love the ability to do spot treatments without spending a fortune on going to the laser center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it now 5 times on lower legs and under arms and I would say 70-80% of the hair is gone.  If its not actually gone, I am only shaving once in 2 weeks on minimal areas and I was an every other day shaver.  I am olive skinned (half asian) but with freckles (irish) I tan easily so I wouldn&#x27;t call myself fair skinned at all.  I have dark brown hair.  There are skin/hair combos that are more ideal than mine for laser but I am having great success.</li>
    <li> Love this hair removal system! It is THE BEST for removing hair without strong hair-burning smells &amp; without discomfort or pain!  I have been using it off and on (inconsistently) over the course of 8 months. I have lighter skin &amp; dark hair and have used it on legs, underarms, and upper lip. It is so nice not to have to pluck or shave hair as often because hair grows out and drops off after awhile of use, and the hair that is left takes longer to grow back &amp; grows back finer. Used for upper lip at the lower settings (1-2), legs at the highest (5), and underarms graduating from 3 to 5; it&#x27;s awesome that it can be adjusted according to your skin sensitivity!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had laser in a spa for my bikini line and armpits. The salon said after the full round of treatments I&#x27;d have to come in once or twice a year for &#x27;touch up&#x27;, a few hairs will come back over time no matter what method you use. This was included in the treatment package, they went out of business a year later (of course) and sure enough over time a few hairs reappear. The iLIGHT is massively cheaper than the salon, I&#x27;ve been using it to touch up my pits and bikini line and also started my lower legs, upper lip and chin. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if there will be permanent hair reduction, but the hair growth is definitely slower. I shave once a week and zap everything right after and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the week. Treatment is very fast, you hold the window to the skin, keep the button depressed, and the machine will zap every few seconds as you move the window along. If you are a good candidate, darker hair and lighter skin (I&#x27;m Asian), I&#x27;d go for it. Compared to a salon it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I got the Quartz version a few months ago and have used it 5-6 times on my armpits and bikini line. It works great!! I would say my skin tone is a shade darker than fair and I have brown hair (or maybe black in those places). After using it ONE time, I looked at my armpits a week later and realized 1/3 of the hair hadn&#x27;t grown back and the hair that was there was at least a little more fine than before. I believe the manual suggests doing it every 2 weeks for 6 weeks to see results and that was true for me.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I would shave my armpits and maybe go 2 days in a sleeveless shirt but on the second day I&#x27;d be self conscious. I didn&#x27;t like to shave again for ~a week because the hair was thick and my skin would get irritated. Now, after 5-6 uses, I can shave my armpits and have almost nothing grow in for several days. Recently I did a quick dry shave after 6 days and then went another 6 days before shaving. Hair grows in but it&#x27;s barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;The machine has 5 settings and I use level 4 or 5. It doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all, unless the skin was irritated by shaving. However, I have waxed my own bikini in the past so I may have a high threshold. With waxing, after a few strips, it hurts more, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that with this.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have the patience to use it on my legs but I&#x27;m going to try. I tried recently but only completed about a 3 inch strip on each side of each leg. It was way too tedious, but I&#x27;m sure whatever I can manage will be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;I did run into an issue with the first product I received. I&#x27;m 99% sure I was following the instructions, but when I pressed the button nothing would happen. It stressed me out after dropping that kind of money but luckily Amazon let me exchange it at no cost with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I ordered the red safety glasses I saw recommended on Amazon, but they make things so bright that I can&#x27;t see clearly. I just close my eyes and/or look away. The flash is brightenough that I think you should be careful.</li>
    <li> today is my 4th treatment at 2 months (3 treatment during 1st month). I did IPL hair reduction before coz my hair is course n dark so the first few treatments were quite painful (at full energy level coz anything less than that won&#x27;t work). I noticed uneven regrowth after treatment which is similar to what I have gone through IPL before in a clinic. This may be a good sign that the device is working but I really need to see how it goes 6 months from now. The regrowth has been slowed down for sure. And overall my legs look less hairy. But the pain is definitely more than a snap of a rubber band at full energy level (again anything less than that is a waste of time) so I have to stop when it&#x27;s too painful. So it took me almost 2 hours to treat 2 legs coz it really feels painful. I guess no pain no gain? Noticed some redness around the follicles which may also be a good sign that the follicles have been kinda burnt. Will update again at a later time</li>
    <li> Excellent, satisfy what it promises! My wife loved!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I upgraded from the non-quartz model after using that for six months.  So I think it&#x27;s taking more cycles for all my hair to grow back in before it gets all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for two months I&#x27;ve been using this at least every other week.  My underarms I&#x27;ve done every week and I am starting to see a huge improvement.  I definitely see a big difference everywhere else, but still have a ways to go.  I&#x27;ve noticed though that when I shave I can go several days without noticeably needing to shave again.  Prior to this, I would have to shave at least every other day.  Big, big plus there.  And being able to shave when you need to is also a plus compared to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not needed to change the bulb yet, although I did order an extra just in case.  With the non-quartz I had to change every &amp;#34;body and a half&amp;#34; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient.  Prepare to dedicate a few hours to this process.  You have to shave first and dry completely.  Each pulse only does a small area at once.  The bulb will heat up and you will want to stop for a little while to let it cool.  Overheating it will wear it out quicker and will also burn you.  I&#x27;m a wimp and I can&#x27;t handle it beyond the second setting, so that also takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POWER USAGE: This is a big one.  I tried using it in the living room so I could watch some netflix at the same time.  It actually tripped the circuit and shut the tv off.  So I moved it to the bathroom where there is little else on the same circuit and the lights still dim when you zap.  My high powered hair dryer doesn&#x27;t even do that.  Just a little perspective on the amount of energy it uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it really does work.  But you need patience.  Lots of patience.</li>
    <li> It works but not as quickly as I thought it would.  Be careful with the settings as going higher that 3 will cause pain.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work. I have the perfect skin for this and it was completely useless .tried it for 3 months and did nothing. Returning it</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I geuss my leg hair is too stuborn</li>
    <li> I used this devise on my armpits about 8 times so far- and the growth of hair has not been impacted. I am very fair skinned with dark underarm hair- so the devise should have significantly reduced hair growth within the first 3-5 applications. My conclusion: Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Just received... Will use how it says and hope for the best</li>
    <li> Okay. SO my review has nothing to do with whether the product works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mainly here to bich about the pain. Because holyyyy hell. Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently in laser treatment right now, actually. I&#x27;m doing legs, arms, and tummy. Imma hairy female, what can I say. Additionally, the docs usually do the laser on a higher frequency for me due to coarse hair. Pain fkin blows, but it&#x27;s bearable. I&#x27;ve waxed much before, too. Point is, I&#x27;m decent at handling pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catch: the pain is very different between the two methods (laser vs IPL i.e. Remmington iLight). Laser is a very very unpleasant pain that is most comparable to needles being stuck into your follicles. Which ow. But it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington? It feels like a very quick burn. Seems that&#x27;d be okay, right? Not in my opinion. While laser is like slight needle torture, being slightly burned (Remington) makes my brain freak the **** out because no, its not just cosmetic pain, its more like *beep* !!!!! THAT BURNED. wtf omg amiokay? ....okay again. *beep* FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then you sit silent for a few moments thinking about how society has screwed you over into caring about hair so much till the point of repeatedly burning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You aren&#x27;t actually being burned. It just feels exactly like that. And lizard-human brain reacts worse and extra nervously because it is an *alarming* pain. Your reflexes are wired to pull back from it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly, just imagine heating up a pan on the stove on high heat, and, while it&#x27;s hot, tapping whatever part of your body you want the hair gone on it. That is how I would describe iLight Quartz&#x27;s pain. I don&#x27;t know if non-Quartz will feel as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From all that I researched, I do indeed think this device would deliver results. I really do think so. But the scary as 2nd degree burning shocks kind of make it hard to go that far till you do see results. I even tried in on my super white with dark hair boyfriend. He agrees, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;Specifically (and he didn&#x27;t read my review for those skeptics out there &#x3D;D ): &amp;#34;Very annoying and alarming short zap of pure burn&lt;br /&gt;Could use as torture device&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO yeah. Be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were you and considering buying this, I&#x27;d do what I did: buy through amazon/be sure you can return this item if you&#x27;re not satisfied with it. If your lizard brain indeed reacts like mines, return and get your $400 back and go join the circus.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Just after the first use I noticed a difference in hair growth.  Looking forward to seeing the results after the three recommended treatments.</li>
    <li> The product packaging was for the iLight pro plus Quartz but the actual product in the box was the IPL6000</li>
    <li> Works very well! I am very pleased with the results!!!</li>
    <li> I am a man who has been interested in body-hair removal for a long time. I&#x27;d tried shaving, but after all the tedious work of shaving everywhere, my dark hair follicles were visible under my skin even immediately after shaving. I dropped $300 on a professional full-body wax, and I was pleased with the result, except for that by the time the swelling and irritation died down (a little over a week) I had visible regrowth again. So that was not a sustainable option for sure. My dermatologist informed me that laser hair removal would cost well over $6000 and would require over a half-dozen 5-hour removal sessions spread out over 6-8 months. Obviously, that&#x27;s prohibitively expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began researching these Home IPL products. I found that the very same pale skin/dark hair combo that makes shaving so unsatisfying for me made me a great candidate for IPL treatments. I purchased an ILight Pro Quartz from a local store. I knew Remington was a trustworthy company, unlike some of the other companies who only sell IPL products that are half the price of this one and have sketchy reviews. As far as choosing the model, I wasn&#x27;t trying to deal with switching/faulty cartridges or refill packs, so I went for the model that was supposed to last for several thousands of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it 1-2 times every 2 weeks for about 3 months on my legs, stomach, chest, groin and butt, I can say without a doubt that I have achieved at least a 60% hair growth reduction. NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT get super fast and convenient results using this product. However, I can say that by following the instructions carefully and being as consistent as possible, I have seen significant results so far, and I am confident that I will eventually reach the smooth, hairless skin that I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works by zapping the hair follicle under the skin, heating it up, and forcing the follicle to stop growing. Because of this, it is important to shave as close to the skin as possible prior to each use. This means DON&#x27;T expect to be able to throw away your razor after purchasing. The process is slow and definitely tedious, but doing this will not only make each treatment more effective because more of the IPL energy will hit the follicle itself instead of being wasted on other parts of the hair, but it will also make it less painful as the heat energy won&#x27;t have as much hair to heat up, so it won&#x27;t feel as hot, stingy, and burning. I have found the mild discomfort during use to be tolerable, especially when I shave first, even on max strength setting. Shaving first also greatly reduces the burning hair smell that does happen if you don&#x27;t shave first or if you miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is likely that you won&#x27;t see any results at all for the first 2-3 uses, or about a month. On uses after that, I began to notice that the hair I shaved and treated was growing back much slower and more unevenly. In several areas it wasn&#x27;t growing back at all. After about 2 months, the stubble that grew back between treatments began to just fall out in some places. I&#x27;m still working on the more stubborn, coarse hair on my groin, mid-chest, and stomach, as well as the harder areas to reach/treat evenly, such as my butt and the back of my thighs. Progress is slow, but it is still progress. And way cheaper than waxing or laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all is said and done, after dozens of full treatments, the bulb cartridge has never overheated, never failed, and has yet to need to be replaced. Considering that even a $6000 laser treatment would take 6 months, I think it&#x27;s unfair to expect a $400 at-home alternative to work any faster. I don&#x27;t think this product will work for everyone especially people who don&#x27;t have the right combination of light skin and dark hair. But I can say it has been working alright for me. I will likely update my review in a few more months.kin as possible prior to each use. This means DON&#x27;T expect to be able to throw away your razor after purchasing.

I will likely update my review in a few more months.</li>
    <li> Its been two weeks and I am already seeing results! Hair is starting to fall out. I started using on setting 3, but realized setting 5 isn&#x27;t painful. There are a few areas that are more sensitive, if it&#x27;s a big problem you can pick up some numbing cream from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely thrilled!</li>
    <li> Love this unit, the quartz bulb lasts at least 3-4 times longer than the standard iLight I had before. The only down side is the cost of the replacement bulbs ($99), and the fact that I got a bad one from Amazon that only lasted 10-12 flashes. I would highly recommend this quartz version to anyone, just be wary of the replacement bulbs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to remove hair on my stomach and back.  I have the recommended skin color and hair type for the Light Pro to give it&#x27;s best results.  I have used the Remington multiple  times and have had no noticeable results.  I hope to use it for a couple more months to see if there will be any results at all. I would like to know what the return policy is if I continue to see no results.</li>
    <li> Good bang for the buck, works great, wife says that it feels hotter than the ones in clinics or other brands, though i get that its a subjective thing, nevertheless she&#x27;s happy with it, saved us a few hundreds of dollars by not needing to go to a clinic for that sort of things, now after just one session there&#x27;s a very satisfactory result, though she didnt have that much to zap to begin with</li>
    <li> I waited a few months to write my review, to see what the actual results would be.  So far, so good.  I used to have very stubbly legs within 2 days of shaving--a real nuisance during the spring and summer.  The IPL has reduced the amount of hair substantially, and what is growing back seems finer and lighter.  Now I can go weeks without shaving.  4 stars versus 5, since I thought all hair would be permanently removed (and maybe it will be if I keep using every 2 weeks).  I went with the most expensive quartz unit due to exponentially more flashes.  Even the priciest model is basically the cost of one laser treatment, and you will need at least 3 of those to yield equivalent results.  The flash even at strongest setting is very bearable (especially on the legs).  Bikini area and underarms you might want to go with a lower setting.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing!!!!  I have been using it for a month now.  I am using it on my under arms.  In the past I had to shave every 1-2 days.  I can now go a week before I feel any hair growth and then it is minimal. I love it!</li>
    <li> Very good results, like the manual said, after the third session I start to see changes. I am using it in level 5 and not painful for me. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Been helping my wife with her leg hair removal and it is going very well.  So far I would say a 2/3 reduction in hair overall with the hair that is left being very fine and hard to see.  My wife is fair skinned and has dark black hair.  My wife has went six months without having to shave her legs so she is liking it.  On the highest setting there is some pain associated with the process but it is bearable.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase ever on Amazon (crazy, I know). A friend had recommended an earlier model of iLight awhile back and I finally got around to purchasing my own. Amazon had the best price so I decided to finally become an Amazon shopper. I went for the quartz model because in the long run it seemed like the best deal to not have to frequently replace the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: the iLight came in a cardboard box with everything you need - manual, cleaning cloth, and DVD with video instructions. As other reviewers have said, the manual is for the previous model, but they inserted a sheet with the quartz updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Device: the device is easy to put together - just plug in the cord. Thankfully it’s a long cord so you don’t have to worry about sitting next to the outlet. The handle fits nicely into your hand and the button is easy to push. There are 5 levels of intensity and a sensor on the base and the handle to make sure your skin color is appropriate to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I started out a little intimidated, I didn’t know what to expect. I watched the DVDs and then got setup and ready to go. You should thoroughly shave first, if you use the iLight over dark hair stubble, you&#x27;ll feel a pinch. I am a fairly tan person so I was worried about using it on my skin, even though it was within the acceptable range, but I had no problem with the sensor registering or use. I turned it up to the highest intensity for the best chance at results. The light is very bright, but no eye protection is needed. I thought this would be a quick process, but it took longer to get through than I expected, one leg was around 15 minutes, but it wasn’t a big deal since it only has to be done once every 2 weeks. If you hold down the button, you can shave some time off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I&#x27;m at about 70% hair reduction after 6 weeks. I&#x27;m a pretty hairy person, so that&#x27;s significant for me. There are patches on my legs with no hair, but other  areas that don’t lookaffected much, probably due to my application and the hair cycle. If there was a quicker permanent alternative, I’d probably try it, but haven’t found anything yet that can offer anything superior. I&#x27;m going to stay on the two week schedule to see if I can get to 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Yes, I recommend this product if you are looking for permanent hair growth but are willing to keep at it. And I’ll definitely purchase from Amazon again!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed to say that this product does not work. I have a very light complexion with dark hair which made me the perfect candidate. I have used for a few months with no noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I just start to use it and results will take 3 or 4 weeks. It seems to be very good and working well.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this, I had scheduled appointments at a local clinic for laser hair removal, and three sessions cost about the same as this device. I would have needed at least 5-8 more sessions to completely remove my unwanted hair, so doing home treatments with the Remington is definitely much, much cheaper for me. 50,000 flashes is more than enough so I could even pass it to one of my friends when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using it at the highest setting, I would recommend that you have some aloe vera gel ready and apply it to the treated area after it&#x27;s been flashed so that the redness/dryness goes away faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;ve had success with laser sessions in the past and want to save time and money on future treatments.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works well...</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have had 3 treatments so far and what I have noticed is patches of hairless skin or where it is thinner. It also seems to be growing back slower. I still have only used it on the lowest setting. Most of the time it is barely noticeable but occasionally it feels like it really zaps me and I don&#x27;t like that. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try it on level 2. It is slow going but seeing results is encouraging! I have very pale legs partly because the hair on my legs is quite dark and coarse and it grows fast, so shaving very often causes irritation so it doesn&#x27;t look good anyway. I am hopeful that I will be able to wear shorts and skirts more often with the help of this product.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to have 30,000 flashes, it flashed enough to half of my calf. The book says it is only good for 1500 flashes same as the old model. Total junk!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in May 2014, after careful consideration and reading a lot of reviews on several different products. I have mostly been following the manufacturers directions for use. I can tell you that after using the product for only a couple of months, it does work. I can see a definite reduction in hair growth. I have used the product on my face, underarms, bikini area, and legs. I believe the reason for using it every 2 weeks is because the natural hair growth pattern regrows hair about every 2 weeks. I have medium tone skin and naturally dark brown hair. I have not entirely avoided tanning. I do tan very well in the summer with mild sun exposure. I do not believe sun exposure has affected hair growth results. I have seen a nice reduction of hair on sun exposed areas, as well as, lighter skin areas. I am hopeful that with continued use, I will see less and less hair growth. I chose the quartz product because the reviewers for the original bulb system complained that the bulbs did not last very long and tended to burn out before they were supposed to. It may be too soon to tell but, I have not had any issues with the quartz bulb after using the product at least 4 times on all body areas. I do not find the product to be very painful even when using it on the highest setting. The other reasons I chose this product as opposed to professional laser hair removal is because, this seemed to be a less expensive option, I can use it in the privacy of my own home, and choose when I want to use it. I gave only 4 stars because the product takes time to use and seems to require a lot of patience to see desired hairless results. Also, I have not seen as much hair growth reduction on my face as other areas even though, I have used full strength.</li>
    <li> Day 1:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, this review is going to be an ongoing review. I&#x27;m going to follow along and track progress, since that&#x27;s not something you see on here often. I&#x27;m starting out with 5 stars because it arrived, and though I&#x27;m not a fan of how it&#x27;s marked on unit and in literature, it appears to be in order. Star rating will follow if it meets the claims made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived via Fedex. Selection was made because many review sites put this as a great unit, with the only issue being it&#x27;s price. Some review places actually had the gall to state they knock it from 1 to 7 or 8 on a top 10 because of price. The price is on par with 1 session at a place for treatment, so if it works, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than professional treatments. Time to put it to a test myself. I&#x27;ve tried a few small electrolysis machines in the past, and had issues with burn marks from them. My sister has the Tria 4X, which I tested out, and didn&#x27;t like because it was bulky to use, and had a teeny tiny usage area. The hand held part of this for treating is much lighter than the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have this out of the box, and read over the manual, up to the other language and stopped. First issue with the system is that to unlock it and begin using it, you have to press a piece of skin on the device from the intended working area. In the picture, it&#x27;s the little black window visible on the base unit. That&#x27;s going to be hard to do for a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the manual only refers to the IPL6000 iLIGHT Pro. It doesn&#x27;t state Pro Plus or Pro Plus Quartz. The specifications page in the manual even states it uses a Xenon bulb, so being the Quartz system, if you&#x27;re an engineer type, might as well skip the specs, since they are going to be wrong. There is another sheet that was given in the box that states &#x27;Addendum&#x27; that talks a bit about the Pro Plus Quartz. It also modifies some bullet points with references. It does not provide an updated list of specifications such as Energy Level. The bottomof the unit only states IPL6000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a LOT of don&#x27;ts in the manual, make sure to read them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved the box for it to put it back in when done, per instructions. The outer cardboard box it came in is presently my cat&#x27;s newest hideout. Time to go get a shave and give my first update. Looking forward to this. I live in the Sunshine State, but my darkest tan falls within the treatment range, so I should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an owner now for several hours. So far, performed a first treatment on neck, chest, and underarms. Went a lot faster than I expected, far faster than I could have done with the tiny Tria head on my sister&#x27;s 4X. Maximum power level didn&#x27;t hurt at all in most places, a few places it felt like a brief, hard pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to see what would happen by breaking rules and zapping a stray dark hair, and it singed off. Not the most fun experience either, so definitely listen to the rules and shave first. I also decided to see what would happen if I tried rezapping an area after a little while, and it was MUCH more painful after 45 minutes of cooldown time. It says only to treat an area once, and it means it. I know, follow the rules. As an engineer, I always feel the need to test capabilities and technical writer&#x27;s understanding. They are right on the money on these two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for light level, you&#x27;re definitely going to want eye protection, my sunglasses did the job just fine. Frequently bought with this suggests rather expensive laser eye protection. That&#x27;s overkill. Just a good, cheap set of sunglasses will work fine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to all this, definitely keep an eye on the light window. Every 10 or so flashes, I noticed smudging. It&#x27;s going to cause excess heat buildup and shorten the bulb life, so I was making sure to keep it cleaned off. The lint free cloth it comes with doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of cleaning it, but a q-tip worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onething I saw mentioned on reviews is you know you&#x27;re getting something done when you can faintly smell burnt hair, and I did, so here&#x27;s hoping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on this evening, going to get a lot more personal with it on arms, legs, stomach, and bikini area. I went with the quartz bulb for the longer life for a reason. Also going to be a good way to find out exactly how well it performs in the long run. I&#x27;ll do one more update today after that session, then additional sessions will be smaller updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get a chance later day 1. Got it day 2. You really need to go contortionist to get the backs of your legs without help. They really should add an indicator bump on the button to let you know when your finger&#x27;s in the right place too. When you finally get maneuvered right, and you press, and you realize your finger slipped, it&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a LOT longer to do my legs than I thought it would. Between getting bent out of shape to reach areas, stopping every so often to clean the head, and adjusting mirrors this way and that, still not sure how well a job I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, total count for the full first wave, about 420 flashes. That includes neck, chest, arms, legs, stomach, and bikini. Yes, I&#x27;m covering a large area. Other reviews have said they are doing one small area, so this will be a good indication of if you&#x27;re going for more full body coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was using the Pro or Pro+, I&#x27;d be at 1/3 used on my bulb, on the first pass, as it&#x27;s about 3 passes, following the math. I should get about 80 full passes if literature is correct for the quartz bulb. So to continue math based on present prices of bulbs, the Xenon bulbs cost $20 for 3 uses, so somewhere between $6 and $7 per full body coverage. The quartz bulbs are about $100 for 80 uses, so about $1.25 give or take. If you&#x27;re reading this sometime in the future, bear in mind, those prices reflect now. You might need to adjust them eventually. Also, I&#x27;m rounding; 1500/420 is a bit more than 3, and 35000/420 is a bit more than 80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I made the wise choice so far. Let&#x27;s see if the bulb can keep up, and how the product works. I&#x27;m not going to push things, so until next week! :)</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about a month. While it is not as strong as the lasers professionals use, I definitely feel it working while I use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok...that&#x27;s the perfect way to describe this product. I&#x27;ve done up to 4 treatments now from head to toe-literally. Face/arms/underarms/legs/and other misc patches of body hair. I say &#x27;up to 4&#x27; because it&#x27;s so time consuming I&#x27;ll do one body part one day, another body part a few days later, and so on. So here&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br /&gt;1.) Buy this thru Ulta and use a coupon-it&#x27;ll save you some money and Ulta always has freebies with purchases. They&#x27;ll ship it free, too.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The product works...sorta. I&#x27;ve used it on my face 4 times and the hair is growing back only slightly slower than usual. Hair on face is more course than body hair. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t work as well as on body. BE VERY CAREFUL using it on your face! Even if I close and cover my eyes, the flash is very bright!!! It could definitely cause eye damage! In fact, I have to close my eyes and look away when I use it on ANY body part...it&#x27;s that bright. A time or two I&#x27;ve accidentally not looked away and it left me seeing spots for a long time. Not good to do! BE CAREFUL! It should be required to use safety lenses.&lt;br /&gt;3.) I&#x27;ve used it on my arms and legs 4 times and the hair grows back MUCH slower there. On my arms there&#x27;s about a 30% reduction in overall hair, but what is growing back is a softer, lighter, and again, grows back MUCH slower. For my legs, I can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s less hair, but I used to be one of those that would have stuble less than 24 hours after shaving. But now I can go 5-7 days between shaving, and even then the hair is so soft it wouldn&#x27;t bother me to go another few days.&lt;br /&gt;4.) It is very time consuming. It takes a really long time to do any body part and you need to let it cool down every now and then while working because the wand gets very warm. I usually laser while I&#x27;m watching TV once or twice a week, so I&#x27;m not really bothered by how long it takes to do. But if I did all the hair I need to do in one sitting, it would be a half day project! Who has that kindof time and patience?!?&lt;br /&gt;5.) Some areas are difficult to do because of the wand shape. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any other way to design it to make it easier to use in some places, but using it can sometimes leave me feeling like a contortionist. You may need to enlist the help of a friend or partner.&lt;br /&gt;6.) It does not hurt. I either have a really, really high pain tolerance, or other people have low tolerances. I use it on the highest setting on EVERYTHING and the only time I&#x27;ve felt any pain is if I accidentally zap over a blemish. That stings-ok, that stings really badly, but if I can manage to avoid doing that, I barely feel anything but a little warmth and the tiniest of snaps. The colder the machine, the less you feel that. In fact, I don&#x27;t even feel the heat or the tiny snap when the wand is good and cool.&lt;br /&gt;7.) 4 full body treatments and I&#x27;m still on the first quartz bulb. But I have a feeling it will be going out anytime now. I hope not, though!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth the money and time. I hate shaving, so anything that makes me have to shave less often is ok by me. I wish it were more of a permanent removal, but for $350, I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using as recommended for 2 months now.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  Heartbreaking because of how incredibly expensive it was.  Super disappointed!</li>
    <li> Hurts, and have yet to see a difference.  I have used once a week for 3 months</li>
    <li> Update: I ended up talking to Remington customer service to confirm the models and what we should have: the base will still say IPL6000 on quartz models&lt;br /&gt;Initially I didn&#x27;t question it since my iLight came in a pro plus quartz box and I even compared the the bulb to the picture on Remington&#x27;s website (definitely the quartz). After I got an comment to confirm I had the right product, I saw the base of mine also shows IPL6000 as does the manual - you should find an inserted addendum for quartz. I wanted to confirm so I checked with customer service. The base model is still IPL6000, the Q is for the the quartz bulb and the upgraded technology, but it will not say IPL6000Q on the base&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for an at home hair removal solution and finally chose Remington&#x27;s IPL (Pro Plus Quartz model). I researched different options and brands. Not surprisingly with this type of product, I read a lot of mixed reviews and it&#x27;s hard to tell which ones to trust; however I came to my decision because 1) I knew the brand and 2) sounded like my best chance of results with the least amount of side effects, I don&#x27;t want to burn my skin in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I&#x27;m a good candidate for this system, my skin and hair color match the recommended, and I followed the instructions. It&#x27;s not hard to figure out, but I still watched the videos online before trying. I used it on my legs, under arms, and bikini line. The verdict - it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s slow, but if you want immediate results, then stick to shaving. I went into it with realistic expectations, I knew it was going to take some time. After my third treatment, I saw slight hair reduction. After a couple more, the hair is noticeably thinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes it&#x27;s going to take some time. I still need to shave, but there is a definite reduction in hair and I&#x27;m optimistic it will continue as I keep using the device. It does also depend on your application. It&#x27;s prone to user error, my first couple sessions I was lazy and missed areas on my legs, I can tell where I did and didn&#x27;t apply the treatment. It can be a little tedious if you&#x27;re doing a large area, but spend the extra time to get every inch - it&#x27;ll save you time in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the i-Light was simple and relatively painless. It sometimes stings for a second, but it&#x27;s tolerable and quick. It does seem to get hotter if you&#x27;re using it for extended periods of time, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it overheating, but usually give it a minute in between body parts to cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my choice. I do think the i-Light delivers on its claims - as long as you are using it as intended and give it a chance to actually work, you won&#x27;t see overnight results. I&#x27;m going to stick with it and hope by summer I can be at the point where I no longer need to shave.ple sessions I was lazy and missed areas on my legs, I can tell where I did and didn&#x27;t apply the treatment.

    <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT WORKED AS ADVERTISED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my IPL6000Q direct from Remington in February of 2014, along with an extra quartz bulb, in order to take advantage of various discounts and save $100 off the original $500 subtotal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this month the light on the unit finally began flashing to indicate that the bulb is going to fail soon.  So, on a positive note, it would appear that the bulb did, in fact, last somewhere around 30,000 flashes (as advertised).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the rest of my experience has been an overwhelming disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like the fellow reviewer &amp;#34;Paul S&amp;#34; I am male and have been using the iLight, as instructed, with methodical (verging on obsessive) consistency.  Unfortunately, I have probably experienced less than a 10% reduction in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, after several treatments, the iLight appears to be working.  While most of the hair grows back there are nonetheless very obvious places where the hair remains very short, just a black spot barely above skin level.  Pulling on such a hair with tweezers results in no resistance and the hair simply falls out (although they fall out perfectly fine on their own).  While the number of hairs affected in this way is small, it gave me confidence that continued use would eventually result in a significant reduction in overall hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the case.  In as little as a month or two the missing hair all begins to grow back.  I have heard arguments that hair grows in cycles, but after 6 months of consistent use it is unreasonable to assume that nearly ALL the hair is growing back because of cyclical growth patterns.  I would wager, in fact, that I have ultimately achieved less than a 10% reduction in hair growth in treated areas.  Possibly less than 5%.  This is frustrating both for the loss of a significant amount of money that was spent on this product, but also because of the loss of an enormous amount of time and effort invested in the hair removal process itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost hours upon hours zapping myself over and over, a process that is both tedious and uncomfortable, only to discover that it appears to have been almost entirely wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not the only one either.  Two other individuals have also been using my iLight (albeit on smaller areas of their body).  They have both likewise experienced the same eventual regrowth.  All of us are ideal candidates, with very pale skin and dark body hair.  We have all very carefully followed the instructions, shaving the hair as close as possible, and been very rigorous and methodical in our use of the iLight.  And all of us, having crossed the point of 6 months of total use, have nothing remotely approaching the average &amp;#34;66% fewer hairs,&amp;#34; as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale of my disappointment with this product, with the loss of both my time and money, cannot really be overstated.  I had earnestly hoped that technology had finally provided a cost effective means for a dedicated consumer to finally remove their own body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  And, in retrospect, I am not particularly surprised.  If home IPL technology was even close to as effective as claimed then I feel like the professional laser hair removal industry would have already collapsed.  But it hasn&#x27;t.  There is no undercurrent of chatter on hair removal forums, or bodybuilding forums, about the equally effective and cost efficient alternatives to professional laser hair removal.  This is very likely because such an alternative simply does not exist yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I cannot help but wonder if a large quantity of those overwhelmingly positive reviews for the Remington iLight product line are fake.  I just find it extraordinarily unlikely that so many people could have had such positive results when my own results, along with the results of the other two individuals who have also used my iLight, have ultimately been so overwhelmingly negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that &amp;#34;individual results may vary.&amp;#34;  But I can only hope that my warning saves any potential consumer from potentially sharing the significant disappointment that I have experienced using this product.</li>
    <li> I know this product isn&#x27;t approved for facial hair, but it worked wonderfully for me. I have semi-fair skin that gets much darker in summer, which is when I started using this product. My facial hair was black and thick, mainly around my chin and jawline, and I had been struggling with it for years. I used the Remington on the second setting for three weeks in a row, three sessions each time, and at the end of the month I saw massive improvement. The hair is thinner and less noticeable where it does still grow. The only down side to this product is the life of the lights so I would recommend ordering extras with the original purchase.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worthless product, the surface of the light is too small. I have the perfect hair and skin according to product description, but it does NOT work. Have used it several times with no result and now this product is not not eligible for return. Sad.&lt;br /&gt;This is posted by Asa Maria Rottsolk</li>
    <li> My IPL6000 model listed on the bottom of the unit has no (Q) as part of the ending model number, however, box reads Pro Plus Quartz,  makes me wonder if other type cartridges for the i light Pro may work if quartz cartridges are not accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many mixed reviews on Amazon and other websites as to results of these IPL&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll just have to find out for my self, so far my unit seems operational, results are still pending,  it seems that each individual skin/hair is different, so, I guess that&#x27;s the disclaimer, may or may not work out, high price to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see what my results are be before ordering additional quartz cartridges, not sure of their availability, I see none yet listed on Amazon, only the Remington website, tight market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update pending..........</li>
    <li> love it , seems to work great. Wish i would have bought this long time ago</li>
    <li> Great product, works as advertised and easy to use.</li>
    <li> After two treatments... Zero results</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington iPL Quartz after researching it and discovering that it had 30,000 pulses, however, I believe the supplier that supplied the item to Amazon made a model swap.  The outer box had a removable cardboard sleeve, and sleeve seems legitimate (i.e Remington iLight ProPlusQuartz) however, the model in the box was actually the iPL6000 (the model # is on the back).  The manual is what tipped me off because it&#x27;s for the iPL6000 and states that the replacement cartridge has to be replaced after 1500 pulses (which the iPL6000Q has supposedly 30,000 pulses).  I&#x27;m so disappointed because I&#x27;ve been waiting for this item to come down to a decent price.  I&#x27;m waiting for Amazon to rectify this and find out what happened (on the supplier end) so this doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else.</li>
    <li> So far I believe this product to be working.  I have coarse hair and have always joked about have a 5:00 shadow on my legs and underarms.  I have used this 3 time in 3 weeks and can see a difference.  I think it is actually working.  My hair growth is noticeably reduced.  I&#x27;m hopefull...</li>
    <li> The product is in perfect conditions, I hope to be the i light ProPlusQuartz (30.000 flashes) because the manual say 1.500 flashes but the box is right.</li>
    <li> Though on paper I appear to be the ideal condidate for this device skin and hair tone wise, unfortunately it  did not work at all for me, other than burn me in some places, and I really wanted to love this and have it make all unwanted hair go away. There is also a design issue: the skin tone tester, while a good idea to have on such a device, should be in the handle, not on the base unit. It is a bit difficult to test some areas due to this design decision.    My sister purchased a Philips home laser device that she used during the same timespan, and her hair has not yet grown back, so I will give hers a try and see what happens.    Could be TMI for some folks: One example of where it should have worked if nowhere else: I have one thick, dark hair, that I usually pluck. I lasered over it for sure at least 10 times. The hair continued to grow. That stupid hair is obviously always in its growth cycle, and it probably mocked me for my laser attempts. It is a thick and ugly as before, darn thing.    I feel bad giving this device such a bad rating, because it is very well made, but since it did not do the one thing it was designed for in my case, I could not give it more.</li>
    <li> Did not work (skin test failed on a Caucasian skin.  It may be due to the horrible design and location of the skin tester.  You have to put the base unit on the spot to test...give me a break!  Called for support and voice recording said &amp;#34;only offer support 8 to 4 CST.  Returned it the next day!</li>
    <li> This is not a use it one and be done device. I have been using it for a year and yes it does work. I can see where the hair is not going back. But you must keep using it to get the other hair that is not in a growth state. Read the instructions so you will understand what I am taking about.</li>
    <li> Slows down hair growth but new hair comes out where there wasn&#x27;t before. The hair continues to grow, the machine does not stop the growth.</li>
    <li> I got this item a couple weeks ago. I have used it twice now, I used the second setting the first time and the third setting the second time. So far when I use it does hurt a little but I also smell like burning hair so I am hoping this is a good thing..? anyone else have this happen?</li>
    <li> The product is perfect and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very poor....stopped working after a few uses.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  I have only done 2 treatments and can see some places with out hair already.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the final results.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford spa laser treatments anymore and was really unhappy with the service. I was doubtful that a home device would work and the price daunting, even though much much cheaper than continuing at a spa. The negative reviews I saw online didn&#x27;t make the decision easier but bottom line is results will vary if you don&#x27;t have dark hair with a light skin tone. My results after two months have been FANTASTIC! hair is gone if not significantly thinner. It&#x27;s easy to use once you get the hang of it and treatment time is 30 minutes or less. It is not approved or recommended for the face but I&#x27;ve done it and it&#x27;s worked well. In my opinion it&#x27;s hard to do after shaving, as instructed, because you can&#x27;t see the hairs. Yes it hurts slightly more but was much more effective for me. I also started by doing it once a week,  instead of every two weeks, for the first 3 treatments. That allowed me to catch any hairs I missed. Now 2 months in hair is getting sparse and I&#x27;ll transition to maintenance soon. It does not come with goggles. I do recommend getting a pair.</li>
    <li> Bought this unit for my wife and daughter.  They love it!</li>
    <li> it worked great ONE time.</li>
    <li> Treatment number 2. I have noticed hair reduction! I used it on my face yes it says no but I don&#x27;t care. I used it on my upper lip and also where I do my eyebrows just for fun. Looks like less hair is growing back in those areas. Legs it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all on setting 3. Bikini area... That hurt on 1! Idk if it&#x27;s cause the hair or what but in will update you guys on month 2! After 2 more treatments.</li>
    <li> You do not want to buy this hair removal product horrible DO NOT BUY THIS STUPID PRODUCT DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DON&#x27;T PURCHASE IT OKAY.</li>
    <li> It work. The reviews are correct. It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair</li>
    <li> So okay, I was hesitant and did A LOT of research. I have used it maybe 8-10 times. I do it every week, once a week. And I don&#x27;t shave for the rest of the week. It has done wonders for me. I have slightly darker skin, a light olive and natural black hair. It was a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have the perfect skin type for this unit as described by the manufacture however, it does not work.  The unfortunate part is it takes several months to start see results but that takes you out of the return period.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> The best choice if you want to remove your leg hairs.</li>
    <li> seems to work very well. The wife is very happy with her Christmas present</li>
    <li> Amazing product, but not as fast as it says. I used 4 times, one per week, and still have some.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. What more can I say.  I have very white skin and dark hair.  used this 10 to 12 times on max setting then waited 3 months for my hair to grow back since it grows in stages and it&#x27;s just as full as ever.  I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item.  I have been using it for the past 9 months and have not experienced any permanent results.  My skin is pale (white) with dark hair.  You hair will be thinner while you are using it, but once you stop, it will all grow back.  The name has the word &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; in the product title, but you will not get any permanent results.  Huge waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I received my iLIGHT Pro Plus two months ago, and both me and my wife have been using it ever since. We are both light-skinned and we both have thick dark body hair, so it seemed like the perfect solution. So far it has worked very well for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my legs, and where I used to need to shave them every few days, I can now wait the recommended two weeks between treatments without shaving and still look smooth. There is still hair, but a lot less of it and a lot lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare with professional laser treatments, I also bought a package for my chest from a spa and have been going to them for two months as well. So far they have only been able to do two treatments (wanting a 6 to 8 week period between each treatment), and the hair there is still a lot thicker and denser compared to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to make a judgement from my personal experience, I&#x27;d have to say the iLIGHT Pro Plus is actually working better than the professional treatments. The only thing to keep in mind about that statement is that is does take more time, effort, and dedication - you have to carefully go over each area of your skin every two weeks to get the best results. On the plus side, it does hurt a lot less than the professional laser as well and you can do it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts on the machine itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord for the base station and the wand are both nice and long. It&#x27;s never been a problem reaching a power outlet. The fact that it isn&#x27;t battery powered is also great when doing larger areas like full legs. Both cords wrap around the base nicely and the whole unit can be stored neatly.&lt;br /&gt;The wand is light enough to hold without straining your hands. The button is a little hard to press at times, but it&#x27;s not something you want to accidentally press anyway. The sensors on the wand also need a little bit of fiddling with to engage sometimes on tricky areas like around the knees, but it&#x27;s agood safety feature to have.&lt;br /&gt;After two months the bulb is going strong with no signs of wearing out. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean with the cloth (I wrap mine around a Q-Tip to reach into the window). I do let it cool down from time to time during longer treatments since it does get hot, but it&#x27;s never overheated on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you&#x27;re thinking of laser hair removal but you&#x27;re not sure about going to a spa or doing it yourself, the iLIGHT Pro Plus is a very good investment.</li>
    <li> I used someone elses... They showed me their cool new ipl and while they were gone I would steal into their bathroom and play with it.This Item worked for me. First two tries I got nothing out of it. The third time though I noticed I lost a hair or two. Two days later I flew off on home and I was struck with hair loss. It fell out like I had mange. I need to this item (I just ordered it) so I can zap more. My crotch looks like I&#x27;ve been messing around with feral cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I warn all users to not stop halfway through and do not use someone elses unless you can get access to it again. Unless of course cat molester is a look you go for regularly. I would rate this a one star but It works so damnably well I had to give it the 5 stars it rightly deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am white with dark hair. Zap on high setting and don&#x27;t be a wussy.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  Have used every 2 weeks for 4 months with no reduction in hair.  Amazon will only return within 30 days.  Way too much mony to spend on something that does not even work 1%.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using but kill all most my hair in the leg!!!</li>
    <li> Sent back without using. Needed for my face. Not clear in decription &amp;#34;cannot use on face.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not really seeing any results 2 months of using it as directed. The price is a little much for the product.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Waiting to see if it works for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and I am very satisfied with the product.  It&#x27;s sturdy and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Rahim</li>
    <li> Still using I do c a difference</li>
    <li> Shave the area you&#x27;re going to use this on before treatment. It&#x27;s fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt to use. Pretty quickly you&#x27;re going to see the hair stop growing back. Use it on the parts of your body that you&#x27;re tired of shaving. It&#x27;s an investment, but trust me, you&#x27;re going to save time/money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Great product, does exactly what they say it will.</li>
    <li> great product .. and easy to use</li>
    <li> Very nice and good quality</li>
