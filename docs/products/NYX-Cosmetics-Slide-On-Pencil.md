      <li>Paints smoothly and clarity</li>
      <li>This was a great white eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Great eyeliner not damaged and its the color actually stays on</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and stays.</li>
      <li>She says it goes on smoothly without smudging and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>it goes on light and creamy, not flaky.</li>
      <li>This is great for the morning after those long nights or when your eyes need a pick me up.</li>
      <li>it the white pigment is very strong to put bright colors over it will pop out and be very vibrant</li>
      <li>It does not come out super pigmented</li>
      <li>Blends, smudges quickly.</li>
      <li>Stays on nice white.</li>
      <li>pleased with the product (and with Nyx products in general.)</li>
      <li>I have this pencil in white and I love it.</li>
      <li>it really does brighten up your eyes!</li>
      <li>(don&#x27;t judge  ;-)  )  </li>
      <li>Anyway, this Nyx liner is the first liner that stayed put without undue smudging and smearing all over the place (granted</li>
      <li>You get way more product for about the same price.</li>
      <li>try more colors definitely !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>Super soft.</li>
      <li>I loved this eyeliner, so I did a little research and NYX has the same exact pencil, but it&#x27;s retractable!</li>
      <li>, I love having a white liner but this one makes me wonder if there is something a little better out there.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is also very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Brings out the brightness &amp; you are ready to head out for the night</li>
      <li>It works really well under my eyeshadow to get my colors to their peak brightness.</li>
      <li>Very creamy, and came on time.</li>
      <li>This is a very well made product.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast.</li>
      <li>Really greasy and doesn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s  gentle</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth without having to heat it up and is very white.  </li>
      <li>I sharpen it with a regular eyeliner pencil, though the white liner seems more creamy than others I have used so you will have to be more careful when</li>
      <li>I use this as a lower lid eyeliner in white to create a more open eye effect.</li>
      <li>High quality pencil.</li>
      <li>I bought a second one right away.  </li>
      <li>I need it by Friday and don&#x27;t have the money to order a new one.</li>
      <li>This is the first eyeliner that has actually stayed in place.</li>
      <li>Its a pure white.</li>
      <li>I just bought the one in white to make my eyes pop out a little more.</li>
      <li>Wow this white creamy pencil is what you really looking for .</li>
      <li>but if you are like me and are sensitive to eye makeup</li>
      <li>I had a coupon, so I bought directly from Nyx (via their website).</li>
      <li>Can be placed heavy or lightly.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of the light color or the brand.</li>
      <li>The colour is also very solid, therefore you don&#x27;t have to keep scribbling and hurt your eyes to get a pure white colour.</li>
      <li>Mine also came in no packaging loosely tossed into a large box with a roto tiller machine I purchased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to apply it directly and with an eyeliner brush and same thing.  </li>
      <li>This may be a personal reaction that is not typical</li>
      <li>But it does not have as much staying power as some of my other liners</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used it as a highlight on the forehead, cheeks, and nose for more dramatic makeup.</li>
      <li>I liked this eyeliner at first, not too bad for a white, but the part to turn the actual liner up wouldn&#x27;t work....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smooth application of this pencil.  The duration is phenomenal, and does not lose its presence as the days activities proceed.  I bought a second one right away.  Nothing comparable in the stores.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I&#x27;ve been using this on my eyes to prime for bright, shimmery eyeshadows. I&#x27;ve also used it as a highlight on the forehead, cheeks, and nose for more dramatic makeup. It works really well under my eyeshadow to get my colors to their peak brightness. It also helps to keep my shadow in place all day for lasting wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It&#x27;s not retractable. You will need a jumbo sharpener. And I know the outside looks like it&#x27;s plastic. It is plastic (PVC specifically) and you can actually sharpen it.</li>
    <li> Loved the product and it got here fast!</li>
    <li> Really greasy and doesn&#x27;t stay on.  I&#x27;ve yet to find a white eyeliner that does.</li>
    <li> Purchased for lower waterline. Goes on nice and smooth. Haven&#x27;t had to sharpen yet so can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
    <li> good quality. does not smear</li>
    <li> I usually use Almay brand eyeliner because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic so I took a risk getting this but I did anyway because I love NYX brand. However, I need to stick with the hypoallergenic brands for eyeliner. This came off in my eye and slightly burned a little. This may be a personal reaction that is not typical but if you are like me and are sensitive to eye makeup I sadly can&#x27;t recommend this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I LOVE NYX makeup but I just can&#x27;t use they eyeliner :(</li>
    <li> I just received it today. Do not like it. Stayed on for 20 mins and is already smudgy. Even with primer.</li>
    <li> Paints smoothly and clarity</li>
    <li> This product definitely makes your eyes POP when you use it. Brings out the brightness &amp; you are ready to head out for the night</li>
    <li> Yay! I love it! It definitely opens the eyes and goes with everything! Perfect if you ask me. AND it was delivered BEFORE the promised date. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Doesnt rub off on my waterline as much as i would like, but its a great pencil liner for highlighting.  Very creamy, and came on time.</li>
    <li> it sometimes gets clumped along my lashes. and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the rimmel waterproof liner.</li>
    <li> Love NYX. Works great. Arrived fast.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner, I ordered it in white and I use it on a regular basis. It does not come out super pigmented but I&#x27;m that is what I was looking for. But it does not have as much staying power as some of my other liners but I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of the light color or the brand. I usually like NYX, I love having a white liner but this one makes me wonder if there is something a little better out there.</li>
    <li> I bought on a tip from a make up expert it&#x27;s the pencil version and goes on chunky and the tiny chunks stick to my lashes. Mine also came in no packaging loosely tossed into a large box with a roto tiller machine I purchased. Would like to return but I believe the paperwork was tossed.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It glides on smooth without having to heat it up and is very white.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this eyeliner. She uses it to add a bit of brightness to her eyes. She says it goes on smoothly without smudging and lasts all day. She recommends it to others looking for white eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Tip breaks easy so you have to be careful but it&#x27;s  gentle and I love it</li>
    <li> I had a coupon, so I bought directly from Nyx (via their website). I got the black and green, but I&#x27;m here because I want to get the white as well. This is the first eyeliner that has actually stayed in place. I&#x27;m over 40 with lots of little lines around my eyes and still tend to favor the liner-style I wore in my teens (don&#x27;t judge  ;-)  )  Anyway, this Nyx liner is the first liner that stayed put without undue smudging and smearing all over the place (granted, I wear it with primer, but even with primer, several other liners in my makeup box still tend to smear; I was very pleasantly surprised at the end of the day to find *this* liner still in place and still looking good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the product (and with Nyx products in general.)</li>
    <li> Stays and definitely does not stray. One of the only eye liners that would stay on all day long. The colour is also very solid, therefore you don&#x27;t have to keep scribbling and hurt your eyes to get a pure white colour.</li>
    <li> I use this as a lower lid eyeliner in white to create a more open eye effect. High quality pencil. Slides on easily. Stays on all day long. Very happy with this product. I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner not damaged and its the color actually stays on</li>
    <li> Very smooth application.  Very nice coverage.  Makes eyes look much bigger when applied to inside arrows and tightlined lower lids.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> Super soft. Melts with body heat as soon as it touches. Blends, smudges quickly. Can be placed heavy or lightly. Very nice product all around.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made product. It goes on smooth and stays. I got it in the white color.  Its a pure white. 100% recommend&lt;br /&gt;will try more colors definitely !</li>
    <li> LOVE IT.. nothing else to say!</li>
    <li> I have this pencil in white and I love it. I use it for highlighting my eyes but putting some in the corner or using it on my waterline. I found that I benefit from this pencil when I am tired, I put a small amount in the corner of my eye to make them look wider and therefore more awake. I sharpen it with a regular eyeliner pencil, though the white liner seems more creamy than others I have used so you will have to be more careful when sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints, I love this eyeliner!</li>
    <li> This was a great white eyeliner. My only issue with it was that it&#x27;s not retractable and using an eyeliner pencil sharpener doesn&#x27;t do the trick either. I loved this eyeliner, so I did a little research and NYX has the same exact pencil, but it&#x27;s retractable! You get way more product for about the same price.</li>
    <li> It was not sealed and I can not return it beacuse it is not eligible for return.</li>
    <li> disappointed.  doesn&#x27;t glide well</li>
    <li> Eyeliners are pricey today but these are the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever tried. I just bought the one in white to make my eyes pop out a little more. This eyeliner is also very pigmented. You won&#x27;t regret buying it!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for custom makeup and creating the doll-eye effect.</li>
    <li> it really does brighten up your eyes! it goes on light and creamy, not flaky. I noticed on the close up shot on American Idol some of the girls are wearing the white liner.</li>
    <li> Wow this white creamy pencil is what you really looking for . Now adding this to my eyes make up enhance my look and give me the glamorous look that makes me impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of finally finding a white liner that would stay on my waterline. Alas, this isn&#x27;t it. It does go on smoothly but the pigment isn&#x27;t as heavy as I&#x27;d like and, as mentioned, very little staying power. My search continues.</li>
    <li> The white rubs off but it comes out a little clumpy. Maybe I don&#x27;t know the correct way to use it. I&#x27;ve tried to apply it directly and with an eyeliner brush and same thing.  I like it because it runs off and I have had some eyeliners not even do that.</li>
    <li> This is great for the morning after those long nights or when your eyes need a pick me up. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It works great love it the white pigment is very strong to put bright colors over it will pop out and be very vibrant</li>
    <li> Goes on a little dry. it does not blend well.</li>
    <li> I liked this eyeliner at first, not too bad for a white, but the part to turn the actual liner up wouldn&#x27;t work.... I need it by Friday and don&#x27;t have the money to order a new one. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the worest I have tried ever!</li>
    <li> I hate it when you have to go over and over when a pencil liner..but this was just smooths on...it really has been the ideal kind...</li>
    <li> Was opened and definitely touched by someone.</li>
    <li> Stays on nice white. ..just takes a few passes</li>
</ol>
