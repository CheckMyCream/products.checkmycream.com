<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a Miley Cyrus type of hairstyle, and these work amazingly to cover up the fact that my hair is super short (shaved on sides and in back, crown is long but is only upper/middle of neck length). Ordered on the 19th and got them on the 30th, great quality for such a low price overall. Very satisfied with the product. I am roughly 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and they almost reach down to my butt, so expect longgg extensions when you order these. (I bought 4 packs because i cut 2 of them up to make smaller clip-ins but for normal hair you should only need one or two of these, they are pretty thick and shiny). I would definitely order again. They stayed true to the color I ordered (jet black) and it blends perfectly to my hair color.  However be forewarned, these get heavy pretty quick (even just the one set hurt my head after about an hour). But otherwise these are great~</li>
    <li> super nappy and fake looking, mind as well but a wig and wear it on Halloween horrible texture. Cheaply looking!!</li>
    <li> A bit heavy and doesn&#x27;t feel so fake. A little hard to play off because of how straight it is.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! :) I am absolutely in love with it. The hair is light on your head and it doesn&#x27;t pull. Plus, it blends perfectly with my hair color. I can style it by putting foam rollers into it or using the hair straightener on a low setting. I pretty much where this all the time...Even when I sleep. I would definitely suggest buying this product because it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> If you buy cheap, you get cheap!</li>
    <li> I should of checked should of checked measurements cause it&#x27;s really long..</li>
    <li> It dosent look black as in the picture and yes it looks very much synthetic.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet not sure if i will. The picture looks much more realistic comparing to what i received.</li>
    <li> They Do Not Curl At All .. Im So Dissapointed</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and beautiful product.  The hair is really soft.</li>
    <li> nice.. Its Long and not too shynny so looks real.. i brushed &amp; doesnt fell off i recomend to anyone my Sister loves it !!</li>
    <li> Beyond beautiful ❤ ❤ ❤ I loved it looks and feels like real hair</li>
    <li> These other reviews are so picky for $5 hair extensions. Of course they will not be quality like expensive $100 hair. However they are good! I cut them into individual pieces so they won&#x27;t tangle easily. I wore these in a pony tail for prom and they were in perfect condition by the end of the night. I would repurchase. I ordered them in black.</li>
    <li> Very thin piece. Not pleased. Also was charged for shipping when it was supposed to be free.</li>
    <li> It was amazing. I love it so much. I&#x27;m very very critical of the reviews, but this is a review I had to write because the clip ons are amazing. I&#x27;m Asian, and I thought I would need 2 of these since reading other people&#x27;s reviews, but putting one clip of extensions was just fine. I ordered 2 though because the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that it takes a while to get the shipment because it&#x27;s being shipped from China. The wait is worth it though, and the price is so cheap. Everyone thought it looked real. I cut one of the extensions I had to fit my hair needs better and to make it just look a little more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about buying more.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product.  Did not look real and the buyer does not offer refunds.  But then again I guess you get what you pay for, the product was cheap and looked cheap.</li>
    <li> i think a lot of people are being way too harsh tbh. they&#x27;re four dollars, obviously they&#x27;re not going to be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;came sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;looks like real hair, besides being a little shiny.&lt;br /&gt;extremely long.&lt;br /&gt;can handle a decent amount of heat.&lt;br /&gt;aren&#x27;t exactly thin. (you&#x27;ll still need two packs though lmao)&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;tangle easily.&lt;br /&gt;get really heavy after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;feel kinda gross.&lt;br /&gt;difficult to blend.&lt;br /&gt;clips detach sort of easily.&lt;br /&gt;basically i just cut them into smaller pieces so they would blend easier and wouldn&#x27;t tangle so much, washed them with shampoo and fabric softener to lessen the shine, and cut a lot off so they wouldn&#x27;t be so heavy. i&#x27;m actually pretty happy with them, especially since they&#x27;re so cheap. would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re willing to chop them up a little. :-)</li>
    <li> Clip ins are wonderful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Some of the hair is starting to fall our when I brush it, but other than that it&#x27;s good. The hair is kinda thin tho. 😕</li>
    <li> Terrible feel. Terrible in holding the hair in place. It is far too heavy, and sheds like crazy. And it is EXTREMELY tangly. Will not reccomend this particular brand to anyone.</li>
    <li> Matches perfectly to my off black hair. Don&#x27;t wear daily and get a special wig comb before you brush it.</li>
    <li> Came untangled and sleek. Good clip hold, althought a bit heavy. Sheds a lot at first but i combed it a few times and it was fine. My hair flips out at the ends so i have to straighten it to blend properly but otherwise good for the price. The ends get a little puffy and dry looking but after washing it, it was normal again.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this product . It actually came before the due date n came with some extra hair nets.thank you</li>
    <li> Just got it today as part of a cosplay wig project I&#x27;m doing for someone. Looks very sleek and natural, thank you!</li>
    <li> it was a very good product and it came faster than I expected,nice job😊</li>
    <li> 2 words.&lt;br /&gt;Flaming plastic.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, unfortunately. I havent been able to wear these because the clips are too wide and not strong enough to hold the extensions in place.</li>
    <li> I just got mine today I have thick hair like reddish brown and black color I bought 1 of these extensions in black it blends so well and mine does not look fake or too shiny at all . its so long and pretty .my first time buying extetions  I didn&#x27;t know they could make u look so much better my hair was already down to right below my bra strap . so with these on its really long , I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 . and when I sit they touch my hips . if anything you could always trim them if you don&#x27;t like it that long . but for the price there good . and with my thick hair and having only one track it doesn&#x27;t look to thin. That will varie on people though.  I bought these may 29th and received them June 13th. But anyways its only 5 bucks give it a try !!</li>
    <li> Nice long and soft&lt;br /&gt;Gets tangled pretty easily; can be straightened and curled.&lt;br /&gt;Tangles come out with brush&lt;br /&gt;Came quickly&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again :)</li>
    <li> They are hard to put in.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! These extensions are really amazing. I bought the black piece for a friend of mine as a gift. The hair was really long so I trimmed it and then straightened it because it was wavy in some places.  don&#x27;t miss out on this wonderful deal!</li>
    <li> Clips broke off first day, smelled funny too the hair was soft tho i just added a little baby oil to make it not frizzy</li>
    <li> I bought these and they are perfect! They do get ratty, but i just spray them with water and straighten them......bAM! soft hair again. i will most likely order from here again. They lasted me 4 months.</li>
    <li> Really long and pretty! But I did experience some of the hairs falling out already, but it still looks really great and I would probably have to straighten my hair to match it. haha. But I like it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice I mix it in with a couple human hair tracks so it looks more realistic. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair out,  minimal maintenance, and matches my hair</li>
    <li> I bought two in black and they came way before the estimated date. I would recommend this product if your natural hair is smooth and can be straightened well since these are very straight. I will probably cut an inch or two off since they are a bit too long for my taste. All in all they&#x27;re thick and shiny and just what I was looking for and the clips are nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> They were ok,one of the clips broke the next day.i just used a bobby pin to secure it.other than that.not to bad</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my product! It came way faster then expected delivery date! The color was black and matched great. Feels and looks like silky hair. Do not throw it around like crazy because mind you it is synthetic hair. If you have thick hair like me you need two pieces to accommodate the rest of your hair evenly. If it is thin hair you only need one. It is a thick piece and for the price I&#x27;m sorry but this is GREAT quality.  The clips are very strong it is a seller I already purchased another one and I just received mine today! Trust me it is so worth the price!</li>
    <li> excellent .. I&#x27;m from Venezuela and received my purchase super fast. I will continue buying while still getting a good product..</li>
    <li> I liked it but hated it tangled alot but other then that it was a nice 5clip</li>
    <li> I thought it would wrap around my head at the temple, but it barely covered the back of my head. I gave it to my daughter to combine with her other clip-ons. I also ordered jet black and ended up with a #2 so I got what I paid for. Shipping was earlier than stated but took about a month. I will not recommend this quick fix.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering jet back extension and they always come in dark brown.they are beautiful it looks real and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
    <li> This hair piece is well worth the $5. It is very easy to clip in and it stays in place pretty well. The hair is very soft and silky. It does get a little tangled but a quick brush through and it looks great. It doesn&#x27;t shed too bad either. It is a little heavy...but maybe because I&#x27;m so used to my thin hair. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> this was exactly what I needed and the clips are fairly easy to use. It came quicker than the estimated delivery and it feels vey soft. The onyl problem is that it tangles easily but nothing a bit of product and gentle brushing can&#x27;t fix</li>
    <li> Came in very quickly and people asked where my extensions were. Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars in because of how easily it tangles.</li>
    <li> It was perfect and fit so well! I like how it came on the exact date that it was supposed to! The item was not tangled it was soft and felt so real it was perfect my boyfriend didn&#x27;t recognize me when I wore it!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this one really needs my honest review. I got my extensions 15 days after I ordered them so it wasn&#x27;t a horrible wait. When I got them I was so disappointed when I pulled out ugly straw like hair. It so obvious that it&#x27;s fake hair and it&#x27;s extremely long. The hair on it is thick but it&#x27;s to heavy and tons of bald spaces. I don&#x27;t understand all these great reviews. Don&#x27;t waste your money!! I ended up throwing mine away, it&#x27;s gross useless hair extensions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but it sheds a lot and gets In knots too fast ..looks really fake too. ...but it&#x27;s OK for now</li>
    <li> Its not great but not horrible. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews? What are you expecting for five bucks?</li>
    <li> It looks too fake on me I thought it was a little but shorter</li>
    <li> This was beyond what I was expecting for the price. I love it. I would recommend this vpmpany to all.</li>
    <li> It gets nappy after a while. It sucks I don&#x27;t recommend 😍😍.</li>
    <li> They are good if you are using them as part of a costume, they are very shiny and hard to blend in with real hair, very unnatural looking.you get what you pay for I guess. On another note, the shipping was free and received them before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> the difference from before and after!!! shipped and got here pretty fast very pleased so far! when opened, felt very real! plan on buying again</li>
    <li> I am happy to buy this product! is just as seen in the photo</li>
    <li> Might work for you if you have thin and healthy looking hair, hair comes off easily and one of the clips came off so the stitching isn&#x27;t all that ..</li>
    <li> Very nice black hair extension! The clips ensure it stays in place and when it is styled in with&lt;br /&gt;the rest of my hair its flawless! Can&#x27;t beat the price and it comes way faster than the delivery date estimate !!!</li>
    <li> it was great ... it came as showed very thick and long .. just a little hard to handle but ill get it to work .. am just amazed on how cheap it cost but in a very great condition and beautiful not really what I expected it came out to be even better !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome I love it it&#x27;s tiny but it is really good I feel so happy with my first experience</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love. At first it felt like human hair which was creepy and scary but then I noticed a strand very elastic so it was obvious it was plastic. Love it so much I ordered a dark black thinking I had dark black hair and my hair looks light brown when I wear it but I was already planning to dye my hair a shade darker. If you&#x27;re looking for some hair extensions like the Bellami hair line but obviously can&#x27;t afford to pay $300 then you should definitely try this, you won&#x27;t regret it as long as you get your right shade. (P.S. One is enough and heavy enough)</li>
    <li> They are great extensions. I enjoyed them very much! They are very light.</li>
    <li> Super long in a fake way. The curly one is much more natural looking</li>
    <li> Pretty and looks real</li>
    <li> It shipped quick and I was surprised. Its so buetiful I wore it a few times already and people have complemented me on my long hair lol little do they know its fake.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product it said, &amp;#34;Real Hair&amp;#34;. However, I did not read the reviews, which every one was disappointed. This hair held up for a little while, then got really nappy. Over all, It was fine, but do not expect to have it for a long time.</li>
    <li> These are great! Im shocked. My Natural hair is actually longer than this piece but i use it for night when i want extra volume.</li>
    <li> They were longer than I expected them to be. And I&#x27;ll need to put some baby powder on them, Because they&#x27;re very shiny. They&#x27;re a bit thin, so of you have thin hair like me then you&#x27;ll need two sets. They also tangle pretty easily, but you can brush them and they&#x27;re fine. I just wish the shipping was faster. I ordered on the 1st of march and got them on the 23rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I got another set, and updated the picture (sorry for the snap chat picture)&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s with two sets in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 5&#x27;0 and they&#x27;re pretty long on me, but my first set still looks just fine.</li>
    <li> You get what you see in the picture, I received them when the order was due to come in so basically right on time. The hair is sleek and shiny, if you have thick textured hair I would not recommend them. I straighten my hair to get it thin. These have very secure clips, for the length and amount of hair on the segment they give you it weighs a bit but that is reasonable. I bought two so they&#x27;d look realistic when I clipped them on. They are fragile, not mean&#x27;t for a ton of activity. I haven&#x27;t worn them yet because I have to dye my hair back to black but from the build they are very sturdy. I hung mine up on clip hangers so they wouldn&#x27;t get tangled. To give a more realistic feel (if you find the quality to be too fake) I&#x27;d carefully apply baby powder. It comes in a gray package (it&#x27;s kind of cute in my opinion). When I wear them I&#x27;ll add another review.</li>
    <li> very thin and hardly any hair on clip, looks very full in the pic but product is very low quality.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this on Nov. 5th and I just received them today (12/2/14) (1 day before the expected delivery date) so that&#x27;s a plus. I was so excited trying this on because it&#x27;s my first clip in hair extension and I love IT!!!! The dark brown is more like a reddish brown but it&#x27;s totally fine with me since I died my hair dark brown. I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so long though but hey it&#x27;s better than coming up too short (i can always cut them). I love it I may need to sew it a little bit for a stronger grip but other than that, I love it! I will purchase more in the future :)</li>
    <li> Do not buy the hair is fake and nappy, people will talk about you if you where this.</li>
    <li> Ok so i read some of the reviews after i had already purchased this item and got really scared hiw they would look and i can say they look spot on exactly how the picture looks and even with thick hair (like i have) the still look great wirh only one and it matches my hair exactly . definately worth the money. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Looks like real hair  just shinier but no one would notice but yourself.anytime I wear this I get huge complements.</li>
    <li> It gets frizzy really, really fast and then like its dead and stretched out to the point you can&#x27;t do anything with it, but make a bun and over time even that it doesn&#x27;t look good. i have 17 hair extensions from different brands and i have 12 more coming because i love hair extensions and this isn&#x27;t a good brand to me</li>
    <li> please do not buy products from this company PLEASE!!!!!! the quality is so bad I had one wear and it was totally knotted. the quality is so poor and it doesn&#x27;t even look real. its better used for kids Halloween costumes. be carefull for what you buy people.</li>
    <li> These look, feel, and just are 100% fake. They weigh probably about 5 pounds😒 they went straight from in the package, to on my head, to the garbage. thought i could cut back on how much i usually spend on my hair but now i remember why i spend as much as i usually do!</li>
    <li> Super cute look and the best price</li>
    <li> Very cheap/ Looks like Barbie doll hair.</li>
    <li> I love the hair it is so pretty and I have been wearing extension for a very long time and have spend lots of money on them. The only problem with them they get very tangle so fast and even through I would brush them they will keep getting tangle. But like I said the hair is so pretty looks very natrual. And they are not heat friendly they will get burned and look burned.</li>
    <li> My Item Came Early In A Bag And It Was Really Soft. Its Super Straight So It&#x27;s A Little Hard To Blend With Natural African American Hair. I Would Suggest Try The Curly Clips But If You Can Get Your Hair To Lay Down Go Ahead And Get This Product Its Actually Pretty Great.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEE these so muchhh... They came before the expected time.The hair feels and looks so real &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; their long and straight ive worn them for an entire week and they look amazing. Im just ordering another piece. :)</li>
    <li> These extensions are amazing quality! Came in way earlier than expected and they are so pretty and soft. Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> They get a bit staticy</li>
    <li> Very cheap not worth it. I got it for a Halloween party and it keep getting tangled. I would not recommended it . And if you are getting it to wear the clips fall of not on good you get what you pay for. It also sheds like crazy .</li>
    <li> I have too much hair for this, is too thin but good quality</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was not expecting much since it was only $4.99....&lt;br /&gt;They are long, super soft, has a medium thickness (probably want more than one if you have thick hair - my hair is very thin), and the clips are secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to wear it out, but I suspect it will tangle/shed when I do. I&#x27;ll probably get about  four good uses out of it before it becomes unmanageable. (Again, just an assumption) I will post an update after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got them in black and the color is as expected :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Tangled very easily and ruined in 3 days</li>
    <li> Very soft, straight hair. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. Untangled when it arrived (ahead of schedule) and well packed. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Came really early looks just like the picture ...really shiny but wash it and its fine..came really neat in the package..it was thick I have thin hair so it is really nice for that..matches my hair perfectly..i will be buying from them again</li>
    <li> Lots of shedding and tangling</li>
    <li> Awesome, i wear this everyday and it stays in place great. Worth the buy :)</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it, no tangles. Feels like natural hair.</li>
    <li> Beautiful texture and came with the stocking cap. A little thinner than I had hoped but still looks natural</li>
    <li> They came tangled but I brushed them and they are great</li>
    <li> I like them but two of the clips where broken. They are nice and thick and look nice tho</li>
    <li> The hair is really soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 they go down to my butt . Super long and actually really pretty great clips . They are super shiny so I brushed son baby powder into them that helped a lot . Anyways my friends love them I recommend them. I did cut mine some so they looked more real but they&#x27;re a good buy.💋</li>
    <li> Pretty good price and was impressed with this product!</li>
    <li> Tangle very easy! Stays put on hair.</li>
    <li> Omg I just got them today and I love them!&amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and they reach to the end of my back!&lt;br /&gt;Will order again soon!&lt;br /&gt;Also I have shoulder length hair and ordered 4 just in case and I only needed 3 :) lol but it&#x27;s good to be prepared :p</li>
    <li> I love it. I was able to wear a beautiful bun to work and when i got off, i let the bun down and had a fun ponytail.</li>
