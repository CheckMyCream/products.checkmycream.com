      <li>v easy to use.</li>
      <li>This iron works great, and it heats pretty fast.  </li>
      <li>it was cheap</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really easy to hold, there is no risk of getting burned or accidentally touching the incredibly hot barrel.  </li>
      <li>The design of that iron more closely resembles my old favorite.</li>
      <li>works fine, no big problems, just choose the right size to what kind of curve you want!</li>
      <li>This is great for making loose waves.</li>
      <li>Nothing special but does what it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I will shut it off and then quickly have to turn on again.</li>
      <li>It heats quickly.</li>
      <li>, thank you very much , I will come bake soon!</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t put much of a curl in my hair, and my hair is usually easy to curl.  </li>
      <li>I have shoulder length hair and find this iron is great for adding a little curl or wave.  </li>
      <li>It seems durable, heats very quickly, and produces a decent curl.</li>
      <li>The only thing I actually liked is the tip with the hole -</li>
      <li>I really like the cool loop tip, which gives the user control without burning their fingers.</li>
      <li>It gives a natural cure and easy to use.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, but when I use this curling iron, my hair looks amazing for hours.</li>
      <li>it goes higher.</li>
      <li>It heats up pretty hot.</li>
      <li>I am now still learning how to use it to make a hair style because I am the first time user.</li>
      <li>This curling iron was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I think this product is same as its description, so l love it</li>
      <li>One is that it is easy to inadvertently press the off button while using it,  and the other is that it does not grip hair well, esp when you are trying to fit it over the ends of your hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide easily over your hair, and hair actually gets hung up in it somewhere around the bottom of the barrel and gets pulled out.  </li>
      <li>If you like nice, soft curls that last throughout the day (or night), I highly recommend this tool.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a large barrel curling iron to curl your hair, this one will not work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;30 heat settings on the dial -- seems excessive, can&#x27;t imagine anyone using lower heat settings as even at highest settings there isn&#x27;t much curl!&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, and that it seems to be more gentle on hair than my previous one, I am still happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Not quiet understand the number dial ( I set it on 17ish and it seems to be fine)</li>
      <li>it heats up fine but doesnt give me the long lasting results also its v slippery, my hairs are slipped out of the grip easily..</li>
      <li>Debated 3 or 4 stars - went with 4 because price is so reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s been hard for me to find curling irons that get hot enough for my hair, but this one is great.</li>
      <li>I needed a larger barrel for the ends of my fine hair, especially for days when I&#x27;ve washed my hair the night before &amp; it looks all funky in the morning.</li>
      <li>It gets plenty hot and heats up quickly but does not leave a long lasting hold.</li>
      <li>The hair is by that time sufficiently hot enough to burn your hand when you attempt to grab it.</li>
      <li>My biggest complaint about this curling iron is the heat control dial is very close to the clamp handle, and is too easy to rotate accidentally with my thumb.  </li>
      <li>For such a cheap curling iron I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this little guy has surprised me!</li>
      <li>I needed to smooth out the ends, get a little curl, and iron out some of the &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; that formed when I slept on it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this curling iron after my old gold ceramic Conair died.</li>
      <li>I bought this curling iron as a replacement for my old one.</li>
      <li>like I did with my old curling iron.</li>
      <li>Not because it&#x27;s too hot or anything, I think a wire is loose and when I turn it to curl my hair, it just .. turns off.</li>
      <li>real problem I&#x27;ve encountered with it is if I curl large sections of hair that fill up the entire barrel space, there&#x27;s a tiny, tiny corner where the metal barrel attaches to the plastic handle that can snag my hair!</li>
      <li>Sometimes takes several tries to get hair secure enough to wrap around curling iron.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t give as tight a curl as the iron I was using, but seems better at not &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34; my hair like my old one - the trade off I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other posters on a couple of issues.  </li>
      <li>easy to use, the little kick stand is a bit long and can get in the  way.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that with my naturally curly hair curling my bangs back away from my face wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
      <li>Lastly, the part that clamps and holds your hair for curling is not tight enough and often the section of hair falls out before you even get it completely wound around the barrel.</li>
      <li>The stand is way too long and frequently gets tangled in my hair.</li>
      <li>Wish I would have just stayed with hot tools instead of trying to save a few $.</li>

<li> flat irons/ styling tools/ etc</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it has met all my expectations.</li>
<li> it would get super hot to the point of almost smoking and had a horrible smell then not even hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
<li> However, all it manages to do it flatten my hair and put strange, flat, twisty patterns in it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try to find a different Conair with a chrome barrel like my old one, which worked well but eventually got an unpleasant smell that I couldn&#x27;t clean off.</li>
<li> Minor annoyance in that</li>
<li> I have had no problems with my long hair getting caught in the iron</li>
<li> My hair is pretty long, and so if the curls are too big, I lose them to gravity, and if they&#x27;re too small, I look like I&#x27;ve tried too hard.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s way too loose.</li>
<li> sometimes I accidentally hit the rotating heat adjuster and crank the heat up or down in the middle of styling, so I wish there was a way to lock it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> just so I could remove the tip and replace it on my other curling iron.</li>
<li> I tried putting mousse and hairspray and other products in it before curling to help hold the curl and the curl still falls out in about an hour.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t grip hair tightly, have to press upward on the handle to get a tight grip ( have short, one length hair, so there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair to wrap round the barrel)</li>

    <li> easy to use, the little kick stand is a bit long and can get in the  way.</li>
    <li> This curling iron was a good purchase for the looser, wavy look. It seems durable, heats very quickly, and produces a decent curl.</li>
    <li> i have tried this twice since i got it. it was cheap but okay. the only thing i noticed is that i received it &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34;. meaning not in the box, no instruction or anything. it feels like i bought it second hand already because it was just packed in bubble wrap. and the &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; or whatever u call that thing used to clip the hair to hold it, it&#x27;s way too loose.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. It heats up quickly and creates nice curls. The only complaint that I have is that the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button is in an inconvenient place.</li>
    <li> This curling iron was exactly what I was looking for. It works perfectly for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in March (it&#x27;s July now) and it stopped working already. If I use it for longer than 15 seconds, it turns itself off. Not because it&#x27;s too hot or anything, I think a wire is loose and when I turn it to curl my hair, it just .. turns off. It&#x27;s really disappointing because I had a Conair before this that lasted forever, years and years, so I&#x27;m really surprised that this one broke at all, let alone a mere 5 months after I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This iron works great, and it heats pretty fast.  I must agree that it could have been more sturdy to hold your hair whilst curling. but overall a very good buy for me.</li>
    <li> Very affordable, and provided great results. I really like the cool loop tip, which gives the user control without burning their fingers. The coating and pressure of the barrel is perfect for loose waves or tighter curls. A plus!</li>
    <li> For such a cheap curling iron I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this little guy has surprised me! It&#x27;s simple and easy to use. Minor annoyance in that sometimes I accidentally hit the rotating heat adjuster and crank the heat up or down in the middle of styling, so I wish there was a way to lock it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real problem I&#x27;ve encountered with it is if I curl large sections of hair that fill up the entire barrel space, there&#x27;s a tiny, tiny corner where the metal barrel attaches to the plastic handle that can snag my hair! So now I just pay extra attention and put my fingers over that spot to keep my hair from getting stuck in there.</li>
    <li> Sometimes the on button won&#x27;t turn the iron on. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a safety feature or not. Sometimes I will shut it off and then quickly have to turn on again. Then it won&#x27;t turn on. Otherwise I love this curling iro.</li>
    <li> My curls fall out about an hour later. What gives?! Not cool.</li>
    <li> It heats quickly. I am now still learning how to use it to make a hair style because I am the first time user.</li>
    <li> I needed a larger barrel for the ends of my fine hair, especially for days when I&#x27;ve washed my hair the night before &amp; it looks all funky in the morning. I needed to smooth out the ends, get a little curl, and iron out some of the &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; that formed when I slept on it. This does just that. I should have measured the barrel of my old one, because this is larger than I expected, but it still does the job. The only issue I have is that the red indicator light is not bright enough and I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s turned on unless I&#x27;m looking directly down on the iron. I have had no problems with my long hair getting caught in the iron like I did with my old curling iron. It heats up pretty hot. Nothing special but does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite good for me although it made my hair curls a bit loosed which i prefer tighter one.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair and find this iron is great for adding a little curl or wave.  I like the tip and it makes it easier to handle.  easy to use; no complaints.</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED in this product.  The design is very poor.  The stand is way too long and frequently gets tangled in my hair. The temperature control is a great feature, except it moves with the slightest touch and every time I start to curl my hair the setting changes!!  This is an issue even when I&#x27;m trying my best to avoid touching the temp control dial.  Take a pass on this one!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It&#x27;s just what I needed, and the perfect size. My hair is pretty long, and so if the curls are too big, I lose them to gravity, and if they&#x27;re too small, I look like I&#x27;ve tried too hard. Also, it&#x27;s been hard for me to find curling irons that get hot enough for my hair, but this one is great.</li>

    <li> works fine, no big problems, just choose the right size to what kind of curve you want!</li>
    <li> Debated 3 or 4 stars - went with 4 because price is so reasonable.  This curling iron is probably best for someone just wanting to smooth hair, and not get very much curl.  This doesn&#x27;t give as tight a curl as the iron I was using, but seems better at not &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34; my hair like my old one - the trade off I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other posters on a couple of issues.

    <li> I don&#x27;t like this curling iron.  It just doesn&#x27;t put much of a curl in my hair, and my hair is usually easy to curl.  I believe it is because of the ceramic coating on the barrel.  It doesn&#x27;t glide easily over your hair, and hair actually gets hung up in it somewhere around the bottom of the barrel and gets pulled out.  I&#x27;m going to try to find a different Conair with a chrome barrel like my old one, which worked well but eventually got an unpleasant smell that I couldn&#x27;t clean off.</li>
    <li> I think this product is same as its description, so l love it , thank you very much , I will come bake soon!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron as a replacement for my old one. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it has met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> its just OK ... it heats up fine but doesnt give me the long lasting results also its v slippery, my hairs are slipped out of the grip easily.. i did not find it v easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron! warms up fast and does a good job on curling my hair my hair, will order from this company again!</li>
    <li> This curling iron has been a disappointment. It gets plenty hot and heats up quickly but does not leave a long lasting hold. I have tried it on mine and my daughters hair and neither of our hair stay curled. I tried putting mousse and hairspray and other products in it before curling to help hold the curl and the curl still falls out in about an hour. Spend a bit more and get a better curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is great for making loose waves. I love it! Not quiet understand the number dial ( I set it on 17ish and it seems to be fine) it goes higher.</li>
    <li> The clamp on this curling iron is really weak - my hair falls out.  I don&#x27;t like the little flippy metal stand - unless you&#x27;re the type that can hold a curing iron and never set it down when you start, you&#x27;ll end up monkeying with the stand a lot.  When it&#x27;s down, your hair gets caught in it.  I have no idea why they don&#x27;t just create a flange along the underside at the uppermost portion of the handle - many irons do this and it&#x27;s foolproof. The only thing I actually liked is the tip with the hole - it&#x27;s really easy to hold, there is no risk of getting burned or accidentally touching the incredibly hot barrel.  If this iron were $10, I&#x27;d be tempted to buy it just so I could remove the tip and replace it on my other curling iron.</li>
    <li> Love it. cheap and effective.</li>
    <li> When it comes to styling, you cant go wrong with CONAIR. It is an excellent curling iron for the price, I will continue to buy their products.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curler. My hair stays in big curls all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m being generous and giving this a two star assuming that if it wasn&#x27;t defective it could be acceptable. The one I received not only couldn&#x27;t hold a constant heat it would get super hot to the point of almost smoking and had a horrible smell then not even hot enough to curl my hair. I have had several curling irons/ flat irons/ styling tools/ etc and this is by far the worse one. Luckily Amazon is amazing and customer service is out of this world.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron after my old gold ceramic Conair died. I loved the design of that iron and was looking for an exact replacement. Unfortunately, this iron didn&#x27;t measure up. I do not like the design of this curling iron. It catches your hair in the crevice where the barrel and the plastic handle connect and pulls it out. Painful!! Also, the metal stand gets in the way when curling your hair so that you have to remember to flip it back toward the handle each time you use it then flip it back out before you set it on the counter. Inconvenient!! Lastly, the part that clamps and holds your hair for curling is not tight enough and often the section of hair falls out before you even get it completely wound around the barrel. The hair is by that time sufficiently hot enough to burn your hand when you attempt to grab it. Irritating!! I am returning this iron and trying the Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron. The design of that iron more closely resembles my old favorite.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grip hair tightly, have to press upward on the handle to get a tight grip ( have short, one length hair, so there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair to wrap round the barrel)</li>
    <li> the product is okay, and it can make my hair curling and it looks like the nurture hair. I like it.</li>
    <li> Good heat levels and I like the finish.  The tip is formed with a handle that lets you guide the wand without burning yourself.  Novel idea.</li>
    <li> Perfect and exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t make curls that hold. I was hoping that with my naturally curly hair curling my bangs back away from my face wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. However, all it manages to do it flatten my hair and put strange, flat, twisty patterns in it. If you&#x27;re looking for a large barrel curling iron to curl your hair, this one will not work.</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint about this curling iron is the heat control dial is very close to the clamp handle, and is too easy to rotate accidentally with my thumb.  I would also prefer the clamp be tighter.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. Does just what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! My hair is fine and usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, but when I use this curling iron, my hair looks amazing for hours. Plus the price can&#x27;t be beat for the curl-power. The adjustable heat is a nice added feature, although it doesn&#x27;t affect the curling iron&#x27;s usefulness in a sword fight. If you like nice, soft curls that last throughout the day (or night), I highly recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> It gives a natural cure and easy to use.</li>
