      <li>this is a win win situation.</li>
      <li>Thumbs up for sure!!</li>
      <li>I have oily acne prone skin with some associated seborrhoea and this is a grew way to keep my skin looking good.</li>
      <li>I have always loved using these pads and order them all the time.</li>
      <li>I have purchased it before from Sephora and I loved it.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and commented how my skin looks so good.</li>
      <li>I do not know how good the product was...  </li>
      <li>but the results were even better than I had experienced with Retin-A.  </li>
      <li>I am not a fan of most of the Peter Thomas Roth products, but these I love!!</li>
      <li>very fast- excellent seller- just ordered another one.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>These are my favorite beauty product!  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Great &amp; easy product to use...</li>
      <li>I used these 2x a day when bought from QVC and it does work and give a moisturizing affect, cleanses well, great on fine lines  and lessens</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>and it felt nice.</li>
      <li>I am 43 and loving it.</li>
      <li>One edge of the seal was kind of bent up a teeny bit, as if a syringe had been put under the foil.</li>
      <li>Very good but has a higher PH.</li>
      <li>Package arrived perfect, sealed and brand new.</li>
      <li>and it may irritate sensitive skin but for my combination skin, it was awesome.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to get lucky as some folks did receive a good, sealed product...  </li>
      <li>Ok, I guess.</li>
      <li>but I will say to be cautious since so many have received their items already opened.</li>
      <li>The more you use it the better results are.</li>
      <li>/&gt;face peels which didn&#x27;t seem to work any better.</li>
      <li>found these HERE, lower price,  FREE shipping as prime member, Can&#x27;t beat that,! :)</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>and I will be ordering more, but that might be months from now because there are a lot of pads,</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I have tried every department store and many drug store brands.</li>
      <li>Love both products. :)</li>
      <li>LOVE,LOVE, LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Because you have to rinse your face with water afterwards, I find it most convenient to use these in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I heard about these pads from a friend and am glad I decided to try them for myself.     </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Tingly and seemed to reflect the good qualities that the positive reviews describe.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy as one,two,three, and you are done</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>But, I love how clean and,&lt;br /&gt;fresh</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The rest of the glue was stuck on strongly.</li>
      <li>I figured I was fine.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Added to my daily regiment it works great.</li>
      <li>the price was great for these facial pads, they work well</li>
      <li>Really make s my skin look younger and flawless, age spots are diminished.</li>
      <li>I find that when I use these consistently, my skin appears brighter, more even-toned, and smoother.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am changing my original rating from 3 stars to 4.</li>
      <li>I have super oily skin and huge pores.</li>
      <li>It is sticky, which is ok, but even if I leave it on for awhile before I wash it off, I really don&#x27;t notice any results.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where I can tell it most that it really is working.</li>
      <li>Then rinse off with cool water and I apply a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Not sure that it is as good as the reviews because it really can&#x27;t be very strong unless it&#x27;s a prescription.</li>
      <li>I love PTR unwrinkle pads, but this one was not sealed, was open about a quarter of the top was not glued.</li>
      <li>I have used Retin-A in the past with very good results</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after just the first week !  </li>
      <li>Another tip...if you have product left over on the pad, be sure to rub over your hands and the heels of your feet!</li>
      <li>Fine, okay, the inner \\&quot;sealed for your protection\\&quot; seal was still there, so</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a great product, but they don&#x27;t work if the liquid had all dried out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it does make us look fresh</li>
      <li>Makes you look fresh on the morning and evens out skin color and tone.</li>
      <li>is a very gentle product.  </li>
      <li>think this product is at its best used regularly between professional facials but not to replace a professional facial or mild peel.</li>
      <li>stopped after first  jar of these  </li>
      <li>With regular use I hope to see even more improvements</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and have for sure noticed a difference in my skins overall texture and appearance.</li>
      <li>First I wipe my skin off with a cotton pad soaked in 91% alcohol.  </li>
      <li>bought it from Health and Beauty On-Line Store.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the mixed reviews, many of which claimed the product was delivered unsealed, I decided to record a video of myself unboxing</li>
      <li>Sure enough, my product&#x27;s Seal of Protection was already opened.</li>
      <li>So, my thinking is that while the product is unsealed this might be precisely why it is inexpensive (relative to full retail).</li>
      <li>If you do not see results at first, then try leaving it on your skin longer.  </li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1T8LO6KORWYOV]]This is my first time using this product</li>
      <li>BUT when used three or four times each week, the product does certainly brighten my complexion and reduce pore size.</li>
      <li>They have totally eliminated some dry patches on my hands that I thought were there for good.  </li>
      <li>My skin glows and the fine lines starting around my eyes have faded away.  </li>
      <li>Complexion is much improved for a home product.</li>
      <li>These work really well for me.  </li>
      <li>I have to say, not so much.  </li>
      <li>you are feeling like they cost too much - then cut them in 1/2 -</li>
      <li>Keep my skin clear and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I ABSOLUTELY recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin looking much smoother than it ever did before I was using this product.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This product has made more difference in 10 days than the other two laser treatments did, costing $500 each.</li>
      <li>younger and significantly reduce wrinkles.</li>
      <li>they could be replacing the original pads with different ones as this review suggests:</li>
      <li>I would try other products to get a better result.</li>
      <li>I bought this with high hopes of really experiencing a difference.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> additional skin refining in conjunction with professional treatments</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY recommend this product.  I saw results instantly.  This is a must have anti-wrinkle beauty product! LOVE,LOVE, LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t forget the back of your hands when using it.  That&#x27;s where I can tell it most that it really is working.</li>
    <li> Works well and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This semi-negative review is solely on the seller and the handling of the item, not the product itself. I have purchased it before from Sephora and I loved it. If you&#x27;re wondering if this product works, I would say it is on the stronger end of acidic toners and it may irritate sensitive skin but for my combination skin, it was awesome. It brightened and helped to even out any discoloration. A bonus was how hydrating it was as a lot of acidic toners can be drying. I believe Caroline Hirons (www.carolinehirons.com) talks about it as well. Since she is a skincare professional I would recommend checking that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, after opening the item, I decided to check the seal as so many reviewers had complained about it being broken. Sure enough, my product&#x27;s Seal of Protection was already opened. The product itself isn&#x27;t so old that it is expired or should have been tampered with. I checked the batch number from the bottom of the container on another site (checkcosmetic.net) and it was made in February 2014. This product says it will last 24 months after opening, so it should be fine to use for at least another year. Some lettering has worn off but like I said, it is a year old already so that isn&#x27;t a surprise. There wasn&#x27;t any weird smell, just the same scent as my previously owned tub from Sephora. The only thing that makes me suspicious is why the seal is open in the first place. To be honest, it makes me skeptical to use where I otherwise would have been fine had it been sealed despite it already being a year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to say the ones from this seller (RMK Distributors) don&#x27;t work as I won&#x27;t be actually using them due to it already being opened and what not but I will say to be cautious since so many have received their items already opened. Hope I helped anyone out there!many have received their items already opened. Hope I helped anyone out there!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite beauty product!  You will notice a difference in the texture of your skin after one use.  I cut them in half and get double the uses from one container!  I don&#x27;t put it on my neck, because I did get dry when I did that.  I use this along with Amlactin and eye cream.  Really happy with it!</li>
    <li> Very good but has a higher PH.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Makes you look fresh on the morning and evens out skin color and tone. I have oily acne prone skin with some associated seborrhoea and this is a grew way to keep my skin looking good. Added to my daily regiment it works great.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1T8LO6KORWYOV]]This is my first time using this product so I don&#x27;t know how it is normally packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from Health and Beauty On-Line Store.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the mixed reviews, many of which claimed the product was delivered unsealed, I decided to record a video of myself unboxing the product.&lt;br /&gt;The pads came in their jar but the jar was not in a branded box. Just the jar came in the package.&lt;br /&gt;Closer inspection of the jar revealed some smudging of the text around the lid. Could suggest that the jar was old.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up the jar the seal was only 3/4 of the way on. So basically like other reviewers I was delivered an unsealed jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Health and Beauty On-Line is selling unsealed jars is not clear. These could be old/expired jars that were refilled with water as this recent review suggests: http://www.amazon.com/review/R185K89VYBRFQG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0028BKV4E&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or they could be replacing the original pads with different ones as this review suggests: http://www.amazon.com/review/R94AG8SDU8Q6Y/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0028BKV4E&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell. But you should be sure to check the jar you get to see if it&#x27;s (rather sneakily) half or 3 quarter sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I would normally give a disingenuous product like this one 1 star but I ended up trying a pad and it felt nice. Tingly and seemed to reflect the good qualities that the positive reviews describe. So, my thinking is that while the product is unsealed this might be precisely why it is inexpensive (relative to full retail). We could be getting a product that is not perfect but pretty good. I&#x27;m going to end up keeping the pads and if they don&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll know why.</li>
    <li> Ok, I guess. I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sold on these. I like them, they are handy, but way too expensive and I didn&#x27;t really see any changes with daily use.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes of really experiencing a difference.  I have to say, not so much.  It is sticky, which is ok, but even if I leave it on for awhile before I wash it off, I really don&#x27;t notice any results.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin looking much smoother than it ever did before I was using this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. That said, I would hope that before buying the 90 count jar, you would read about peels in general, and try them first.&lt;br /&gt;Peter Thomas Roth Peel Pads have made my face and neck unbelievably soft! When I have an extra minute, I also use them on the backs of my hands,elbows, knees, etc. I do not have terribly sensitive skin, but I did experience a slight sting initially. I use them every night.&lt;br /&gt;The Peter Thomas Roth line was introduced to me by a girlfriend. I bought the resurface intro kit, and I was hooked. I have tried every department store and many drug store brands. Nothing I have ever used compares to PTR.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I almost gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is expensive.  I am&lt;br /&gt;over 50 and always use PTR products.  They do keep your skin&lt;br /&gt;looking younger and significantly reduce wrinkles. I took the advice of someone&lt;br /&gt;else and cut the pads in half so they last longer.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. Really make s my skin look younger and flawless, age spots are diminished. The more you use it the better results are. I guess it is important to use it on dry face and not use water after that.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped very fast- excellent seller- just ordered another one.Thanks</li>
    <li> Nothing to black-mouth it.  Nothing wrong with this product but my daughter and I did not see any improvement either.  It does nothing bad nor good.  I would try other products to get a better result.</li>
    <li> I stopped buying these because they are pricey and THE SKIN ON MY FACE S*** THE BED. I&#x27;m serious: my skin turned to crap when I quit using these. After I stopped using these peel pads my skin started flaking, I got breakouts and my skin was generally dull. And my wrinkles came back! There is no question: this is a MUST-HAVE product.    -Signed, 37 and never not using these</li>
    <li> I have always loved using these pads and order them all the time. I usually one pad, let it dry, then use another to get really great soft glowing skin. I get compliments every time I use them! Great seller! I was a bit apprehensive ordering from them since some had reported that their pads were dry but mine came freshly sealed and moist. Will purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> The package was already opened, and in such a SNEAKY way! There is no plastic ring around the outside of the jar. Fine, okay, the inner \\&quot;sealed for your protection\\&quot; seal was still there, so I figured I was fine. Before I ripped it off, though, I checked carefully. One edge of the seal was kind of bent up a teeny bit, as if a syringe had been put under the foil. Sure enough, the glue had been pried up only in that spot. The rest of the glue was stuck on strongly. I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that a syringe was used to add extra liquid to pads that had dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should totally change their source for these pads. They&#x27;re a great product, but they don&#x27;t work if the liquid had all dried out.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It has made a visible difference to my skin in only 10 days!  I have super oily skin and huge pores. This product has tightened my pores and reduced my breakouts. I have very sensitive skin but it has not irritated it at all. I started using it every other day as instructed. However, with no irritation I began using it every night before going to bed. I have had two laser treatments one of which made it impossible for me to go to work for two days. This product has made more difference in 10 days than the other two laser treatments did, costing $500 each. My skin is glowing and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and have for sure noticed a difference in my skins overall texture and appearance. With regular use I hope to see even more improvements</li>
    <li> I used these 2x a day when bought from QVC and it does work and give a moisturizing affect, cleanses well, great on fine lines  and lessens break outs !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It didn&#x27;t give me a glow per say,  I don&#x27;t want one.  BUT does BRIGHTEN my face and  dentist office noticed it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped after first  jar of these  i got from QVC cause their price was so high, and shipping was over 10 bucks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then found these HERE, lower price,  FREE shipping as prime member, Can&#x27;t beat that,! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will now continue to buy from here now and not stop using , I only stopped  due to ship charge at QVC and higher cost.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting them in half because you do not need the whole thing, leave it on for a minute and I take it off.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I have had great results with these.  I use them on my face, neck, chest &amp; hands. They have totally eliminated some dry patches on my hands that I thought were there for good.  I use them every morning before I shower &amp; have had no sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> I assumed that this product would provide an almost immediate and dramatic change in my skin (along the lines of a chemical peel by a skin care professional. It doesn&#x27;t do that BUT when used three or four times each week, the product does certainly brighten my complexion and reduce pore size. Even at 40% active ingredient I get no &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; or redness and I leave it on for about 3-4 minutes before washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is at its best used regularly between professional facials but not to replace a professional facial or mild peel. I think it definitely extends the results of salon grade skincare.</li>
    <li> I do not know how good the product was...  The seal was broken when I received it.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to trying this product.  I was hoping to get lucky as some folks did receive a good, sealed product...  I was not one of them.  Buyer beware, too risky with your face to try an already opened product.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the Peter Thomas unwrinkle pads. I use them daily for acne on my shoulders, chest, face and back following with a moisturizing solution of organic aloe Vera and organic jojoba oil as these do not clog pores and mimic body&#x27;s natural oIL. With years of dealing with acne, this product plus the mosturination routine helps immensely. I&#x27;ve even stopped using my rerun a which was a miracle for my face. Thumbs up for sure!!</li>
    <li> Bad! The wrinkle peel pads were already opened when it arrived! And the bottle looks old. I will never buy from this user again!</li>
    <li> I used these peel pads for the first time last night.  I awoke to soft, luminous skin.  I heard about these pads from a friend and am glad I decided to try them for myself.     As with any glycolic product, it is important to start out slowly, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin.      Another tip...if you have product left over on the pad, be sure to rub over your hands and the heels of your feet!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for two months. Because you have to rinse your face with water afterwards, I find it most convenient to use these in the shower.  I wash my face, then grab my towel and pat it dry it quickly. I rub one of the pads on my face and neck.  It tingles and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a mini-chemical peel, and the dead skin cells are just being eaten away.  I continue with my shower and after a few minutes, I rinse my face.  Instantly, my skin feels much smoother.  I find that when I use these consistently, my skin appears brighter, more even-toned, and smoother.</li>
    <li> the price was great for these facial pads, they work well and I will be ordering more, but that might be months from now because there are a lot of pads,</li>
    <li> Really like how it makes my skin feel -tight and taunt. Complexion is much improved for a home product. Had expensive&lt;br /&gt;face peels which didn&#x27;t seem to work any better. Hadn&#x27;t seen my daughter in 2 years when she visited 2 weeks ago&lt;br /&gt;and commented how my skin looks so good. Imagine how I felt when I heard that.</li>
    <li> Smooths skin after one application. Easy to use. I have very sensitive skin, but found these to work well and not cause irritation. A slight tingling occurs after a few seconds, you can leave on for 60 seconds or for up to 3 minutes. Then rinse off with cool water and I apply a moisturizer. I am not claiming a miracle cure but I have used twice and a lot of my winter flakiness has already come off. Definitely a keeper. Package arrived perfect, sealed and brand new.</li>
    <li> Today I am ordering a second jar.  This time I am ordering the 90 count jar.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these pads less than a week.  But, I love how clean and,&lt;br /&gt;fresh my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very gentle product.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has allowed me to use them on his face too.  He humors me. :)  He too&lt;br /&gt;can tell a difference in his skin.&lt;br /&gt;We are in our fifties.  We don&#x27;t expect this product to make us look 10 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does make us look fresh faced. :)  That is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow this with Oz vitamin C serum.  Love both products. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have used Retin-A in the past with very good results but I hate the flaky dryness that comes along with using this expensive prescription.  With the Un-Wrinkle Pads I had no dryness but the results were even better than I had experienced with Retin-A.  I noticed a difference after just the first week !  I did start slow and use it once a day every other day and then increased to daily use.  Sometimes I use it in the morning and evening.  My skin glows and the fine lines starting around my eyes have faded away.  I love it!  I have already ordered again because I don&#x27;t want to run out !  I also use the pad on the back of my hands.  I highly recommend this product.  One of my patients thought that  I was 29 until I told her I had a 20 year old son.  I am 43 and loving it.</li>
    <li> These work really well for me.  Not too strong;  not too weak.  Keep my skin clear and fresh.  I use them about 4x week; but have used them as often as 7x week if needed.  Strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are feeling like they cost too much - then cut them in 1/2 - it&#x27;s totally viable and doubles your $.</li>
    <li> gives me a glowing complexion and I always get complements on my skin. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these every other day for about a month and am waiting to see any significant improvement.  I haven&#x27;t given up just yet but not sure they are going to really make a difference.  I have not noticed any reaction or redness with my somewhat sensitive skin so far.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I started leaving the product on my skin without rinsing overnight and can now say that I see an improvement.  Also using it on the tops of my hands with decnt results. If you do not see results at first, then try leaving it on your skin longer.  I was hesitant at first because I have sensitive skin and thought I would have a bad reaction...but turns out that it was not the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am changing my original rating from 3 stars to 4.</li>
    <li> I love PTR unwrinkle pads, but this one was not sealed, was open about a quarter of the top was not glued.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  First I wipe my skin off with a cotton pad soaked in 91% alcohol.  Then I use the pads, and allow my skin to dry before applying other products such as lotions, sunscreen, cosmetics, etc.</li>
    <li> Great &amp; easy product to use... Plus I like the pricing and 60 pads this is a win win situation.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of most of the Peter Thomas Roth products, but these I love!! They make my 45+ year old skin look smoother and brighter.  I have bought them several times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> You can easily stretch this batch to last by cutting the pads in half. There&#x27;s plently of solution in the container to last a very long time. I noticed an immediate change to the clarity of my skin.  I highly recommedn that you follow the directions, so you will not have a bad experience with this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure that it is as good as the reviews because it really can&#x27;t be very strong unless it&#x27;s a prescription. The jury is still out as I have only used a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> This turned yellow shortly after opening and it has a funny smell.  I have purchased this product before and this wasn&#x27;t an issue.  i haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin.  would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Second time I&#x27;ve purchased. I have sensitive skin, does not bother me. Does what it claims.</li>
    <li> Easy as one,two,three, and you are done</li>
</ol>
