<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> i love that the fact its so compact.</li>
    <li> The perfect solution for my bathroom!</li>
    <li> Great Product---easy to install.... :)</li>
    <li> This product gets 3 stars from me because my blow dryer does not fit and it is difficult to install. Other than that delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> I was surprise how sturdy this is!  It is awesome and it comes with drywall anchors.  Very useful in small bathroom space with little or no counter space.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner. And it is just about exactly what we were looking for. I was hoping the holes would have been a bit bigger, but that&#x27;s not enough for me to dislike the product.</li>
    <li> This is a good sturdy solid rack and easy to install.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy beauty appliance holder that Ive attached to my small vanity. It fits my: curling iron, round brush, and blow dryer with ease. This device really brings organization to a vanity.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than it looks. The largest section is too small for my hair dryer, and the smallest section is too small for anything.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my tiny bathroom - keeps my hair appliances out of the way and off the counters - holds my blow dryer, curling and straightening irons with problems</li>
    <li> Screwed onto the side of my vanity table, love it!</li>
    <li> Sturdy well designed product, made of metal so there are no concerns with the heat the curlers/blow dryers generate, which would melt plastic.  Items fit well.  I actually installed mine on inside of closet door for out of the way/uncluttered, easy access.  See pic.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for hair dryer and flat iron.  Affordable and durable.</li>
    <li> attached it to my vanity and now have my curling rod, straightener, and blow dryer holstered in it and it is amazing couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> i purchased this a month ago and I love it. My hot curling iron can sit in it with no concerns. My 1 1/2 inch has a rubber cover and it fits also, although I&#x27;m not sure why I still use it. The blow dryer is positioned nicely so there is no risk of burning yourself on the hot curling iron. Very easy to install, although the anchors and screws that are included are flimsy and I used better ones as mine was not installed on a stud.</li>
    <li> Great product! Stores the dryer, straightener, and curling wand for my daughter. No more appliances on the counter or floor.</li>
    <li> So nice to have hair dryer and curling irons organized.  Metal, very solid.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured, great for holding a hot flat iron</li>
    <li> Wonderful item; works amazing; shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Perfect for what I needed it for. It supports my flat iron, my wand, and my blow dryer all @ the same time, and it&#x27;s not bulky... Great buy!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Exactly what I needed for my bathroom. And I knew my boyfriend would quit complaining about my irons/dryers everywhere</li>
    <li> Worked great for my wife&#x27;s stuff.  I did not use the drywall hangers it came with.  Those were pretty flimsy. I used better ones.  Good quality otherwise.</li>
    <li> I love this it saves space</li>
    <li> Holds all my styling tools in my makeup room. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for holding my blow dryer and two flat irons.  It&#x27;s heavy duty and was&lt;br /&gt;easy to install on the wall.</li>
    <li> Awesome I would purchase again!!!!  if I need to but I love it and it&#x27;s also heat friendly .</li>
    <li> glad i bought it, now I won&#x27;t get burned again</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed! It takes up such little space and stores all my hair tools. I even used that the space in between the 3 tubes to store a fourth hair tool. It is made of metal so it is very sturdy and won&#x27;t break over time like a plastic one would. Incredibly happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Put this in for my wife to get her stuff organized.  Seems very well built and fit her hair dryer and curling iron easily.</li>
    <li> I really needed something to keep my hair dryer, curling iron, and flat iron organized.  This works perfect.  Great gift idea as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect to hold my curling wand, straightener and blow dryer. Smallest hole is very small so either need to put in my straightener open or will only hold the wand with one of the narrowest barrels.</li>
    <li> No problems at all, I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product is great but don&#x27;t use the drywall inserts or screws. Both not good quality and will not hold. Just put in good screws and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Actually was too big to use in the bathroom I intended to use it in, also the attaching screws seem to be pretty wimpy for such a robust product.</li>
    <li> Yes I would recommend this product for home use!  It is very sturdy and holds both my dryer and curling iron.  It was easy to install on side wall under vanity counter for easy access!  5 star rating!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought this years ago. I attached it to my bathroom wall and keep my hairdryer and my two straighteners in it. It&#x27;s really nice not to have to worry about what I am setting my hot tools on. It seems to hold the heat well too, so it&#x27;s not transferring onto the wall that it is attached to.</li>
    <li> great worked perfectly</li>
    <li> This holder is bigger than it looks on screen, which is a good thing.  Made with heavy metal and very good paint.  To install into a stud will need two screws (the holes a large for bigger screws).  Mounting in drywall use toggle bolts. The included plastic anchors and screws are not sufficient.  Great place for hot irons and storage when not in use.</li>
    <li> I think this product is better than described. My husband did use better anchored screws than what came with it. Matches my bathroom and looks great. I actually use the curling iron hole to hold the cord for my flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days and have not yet mounted it on the the wall, but it appears to be very well made and tough which is what I was looking for since this is going to be used by a teenager and pre-teen pair of girls. They are great kids, but not always the gentlest on things that they are using, so I am hoping that it will be teen proof, if there is such a thing!</li>
    <li> Very well made only thing I wish it had was a slot for my flat iron.</li>
    <li> The was SO MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED!!  it&#x27;s heavy and durable.  Made if steel not plastic . Great product.  I like it a lot!!</li>
    <li> the size of the holds are just ok.</li>
    <li> Everything is fine and works well.</li>
    <li> Easy to install. ...exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great product. Sturdy and easy to install.</li>
    <li> the wall mount is heavy and well made.  It should last forever.</li>
    <li> I returned because it did not fit my blow dryer or my flat iron.  It seemed like it would have been very durable had things fits.</li>
    <li> This things really fit my needs. Cleaned up the wife&#x27;s vanity and put all of her hair utensils in one area.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Any one that can use a hand drill can install it.</li>
    <li> The dryer side of this holder was much too small for my hair dryer (which is a pretty basic size) but it&#x27;s so well made I decided to keep it for my curling irons alone.  The metal is solid and the finish is great...it should hold up forever.  I initially contacted the company to return the item and they were fast and helpful, but as I said I plan to keep it anyway.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t come with any anchor or screw to mount it up.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair dryer, flat iron, and curling wand. My husband installed this with no issues. Very sturdy!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Helped me get organized</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and well made, better than expected. It is made of heavy guage steel and has an excellent gloss black paint job. Nothing cheap here. I expect to get years og service from mine.</li>
    <li> This was easy to attach to my cabinet, and works very well. It&#x27;s also very sturdy. Should last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product! Use it for my hair dryer, flat iron and brush. It is very sturdy and attractive.</li>
    <li> You can actually fit a LOT on this, saves me so much drawer space!!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and compact. keeps my wife&#x27;s off the counter and tub.</li>
    <li> This is a great product high-quality paint&lt;br /&gt;.easy to mount&lt;br /&gt;.highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Says it looks like the holsters in the beauty salons.  Keeps dangling cords curling irons and the hair dryer off the bathroom sink counter.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my curling irons and hair dryer. What sold me on this one was that it is metal (not plastic). I installed it on the side of my makeup table, slightly angled so I can easily access my appliances while getting ready. Since I got it several months ago, I have loved it every day!</li>
    <li> I love this! It saves counter space and it was easy to put up. I was able to surprise my husband.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for to clear up sink space.  Heavy duty.</li>
