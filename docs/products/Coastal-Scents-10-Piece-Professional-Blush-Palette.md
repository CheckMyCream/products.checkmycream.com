      <li>i love the colors and they are good quality.</li>
      <li>nice pigmentation,</li>
      <li>Nice packaging.</li>
      <li>Honestly this was an impulse buy -there</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s handy to have, though,  and I do like the variety of colors to experiment with.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and am thinking about getting the original blush palette as well.</li>
      <li>The colors were very bright and pigmented and will go great on several shades.</li>
      <li>The colors are pretty pigmented and beautiful.</li>
      <li>The pigmentation on these is pretty great</li>
      <li>I did wear it for a blush but put it on with a very light hand.</li>
      <li>The colors were too bold for my fair skin.</li>
      <li>Love the makeup for the cost.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love having the color selections in one pallett.</li>
      <li>it was what I wanted for the most part.</li>
      <li>The color choices are OK.  </li>
      <li>It went on my eyes nice &amp; pigmented &amp; was soo smooth.</li>
      <li>It works better for an eyeshadow then most of my eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>Love the blushes they came on time Also</li>
      <li>Great color and came fast</li>
      <li>Its a pretty good deal 10 blushes for 20 bucks, but i probably wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase because of the smell.</li>
      <li>Cool and warm tones included to go with any look.</li>
      <li>These are actually pretty good.</li>
      <li>Very bright pigment have to be careful but other than that they are wonderful</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned with pink undertones and this pallett works for me.</li>
      <li>Then, lightly dust on.</li>
      <li>the colors are true and rich.</li>
      <li>I thought more colours would of suited my complexion after reading the reviews that its more suitable for dark ladies.</li>
      <li>I had to return them because of the skin irritation, but they would have been a dream come true otherwise.</li>
      <li>Perfect for African American skin.</li>
      <li>- I think it would be a better idea to find a few colors that i really liked and get just those (I like the NYX blushes and they are pretty cheap)</li>
      <li>are a few colors in there that I would never wear just because they don&#x27;t really go great with my complexion</li>
      <li>These are very pigmented and have to be applied lightly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Stacks nice and flat.</li>
      <li>If I were comparing these blushes to a brand I would say they are right in between drug store brand and MAC.</li>
      <li>The colors are nice, there is a wide variety from &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; neutral colors to more vivid colors for bolder looks.</li>
      <li>like I thought the first one could be a highlight</li>
      <li>I tried them and didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction or anything and the color lasted pretty well throughout the day.</li>
      <li>The only real cons about this product is that some of the blushes kick up a lot of powder, some of them are a bit patchy (but still workable), and some I wish had just a bit more pigment to them.</li>
      <li>They are very pigmented which makes up for that because you don&#x27;t need very much</li>
      <li>I really like this blush &amp; it is very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look real at all... Not recommended</li>
      <li>very compact, every color blush you would ever need.</li>
      <li>They blend very well</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think the picture really shows the colors very well</li>
      <li>IDEAL FOR DARK AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN.</li>
      <li>A few of the blushes, especially the purple/lilac color, are darker in person than they are pictured here, but are still very pretty and can be used without looking clownish if you use a light hand.</li>
      <li>Use it nearly every day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and am not sensitive to products normally</li>
      <li>they last all day and they are not harsh on your skin would def recommend</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way... use a big fluffy brush and be aware of how much product it&#x27;s picking up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> these colors are amazing i order one for each of my friends. No need to swirl your brush in it. the colors are true and rich.</li>
    <li> Bought as a bday gift for a friend. Received undamaged. Hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> nice pigmentation, very compact, every color blush you would ever need. Great value for the price. Great addition to my pro kit.</li>
    <li> The blushes are really beautiful but I don&#x27;t think the picture really shows the colors very well like I thought the first one could be a highlight but it is a pink blush and the blushes are a lot smaller than I thought they would be. They are very pigmented which makes up for that because you don&#x27;t need very much it was what I wanted for the most part. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Love it great colors and pigments</li>
    <li> Received broken...blush everywhere</li>
    <li> Love having the color selections in one pallett. Cool and warm tones included to go with any look. Use it nearly every day. A little goes a long way... use a big fluffy brush and be aware of how much product it&#x27;s picking up. Then, lightly dust on. I am very fair skinned with pink undertones and this pallett works for me.</li>
    <li> A great deal for the price. These are nicely pigmented and all of the shades are flattering on my fair-neutral skin. I deducted a star because one of the blushes basically disintegrated when I accidentally dropped the palette from a moderate height.</li>
    <li> The color choices are OK.  Some of the colors like the purple and the orange seem a bit chalky.  If I were to recommend a low cost blush, it would be the Sleek Make-up brand which is also sold on Amazon.  I purchased 2 of the Blush by 3 and they are great.</li>
    <li> Good pigmentation but can look chalky</li>
    <li> Yeah I like it. Got it in one piece.</li>
    <li> I really like this blush &amp; it is very pigmented. I ordered it because of the purple. I did wear it for a blush but put it on with a very light hand. I also wore it for an eyeshadow and really loved it. It went on my eyes nice &amp; pigmented &amp; was soo smooth. It works better for an eyeshadow then most of my eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> I literally just got it 5minutes ago, &amp; one of the blushes was broken. I bought it for my mom, I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I read reviews and did some research before buying this palette. A few of the blushes, especially the purple/lilac color, are darker in person than they are pictured here, but are still very pretty and can be used without looking clownish if you use a light hand. The only real cons about this product is that some of the blushes kick up a lot of powder, some of them are a bit patchy (but still workable), and some I wish had just a bit more pigment to them.

    <li> Very dark colors and so looks very weird when applied on your face. Doesn&#x27;t look real at all... Not recommended</li>
    <li> The colors are nice, there is a wide variety from &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; neutral colors to more vivid colors for bolder looks. The pigmentation on these is pretty great and you can build up the color. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about these is the smell, they have a plastic-chemically smell. I tried them and didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction or anything and the color lasted pretty well throughout the day. Its a pretty good deal 10 blushes for 20 bucks, but i probably wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase because of the smell. Honestly this was an impulse buy -there are a few colors in there that I would never wear just because they don&#x27;t really go great with my complexion - I think it would be a better idea to find a few colors that i really liked and get just those (I like the NYX blushes and they are pretty cheap)</li>

    <li> Great color and came fast</li>
    <li> These are very pigmented and have to be applied lightly. The colors were too bold for my fair skin. I would recommend it for darker complexions.</li>
    <li> Love the makeup for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Stacks nice and flat. Nice packaging. Good shipping.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Beautiful colors and easy to apply. And the colors stay all day. Very bright pigment have to be careful but other than that they are wonderful</li>
    <li> i love the colors and they are good quality. they last all day and they are not harsh on your skin would def recommend</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings...I thought more colours would of suited my complexion after reading the reviews that its more suitable for dark ladies.I am carob in Black Opal</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLORS! IDEAL FOR DARK AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. Some are matte and some have shimmer...either way u won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is the best palette I have purchased. I use ot almost daily. Perfect for African American skin. I am a MAC studio fix NC50 and Revlon Colorstay Caramel for combination/oily skin.</li>
    <li> These colors are amazingly beautiful and I was so excited to use them! Unfortunately these, within 20 minutes of applying were burning my skin really bad. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and am not sensitive to products normally so this was surprising to me. I had to return them because of the skin irritation, but they would have been a dream come true otherwise. Too bad :(</li>
    <li> I recieved my palette very quickly in great condition. The colors were very bright and pigmented and will go great on several shades. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this and will order again.</li>
    <li> For the price this is an amazing value. The colors are pretty pigmented and beautiful. For anyone that is just getting started with makeup this is a great piece to add to your kit. If I were comparing these blushes to a brand I would say they are right in between drug store brand and MAC.</li>
    <li> These are actually pretty good. They blend very well</li>
    <li> It looks chalky on my dark skin......all the colors ebd up looking chalky.....not a fan</li>
