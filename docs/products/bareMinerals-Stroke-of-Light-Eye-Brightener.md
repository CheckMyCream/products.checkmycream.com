      <li>I love this as a concealer for dark spots and blemishes all over my face, but can&#x27;t stand how it looks under my eyes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This applies very smoothly. (I recommend using a concealer brush for an even smoother application that also allows you to use less of the product each time. It requires only the smallest dab) It does brighten the under-eye area. I am pleased and have purchased 2 of them; one for the purse and one for the cosmetic drawer. If the day is long, I would probably apply it a second time, but it does seem to last well enough on a regular day...unless there&#x27;s some crying going on.</li>
    <li> Good for contrasting!  Gives your face a bit of a wake up in brightness.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a touch lighter than I expected but it still works. I think it covers well, makes my &amp;#34;new mom tired eyes&amp;#34; look much better.&lt;br /&gt;I like the slight shimmer.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, a little goes a long way, it hides fine lines and any discoloration just pat on sparingly with ring finger. Love it!!</li>
    <li> My favorite concealer for under they eyes. Shows great in pictures. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Even if this is all you put on it makes a big difference! With makeup or alone, it hides the dark circles.Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It really makes a difference under your eyes.  I use a little underneath and then put my Bare Minerals foundation over it.  I can see how much brighter and the dark circles do not stand out.  I totally recommend this product.  It is a must have and  you will not be disappointed.  The price is good on Amazon too. The seller was great and item arrived earlier than I thought.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected. It&#x27;s more of highlighter for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, gives my eyes glow.</li>
    <li> I expected a new product from Bare Minerals when I quick ordered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what I got was what appeared to me something that had been opened but not purchased or was purchased and rtn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then for a return shipping label I am expect to of course find time to go and pay for the return shipping of the used item that was sold as new.</li>
    <li> I am a fulltime student and work fulltime needless to say I need help not looking tired all the time and this product does the trick. My only negative is that I need to reapply throughout the day. I would suggest getting one shade lighter than your normal color for the greatest results.</li>
    <li> Love this product...used it for a few years now ...goes on evenly and covers well. Highly recommend it for your use with makeup.</li>
    <li> Highlights perfectly! Arrived as expected! Packaged just right ...great product...purchased once before..will continue to purchase ..Thank you so much again !</li>
    <li> very nice - it does really brighten the under eye area.  I tend to have difficulty with dark circles.</li>
    <li> I hate wearing makeup.... but I love this stuff. And it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water when near them. That&#x27;s HUGE!</li>
    <li> Great product,  works fantastically.  Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.A lot goes a long way so very little is needed to provide great coverage!  I have sensitive eyes and skin and so far, there has been no irritation, but again, use sparingly!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brightener I have ever owned!  Everyone must try it!  You will love it I promise!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It does a great job disguising under eye dark circles and is very light feeling.  Does not feel caked on.</li>
    <li> The only concealer I ever use!  Perfect the first time and lasts all day.  Lovely product.</li>
    <li> I must agree with another reviewer who said that this does not so much cover your dark circles as much as it brightens that area under your eyes. Short of laser surgery to remove your dark circles, I have found no cream or cover up that will completely remove that dark smudge or camouflage it. But this is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> awesome product !&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again i have tried the all this one is the best ,covers well &amp; lasts all day.</li>
    <li> In general the texture and ease of application are a plus, but the major issue is that the brightener is not very thick. In other words, if you&#x27;re looking to really conceal any under eye dark circles, this product will not do the trick. It&#x27;s pretty sheer.</li>
    <li> BARE MINERALS PRODUCTS ARE ALWAYS FANTASTIC. THIS WORKS GREAT AND I AM SO HAPPY I PURCHASED IT. THE PRODUCT WORKS JUST AS IT SAID IT WOULD.</li>
    <li> Very nice product; creamy, blendable, and affordable.  This is very light and does not leave a cakey finish, very sheer and smooth.  It is a nice value worth a try.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and color for a lightweight concealer.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for covering under eye dark circles.</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me. I wanted it to cover my dark under eye circles. It did not do a good job, wether not thick or potent enough to cover/conceal. I wanted it to work</li>
    <li> Super light-weight and reflects light off my natural dark under-eye circles. Absolutely fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product to brighten up dark areas. I use it on dark eye circles, but you can use it different places&lt;br /&gt;you want to brighten. It goes on easily and blends well.  I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Blends well but doesn&#x27;t fully conceal my under eye area (not that I have super dark circles either - just a little tired looking) and isn&#x27;t too buildable. I also noticed if I blend it out onto my cheeks and nose area, it makes me oily. Will probably move on to another concealer.</li>
    <li> Works great without getting in creases like powder can do.</li>
    <li> I really like how easy it is to apply, and it most definitely lightens up underneath my eyes! It&#x27;s also fairly easy to blend in with the rest of my foundation.</li>
    <li> Perfect to carry in your purse to brighten when needed</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! It immediately brightens my undereye area and makes me look awake and refreshed. I am only 25, but i have two toddlers, so dark circles are pretty standard. This is my secret weapon. I use it every day, i don&#x27;t know how I managed without it. It is not a concealer, it is an under eye brightener. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this. I apply a dot under the eyes and they really stand out.  It brightens the area.  I was pleased with this product and will purchase again</li>
    <li> Arrived fast! Very nice concealer works great. Thank you for a pleasant transaction.</li>
    <li> Fabulousness!  It seems like ive tried hundreds of concelears, highlighters etc. For my bags/dark circles. This doesn&#x27;t make them disappear however,  it smooths and brightens the area under my eyes. I use it under eyes and a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape below the eye, along side of nose and sweep up to top of cheek bone. Gently tap with a sponge to blend. Gonna have to buy a truck load! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this concealer.  It is light, yet gives good coverage.</li>
    <li> This concealer makes your face look so vibrantly lifted, alert and pretty.  I bought it because I was exhausted from working long hours and going to school.  I still had a little of my day&#x27;s makeup on and I just tried a little dab under one eye.  The most amazing concealer I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;m never using any other.  I can put on this concealer, mascara, lipgloss with just a touch of tinited moisturizer and look fabulous.  I adore this product.  Two thumps WAY up!</li>
    <li> I bought this and returned it the next day.  It&#x27;s nice, but it makes the texture of my skin look funky. I also have a Garnier under eye roller that&#x27;s tinted and it works much better, has a better texture, and is less than 1/2 the price. I&#x27;d definitely try it in store first if you can- that way you can know if the texture will bother you.</li>
    <li> The best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used !</li>
    <li> I love the way this goes on wet but sets as minerals and it&#x27;s very long lasting! It&#x27;s my new favorite under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample and at first used it as a concealer under makeup.. I saw nothing.. Then after forgetting to apply for a few days, I put it on over my makeup..  Apparently this did it, my eyes look so much brighter .. I even tried a little on my brow bone for added light..  Not sure if this is the correct way to use but for me, I love it</li>
    <li> Works great for under eyes!</li>
    <li> The wand makes this concealer easy to apply.  Perfect for on the go to because you can just rub in with your finger after you apply.  There is a small amount of shimmer that give your eyes and extra pop!  My first container lasted 6+ months because you don&#x27;t have to use very much.  Very impressed!</li>
    <li> Another great Bare Minerals product.  I use this product both under the eye to conceal and on  the eyelid as a wonderful base for eye shadow.  It is light weight yet conceals well.  Very reasonably priced and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Just like any Bare Minerals product, I love this!  It really works and brightens my under eye area well.  Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> perfect color and plenty of liquid in it</li>
    <li> I love this as a concealer for dark spots and blemishes all over my face, but can&#x27;t stand how it looks under my eyes.  Once I add powder over it, every line and crease around my eyes was magnified and looked cakey.  I&#x27;m sticking with a creamier concealer for under my eyes, but will be ordering this again for the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> It realy works. and its super easy to wear, both underneath and over my makeup. it helps with  my dark circles, and makes my eye area brighter</li>
    <li> As a woman in her 50s who&#x27;s been battling heriditary dark undereye circles since the onset of puberty, this is one of my not-so-secret weapons against the aging effect of said circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything under the sun. Light concealers. Industrial strength concealers. Accepting the circles as just part of my charm. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that the fact that now I have to contend with fine lines. Fine lines and concealers do not play well together. Some of them look great when they go on, but halfway through the day they&#x27;ve settled into the fine lines and turned a greyish color. Not helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the only things that I&#x27;ve liked well enough to use again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a concealer. It doesn&#x27;t cover up the dark circles. It just makes them not matter as much. It&#x27;s hard to describe it accurately. It brightens the undereye area just enough to make my dark circles less noticiable and it doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines to create new problems. I use it after my foundation and dab a series of small dots under the eye...then just roll and blend with my ring finger. The difference is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m covering up anything. It just looks like there&#x27;s less that needs covering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as Bare Minerals keeps making it.</li>
