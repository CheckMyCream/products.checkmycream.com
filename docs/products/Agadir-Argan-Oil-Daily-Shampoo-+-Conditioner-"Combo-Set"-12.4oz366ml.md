      <li>I chose a 5 star rating because it makes my hair smooth and soft, and I love the leave in oil!</li>
      <li>Today was the first day and I love this product.</li>
      <li>Not sure why, but the &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; is not as wonderful as it is when I use it at the salon, after a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is my third sulfate-free shampoo, and by far the best.</li>
      <li>Love the set it makes my hair soft and healthy feeling</li>
      <li>wonderful for dry or brittle hair and is better than any deep conditioner i have used!</li>

      <li>I notice a slight, pleasant smell but nothing that made any impression or</li>
      <li>There is very little build up and the great smell lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really think that part is true...</li>
      <li>that so many reviews, if you have the extra cash and want to try it up to you,</li>
      <li>Definitely will be buying more.</li>
      <li>This is my first time..</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy hair that grows straight out of my head</li>
      <li>Bought some for daughter who is very picky</li>
      <li>so I need a little more hold.</li>
      <li>My hair feels like and looks like my 3 year old neices!!</li>
      <li>Definately worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>I needed new products.</li>
      <li>I did have to return this, and I lost a bit of $$ other than shipping as in special pricing etc.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner seem to dry my hair out more than the other shampoo that I use.</li>
      <li>I like the smell and feel my scalp clear after using it.</li>
      <li>i had problems from heat and coloring this fixed it all.</li>
      <li>my hair is soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and if you have hair like mine which is soft then you need to spray the bottle into your hand and then finger your hair with it</li>
      <li>Shiny, bouncy and extremely soft and silky.</li>
      <li>If you have chemically enhanced hair like I do then this is the answer for shiny, soft, manageable hair.  </li>

    <li> If you have chemically enhanced hair like I do then this is the answer for shiny, soft, manageable hair.  The smell is heavenly too!</li>
    <li> by far this is the worst shampoo I ever bought.. I have long thick coloured hair my hair is soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I used the oil treatment sample that came with the order with my hair therapy wrap.&lt;br /&gt;which was an epic fail, did nothing to my hair just made it so frizzy and dry could not wash it easily with the shampoo and the conditioner.  i thought that this might be the reason so i gave it another try washed my hair 2 days after.. i could not brush my hair my hair was soooo dry frizzy and unmanageable to describe it well i looked like i had a nest on top of my head that how my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;am not sure why or how it have that so many reviews, if you have the extra cash and want to try it up to you, but i decided my hair is important to me and i throw everything in the trash..</li>
    <li> I tried these on a whim.  Wonderful shampoo and conditioner. My straight, long hair detangled with minimal fallout and was silky-smooth for the next few  There is very little build up and the great smell lasts all day.  The spray seems a bit to oily for my hair and does cause build up (I don&#x27;t normally have build up as i don&#x27;t use many styling products).  I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This package deal is awesome including the oil hair treatment. Makes hair very shiny, soft, feels good and manageable and with the Argan hairspray you can build on the style and it lasts for days. Bought some for daughter who is very picky and she loves it! Definitely will be buying more.</li>
    <li> i use to use pantene but this is so much better. i had problems from heat and coloring this fixed it all. i love the smell. i will never use anything else. bonus it is sulfate free which is great for colored hair</li>
    <li> I am in love! I have thick curly hair and have tried every hair product imaginable sparing no expense. Seeing the reviews after having read up on argon oil i decidid to try it and im glad i did. My hair feels like and looks like my 3 year old neices!! Shiny, bouncy and extremely soft and silky. I notice a slight, pleasant smell but nothing that made any impression or lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Just smelled like argon oil to me. You cant beat this deal.</li>
    <li> This is my first time.. I use it for two weeks now.. I like the smell and feel my scalp clear after using it. As a treatment, i can not judge now ..</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing a beauty product online but I&#x27;ve heard good things about this brand. This is my third sulfate-free shampoo, and by far the best. Nice lather and no residue. The styling spray is lightweight and the fragrance is soothing. I think this has been a great addition to my haircare regimen.</li>
    <li> The smell gave me a headache. I usually love items with the Argan Oil.  So if you are sensitive to weird smells you may want to rethink ordering this.  I did have to return this, and I lost a bit of $$ other than shipping as in special pricing etc. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> My hair is looking better because of these products. Not sure this is the end of my hunt for a product line but they are good. I have very frizzy hair that grows straight out of my head (in every direction) so I need a little more hold. I f you have good hair and just want a little hold and shine this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Yes and I want to purchase more</li>
    <li> I have natural long hair. The shampoo and conditioner seem to dry my hair out more than the other shampoo that I use. May work fine on some hair textures....not so much on mine.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but the &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; is not as wonderful as it is when I use it at the salon, after a shampoo.  Same brand.  I&#x27;m wondering if there is a change in the quality, over time...and maybe there is an &amp;#34;expiration&amp;#34; of quality.?  Still, it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> great smell, wonderful product. It leaves my hair silky, smooth and smelling great. wonderful for dry or brittle hair and is better than any deep conditioner i have used!</li>
    <li> The seller contacted me promptly whenever I had a questions about the product. I really enjoy the quality of the product. This is a must try.</li>
    <li> Awesome works great on my curly hair that is color treated. It is hard to find a shampoo as good as this one!</li>
    <li> I heard this could make your hair grow faster by a few friends who tried it but I don&#x27;t really think that part is true... though I do think my hair is still soft and more shiny after using this. The spray isn&#x27;t bad either and if you have hair like mine which is soft then you need to spray the bottle into your hand and then finger your hair with it so it doesn&#x27;t make it to oily.</li>
    <li> Love the set it makes my hair soft and healthy feeling</li>
    <li> Not For ALL hair types.  My hair is relaxed and colored.  The product make it look a little bit dry....</li>
    <li> I chose a 5 star rating because it makes my hair smooth and soft, and I love the leave in oil!</li>
    <li> Perfect combo if you buy ut with the  argan oil bottle.</li>
    <li> I just put highlights back into my hair after 6 years of being brown. My hair was dry and unmanagable at first. I needed new products. This was recommended by my hairdresser. Today was the first day and I love this product. The smell is amazing, the texture of my hair is so soft (not oily) and pretty. Definately worth the extra money. I also bought the curling cream but have not used it yet.</li>
    <li> Purchased many products thinking I would like it but I don&#x27;t. Not satisfied with results of appearance and texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good for some, not for me, oh well, we all buy something we don&#x27;t care for in the end, trial and error.</li>
    <li> thanx its good serves</li>
