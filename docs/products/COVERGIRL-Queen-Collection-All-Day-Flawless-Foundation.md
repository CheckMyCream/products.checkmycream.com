      <li>Great coverage doesn&#x27;t go on heavy blends smoothly!!!!!</li>
      <li>I really like the formulation for this product because the blend matches my skin tone perfectly, The foundation feels light and covers more like a powder than a cakey foundation - and</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan!</li>

      <li>I love it .</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>

      <li>I hope they never stop making it :)</li>
      <li>Love this foundation...</li>
      <li>This and Mocha are sisters but this has a red undertone which is perfect for me!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>it does look flawless and it certainly last all day!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and this one seems to work well with me.</li>
      <li>It performs just as well and maybe even better</li>
      <li>Love them all.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, feels very light, and has staying power.</li>
      <li>For winter and spring I use the sheer espresso tone, they are really beautiful on me and stay a day.</li>
      <li>My perfect foundation for summer where I can go very dark.</li>
      <li>product is very liquid and smoothed into face nicely.</li>
      <li>Fabulous seller and</li>
      <li>Just can&#x27;t wear to any event where you will cry LOL because it smears with every tear.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, It definitely has staying power and keeps us non-oily for hours</li>
      <li>Not all of us can fit in that &amp;#34;medium deep&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This is a perfect match for my skin tone which is really hard to find.</li>
      <li>If Covergirl Queen can do mineral foundation in these same shades, like a cream to powder, that would be good.</li>
      <li>You must pick this up, it&#x27;s long wearing, blends easily and is med coverage that is build able to full.</li>
      <li>The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is most definitely NOT full coverage; HOWEVER, I can easily build the coverage up to full on my acne scarred cheeks and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product line for women that have had trouble finding the perfect foundation shade for deeper skin tones but keep in mind unless you have &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Alone it tends to be pretty oily.</li>
      <li>I never write reviews but after wearing this product and being complemented on how nice and even my skin is 7 HOURS after application(I have acne prone skin with lots of dark marks) ...</li>
      <li>What I like about this foundation is that Covergirl made an effort to have different shades available for women of color.  </li>
      <li>Originally I was sheer expresso, then I changed to warm caramel, and now I&#x27;m using soft honey, but I recently bought soft copper.</li>
      <li>I normally use Makeup Forever HD foundation, but I found this which is cost efficient and will be using this for now on!</li>
      <li>then my high end foundations (Lancôme, makeup for ever, Nars).</li>
      <li>however the consistency of this product is lighter and although it covers well and looks and feels natural on the skin it didn&#x27;t cover my blemishes very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> What I like about this foundation is that Covergirl made an effort to have different shades available for women of color.  Not all of us can fit in that &amp;#34;medium deep&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; tones.  I&#x27;m annoyed by foundations from well known companies that don&#x27;t give women of color a lot of shade choices.  At least Covergirl does.  I have oily skin and I like that it goes matte once I apply it. If only they can do the same thing, but make a mineral foundation for the Queen collection (Maybe they do and I don&#x27;t know where it is).  What I&#x27;m finding after using this for a couple of years now is that I do have to change shades. Originally I was sheer expresso, then I changed to warm caramel, and now I&#x27;m using soft honey, but I recently bought soft copper. I realize that in the summer your skin tone does darken a bit then winter.  If Covergirl Queen can do mineral foundation in these same shades, like a cream to powder, that would be good. In the summer when it&#x27;s humid, a liquid foundation is the last thing you want.  I will say that this does hold up good on humid days. But like any foundation it does wear off.  I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and this one seems to work well with me. This is better foundation than the ones of tried. I always go back to this one.  Setting it with powder is optional and it is buildable coverage.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will purchase over and over.</li>
    <li> Great coverage doesn&#x27;t go on heavy blends smoothly!!!!! Good for both daytime and evening looks...doesn&#x27;t run will definetly purchase this item again</li>
    <li> Just received this today and it was a perfect match. (I have a good eye...lol) It goes on smooth, feels very light, and has staying power. I did use a primer as I do with all foundations. Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love it. it does look flawless and it certainly last all day! I  definitely recommended this product to others.  perfect!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but after wearing this product and being complemented on how nice and even my skin is 7 HOURS after application(I have acne prone skin with lots of dark marks) ...I am a huge fan! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is most definitely NOT full coverage; HOWEVER, I can easily build the coverage up to full on my acne scarred cheeks and the results are amazing. It has given me soooo much more confidence and it lasts all day with no/minimal touch ups. I hope they never stop making it :)</li>
    <li> This was delivered way before the estimated delivery date. Fabulous seller and i would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very liquid and smoothed into face nicely. It also doesn&#x27;t feel like if you have anything on. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the Queen Collection and this foundation is awesome!!  As a matter of fact, I seem to get more compliments on this foundation than my Mary Kay foundation, Go Figure!!</li>

    <li> This is a foundation that I have repurchased.  I like it a lot but this color is hard to find in my local drug stores.  I like the finish that it gives as long as you set it with a powder. Once it oxidized, it can look a little orange but I usually mix my foundations anyway.  I like it because of the staying power it had on my oily skin.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I really like the formulation for this product because the blend matches my skin tone perfectly, The foundation feels light and covers more like a powder than a cakey foundation - and a plus is that a little goes a long way and my skin looks natural and glowing. There was one small drawback for me with this product - I have even skin tone but also have a couple dark spots and blemishes however the consistency of this product is lighter and although it covers well and looks and feels natural on the skin it didn&#x27;t cover my blemishes very well. I would definitely recommend this product line for women that have had trouble finding the perfect foundation shade for deeper skin tones but keep in mind unless you have &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; even skin tone a base primer or concealer may be needed to enhance coverage.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this. Coverage is not good on flawed skin. It does look good on some people. I have a couple of family members that wear the product and it looks great.</li>
    <li> For us brown girls please don&#x27;t overlook cover girl queen collection foundation. I love this. I use to buy Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, MAC, Lancôme and Bobbi brown. I found that cover girl queen collection does just as good as those name brand foundations. Don&#x27;t down it until you try it</li>
    <li> This and Mocha are sisters but this has a red undertone which is perfect for me! I love it . you can build on it, once it dries it feels matte. This apply like butter. I normally use Makeup Forever HD foundation, but I found this which is cost efficient and will be using this for now on!</li>
    <li> Matched my skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> To me this foundation does not work well alone I have to mix it with another foundation to ger a lasting result.  Alone it tends to be pretty oily.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Just can&#x27;t wear to any event where you will cry LOL because it smears with every tear.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, It definitely has staying power and keeps us non-oily for hours and it feels like I have no makeup on at all. Not full coverage but it&#x27;s buildable.</li>
    <li> The Queen Collection is the best and Spicy Brown is best for my ethic completion.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect match for my skin tone which is really hard to find.</li>
    <li> love it makes me look flawless</li>
