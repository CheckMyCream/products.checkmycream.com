    <li> Superb!! Ordered these for the Mrs. and she loves them!!!</li>
    <li> my wife loves them... what else can a guy say?</li>
    <li> Fit well. I would say my hand is slightly larger than average. ( ring size 8 1/2 women) fit is not loose or tight. Just right. Love the color also (amethyst )</li>
    <li> The material is good and they don&#x27;t shed fiber but I have very small hands and my only complaint is that the length of the finger parts are a little long on me. I have to constantly pull the material down to make sure it doesn&#x27;t hit the part of my nail I just painted. That is kind of annoying but otherwise they work well. Probably better for people with longer fingers.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. No problems.</li>
    <li> These gloves easily protect your hands from the hot light. I feel much better about no chip manicures now that I have a way to protect my skin!</li>
    <li> The fit was perfect,and when I washed them good as new.Several people what a great idea.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. These are comfortable and keep my hands cool under the UV lamp. The purple color is true to the pic. I have medium hands (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; tall) and long fingers, and the gloves fit me perfectly. Those with smaller hands might find they are a bit too large.</li>
    <li> This glove is good. Fingers just s little bit long for me, but I am petite. Serves its purpose to protect from UV light.</li>
    <li> Fits good on my hands. Used them when I went to the salon to get my gel nail polish on</li>
    <li> Keep your hands young. These are stretchy, comfortable, and easy to wash. Only 4 stars because i wish the gloves were longer (went up the arm further). Highly recommend for anyone doing gel nails.</li>
    <li> These are great for Shellac nails and driving as well.  Perfect for small hands too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for addressing my clients that worry about what they hear on TV although the whole manicure only amounts to 2 min. In the sun. It&#x27;s good to see who can jump on creating items like this.</li>
    <li> I got these for obviously reasons and of course I cant tell if they are working but I will say that my only suggestion would be that they would come in sizes. My hands are thin and my fingers are what I can only assume to be shorter than normal so my hands don&#x27;t fit the gloves well. My entire pinky is covered just about. That may be a good thing if I  used regular polish with my lamp, but we all know that gel sets once you take your fingers out of the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Love the color. The funny smell goes away once they hit the air for a bit. They&#x27;re a really nice fabric. I would recommend them with confidence</li>
    <li> These gloves look and work exactly as described. I will use them every time I get a gel manicure. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great! My main concern was fit, as I have bigger hands and these fit nicely. I can get my nails done without dealing with leathery hands.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my gloves thanks</li>
    <li> Great fit and comfort!  Glad to have protection!</li>
    <li> Shield glove are great! Perfect fit. Thanks</li>
    <li> Fits chubby hands! The fabric is thin, not bulky, and adaptable. Very breathable. The fingers are a bit longer than I&#x27;d like, but they&#x27;re manageable. Small hands and/or short fingers should beware. The amethyst is a reddish purple, not as dark as pictured.</li>
    <li> I really like the gloves and they fit my medium size hands really well.  I think they&#x27;re well-constructed and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.  I recommend to anyone looking to protect their hands from harmful UV rays.</li>
    <li> If you have small hands these glove fingers keep riding up into the nail bed and manicure.  You can&#x27;t pull them down easily with wet nails and my manicurist pulled them down 2X and gave up - just too big.  I have a size 5 ring finger, so my hands are small - but one size does not fit all, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to adjust them.</li>
    <li> It is too big and on my first time it did not do what I expected it to..-If it was for the shipping cost I would send it back....</li>
    <li> Update:  After using these gloves twice, they began to unravel.  Keep your needle and thread handy.      The gloves seem to be doing what they are intended to do.  The light from the UV lamp was too warm for my hands and these gloves make it more comfortable when I get the gel polish.  Hopefully they are protecting my hands from premature aging also.  The purple is pretty, and they fit great on my hands which (with my height of 5&#x27;9) are a bit larger than average.</li>
    <li> these work great are easy to get on and off do not slip down onto nails</li>
    <li> Good UV Protection - just as advertised.  They fit my hands well, which are fairly large with shorter fingers.  I will probably continue my gel manicures now that I have these.</li>
