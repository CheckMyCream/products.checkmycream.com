<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with VoilaVe products, including the Rosehip Oil.  There are SO many oils and skincare items out there, how do you choose?  I like to go with a good value for the money and I want it to be pure and organic.  VoilaVe Rosehip oil comes in both a 1 oz and 4 oz bottle, so you can try the 1 oz and if you like it go with the larger one next time.  You will love it, it has a wonderful fragrance, and it is so light and fresh on your skin.  It is packed with antioxidants and works for a lot of skin issues including discoloration, and it absorbs quickly and easily.  Also works as a great moisturizer for your skin and contains plumpers to give your skin that wonderful healthy glow.  The oil is bottled in the USA and is USDA certified organic.  The smaller bottle comes with a little dropper and you just need a few drops to use it, so this bottle will last a long time.  The larger 4 oz bottle has a pump on top so that you don&#x27;t waste any of the oil.  Who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger and get rid of face issues?  I think everyone can benefit from this!  Give it a shot and see what you think :)  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
    <li> The oil is calming to irritated skin. It does fight dry skin exceptionally well, even better over time with frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight unpleasant earthy odor, but I wash it off before going out in public, it&#x27;s not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil spreads very well, one pump will cover your entire face. Some say it absorbs immediately into the skin, it&lt;br /&gt;may but your face will remain oily and shinny if you don&#x27;t wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s a great choice for those with eczema or psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, to bad they raised the price and I had to purchase another brand (that I am happy with) on Amazon.  The product is amazing, Come down to same price value as before and I&#x27;ll def come back for more.</li>
    <li> I have just recently discovered rosehip oil, and I am wondering how I have been missing it all this time... this product is organic, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my face, my elbows, my super nasty dry feet and recently on mosquito bites. We have been under attack and the rosehip oil takes the itch right down.. better than anything else I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is made of dark glass, to protect the oil for a long time. There is also a handy dropper which makes application easier. The scent is a light oily smell- not a perfume, but earthier. I like using it all over- and the scent fades pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for providing me a sample of this product for review on my blog.</li>
    <li> really helped me when I thought i had stretch marks, really smoothes out your skin, I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Light and absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with the Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this oil!&lt;br /&gt;Received it promptly, it was wrapped carefully.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used Rosehip oil before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but, it has a faint earthy, fresh aroma, straight out of the bottle. The aroma dissipates as you smooth it into your skin.  It only takes about 3 drops to cover my face and neck and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils, it&#x27;s wonderful for that purpose as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for offering a high quality Organic Rosehip Oil.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect to smell like a rose but your skin will never be softer from a natural product.</li>
    <li> I have bought several bottles of this and have given a few bottles as gifts.  It is my official nightly moisturizer now.  I love it.  My skin feels softer and looks smoother and clearer.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with breakouts, despite it being an oil.  It also works well as a carrier oil for essential oils.  The 4oz bottle will last quite a while and I find it is easier to use because it has the pump, plus it won&#x27;t spill as easily as the smaller bottle with the dropper applicator.  I have used this as a day moisturizer as well, but it needs a few minutes to absorb, and since I&#x27;m usually in a rush to put on makeup I primarily save this for use as my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for the past few years and love how it works.  I get particularly dry and flaky skin during the winter and I use this at night to help reduce (practically get rid of) any redness/uneven skin.  I recently moved from another country and so my usual shop does not ship to my new address... so very happy to have found an alternative supplier.  Would use this company again and definitely recommend their product, proper rosehip oil, works great.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am very happy with it&#x27;s quality and price for its size. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I especially like that it now comes in a 4oz. bottle</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very soft</li>
    <li> great service and I love love love this product~!</li>
    <li> I have tried other Rose Hip Oil&#x27;s, but this product is by far the best I have ever used. I love the way it leaves my skin.</li>
    <li> its great! I see astonishing improvements on my skin when coupled with drinking a gallon+ of water a day! Thanks so much has really helped and I also use avocado oil as well. I use them together and my skin tone has become much more even, my skin much more plump!</li>
    <li> LOVING my ORGANIC Rosehip Oil!!  I was spending WAY TOO MUCH on expensive oils.  I did some research and liked what I read about Rosehip Oil.  I&#x27;m 50 and am excited about the results I&#x27;m seeing with this oil!  GIVE IT A TRY!!</li>
    <li> I use VoilaVe&#x27;s Triple Action Vitamin C product and love it, so I decided to try a few of their other products. This Rosehip Oil has a really unpleasant (dare I say rancid?) odor to it. I am willing to suffer a bit to hang on to the last shred of my youth, so I continued to use it for a bit, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference from any other regular old moisturizer and the smell is just off-putting, so, I didn&#x27;t even get through half the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the way this oil feels in my homemade moisturizer blend. Also, buying the oil from this company makes sense because it has great quality products, excellent customer service and good tips for making sure the products you buy stay fresh.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works or not, because it smells so awful and fishy that I can&#x27;t stand to use it!</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! I use this as my moisture for my face and neck ;) helps heal sun burnt face, my face is silky smooth! Thanks sooooo much ;)</li>
    <li> The smell is not an issue so don&#x27;t worry about that. So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using it on my cheeks because of malasma and I&#x27;m using it on my knees to see if it will minimize the wrinkle lines. I think I might be seeing a difference on my knees! I love using products for other than their intended use.</li>
    <li> turned my nails orange</li>
    <li> Became malodorous within a few weeks after opening it. mabe better off buying a smaller bottle.</li>
    <li> Yuk!!! It stinks! I tried it on my hair while gagging from the smell and it turned my clean hair into a slimy mess! (I only used a tiny amount!) My neighbor made a comment about the stench and wrinkled her nose at my hair. It did not make my hair feel soft or shiny. I regret buying this product and will trade it on Ediv or give away to someone else who wants to try it. Do not buy this unless you know you like that smell! I would use it up on my feet to hydrate it but the smell is so bad I can&#x27;t stand it! Gross!</li>
    <li> Results remain to be seen as time is an element.  Feels great and looks convincing to other people I talk to.</li>
    <li> I really like using this on my face because my skin is really sensitive and this product is non-irritating.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I use it with the rest of the VoilaVe system of products. The smell is bitter at first, but it goes away quickly, and it works very well so far for me. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Helps moisturize my skin without any pore clogging, breakouts, or too much of a sheen. I am prone to blemishes, and this oil seems to help with both oiliness and scarring--nothing drastic but helpful. Light earthy smell that I kind of like. I apply a couple drops to the (very dry) ends of my wavy hair to tame frizz and flyaways.</li>
    <li> This has worked wonders on my skin! I love that it is a dry oil so it evaporates quickly but still leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I mix it with a couple drops of tea tree oil to keep my skin clear. I have also noticed a difference in some of the fine lines on my face, especially between my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Awesome  stuff!!! :)))</li>
    <li> i use this as a moisturizer-- i do have combination skin~&lt;br /&gt;i do NOT find my face to be any &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; greasy/ oily than before using this product&lt;br /&gt;i use this in combination w/ other VoilaVe face products&lt;br /&gt;though i am not sure i will re-purchase the other items&lt;br /&gt;i LOVE this product&lt;br /&gt;it works WONDERFULLY as a &amp;quot;healing&amp;quot; product (say -- dry fingernails, dry feet, knees, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i very much like this product,&lt;br /&gt;i was between this and the Argon Oil (for hair)&lt;br /&gt;though i will STILL buy Argon Oil, i will continue to use this as a daily (&amp;amp; night) moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i DO use more at night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a long ways-- and like i said, can be used for a lot of other parts of the body~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not sure &amp;quot;how much&amp;quot; it has &amp;quot;healed&amp;quot; my skin (as i said, using in combo w/ 2 other products)&lt;br /&gt;and my skin, to begin w/&lt;br /&gt;is pretty much blemish free (98% of the time) i don&#x27;t wear makeup on a daily basis (only do cat eyes)&lt;br /&gt;i am 44 and don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles (am a woman of color, and if my hair is colored (ha) people usually think i am in my early 30&#x27;s---&lt;br /&gt;but wanted something that would be proactive as i DO age~ ...</li>
    <li> Bit heavy.its gotta tint, but it works really well on the skin. I use it a couple of time a week at night, and my skin looks amazing the morning!</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and arrived quickly. Excellent product. Really helped improve the quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this Rosehip Oil by Voila Ve. I purchased other brand in the past and I felt that the Voila Ve is better quality and better price. I don&#x27;t know much about oil but after 2 months of use, my fine line are gone. I don&#x27;t see much different on dark spots though. Overall, very satisfied and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice product, absorbs quickly.  Too soon to see if I&#x27;ll get results for hyperpigmentation.  In terms of viscosity, it&#x27;s in between almond oil and castor oil.  Not sticky at all like castor oil, thicker than almond oil.  I just use one pump.</li>
    <li> This oil is just as I expected, rich &amp; soothing particularly for my very sensitive skin. Very economical to use as a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance just smells of a natural oil, which I am used to &amp; does linger for a while, more than a few seconds as the bottle suggests, however I left it on my skin after cleansing for about an hour &amp; followed it with a lightly scented natural moisturiser before bedtime. I have not had it long enough to use it during the day as yet,  but will do so following the VoilaVe routine &amp; make a judgement then.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this on my face and loving it so far!</li>
    <li> Reordered this and will continue to reorder because it&#x27;s FABULOUS for your skin!!</li>
    <li> It has helped heal my complexion, offers a beautiful radiant sun kissed hue without sun damage. My skin has (48-55 age) improved with this product.  Dark spots have dissipated and scars are slowly going away.  Knowing it does not have harsh chemicals is a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, thick, rich oil.  I use it alone or add it to other lotions to enhance them.  It soaks right in and really moisturizes.  I have been using it on my skin, hair and nails.  It protects my nails so they are not breaking and splitting as much.  I also add it to my leave-in conditioner for my hair.  This is a good value because you get a huge 4 ounce bottle for about the same price that other brands are selling 2 ounce bottles.  I like that it has a pump dispenser rather than a dropper bottle because it is much more sanitary and protects against spilling.  it is a great ingredient to add to your homemade beauty products.  I received a complimentary product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Rosehip Oil and have really enjoyed it. I&#x27;ve read that there are many uses for it, so I definitely will be trying different things with it. So far, I&#x27;ve used it on my face, on the fine lines and wrinkles. It really leaves my skin soft and the oil absorbs well. It does not leave my skin feeling oily at all. As far as the smell goes, I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews. It definitely doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smell, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s not bad either. It&#x27;s not a scent that lingers, so if you&#x27;re not crazy about it...no worries. It&#x27;s not something that is an issue with me at all. I will continue to use it for sure! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> The Organic Rosehip Oil comes in a nice sized brown glass bottle with a pump. The rosehip oil is an orange color with a light scent that doesn&#x27;t last long. Having tried rosehip seed oil previously I expected the characteristic oily scent (does not smell like roses). The box it came with had a business card with a link to download a free guide “8 Secrets To Younger Looking Skin”. The ebook was an unexpected bonus. I like this quote: ‘Having healthy and beautiful skin doesn&#x27;t just happen, it’s a lifestyle’. Great introductory words! The ebook describes VoilaVe products, their uses, and how they all work together to keep your skin looking great from head to toe as well as the 8 secrets to younger looking skin. This is my first product from this company but after reading the ebook I am excited to use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the directions say I squirted several drops of my VoilaVe organic rosehip oil into my bath and it did leave a nice soft coating to my skin. Not slippery or oily just more hydrated. Due to the change of weather my skin has been drying out so this is definitely a great product for moisturizing skin. It soaks into the skin quickly and I love the way it makes my skin feel. The pump is convenient when I only want a little bit of product to apply to my ashy areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature I really like about this product, besides the light scent, nourishing my skin, large size and pump is that it is certified organic by Ecocert IGO. With all the beauty products out there that have a long list of ingredients that can&#x27;t be healthy this is a wonderful alternative. One ingredient, organic, good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was sent these products FREE in exchange for a review. I am not affiliated with the companies mentioned. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;﻿</li>
    <li> This was a big year for me, the year of change, for a healthier, more natural lifestyle, and this included re-evaluating no only what I was putting in my body, but also what I was applying to my skin. Therefore, this spring I came to the realization that all my products were loaded with parabens and chemicals, nothing natural or pure and the result was that I was doing my skin and hair more harm than good. I made the decision to change, no more chemical laden products, and I discovered the natural world of oils. I think the beauty industry is turning more and more to these pure and natural ingredients as an alternative to the chemicals we have relied on in the recent past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received better results with oils, than I ever did with my previous, chemical facial and hair products. My favorite oils were Argan, and Rosehip as my number 2. I had thought that all Rosehip oil was the same, but I was wrong, VoilaVe is far superior. I love the VoilaVe subtle earthy aroma, and the clear golden amber color, but most of all I love the VoilaVe Rosehip Oil results. It is dry oil, it smoothens and softens my skin, and it is NOT greasy. VoilaVe absorbs completely without any shine or oily residue. VoilaVe is USDA certified Organic, Pure and unrefined, and Cold-Pressed. Cold-pressed is best because it retains more nutrients because a heat process does not alter it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VoilaVe Rosehip oil is in a sealed pump container, no chance of spilling, and no messy vial delivery that is sometimes wasteful and less chance of any bacterial contamination. In addition, it has both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, which helps to decrease environmental damage and soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use VoilaVe Rosehip oil for ALL of my skin-care, and hair-care needs. As a body moisturizer, I use this Rosehip oil after showering and before toweling dry. It only takes two pumps, and I rub my palms together, and then smooth down my arms, legs and the rest of my body. For me, this is the best moisturizing method because it does not leave any greasy or oily residue and my skin is soft, moisturized, and hydrated. I also use it in conjunction with my facial moisturizer, it absorbs quickly without any shine. Then I apply daily or nightly moisturizer and it keeps my mature dry skin hydrated better than the chemical store bought moisturizers that I used to use, and in addition, it is healthier for my skin. I also use a few drops of Rosehip Oil on my face before my derma roll session. This has helped lubricate my face enough that I am able to continue an aggressive procedure a few minutes longer without the previous irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, chemical color treated hair, and my final test was using VoilaVe Rosehip Oil as a conditioning hair remedy. The results were better than using Argan Oil, which is substantially more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to give myself a deep conditioning hair treatment twice a month, but just using two pumps of VoilaVe Rosehip oil mixed with a palm full of my normal shampoo, works just as well and saves me about an hour of time. I just wash and massage the mixture of shampoo/rosehip oil into my scalp, finish my shower and then rinse my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shower, I used the VoilaVe Rosehip Oil as a body moisturizer before I towel dry, and then apply two more pumps of this oil as a leave in hair conditioner. My hair had the clean feeling without the slipperiness that I had become accustomed to from the chemical hair conditioners. As an extra benefit, VoilaVe Rosehip is an effective hair detangler; my hair combed out easily with my wide toothcomb, without any snarls or tugging that can result in lost hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to blow-dry my hair and I was very pleased with the results. The Rosehip oil did NOT weigh down my hair. My hair was smooth, with a little lifting volume, was silky soft, and revitalized with a healthy clean sheen. VoilaVe Rosehip Oil gave me better results than my previous favorite Argan Oil did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ends my review for VoilaVe Natural Rosehip Oil, but if you would like to continue reading, I have done some research regarding the benefits along with a few different usages for Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to appreciate the benefits of Rosehip Oil, below are the effective components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil Contents&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil contains several nutrients which include:&lt;br /&gt;- Vitamin A or Retinol&lt;br /&gt;- Omega 6 or Linoleic Acid&lt;br /&gt;- Omega 9 or Oleic Acid&lt;br /&gt;- Lycopene - A highly-effective antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Beta-Carotene - A good source of pro-Vitamin A, another form of antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil Rosehip Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) A natural Acne and Eczema Treatment&lt;br /&gt;The essential fatty acids in rosehip seed oil work for dry scalp and itchiness due to stress and chemicals in shampoo.

    <li> I saw no results from using this oil.  The Desert Essence Jojoba oil I purchased with it works better.</li>
    <li> What a find!! Are you maturing? Have dark Spots? Stretch marks? Do you have dry skin, hair, cuticles? These are SOME of the questions and Voila Ve Rosehip oil is the answer! I had heard great things about Rosehip Oil in the past, but was skeptical. I could kick myself now for not trying this sooner and putting an end to my &#x27;dry, aging&#x27; problems!! This works phenomenally well not just for wrinkles, but for deep lines as well! It lightens dark spots, diminishes stretch marks, moisturizes and hydrates skin AND hair and is better than any salon treatment for chapped hands and cuticle repair, and ALL at a much more affordable price! I have yet to unearth all the possibilities and benefits of this magical oil, but I&#x27;m not finished looking and/or trying them all out! A little goes a long way without leaving an oily feeling, just softness. Apply it to your problem skin, hair and nails, and VOILA.... damage repaired, it IS that easy! But don&#x27;t just take my word for it, if you are hesitant, take a little time, do a little research, then run back here and buy this!!! Here&#x27;s to a more youthful you!</li>
    <li> A few drops of this rosehip oil mixed with my moisturizer did wonders for my skin.  It&#x27;s a big bottle too, so, should last a long time.  I&#x27;m very happy that my recent pictures (using same old iphone camera) shows obviously diminished fine lines and wrinkles vs. older pictures.  It seems to help with my adult acne issue as well.  Wish I had discovered this earlier.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin with frequent breakouts.  I read that using harsh acne products make your face more oily leading to more breakouts.  So now I make sure that after I wash my face, I pat it dry and I put a free drops of this all over.  It looks greasy for about 2 minutes and then in absorbs right in.  My breakouts have decreased significantly and my face has a glow I never had before.  It doesn&#x27;t smell amazing but it just means that it has no added ingredients just to make it smell good.  Also, I love that a small bottle lasts me almost 3 months.  Great affordable alternative to expensive moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The Rosehip Oil made my face very moisturized, dewy and glowy! The smell goes away in minutes and is not a concern of mine.  I will re-order from this company when my supply runs out.</li>
    <li> This is my second time that bought this product, I am very happy, because the organic Rosehip is excellent for my skin, I use this product combined with other oil and they work well!!!!</li>
    <li> I hate to say this but this is a terrible product.  I smells just like fish oil.  I cannot believe that is 100 percent rosehip oil.  I have used rosehip before unlike this product.  I guess I can cook with it.  It does not  go into skin just stays on the surface.  Keep your money and try another product.</li>
    <li> Reduced fine lines on my forehead in just a few days.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I apply mixture of this product with Helichrysum, Neroli, Sage, Lavender &amp; Hazonut essential oils to a huge mean looking scar on my knee which went through 3 surgeries this year.  I am very happy to see the scar is much lighter in color and is continue fading away.  I am very grateful to people who post the remedy on internet and very happy with this product - Thank You !!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I got hives all over my face, I think I am too sensitive because I just stopped taking antihistamines, one month ago, I am going to give it another chance in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> At first I put it aside after one week use, because it&#x27;s too greasy for me. But just half month ago I apply it on my face again and the result is amazing. My face feels so soft and smoother than before. I have acne-prone skin and this product really helps me eliminate the acne marks and scars on my face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. High quality as described. Arrived on time with extra care in packaging to ensure safety of product! Works great! I have very sensitive skin and get dermatitis very easily. This has only helped and leaves my skin very soft. Oil soaks right in. Very manageable and easy to use! Also great for hair! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the vitamin c serum and hyaluronic  acid by the same company. It is a great company with great service and follow up. I am using as instructed as a moisturizer. I am a bit puzzled by the reviews. It IS greasy. It DOES stain if  it gets on sheets etc. Probably comes out but one reviewer claims to have dropped it on white Berber carpet and it left no stain. It shows on my sheet. It does absorb and the smell is not at all unpleasant.  But it takes awhile to absorb.  Keep your hair back!  Also. NO reduction in any scars one  reviewer claimed it practically erased a scar on her husbands arm overnight. I&#x27;ve been putting it on a couple of scars on my face for weeks. No change. Good moisturizer and I feel good about natural ingredients. No miracles here.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this oil twice and love it.  It actually helped heal a cracked nail that I had had for years and was told that it could never be repaired.  However, the recent order from this company leaves me with a question about safety and security and customer service with this company.  Below is the review I have sent on the three other products I purchased when I purchased the second order of the oil:&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this product, I was offered a discount to purchase 4 items from the company instead of 1.  I chose the &amp;#34;Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid for your face,&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Dead Sea Mud Mask.&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Low and High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Organic Rosehip Oil.&amp;#34;  Previously I had purchased the Rosehip Oil in 1 oz. and loved it, and this time I purchased it in the 4 oz. size.  Unlike the first order, each of these bottles came with a card that reads; &amp;#34;Caution, Do NOT (capital letters) use this product without obtaining and reading the book..&amp;#34; .and they list a web-site to get the book.  I have tried to get the book, have had friends try to get the book and written the company TWICE to request help.  They have never responded.  However, they have sent me several requests to write a positive review for their product.  While I will give the Rosehip oil 5 stars (Note: the large bottle comes with a caution to keep the product in a box in the cupboard that the small bottle does not contain) I cannot give a good review on the other products because 1) it appears the company is more concerned about getting product reviews and thus more orders than they are for the safety of their buyer 2) I want to know about the product and how to use it properly not only for personal safety, but also to answer the question of am I wasting my money on this product, which might be good, by simply not using it or using it incorrectly 3) If the products come with a warning common sense says no one should buy the product untilthey understand the warning.  The entire thing begs the question: why is the book not simply shipped with the order?  Explain how to use the product.  Can the product go close to the eyes?  Can (and should) the two Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s be used together?  Should the 1 oz. of the oil be kept in a dark cupboard too?  Even more questions come to mind, but I am not getting any answers from the company.  Poor customer service.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this oil.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, no oily feeling.  Has really helped my hands feel softer and look younger.  I have also used it on my face and after only 1 week notice some of the fine lines around my eyes fading.  I would recommend this product  highly.  It is organic, so that&#x27;s a plus.  Definitely give it a try if you have been on the fence about it.  I received this product to try in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used this brand..love it!  I have dry skin in the fall and winter time on my face and the first time I used this product my skin felt soft and hydrated. From the time of purchase I received it in a timely manner. Plus a really nice email from the compamies CEO thanking me for the purchase and that if I had any questions to feel free to contact her. Bottom line, product is great as well as the service.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a month. I mix it with lotion and I actually notice a big difference.</li>
    <li> i hate it. and i&#x27;ve nvr had to do a rtn and im not sure how. &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> I was contacted by VoilaVe to try out some of their natural products. I tried their 100% Argan Oil and this, the Organic Rosehip Oil.Their Rosehip Oil comes in a huge 4 oz bottle with a squirt top. A little goes a very long way. It is made only of Certified Rosehip Oil and nothing else. It is made and bottled in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;  Rosehip Oil is a great moisturizer. It is great to use in the bath, as a moisturizer for your hair, nails, skin, and face. It is especially good for problem areas such as eczema, psoriasis, scars, etc. As with most oils a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;  I loved this Rosehip Oil. It made any dry spots and old scars fade away very quickly. It plumps up any fine lines and wrinkles you may have and gives you a nice glowing appearance. I found myself not having to even wear makeup with it on my face as it really makes your skin radiant.&lt;br /&gt;  At this price you just cannot beat all the great things about it. You can kiss your beauty item clutter good bye and just have one bottle of Rosehip Oil and you have everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;  VoilaVe really stands by their products and offers money back guarantees. They even have a website on the bottle with great beauty tips!&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives VoilaVe&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil 5 Stars! This is definitely something I plan on keeping in my beauty regime. It is a must have for everyone of all ages and is so easy to use!</li>
    <li> I like to use this on my face, but just one pump, cuz it is oil after all.&lt;br /&gt;Has an orangish hue that I like, as I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  I use it as an undercoat to facial lotion.  Been using daily for about a month and not really much change in wrinkles, although with the addition of this product my face is a bit oily...and if my hair gets in it, looks greasy - so beware!&lt;br /&gt;It is Winter in Wisconsin, so I&#x27;ll keep using it for extra moisture.</li>
    <li> From my wife: I love, love the rose hip oil. We have recently moved to the desert from the tropics and my skin is extremely dry. I am also now in menopause so my skin is dry from that as well. I find the Rosehip oil to to deeply nourishing. I use it morning and night and my skin is so soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much that we have ordered two of the large bottles in the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> Ive added this to my face regiment, love it</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY - IS NOT AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE - VERY DISAPPOINTED.  NOT LIKE ARGAN OIL AT ALL - JUNK!</li>
    <li> I been using this Voilave Rosehip oil and it works  in my face do you know when u gonna have this product again?</li>
    <li> I bought this oil hopeful that it would help my husband who is plagued by a rash that comes and goes around 3 times a year.  We had been using plantain and it helped with this rose hip oil the horrible itching disappears upon contact.  We have been using it for 3 days and although the rash is not much improved he is much more comfortable.  Steroids have had no effect on this rash whatever it is and we were at our wits end.  Drs have been no help.  This stuff is making life bearable.  I&#x27;m also using the oil on my face also and it absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling very soft.  I&#x27;ll update later again to let you know how it&#x27;s going.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my skin and hair.  Especially for my face, I have seen a bigger difference in my skin (younger looking) then any commerical skin product on the market that I have used previously.  And I am really glad they came out with the 4oz size.</li>
    <li> Love these products !</li>
    <li> Not going back to previous brands! Bought two small bottles. Mixed one with several favorite anti-aging essential oils, left one as is. Am using both applications with VERY pleasing results. My skin drinks this in during our brutal winters. Skin looks much smoother. Sun spots are fading - yea!</li>
    <li> I have heard great things about rose hip oil and I&#x27;m excited to try it out! Been using it for a week now and so far I like it. Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s making any difference in the anti aging process, but it&#x27;s been a great moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried an eye cream on my eyes and it actually made me break out because it was too thick and clogged the pores around my eyebrows. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant for me, but it does dissipate after a while, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now nearly finished my bottle an have been very happy with the results! It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. It absorbs right in! excited to get another bottle and try some other products!</li>
    <li> I really like it. Thanks !!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is light and thoroughly moisturizes my dry, sensitive skin.  It does not smell like roses, and one might be a little put off by the toasted seed scent (preferable to roses though!).  You should try it.</li>
    <li> Be careful it may not be what the bottle said!</li>
    <li> First of all, i got an follow up email from the seller, on the same day the product delivered, which including the information about weather I got my item yet; how to store the oil, and some tips about the oil -the smell. it&#x27;s really nice of them to do so. It&#x27;s my first time using rosehip oil, and didn&#x27;t know it doesn&#x27;t smell like rose until I read the email. It has a fishy smell (to me) which dissipates in 30 seconds to a minute. I just tried it out for a few day, will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> this is a Wonderful moisturizer,</li>
    <li> Great applicator to all my essential oils -</li>
