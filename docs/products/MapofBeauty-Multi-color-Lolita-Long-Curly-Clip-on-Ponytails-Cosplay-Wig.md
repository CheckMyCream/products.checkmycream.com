      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This wig is super cute!</li>
      <li>It was so full and soft and I loved it!</li>
      <li>for the price you get an amazing amount of soft hair.</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured, soft texture, and nice curls.</li>
      <li>In addition, the bangs are too long unless you have the forehead , say, some kind of ape, and you can&#x27;t cut it easily because the actual hair used to make this is very cheap.</li>
      <li>The bangs are long but it&#x27;s nice because you can cut them to how you&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>It arrived tangle free and very soft.</li>
      <li>Exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>; it&#x27;s very versatile!  </li>
      <li>This wig is pretty thick too, so if you really needed to salvage wefts from it later it would be an excellent candidate.  </li>

      <li>It wasnt heavy very cute</li>
      <li>I will be buying a new one soon !!</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really separate or part the colors because of the way the hair fibers are threaded- in a circular  fashion from the crown.</li>
      <li>Fits really well, doesn&#x27;t take to hair dye though.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig for a costume, and it&#x27;s really nice; it isn&#x27;t shiny or too heavy.  </li>
      <li>Very thick hair perfect when using odd colors.</li>
      <li>I wore it with a black and white dress and it matched so nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft and comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;Cruella &amp; Zacorra cosplays</li>
      <li>The only issue is keeping the two pony tails straight.</li>
      <li>I decided to straighten it and it still is soft,</li>
      <li>completely brushable.</li>
      <li>so I can wear the wig with none, one, both, or move the pigtails to another wig completely</li>
      <li>The night I wore it was extremely hot (at a concert) and to my surprise there was minimal tangles at the end of the night.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected to get.</li>
      <li>thick smooth hair.</li>
      <li>but this type of wig tangles really easy soooo not very impressed</li>
      <li>This wig is a little thin, but very cute overall.</li>

    <li> I bought this wig for a costume, and it&#x27;s really nice; it isn&#x27;t shiny or too heavy.  I like how the pigtails are detachable so I can wear the wig with none, one, both, or move the pigtails to another wig completely; it&#x27;s very versatile!
