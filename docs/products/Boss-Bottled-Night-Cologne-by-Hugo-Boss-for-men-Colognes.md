    <li> Love this cologne! My body chemistry usually absorbs a cologne quickly....after a few hours the scent is gone. Not so with Hugo Boss! A somewhat heavier scent that lasts. Have received numerous compliments....LOL...the most recent was after trying on a sweater. As the sales person was folding it up she asked what the cologne was and complemented the scent. My wife likes it too. :)</li>

    <li> Great cologne and good price. A lot cheaper than what they charge at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good because it is a cologne.</li>
