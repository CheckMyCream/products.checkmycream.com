      <li>guess there is a cost in trying to stay healthy, the more consumers that demand healthier products</li>
      <li>Taste is ok, works well, like the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love the mouth washes though</li>
      <li>Never in my life have i had cavity free mouth!</li>

      <li>Did nothing for my teeth or gums, but tasted ok.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>It has been on the market since the 1970s and is better than many of the newer items out there.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is okay.</li>
      <li>Combined with the rinse and cleanse, my hygienist says my gums are healthy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>PerioBrite leaves it all feeling smooth and healthy for many hours, and it&#x27;s better at whitening than brands that claim whitening as a result.</li>
      <li>All the drugstore brands seem to rely more on strong mint</li>
      <li>Healthy, really healthy and free of toxic chemicals&lt;</li>
      <li>I have seen a huge improvement, and use nothing else but Perio products. :-)</li>
      <li>Liked at first.</li>
      <li>I have tried the Cool Mint as well and both have a nice, fresh zing taste to them.</li>
      <li>Also, I massage my gums with this after I brush and then rinse and use Nature&#x27;s Answer Periwash Alcohol Free</li>
      <li>smooth both in feel and flavor...</li>
      <li>I think it tastes fantastic</li>
      <li>Makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
      <li>even though my teeth were really clean.</li>
      <li>The ingredients list is clean.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel just as clean as when I get a cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Teeth feel clean when rubbing tongue over them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still ambivalent about the vegetable glycerin that&#x27;s in it (as it&#x27;s supposed to coat the teeth), but it&#x27;s better than most natural toothpaste products, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The dentist said my teeth are so clean.</li>
      <li>Leaves mouth refreshed and feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>is the full list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Find your favorite flavor and use this daily for better oral health.</li>
      <li>I love everything about PerioBrite products: natural ingredients, no sodium laurel sulfate or fluoride, and the fresh feeling and smooth teeth.  </li>
      <li>teeth are just from the dentist clean  with no weird aftertaste.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural, healthy alternative</li>
      <li>It worked far better than OraJel.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>I believe natural is better.</li>
      <li>Not as good as what the other reviews say in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>This product has done what no other has been able to in years.</li>
      <li>This is by far the healthiest toothpaste I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the toxics and carcinogens that most manufactures put on similar products (and sadly most people have not idea of).</li>
      <li>This toothpaste cleans really good due to terrific ingredients including many good essential oils, some baking soda (does not over power), and no harsh chemicals.  </li>
      <li>The baking soda really helps plus I love it that all the ingredients are natural.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a really natural toothpaste, it&#x27;s good but for me, I don&#x27;t mind having a foaming agent so I will go back to Himalaya toothpaste with no fluoride .</li>
      <li>I am not a big mint fan, but love this Cinnamon flavor.</li>
      <li>Really like!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe a more solid texture and a lower price</li>
      <li>Actually need more Waterpik time for plaque buildup.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is you should make sure to snap it shut after use otherwise it can leak a bit.</li>
      <li>I had beginning stages of periodontal disease but after consistently using this with the PerioRInse</li>
      <li>Freshens breath and cleans teeth without overkill minty flavor of most big name brands.</li>
      <li>Other than that I love the stuff!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like natural flavors, or enjoy going to the dentist all the time, stick with the drug store brands.</li>
      <li>The Cinnamon flavor is the hardest to find and I am glad to see Amazon finally carrying it.</li>
      <li>I love the mouthwash version and that&#x27;s why I wanted to try this toothpaste, but overall it feels like you&#x27;re brushing with liquid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using tom&#x27;s for a long time, which I love.</li>
      <li>This is the first toothpaste that has really helped my teeth and gums as a whole.</li>
      <li>It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I get a clean feeling like I do with other organic or flouride free brands that I use.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste is great, I don&#x27;t like weak sugary toothpastes</li>
      <li>I also really like the taste.</li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>only sulfate and flouride free toothpaste out there in the market.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No fluoride, alcohol, or harsh chemicals. Check it out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Phtyoplenolin Bio-Chelated Extracts of: Calendula Flowers, Chamomile Flowers, Echinacea Tops, Gotu Kola Whole Herb, Prickly Ash Bark, Olive Leaf, Grapefruit Seed, Black Walnut Green Hulls, Green Tea Leaf, Essential Oils of: Peppermint, Oregano, Lavender, Clove, Eucalyptus &amp; Thyme, Cinnamon Bark, Bio-Saponins [Yucca spp, Quillaia (Quillaia saponaria) Bark, Sarsaparilla Root, Wild Yam Root], Folic Acid, Co-Enzyme Q10, Sodium Bicarbonate, Xanthan Gum, , Chlorophyll, L-Lysines, Xylitol, Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;Base Ingredients: Vegetable Glycerin, Purified Water, Calcium Carbonate, Silica.&lt;br /&gt;Free of preservatives, Fluoride, Alcohol, Synthetic Solvents, Sodium-Lauryl-Sulfate, Artificial Sweeteners, Colors and Dyes.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothpaste because I wanted something natural that was cinnamon flavored.  This toothpaste is just weird, weird color, and weird texture (runny).  It doesn&#x27;t taste horrible, but I like that it was all natural, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> only sulfate and flouride free toothpaste out there in the market.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste (and the mouthwash) for two or three years now. It seems to do a great job of cleaning my teeth and gums...and they seem to stay plaque free most of the day. I also really like the taste. During a dental visit about 1.5 years ago, the hygienist told me that my teeth were amazingly plaque free. She asked me if I had been doing anything different, and I mentioned my toothpaste. I also mentioned it to my dentist, who seemed to still want me to use some type of fluoride (which bugged me A LOT) even though my teeth were really clean. The xylitol actually serves as a enamel strengthener (which many dentists still don&#x27;t agree on), so I have been swishing with liquefied xylitol crystals after I brush--and a few minutes after I rinse my mouth with the mouthwash--to improve the health of my mouth. I wanted to simply add the xylitol directly to my toothpaste, but I&#x27;m afraid that my cat may get into it, as she likes to jump on the bathroom counter *LOL* Really like! I&#x27;m still ambivalent about the vegetable glycerin that&#x27;s in it (as it&#x27;s supposed to coat the teeth), but it&#x27;s better than most natural toothpaste products, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Been using this now for about a year and have no complaints. It&#x27;s refreshing, cleans well, and is a great price. (and all natural of course!) The only drawback is you should make sure to snap it shut after use otherwise it can leak a bit. It doesn&#x27;t have all the filler junk regular toothpaste has to keep it foamy/dense so it will leak a bit. Other than that I love the stuff!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my teeth or gums, but tasted ok. Went back to Toms toothpaste.</li>
    <li> teeth are just from the dentist clean  with no weird aftertaste.  we&#x27;ll see how the dentist appointment goes..  no tartar build up as far as i can tell yet</li>
    <li> I like the description of this and also some of the reviews.  I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 wks., and I do like it.  It&#x27;s a softer paste than&lt;br /&gt;most.  I keep the tube in  standing position, because unless you cap it right away, it tends to slowly &#x27;ooze&#x27; out;  that being said, it drips off the toothbrush very soon after putting it on.  It has bit of &#x27;gritty&#x27; feel to it....especially if a bit has dropped in sink and you use your finger to get it up.  But I like it and feel it does a good job of cleaning.  I&#x27;ll be able to tell when I go back for my next cleaning.  Overall,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste with the least amount of mystery ingredients compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands such as &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;Tom&#x27;s&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Jason&amp;#34; and such, enough said.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste I have ever used....smooth both in feel and flavor...</li>
    <li> If you can love a toothpaste, this is it!  Much different than any other toothpaste, I&#x27;ve ever had.  If you&#x27;re going for taste, this isn&#x27;t it.  If you want results:  try it, you&#x27;ll like it...</li>
    <li> Never experienced sensitive teeth until using this toothpaste. Switched back to crest and no more sensitivity.. EEkk&lt;br /&gt;I do like the periorub though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a change I had to get use to but this toothpaste is amazing. Noticed encouraging results after two days along with the mouthwash. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the healthiest toothpaste I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the toxics and carcinogens that most manufactures put on similar products (and sadly most people have not idea of). No fluoride, no titanium dioxide, no Red 40, no carrageenan, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the product isn&#x27;t perfect yet, there is room for improvement. Here the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Healthy, really healthy and free of toxic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;- Good taste, my entire family is using the &amp;#34;Cinnamint&amp;#34; and we are happy including my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The texture requires improvement. Its texture is too close to liquid.&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive, at $7/4oz is overpriced compared to the toxic Colgate at $4/7oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess there is a cost in trying to stay healthy, the more consumers that demand healthier products, the more manufacturers will produce them and therefore costs will go down, same as organic food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description / picture in Amazon doesn&#x27;t provide the details of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the full list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Phtyoplenolin Bio-Chelated Extracts of: Calendula Flowers, Chamomile Flowers, Echinacea Tops, Gotu Kola Whole Herb, Prickly Ash Bark, Olive Leaf, Grapefruit Seed, Black Walnut Green Hulls, Green Tea Leaf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential Oils of: Peppermint, Oregano, Lavender, Clove, Eucalyptus &amp; Thyme, Cinnamon Bark, Bio-Saponins [Yucca spp, Quillaia (Quillaia saponaria) Bark, Sarsaparilla Root, Wild Yam Root], Folic Acid, Co-Enzyme Q10, Sodium Bicarbonate, Xanthan Gum, , Chlorophyll, L-Lysines, Xylitol, Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base Ingredients: Vegetable Glycerin, Purified Water, Calcium Carbonate, Silica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free of preservatives: Fluoride, Alcohol, Synthetic Solvents, Sodium-Lauryl-Sulfate, Artificial Sweeteners, Colors and Dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a more solid texture and a lower price and I&#x27;ll give them the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, 4 will do it for all the health emphasis.the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, 4 will do it for all the health emphasis.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon flavor in this is not enough to even be noticeable. I also found that the color &amp; consistency isn&#x27;t the same as regular PerioBrite; I have to use twice as much to brush my whole mouth, usually in two separate applications. I&#x27;ll just stick with the regular mint from now on.</li>
    <li> I like the fact of the natural toothpaste with the right ingredients to prevent gum disease.  It is not too foamy either.</li>
    <li> Wonderful find.  Leaves mouth refreshed and feeling clean.  Teeth feel clean when rubbing tongue over them.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!  My teeth feel just as clean as when I get a cleaning.  The baking soda really helps plus I love it that all the ingredients are natural.  The mouthwash is really great too!  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great, I don&#x27;t like weak sugary toothpastes, I want cleansing power I can feel, not a softy toothpaste with empty promises to do whitening, plaque removal and scrubbing manic brushes on my morsels. This one delivers... And thank god for something other than mint!!!!</li>
    <li> I could only use a little bit of it because it was damaged but the taste was just so different, and not in a good way, from the cool mint.  I swear by the benefits of PerioBrite though!!  I had beginning stages of periodontal disease but after consistently using this with the PerioRInse I have seen a huge improvement, and use nothing else but Perio products. :-)</li>
    <li> Since I have Gingivitis, it seems that my teeth and gums are sensitive so I decided to try the line of Nature&#x27;s Answer including this toothpaste. What a huge difference it has made on my teeth and gums! When I brush, my teeth and gums feel soothed and just better. Before I used this, sometimes, my gums would bleed when I brushed. Since using this,the bleeding has stopped. And on my gums, the redness is gone, now they are becoming PINK. Also, I massage my gums with this after I brush and then rinse and use Nature&#x27;s Answer Periwash Alcohol Free Mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;And day by day, I am noticing the difference in the health of my gums, teeth and the way they feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive gums or teeth or gum problems, you may want to give this a try. For me, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Best Tooth paste ever I don&#x27;t buy any other ..will never regret buying it</li>
    <li> PerioBrite is the Best of the Best.. a very delicious Cream.. NO FLUORIDE.. and only natural Ingredients. I recommend this for for you cleansing a whitening purpose without put yourself in danger by using regular tooth creams. Thanks.</li>
    <li> keeps my teeth white without the fluoride</li>
    <li> Great Taste, mouth feels clean and with healthy stuff too to help gums! Thanks</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! Seems plaque stays away longer and it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I really liked the flavor and consistency.  The ingredients list is clean.  It does not gunk up my sink like some other clay-based natural toothpastes do, and it is cheaper than the all natural toothpaste I normally buy.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Liked at first. On second tube. Even, purchased the rinse. But have been experiencing new sensitivity. Calmed that by decreasing use to once a day. Teeth aren&#x27;t any cleaner. Actually need more Waterpik time for plaque buildup.</li>
    <li> Not as good as what the other reviews say in my opinion.  I love the mouth washes though and that&#x27;s why I tried this toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve tried others that are close to it like a Redmond&#x27;s clay toothpaste and they seem about the same.  I don&#x27;t feel like I get a clean feeling like I do with other organic or flouride free brands that I use.  The label says a little goes a long way but I think I had to use more just to feel like I actually had something in my mouth to brush with.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Good ingredients. Very pleased. I use this as an alternate to the Vita-Myr toothpaste and neem toothpaste that I use. I also use the PerioWash mouthwash. Very good products.</li>
    <li> Fussy daughter will use this...only paste without fluoride she likes. Taste is ok, works well, like the ingredients. The end.</li>
    <li> Use a pea-size amount and don&#x27;t expect lots of foam&lt;br /&gt;like you get with Colgate. Like PerioWash it has no&lt;br /&gt;harmful ingredients. Like PerioWash use it two to&lt;br /&gt;seven times a week. The other times you can use&lt;br /&gt;Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda and other natural&lt;br /&gt;products.</li>
    <li> This is a great all natural tooth paste especially if your gums are weak, combine this with the Nature&#x27;s Answer Periowash Alcohol-free Mouthwash. If you are like me who brushes his teeth after every major meal (3 times a day) this should be your tooth paste as this doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals that could damage your teeth or gum tissue in the long run.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  I was looking for a natural, healthy alternative and this is it...I have been using it now for several months and now if I run out and I have to use regular toothpaste,  it taste like soap to me....anyway the only con is the price...sometimes it&#x27;s good and sometimes it&#x27;s a bit overpriced and I can get it at my local store for less.  Overall, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural. No fluoride or sodium laurel sulfate.  This paste is running, brown and doesn&#x27;t foam. The freshness after brush doesn&#x27;t last and I found my breath was bad after a couple hours. I gave it 4 stars because of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is okay. I think it tastes fantastic but unfortunately it is way too runny. I love the mouthwash version and that&#x27;s why I wanted to try this toothpaste, but overall it feels like you&#x27;re brushing with liquid. If you&#x27;re looking for a really natural toothpaste, it&#x27;s good but for me, I don&#x27;t mind having a foaming agent so I will go back to Himalaya toothpaste with no fluoride .</li>
    <li> This product has done what no other has been able to in years. My mouth feels normal. All the drugstore brands seem to rely more on strong mint and I don&#x27;t know what else, but after the flavor wore off, my mouth always felt like something was brewing. PerioBrite leaves it all feeling smooth and healthy for many hours, and it&#x27;s better at whitening than brands that claim whitening as a result. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love everything about PerioBrite products: natural ingredients, no sodium laurel sulfate or fluoride, and the fresh feeling and smooth teeth.  Helps my gums, too.  Now that I&#x27;ve found these products, I am a believer!  If you don&#x27;t like natural flavors, or enjoy going to the dentist all the time, stick with the drug store brands.</li>
    <li> My brother just introduced me to this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using tom&#x27;s for a long time, which I love. But have noticed an increase in whiteness in my teeth after using for 2 weeks. My brother claims compliments on his white teeth too.</li>
    <li> Taste is good.  Cleaning seems satisfactory.  I actually like toothpastes that have a bit of foaming action as it helps keep the toothpaste where I put it once I begin brushing.  Add that and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> 2 years in a row with no cavities!! The dentist said my teeth are so clean. Never in my life have i had cavity free mouth! I say no to flouride and yes to periobrite and its a miracle!  The flavor is different from regular chemical filled toothpaste but once you use it twice you are completely used to the taste and begin to like it! Its much much much tastier than other all natural toothpastes i have tried. It works great, mouth feels so clean.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste better than any of the other non-fluoride ones, and you only need a pea-sized amount..  I just wished it came in a larger container and it was a little thicker (to stay on the tooth brush better).</li>
    <li> Wow, I am really impressed.  This toothpaste cleans really good due to terrific ingredients including many good essential oils, some baking soda (does not over power), and no harsh chemicals.  My mouth definitely feels healthier.  All natural color! Love it!</li>
    <li> Combined with the rinse and cleanse, my hygienist says my gums are healthy.</li>
    <li> This is very good toothpaste. It has a slightly different consistency then regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have tried several toothpastes for sensitivity, including Sensodyne. Most of the over the counter products have sodium laurel sulfate and other additives. While Sensodyne worked for a while, it didn&#x27;t improve my gum health. I also tried Dr. Katz&#x27; PerioTherapy which was okay for a while. After some soreness in my gums (that the PerioTherapy was supposed to have helped with) I tried PeriRub for tooth pain. It worked far better than OraJel. The insert in the package said that it was more effective combined with PeriBrite toothpaste and PeriWash. While using a Dr. Collins toothbrush (if you have sensitive teeth, this brush is extremely gentle) I tried the rub, toothpaste and rinse. I have not had any soreness or sensitivity in nearly 3 months of regular use! PerioBrite comes in several flavors, two mints and this Cinnamon flavor. I am not a big mint fan, but love this Cinnamon flavor. It has a great herbal formulation that includes CoQ10 (healthy for our bodies, and our mouths), Folic Acid, Oregano, Cinnamon and Clove. It naturally whitens, helps dry mouth and has no preservatives, alcohol, sweeteners and dyes. I have tried the Cool Mint as well and both have a nice, fresh zing taste to them. It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount. I believe natural is better. I don&#x27;t miss all the additives and sweeteners. Even Tom&#x27;s of Maine, a \\&quot;natural toothpaste\\&quot; still adds sodium laurel sulfate. This is the first toothpaste that has really helped my teeth and gums as a whole. The Cinnamon flavor is the hardest to find and I am glad to see Amazon finally carrying it. PerioBrite in any flavor is the best choice for a natural toothpaste that will improve your oral health. It has been on the market since the 1970s and is better than many of the newer items out there. Find your favorite flavor and use this daily for better oral health.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has an odd taste that I do not like. I like mint and I like cinnamon but this combo simply does not work for me. In addition, the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; is very runny.</li>
    <li> Good taste and texture. Freshens breath and cleans teeth without overkill minty flavor of most big name brands. Definitely recommend to those looking for a natural toothpaste.</li>
