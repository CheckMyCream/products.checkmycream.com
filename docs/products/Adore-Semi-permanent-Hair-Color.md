      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Best fun hair colors available, and the cheapest!</li>
      <li>I liked the fact it didn&#x27;t bleed with every wash though.</li>
      <li>This product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t stain everything your hair touches.</li>
      <li>I liked this dye in just about every way.</li>
      <li>It was too pinkish for my liking as I had wanted a royal purple kind of color</li>
      <li>I have since had my hair professionally bleached and dyed an awesome shade of purple, and will use Purple Rage to do a touch up when needed.</li>
      <li>It is a lovely colour, but its not purple, not even slightest bit.</li>
      <li>I will try mixing the two to get more of a violet color, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
      <li>I would have given a five star rating had the color swatch been a better representation.</li>
      <li>Most off the people once here that wrote reviews probably washed their hair too often,</li>
      <li>All were gorgeous when I first put them on.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why this dye has so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>And I put it over strong pink, and it dyed perfectly.</li>
      <li>The color is true and it stays put!</li>
      <li>Dont trust this brand if you want TRUE colors, you get what you pay for!</li>
      <li>but it washed easily off my bathtub and tiles.</li>
      <li>it smells yummy and easily comes off skin with alcohol but stained a cabinet</li>
      <li>Through all that, it came out strong.</li>
      <li>The brand produces a great product -- easy to use, easy to clean up, deep long-lasting color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>That is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>Wanted a deep purple-blue color and it turned out really great.</li>
      <li>Adore is amazing and worked really well with my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy this product,</li>
      <li>Super vibrant, good coverage, would buy again</li>
      <li>It looks as good as the professional job I had done.</li>
      <li>The color is  a beautiful deep violet and blended beautifully with my dark hair.  </li>
      <li>My original color was light pink/blondish</li>
      <li>The colors fade fairly quickly, but using this stuff is so easy and leaves hair so nice and soft</li>
      <li>This was just the right color!  </li>
      <li>for me it was more vibrant and lasted longer than color ion!</li>
      <li>oh how I needed you to actually be true to your color-----</li>
      <li>It also is much more vibrant and lasts longer without fading.  </li>
      <li>Definitely buying more!</li>
      <li>A lot more blue than I was expecting, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It looks good but its not very purple.</li>
      <li>It looks black indoors or from far away but taking photos with flash or being in the sunlight and all you see is this gorgeous purple color!</li>
      <li>This is the first time trying this brand</li>
      <li>Then, I washed it out in the shower, in HOT HOT water.</li>
      <li>I was just dying the underside of my hair, not bleaching first.</li>
      <li>be prepared to have to bleach first.</li>
      <li>The purple rage was a bright vibrant pink based purple!</li>
      <li>The colors blend well together and whichever you put on your hair first shows up the strongest, so it&#x27;s easy to get cool effects like hot pink tips which fade into purple higher up.</li>
      <li>, I decided to add some African Violet on top of the lighter purple at the next washing, it came out the dark rich royal, I think the violet of this color mixed beautifully with the pink of purple rage and made it more true purple than if I had used it alone.</li>
      <li>I really really tested it the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>African violet is my favorite color by far!!</li>
      <li>The application was easy enough but the end result my hair was a blueish color and not purple at all.  </li>
      <li>Colored hair requires a tremendous amount if work to maintain (especially red because the molecules are bigger than most Un natural hair dyes) but in the end it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Also, on my natural hair Hot Pink leaves a really nice, vibrant shine.</li>
      <li>Also, on my natural hair Hot Pink leaves a really nice, vibrant shine.</li>
      <li>By the third wash, it is a bright pink color.</li>
      <li>I am happy that I only did a small section first.</li>
      <li>I just go over it with pink when I know I won&#x27;t be touching it up for a while,</li>
      <li>Adore is much truer to the shade.  </li>
      <li>Clearly everyone in here did not know how to manage colorful hair.</li>
      <li>Its very fruity and conditioning...</li>
      <li>On the lighter parts of my hair, I can see African Violet would have looked like a nice shade of blue</li>
      <li>The color fades as you wash your hair, but it fades to a very lovely pastel hue (my hair is bleached under the color).&lt;br /&gt;To extend color, try using dry shampoo to stretch out times between actual washings.</li>
      <li>i put it on my clean, dry medium to dark brown hair and waited an hour in a warm room with it covered in plastic.</li>
      <li>I would stick to my trusty special effects for my purple next time.</li>
      <li>Its a cool blue if you want that sort of grey/blue.</li>
      <li>The only issue I had is that the African Violet is actually more of an indigo color.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a vibrant bluish purple, and it was not that.</li>
      <li>Also, I ignore the directions on the bottle; I apply the color to clean DRY hair and leave it on overnight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a great quality product, but that I bought the wrong color.</li>
      <li>so it was a medium light purple (It is practically black in the bottle, very pigmented.)</li>
      <li>Okay, so maybe it looked black just because I didn&#x27;t completely bleach my hair.</li>
      <li>I like this dye and it is like what people are saying in other reviews... leaves hair soft, easy to apply, etc...</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on color choice: the color chart is not very useful as many of the colors look the same.</li>
      <li>only thing is that African Violet is a VERY DARK COLOR, so if you&#x27;re looking for a bright purple this is not the color for you.</li>
      <li>used shampoos that contained sulfates (sulfates remove hair color), rinsed the dye way before it actually colored, or they washed their hair with hot water.</li>
      <li>I bought this dye thinking that it would be a better solution than going to the hair salon for a small touch up.  </li>
      <li>I recommend diluting it with a pink dye to get a dimensional color that is still a true purple.</li>
      <li>But no where near purple.</li>
      <li>When the dye was still in my hair it looked purple and the water when I rinsed was really purple, but the hair (under all sorts of lights) is definitely blue.  </li>
      <li>hair felt really soft</li>
      <li>Rinse really well to keep it from staining your pillow the first few nights.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The color is very dark purple and washes out to blue. It looks good but its not very purple.</li>
    <li> African violet is my favorite color by far!! The product Adore is amazing and worked really well with my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy this product, for me it was more vibrant and lasted longer than color ion!</li>
    <li> I do have virgin hair, yet other semi perms (like Manic Panic) will at least stick for a couple of weeks and then fade out slowly. I do have dirty blonde hair with light blonde natural highlights, and the darker colors especially will stick around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This washed out in two days. TWO. Completely unacceptable, but the price is so low that I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to use this, be prepared to have to bleach first.</li>
    <li> I like this dye and it is like what people are saying in other reviews... leaves hair soft, easy to apply, etc...&lt;br /&gt;but on my hair (naturally brown but bleached to a 8-9 on the lightness scale) it immediately turned blue. When the dye was still in my hair it looked purple and the water when I rinsed was really purple, but the hair (under all sorts of lights) is definitely blue.  Maybe I need to get a fushia and layer the colors.</li>
    <li> AFRICAN VIOLET, oh how I needed you to actually be true to your color----- my hair came out the color of denim jeans. dark blue, faded to light blue. No purple anywhere---- only looks purple in the bottle &amp; in the bowl. Change the name. Its a cool blue if you want that sort of grey/blue. But no where near purple. FAIL. Luckily I only did about 7 small sections, not my entire head. Dont trust this brand if you want TRUE colors, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I tried Manic Panic purple, and this Adore is much truer to the shade.  It also is much more vibrant and lasts longer without fading.  Rinse really well to keep it from staining your pillow the first few nights.  Definitely a winner in quality, color length, and ease of use.  The liquid is quite thick, so I didn&#x27;t have any problems keeping it from dripping.  Wrap Saran wrap around your hair and head while setting to keep the warmth.  Works beautifully!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I really really tested it the first time I used it. I put it in my dirty hair, which still had tons of hair spray from the night before. (It was actually hard). I diluted it in conditioner so it was a medium light purple (It is practically black in the bottle, very pigmented.) I only left it in for an hour. No heat. Then, I washed it out in the shower, in HOT HOT water. And scrubbed the heck out of it. And then, I conditioned it, and scrubbed the heck out of it again. Through all that, it came out strong. I haven&#x27;t bleached my hair in two months. And I put it over strong pink, and it dyed perfectly. The only spots that are still pinkish, are the spots where I left a ton of hairspray in. But even then, it dyed it a bit. When I use Splat, I have to leave it in for 3-4 hours. I have to wash it in the sink in cold to lukewarm water. And even then, it is a fuchsia. By the third wash, it is a bright pink color. This color is amazing, and I tested it to the limits. Best fun hair colors available, and the cheapest!</li>
    <li> A lot more blue than I was expecting, but that&#x27;s fine. Super vibrant, good coverage, would buy again</li>
    <li> I have naturally darkish red hair. I had previously used a temporary purple dye which had washed off to a light pink. I was just dying the underside of my hair, not bleaching first. I have no experience dying hair other than the very temporary dye which was my test to see if I could do this myself. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt really soft afterwards&lt;br /&gt;The dye was a manageable consistency (not drippy or hard to spread)&lt;br /&gt;The African Violet color was not at all what I expected, and I was extremely unhappy with the flat, ashy black I was left with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a great quality product, but that I bought the wrong color. On the lighter parts of my hair, I can see African Violet would have looked like a nice shade of blue had my hair been blonde or bleached. It just looks awful on darker hair. I would have given a five star rating had the color swatch been a better representation. I was looking for a vibrant bluish purple, and it was not that. In regular lighting at work, people thought I had dyed my hair black :/ I have since had my hair professionally bleached and dyed an awesome shade of purple, and will use Purple Rage to do a touch up when needed. If that goes poorly as well, I will modify my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Update * I now routinely use Purple Rage and Hot Pink together to achieve what I was after. It looks as good as the professional job I had done. The colors blend well together and whichever you put on your hair first shows up the strongest, so it&#x27;s easy to get cool effects like hot pink tips which fade into purple higher up. The colors fade fairly quickly, but using this stuff is so easy and leaves hair so nice and soft that I don&#x27;t mind doing it monthly. The only thing is, while the Hot Pink fades to a nice, soft blonde on bleached hair, the Purple Rage really goes a dirty shade of greenish-grey. I just go over it with pink when I know I won&#x27;t be touching it up for a while, that cuts the green out. Also, on my natural hair Hot Pink leaves a really nice, vibrant shine. Purple on my natural hair still just goes dark. African Violet on bleached hair still looks royal blue to me.green out. Also, on my natural hair Hot Pink leaves a really nice, vibrant shine. Purple on my natural hair still just goes dark. African Violet on bleached hair still looks royal blue to me.</li>
    <li> I put some in my conditioner and shampoo to tone down the brassiness in my hair.  I think it leaves my hair a little glossier, too.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to use it this way.  I have plenty left for future bottles.  If I feel like it, I might do a strand of hair to see what it does color wise.</li>
    <li> I liked this dye in just about every way. I used three colors, African Violet, Indigo Blue, and Aquamarine. All were gorgeous when I first put them on. Sadly, the purple faded to blue after a relatively short time (about a week), but otherwise I rate this product highly and would use it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Adore hair color for almost 6 months now. The brand produces a great product -- easy to use, easy to clean up, deep long-lasting color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Manic Panic, but I was disappointed with its longevity (or lack thereof). While my Manic Panic color would last about a week (even without washing my hair, the color would fade), my Adore color lasts about a month. The color fades as you wash your hair, but it fades to a very lovely pastel hue (my hair is bleached under the color).&lt;br /&gt;To extend color, try using dry shampoo to stretch out times between actual washings. Also, I ignore the directions on the bottle; I apply the color to clean DRY hair and leave it on overnight. I believe this helps with the intensity and duration of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on color choice: the color chart is not very useful as many of the colors look the same. I have used Purple Rage and African Violet. Purple Rage is a bright grape-purple color (think grape Kool Aid). African Violet is blue. Not even like a royal blue, it is straight up blue. If you&#x27;re looking for blue, then I would recommend it, but if you&#x27;re looking for purple, this is not even remotely violet. I will try mixing the two to get more of a violet color, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
    <li> This was just the right color!  A very bright purple with a blue base that fades to a bluish rather than pinkish color.  Sadly, it washed out of my hair faster than I would have liked.  But then I have unrealistic expectations on how long my color should last.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a beauty supply store but noticed reviews are hard to come by so decided to share my experience. I bought the color Purple Rage first and since my hair is black I bleached it first to a dark golden blonde color. The purple rage was a bright vibrant pink based purple! It was too pinkish for my liking as I had wanted a royal purple kind of color, I decided to add some African Violet on top of the lighter purple at the next washing, it came out the dark rich royal, I think the violet of this color mixed beautifully with the pink of purple rage and made it more true purple than if I had used it alone. It looks black indoors or from far away but taking photos with flash or being in the sunlight and all you see is this gorgeous purple color! I loved my purple hair I took very good care of the color because people said it washes out easily... Washed it only twice a week, used a bit of dye mixed in with the shampoo and conditioner, avoided harsh chemicals and kept it moisturized and now that my roots have grown in about 3 inches I want to go back to my black hair and this stuff is impossible to wash out now lol not that I&#x27;m complaining but if you care for your color fading won&#x27;t be a problem! This stuff is great it smells yummy and easily comes off skin with alcohol but stained a cabinet so be careful but it washed easily off my bathtub and tiles. Left my hair soft and conditioned too. Look up budgeting beauty how to dye your hair purple to see my results and pictures!</li>
    <li> Best bright hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair crazy colors for the past 10 years and I never been so disappointed in my life. The dye was very thin, almost like it was watered down. The color looked beautiful in the bottle, had a great smell. I applied it on my newly bleached hair and left in for a hour. I washed it out, the dye washed out with it. Half my hair did not take the dye.  I really don&#x27;t understand why this dye has so many good reviews. I would stick to my trusty special effects for my purple next time.</li>
    <li> It is a lovely colour, but its not purple, not even slightest bit. it is purple in the bottle but when you apply it to the hair (mine was bleached to almost white) it slowly turns into indigo blue. i&#x27;ll add hot pink to it next time to make it less blue and more purple. Adore Creative, please change the name and description of this colour!</li>
    <li> Wanted a deep purple-blue color and it turned out really great. My original color was light pink/blondish so I just stacked on this color since it&#x27;s a lot darker. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair prior like the instructions said, then I left it on for an hour. This is the first time trying this brand and I&#x27;m really happy with it! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t stain everything your hair touches. I only used it a couple of days ago so don&#x27;t know the longevity of it yet. very pleased with the fact that my neck, clothes and pillow aren&#x27;t stained. That is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product! Its very fruity and conditioning...only thing is that African Violet is a VERY DARK COLOR, so if you&#x27;re looking for a bright purple this is not the color for you. I recommend diluting it with a pink dye to get a dimensional color that is still a true purple.</li>
    <li> After trying Manic Panic, Special Effects, and Splat, I am very happy to have found Adore hair color. It is a fantastically pigmented dye that lasts much longer than any other brand I have tried. Adore does not damage my hair at all and deposits amazing color. The only issue I had is that the African Violet is actually more of an indigo color. It is still great though!</li>
    <li> Okay, so maybe it looked black just because I didn&#x27;t completely bleach my hair. Either way, I had black hair for an entire week. That&#x27;s another thing, this only lasted a week before it completely washed out of the top half of my head, leaving the bottom black with brown patches. I hated it! I have used other semi-temp dyes, and will not be using this brand again. Sorry!</li>
    <li> I have black/brown hair thats tough to color. After pre-lightening...this product worked beautifully. The color is true and it stays put! Love it! Will definitely purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I bought this dye thinking that it would be a better solution than going to the hair salon for a small touch up.  The application was easy enough but the end result my hair was a blueish color and not purple at all.  May just be my hair type.  I am happy that I only did a small section first.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I became obsessed with coloring my hair purple.  The color is  a beautiful deep violet and blended beautifully with my dark hair.  The color lasted a long time, I used a non sulfate shampoo and conditioner and washed my hair in cold water.  Very satisfied with this product, will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this adore hair dye!!! Most off the people once here that wrote reviews probably washed their hair too often, used shampoos that contained sulfates (sulfates remove hair color), rinsed the dye way before it actually colored, or they washed their hair with hot water. Washing your hair with warm/hot water opens up the hair follicles and releases the color. Colored hair requires a tremendous amount if work to maintain (especially red because the molecules are bigger than most Un natural hair dyes) but in the end it&#x27;s worth it. Someone also said that they mixed the hair dye with developer. Which you&#x27;re not suppose to do unless directed. You&#x27;re NEVER suppose to mix developer with hair dye if it&#x27;s not directed. This hair dye is great.  Clearly everyone in here did not know how to manage colorful hair. Do not take any if the other reviews seriously.</li>
    <li> Not very purple. Looks black until it starts to fade and then it gives a &amp;#34;hint&amp;#34; of purple. I liked the fact it didn&#x27;t bleed with every wash though. If only there was a product out there that was the vibrancy of Splat and the stayput power of Adore...</li>
    <li> This product was long lasting and very pigmented. I did not experience a lot of rub off with thus semi permanent color. If applied with out diluting with conditioner it was very dark until I washed my hair a few times. I got a ton of compliments and was very happy with this color. African Violet covered a multi tonal fade of blue, pink, purple, and teal. It is a blue based purple.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores to save my life, so I bought it off here. However, one bottle just isn&#x27;t enough for me. Definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I bought this dye to addto my shampoo to make a DIY purple toning shampoo for my bleached hair. It works just as well as any other specifically made as toning shampoo.</li>
    <li> Turned my bleached hair dark blue, then faded to a light grayish blue. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> i put it on my clean, dry medium to dark brown hair and waited an hour in a warm room with it covered in plastic. It came out exactly as I was hoping, a dark almost black with a purple tint.</li>
