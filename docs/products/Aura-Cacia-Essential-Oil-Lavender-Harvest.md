      <li>This essential oil blend smells delicious.</li>
      <li>I love the brand.</li>

      <li>I had individual oils and they were great.</li>

      <li>Decent value for a nicely blended, relaxing and uplifting oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not too sweet, and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put this in a body cream and also add Aura Cacia Neroli and Sweet Orange.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be sweet from the reviews</li>
      <li>This is one of the first &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; I have purchased, mainly because I was looking for rose oil.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with this Aura Cacia Heart Song Essential Oil Blend -----  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d describe it as a \\&quot;warm rose\\&quot; scent, with none of the sharpness that a lot of rose scents usually have.  </li>
      <li>I also mix in a little more rose oil.</li>
      <li>Buy individual oils and make your own mix.</li>
      <li>I heartily recommend this essential oil blend to those who like warm, floral scents for their aromatherapy.</li>
      <li>It is a clean, slightly heady scent, with lavender, rosewood, geranium, and rose undertones.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The top is nicely done too -- just enough comes out just fast enough.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>I love the Aura Cacia brand of essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use it (or most essential oils) on any sensitive-skin</li>
      <li>I use 5-6 drops on the pad which gives a strong enough scent throughout one room</li>
      <li>Its particularly luscious to use before sleeping!</li>
      <li>contains several rose aromas in one and less espensive than buying pure rose essential oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>One thing I found out was that if you combine the right essential oils you can quickly experience a feeling of euphoria.</li>
      <li>Very relaxing.  </li>
      <li>Shipping time was better than expected.</li>
      <li>A comforting and very pleasing scent indeed.</li>
      <li>If you pour too much it smells like floral floor detergent.</li>
      <li>By itself, not so much.</li>
      <li>I liked the smell from the beginning, and it grew on me a bit after I had it for a few weeks.</li>
      <li>This has rose oil in it, but also has several other oils that are very earthy and woodsy almost.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cozy scent that makes the house smell clean and well-loved!</li>
      <li>I play with lavendars, citrus and eucalyptus blends and this is one of my favorites so far!</li>
      <li>Heartsong has long been my favorite essential oil blend by Aura Cacia - I&#x27;ve been using it for almost ten years.</li>
      <li>There is rose in here, but to me, not remarkable.</li>
      <li>I have been buying Aura Cacia for nearly 30 years.</li>
      <li>My secret blend includes this Heart Song blend which is a mixture of lavender oil, rosewood oil, geranium oil and rose oil.</li>
      <li>Plus, the bottle was less than 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>Not only does this oil show up in a matter of days, I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I especially value that it is a natural essential oil.</li>

    <li> If you pour too much it smells like floral floor detergent. Mix it with more drops of another maybe more woody oil, and it gets stronger but balanced. By itself, not so much. Still, I prefer to make my own blends. If you have a grapefruit oil, pour a drop to the mix with this one and it&#x27;ll tone it down, creating a \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; scent.    I find this brand is a hit or miss. From this same brand, I like the Bergamot, Rose Absolue (perfect!), the Lavender (but only one drop), the Sweet Orange and the Grapefruit (perfect for balancing out scents that are too sweet).</li>
    <li> Not only does this oil show up in a matter of days, I can&#x27;t live without it! When used in my diffuser people just stand in place sniffing the air and wonder what that wonderful smell is.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have a perfume smell to it, just awakens your senses.</li>
    <li> Usually I&#x27;m a big fan of Aura Cacia essential oils but this one misses the mark.  It has a cheap perfumey smell.  Nothing healing or inspiring about this scent.  Plus, the bottle was less than 3/4 full.</li>
    <li> Heartsong has long been my favorite essential oil blend by Aura Cacia - I&#x27;ve been using it for almost ten years. It is a clean, slightly heady scent, with lavender, rosewood, geranium, and rose undertones. The scent is warm and inviting; it&#x27;s not cloying or overbearing.

    <li> Beautiful soft aroma. Perfect for your aroma diffuser.</li>
    <li> I like the mix of woodsy yet rosey scent that this gives. I find most scents relaxing and this is used in a plug in scent ball diffuser. I use 5-6 drops on the pad which gives a strong enough scent throughout one room and then it lingers for just the right amount of time to relax, perfect! I play with lavendars, citrus and eucalyptus blends and this is one of my favorites so far!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved the product! As usual, Aura Cacia provided a high-quality essential oil (This one, Heart Song, is one of my favorites and the local store was out of it). Shipping time was better than expected. Will definitely do business again!</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this oil. Just saying.</li>
    <li> The oil smells wonderful and the quality is good. It is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reading a book on bliss but in the meantime I&#x27;m making myself feel happy by mixing up my own scents with essential oils I love. One thing I found out was that if you combine the right essential oils you can quickly experience a feeling of euphoria. My secret blend includes this Heart Song blend which is a mixture of lavender oil, rosewood oil, geranium oil and rose oil. I put this in a body cream and also add Aura Cacia Neroli and Sweet Orange. I also mix in a little more rose oil. I&#x27;m telling you that when you put this combination of oils together it will make you feel really, really amazing. Also mix up some extra oil and put it on your wrists. So what are you waiting for...bliss awaits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I love it but I find the bottle almost impossible to open! It&#x27;s so frustrating. Can something be done about this?</li>
    <li> I notice the lavender and coriander mostly in Aura Cacia&#x27;s Heart Song, which gives it more of a spice scent. There is rose in here, but to me, not remarkable. I use it on the soles of my feet, as therapy. Not in love with it, and probably won&#x27;t purchase this blend again.</li>
    <li> A lovely scent that I am truly pleased to wear! I am not sure quite how to describe it other than what I have already read...woodsy rose. A comforting and very pleasing scent indeed.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Aura Cacia for nearly 30 years. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with any of the products I have used.</li>
    <li> This essential oil blend smells delicious. I used it for a roll on perfume for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> It was not my favorite scent. I thought it would be sweet from the reviews but it was not, not to me anyway. I will try their lavendar next time.</li>
    <li> It has a beautiful, sweet, romantic aroma.  I like it very much.  Good service service too.</li>
    <li> excellent condition, amazing product</li>
    <li> I love the scent!  Very relaxing.  I especially value that it is a natural essential oil.</li>
    <li> High quality blend of a few essential oils. It makes me happy. :)</li>
    <li> If your looking for a floral scent, this is it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this Aura Cacia Heart Song Essential Oil Blend -----  contains several rose aromas in one and less espensive than buying pure rose essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again, timely delivery, good packaging.</li>
    <li> delightful smell....hmmmm...</li>
    <li> Decent value for a nicely blended, relaxing and uplifting oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in an a tealight vaporizer, and it gives off a wonderful fragrance that is soothing and relaxing.  No smell of patchouli or anything similarly cloying.  Not too sweet, and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely my favorite oil blend.</li>
    <li> I purchased Energize, Inspiration, Tranquility and Heart Song by Aura Cacia. Now. I love the brand. I had individual oils and they were great. I had room mist with cinnamon and ylang ylang and it was great. I used all 4 of these mixes and they all smell the same: citrus/eucalyptus/rosemary. I mean it can wake you up allright, but definitely not gentle enough to inspire, create a romantic mood or promote peace. Not a fan. Buy individual oils and make your own mix. Avoid these.</li>
    <li> love the smell and the fact you can make into a room spray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. My mom likes it. I made her a body mist with it. It&#x27;s a little old ladylike for me.</li>
    <li> Wrapped in bubbled wrap, great care was put into the packing of this product. Lovely scent!</li>
    <li> I like this mix! I liked the smell from the beginning, and it grew on me a bit after I had it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful oil blend! Love the exhilarating smells of lavender, geranium and rose oils.</li>
    <li> I love the Aura Cacia brand of essential oils.  This is one of the first &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; I have purchased, mainly because I was looking for rose oil.  This has rose oil in it, but also has several other oils that are very earthy and woodsy almost.  Its not a terrible smell but I would only use it for specific use not for everyday baths.

I find its a calming grounding oil that I would use in a rose petal bath before bed.</li>
    <li> Great aroma to this blend. It&#x27;s going to be a gift so can&#x27;t say how well it works. But from the smell I&#x27;m confident it will perform as these oils should.</li>
