<li> Recently, it&#x27;s been hard to find around my area.  </li>

<li> Always purchased this from local stores, then I was having a very difficult time locating this in stores.</li>
<li> I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find this at any stores...</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every expensive fancy hair serum from every brand and salon.  </li>
<li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> too bad</li>

    <li> Always purchased this from local stores, then I was having a very difficult time locating this in stores. Nothing else compares! I&#x27;ve tried many products and most were much more expensive. For the price and the results you get you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I will always continue to purchase this product as it is the best for my naturally curly and very frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I have very baby fine hair and trying to find products that work on my hair is almost impossible I found this product years ago and has made my hair manageable and tolerable to work with.Doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and actually gives volume.Like most products that that I find to work on my hair they quit making as has been with this one I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore was happy to find here would like to stock-up on more</li>
    <li> I love vitreous shine. I can&#x27;t find it in the storeso anymore I was very happy to find it here. Thank you.</li>
    <li> as great as always. too bad i can no longer find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I use this product because it gives a lift to dull-looking hair....I don&#x27;t know about other anti-frizz/hair shine products, but this one works !</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I have been using it for the past 10 years. Recently, it&#x27;s been hard to find around my area.  Its the one product that I can put in my hair and feel like natural hair oncce it dries.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product my wife has found to keep her curly hair from frizzing.. tames it down.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this product has become hard to find in stores.  Thank goodness amazon still carries it.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it doesn&#x27;t make you hair look oily like some of the other frizz products.</li>
    <li> Only need a tiny but. Works well on my coarse frizzy hair. Happy with my purchase.  I use it in wet freshly washed hair.  Don&#x27;t need to reapply until I wash it again.</li>
    <li> My hair is really fizzy and curly when the humidity gets high.  This product is fantastic and really delivers a beautiful shine.  It has an oily feel compared to other products but the shine is worth it!</li>
    <li> I love Citre shine products. I have tried several leave-in glossing products by Citre and this one is my favorite. It leaves my waist-long hair tangle-free and gives it a wicked shine.</li>
    <li> I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find this at any stores...I started using other more expensive serums, tried other recommendations from friends and NOTHING could replace my Citre Shine.  Please Amazon, don&#x27;t stop selling it!  The greatest thing about this product is that it finishes my curl without greasiness, heaviness or stickiness. My hair looks clean and healthy instead of dry, frizzy or weighed down.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from Morrocan Oil to John Frieda and nothing works like good old Citre Shine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I am 17 years old, or maybe younger?  And I am 34 now!  I think that is all I really need to say.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every expensive fancy hair serum from every brand and salon.  And they dont give me the results that this product gives me.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it if you have long course thick hair.  Finer haired people may not like it b.c it is heavy and strong.</li>
    <li> I love Citre Shine. I was using this faithfully until they pulled it from the shelves . I am so glad to have found it on line. It works great on my curls, and I have a lot of curls. I will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> Best anti-frizz serum out there.  They did sell this is our local stores but no longer.  Thanks to Amazon I can still buy it.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much very well product. I can advise to everybody to use for their damaged and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product for yrs.  Always makes my hair shiny and not stiff.  No frizzies here.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend citre shine....I have dry  and curly hair and this product is a great solution to both problems....it makes my hair more manageable, makes it shine and helps heal split ends....what more could you want</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because nothing else she tried did the job.  She gets many compliments on how her hair shines</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this!  I&#x27;ve moved to Australia and can&#x27;t find it here, so thank goodness for Amazon.com!!  I have naturally curly hair and it keeps it under control.</li>
    <li> This is a good, heavier product for holding hair down (men and women) more than a light, misting shine spray.  After a day at the beach or sun, a dime size amount brings back soft and shiny hair.  Bend your head over and rub it in from the back forward. A little bit goes a long way so experiment with the look you want.  This goes on after a blow dry.</li>
    <li> Love the citre shine .</li>
    <li> Great product....great price!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Love the subtle smell.  Love the consistency (so much thicker than other serums that are watery) and works well to keep hair strong and smooth.  After highlighting my blonde hair multiple times, it was dry and brittle.  I use this to keep it under control, and I now see a BIG difference from its repeated use even when I miss an application.  Strong, smooth and shiny.  Wish more stores carried it.  I hope Citre Shine keeps making it.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my frizzy hair even when I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It is the only thing I use on my hair when heat styling. Only need a small amount so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I don&#x27;t use it as an anti-friss product but to add a shine to my grey hair.</li>
    <li> do not work when it&#x27;s hummed out in the summer but other then this it&#x27;s great product....make it work in the humidity weather.....</li>
    <li> A few drops and your hair is soft, shiny, frizz-free.  Nothing oily about it, and there&#x27;s no annoying fragrance. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, best on the market!  Only a little bit on damp hair and I can scrunch and blow dry and get nice loose curls, no frizz!

    <li> This is my favorite anti frizz!  I got it quick and was very satisfied! I will purchase this again and again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Make my hair extra shinny.  Best shine for hair than any product.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the same product that our local supermarket (Fred Meyer&#x27;s) no longer carries.  However, the price, when all things are considered was very high.  Will not purchase this product from this vendor because of very high price per unit</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the better serums on the market. It&#x27;s a bit lighter in texture and produces shine without that yucky &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; I really don&#x27;t care for.</li>
