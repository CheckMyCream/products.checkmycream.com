    <li> I LOVE this perfume! I get compliments on it all the time. I don&#x27;t wear anything else. I love to purchase it on AMAZON. Anywhere else it sells for $65 or more. On AMAZON it is between $10-$20.</li>
    <li> Excellent! My favorite scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years and it&#x27;s definitely one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I love the perfume! It did take 10 days or so to get here which is why I give it 4 stars. This is my second time buying this and I always get complements.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and smells ok but the scent does not last... is that generally how natural sprays are? I have less experience with such so I do not know. Will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my girlfriend after smelling it at a local mall which was way over priced. I love to smell it on her and she loves it as well. I wonder if after knowing the price she would still like it lol...</li>
    <li> I love this scent but it seems different from the last time i bought it</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and happy I can find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Sweet scent, very nice!</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it everyday.smells exactly like way I smelt it at the store.</li>
    <li> Whoever said this smells cheap? Hell No! They do not know what a quality perfume smells like.  This perfume is awesome, sweet, light, exotic smell.  For some reason, it smells sooo good, like it had a pheromone in it. Very captivating.  So expensive locally but very affordable online. I&#x27;m so glad I came across it online  cause it was crazy to buy it local.  Anyway, it&#x27;s one of the best perfume I ever smelled.</li>
    <li> buy my daughter a least 4 of these a year. she loves the smell</li>
    <li> Smells great. Ships fast.</li>
    <li> Smells great stays on for long time!</li>
    <li> When I smelled this scent on a card at the mall I thought it was a nice sweet smelling perfume, but I was wrong. Has a woman ever walked passed you and her perfume lingered behind her and you thought geez that&#x27;s cheap perfume? Well this is that perfume.</li>
    <li> I always loved this perfume I always spent 60-80 dollars on it. Found it on here for $15 now I&#x27;m just Going to buy it online now.....</li>
    <li> Great product !! Great transaction experience</li>
    <li> Yes smells great my wife fav it&#x27;s very sexy on her</li>
    <li> I love love love this perfume! It was delivered promptly and packaged very well! I&#x27;m already thingking about buying again just to stock up! Indulge and paper yourself ladies!</li>
