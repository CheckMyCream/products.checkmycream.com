      <li>My Mumzy remembers...when the original Charlie perfume/cologne was created!</li>
      <li>It smells rich ( if that makes sense).</li>
      <li>is my 2nd favorite fragrance and it lasts many hours without refreshing it.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent ever, it&#x27;s very light,fresh and feminine!</li>
      <li>It does not over power but has a good lasting scent when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Charlie White perfume</li>
      <li>and it was such a good price I will buy from them</li>
      <li>Charlie red is my very favorite,  </li>

      <li>I have used regular Charlie and Charlie Red and always liked them.  </li>
      <li>I like dominate lasting fragrances, but was won over by Charlie White&#x27;s sweet and soft personality.</li>
      <li>All I can say about Charlie White is that if somebody wants to buy me a gift, this is what I would like.</li>
      <li>One must also remember that a particular scent combined with the wearer&#x27;s  body chemistry will bring forth a different essence each and every time.</li>
      <li>Although, scents are a matter of preference, one must state that the Charlie Classic, and the Charlie Blue have a rather distinctive and lingering presence about them which the other Charlies do not.</li>

    <li> Great product and would buy again if needed.This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase...not so happy about having to come up with a limit of words that I have to use.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised. good value.</li>
    <li> love the smell of the Charlie brand. I would recommend to others in trying this product. the white musk, FABU...........................</li>
    <li> This is my second favorite. Charlie red is my very favorite,  but this smells great.</li>
    <li> All I can say about Charlie White is that if somebody wants to buy me a gift, this is what I would like. Mine recently ran out or one of our girls has been generously helping herself to it. Charlie White smells very nice and it is a pleasant fragrance that I have enjoyed wearing a lot. My husband likes it and that is a generous compliment from him. It does not over power but has a good lasting scent when I wear it. I need some more.</li>
    <li> I have used regular Charlie and Charlie Red and always liked them.  Thought I&#x27;d try the Charlie White, but it has a strong smell that is not pleasing to me.</li>
    <li> Totally love the smell. It is wonderful. Love wearing it. I even wear it to work. It is really nice.</li>
    <li> My Mumzy remembers...when the original Charlie perfume/cologne was created! That was indeed a while ago. Now known as the Charlie Classic...to my Mumzy...this has always been the very best Charlie creation. Needless to say that my Mumzy is somewhat prejudiced...since so many wonderful memories are tied in to this specific scent. Now, let us discuss the Charlie White which has a rather steely quality about it. Yet, it is pleasant...if that is what one prefers. Although, scents are a matter of preference, one must state that the Charlie Classic, and the Charlie Blue have a rather distinctive and lingering presence about them which the other Charlies do not. One must also remember that a particular scent combined with the wearer&#x27;s  body chemistry will bring forth a different essence each and every time. Therefore, each and every scent will smell different on different individuals. Scents also evoke emotions. Thus, such is the mysterious being of scents...and I believed that only pussycats were mysterious. Oh, phffft!</li>
    <li> Nice product. We keep buying t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crispin</li>
    <li> I dont like over flowery scents. This one is just right.I put a dab on my hand to test it and was subtle enough, but stood out just right.It smells rich ( if that makes sense). I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in years and I put it on earlier and it was still as amazing as it ever was!</li>
    <li> not what I thought it would be, will I buy it agine (no).</li>
    <li> Not sure what&#x27;s with all the rave reviews. This stuff smells old and cheap. I was also disappointed with Charlie blue. I&#x27;m afraid to try the rest of the Charlie&#x27;s. I should have known better</li>
    <li> My personal favorite from Charlie. I can wear this scent when other fragrances smell awful. Good bargain for the price and product.</li>
    <li> I started with Charlie Red a while ago and purchased Charlie White by accident and have been using it ever since, about a year now. I like dominate lasting fragrances, but was won over by Charlie White&#x27;s sweet and soft personality. I use it as my every day fragrance.</li>
