<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My previous Hai flat iron died on me after 8 years .after many reseaches i decided on this one came in today on a sunday after 3 days wowo i was so happy.so far looks good works fine i will update my review in a few months</li>
    <li> Although I did not get this from amazon, I want people to know that the quality of this product has gone from great to terrible, my first one lasted 5 yrs. and when I got my second and third one, it lasted about a year, the only reason I got the third one was I didn&#x27;t know any other good brands to use, so I thought I&#x27;d give it another try, and I don&#x27;t know about you, when I spend $100. bucks, I think they are a little cheaper now,on a product, I expect it to last longer then a year, I did modify the problem, which was a short in the cord, so I still have them, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to fix this and when I called the company, they didn&#x27;t care, so now I&#x27;m looking for a new brand</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best one I have ever bought and i&#x27;ve had it for a little over 2 years and is still working like it did on the first day.Got my hair super straight and heats up very fast.And what a great deal cause my salon charges $120.</li>
    <li> this is a great flatiron! i had this exact model for years and it never failed on me once, but i had to get another because my old one got stolen at school:(  my friend owns a Chi flatiron, but I actually prefer the HAI one because it glides over hair smoother than the Chi one(and its cheaper).  i would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> This is my second Hai flat iron. It truly is the best one i have ever used. The first one i had stopped working, i believe it was a cord problem. However it did last a year. I have had this one for a month now and i love it!!! Buy one now.</li>
    <li> I had previously own this flat iron and after 10 years of using it almost every day it died. I was devastated. I went shopping for the same iron on several websites and found it on Amazon the cheapest. I expected the item with in 2 weeks and received it in days. I was shocked and impressed.     Now for the iron.... I am truly disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t work the same as the one that I previously owned. I found that the iron I originally purchased was made in Korea and the iron that I just purchased was made in China. I contacted HAI directly and after a lengthy conversation I found out that other customers have said the same. They suggested that the HAI Nano, or HAI Titanium Convertible.     I will not be returning it as I need the iron but I will be purchasing the either one of the two shortly after I do intense research.     So in a nut shell, Amazon (5 star), where it came from (5 star), Delivery service (5 star), Product it self (3 star) as I mentioned it works but not as my previous one.</li>
    <li> Love the smoothness of the plates. Heats up quickly. Handles my coarse, thick hair with ease.  Has made straightening my hair a quick task.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Flat iron is excellent. Very pleased. Had the Chi for a while and switched when it broke. Best decision ever. This flat iron is a lot quicker and more effective.</li>
    <li> B\Not much to say, It is just a great flat iron and the shipping was fantastic \\&quot;free\\&quot; and pretty fast Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received this iron as a gift and it has lasted me 6 years!  It&#x27;s a wonderful iron!  I have Black and Asian hair and it straightens it with no problems.  It gets pretty hot so select your settings carefully.  I&#x27;ve dropped my iron a few times and it has been knocked down and it&#x27;s still in one piece and works incredibly well.  Amazon has amazing prices on this straighter and when it&#x27;s time to purchase I will definitely being purchasing through this site.  I love Amazon as well!!!:)  This is a wonderful iron and I recommend this iron to everyone!    Best Wishes,  Sarah</li>
    <li> Perfect flat iron for me.  I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. After I wash my hair, the flat iron changes the texture and takes the waves out of my hair and makes it feel like smooth silk -- exactly the results I want.  This flat iron ranks right up there with Chi and I got it for less than 1/2 the price through Amazon.  What a deal!  The only thing I wish it had was a 60 minute auto-shutoff, but I realize this is a commercial model and auto-shutoff usually is not an option.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. Doesn&#x27;t pull her hair nor burn her fingers when using it</li>
    <li> I had mine for 7 years and it just started messing up on me. The cord got worn out so I have to wedge it between stuff to heat it up. So take care of your cords if you buy this one! It will last you for life.  I know this is bad, but I&#x27;ve left it on for 24 hours before and it still works.  My hair is so flat and smooth after using too. This one is awesome!! I get compliments on my hair all the time because of this product.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am very pleased with the flat iron and also with the delivery. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this transaction.</li>
    <li> I love this iron. It works very well and heats up really quickly. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair when I use it. I have very fine, thin hair and I use this iron almost every day. My hair is not damaged from this iron, in fact, it looks heatlhy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I worked fine, but not as effective for frizzy hair as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> This is the worst flat iron ever!  The iron will not heat up unless the cord is positioned at a certain angle!  This happened to my previous HAI Iron but I thought maybe because it was old.  SO i bought another one and it is brand new and doing the same thing.  I am very unhappy and hope that amazon will allow me to return this product.</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic! it works on thick hair and thin hair, and it heats up in seconds! I would recomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it... It works well and gets warmed up fast. You gotta be careful you don&#x27;t touch the outer edges of the ceramic as it does get hot to touch. Just hold on to the actual handle.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this brand and I could not be happier with it. Heats up quickly and really does an amazing job. I have very coarse wavy hair and this flat iron makes it straight and smooth in mere minutes.</li>
    <li> The flat iron came on time, and was in excellent condition.  I just need to learn how to use it properly!</li>
    <li> We always had cheap straighteners in the past that didn&#x27;t really do the job. My daughter has slightly curly, frizzy hair that drives her crazy so she wanted a good iron that would take away the frizz. I read lots of reviews, it can be frustrating trying to decide on which one to buy! I finally decided on this one and she has been very pleased with it. It makes her hair shiny, straight, and best of all no frizz!</li>
    <li> I really like this ceramic flat iron.  My hairdresser recommended I buy one of this type, not necessarily this brand.  I just located it on the Amazon site, and have been using it with much success ever since.  It smooths my hair much better than the iron I previously used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these. They straighten thick, coarse hair well, but don&#x27;t last long. One lasted 8 months and the other lasted through one use.</li>
    <li> I have owned this flat Iron for 5 + years!!! One of the best purchases I have ever made. This iron is way better than Chi, Con- Air, and whatever other brand that is out there. Definetly a good Buy!!! I bought mine when it was way more expensive.... even to this day I do not regret it at all... My Hair is still looking good as the day I bought it!!! Totally in LUV with this!!! haha</li>
    <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s was brand new never used.  Just like the ones that I used to sell in my salon.  Box came in perfect condition and just in time for my trip.  My previous one lasted for 5-6 years.  I hope this one will too.  The seller is great at communicating as well.  Thanks!  12/22/11  This was a great product until this week.  The flat iron has already shorted out and doesn&#x27;t stay on anymore and barely works.  I now have to purchase another flat iron.  I will get the same brand, but not from this seller.  I&#x27;m very sad that it only lasted 2 months.  I have a case for it and I also a shelf for when I&#x27;m at home, so this flat iron doesn&#x27;t go through anything that would have caused it to short out.  As I was doing my hair one more it started making a popping noise &amp; then just stopped working.</li>
    <li> The HAI Convertible Ceramic iron works as described. Fast shipping.  Haven&#x27;t had any similar problems that people gave 1-star mentioned</li>
    <li> My Chi flat iron died and I was looking for a replacement that would work as well, but cost a bit less.  I found the perfect product.  My hair is rather coarse and kinky, but this flat iron straightens it beautifully.  I love it.  It works as well or better than the Chi and it cost quite a bit less.</li>
    <li> 4 of my aunts own this iron and I absolutely love it! I was super excited to trade my books with amazon and told myself that with the gift card balance I was going to buy one of my own. So I did, and Today I received it. I was totally excited when I got the package! Surprised too because it came in 2 days when I had regular shipping of 3-5days. So, I open the package, and what do I get? A Tom Tom GPS. I was soo extremely disappointed!! Now I have to return the TomTom and wait for that package to get to the company, then wait again for my straightner to arrive. Definitely won&#x27;t be here until next week. I&#x27;m super disappointed with the package mistake. I just want my HAI which I know will be fantastic. I recommend this iron to anyone! Its truly amazing :)</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier than I expected and i am very happy with my buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about a month now and it works awesome.  I bought it in place of my CHI which stopped working for NO REASON :(.  I found this here on Amazon and decided to try it out and did a lot of research on the item.  It actually slides through my hair much smoother than the CHI did and it has multiple heat settings (400 being the hottest, which is what I use on my long, wavy hair).  The only reason why it is 4 out of 5 stars is that it takes a while to heat up compared to the CHI.  But I just usually plug it in to heat as I do other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> This has been my professional favorite for years, this is the best price I&#x27;ve paid overall.</li>
    <li> Everyone told me to get a Chi, it&#x27;s the best.  I wanted to read what was out there and try what I thought would work with my thick, course, medium length hair.  Black hair is though and the HAI tool worked fantastically on my hair.  I loved the fact I controlled how hot I needed it and how quickly it heated up.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I owned a similar HAI Iron (which I bought for $99) for over four years (and was still performing quite well) until that fateful morning when it fell from the bathroom counter to the tile floor of my bathroom while I was doing my hair.  The HAI Iron that I recently bought to replace (paid around $69) is not exactly like the one I previously owned but function and performance is comparable. I also have no issues with the one I recently bought and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Love!  Works better than just about any other straightener out there!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement to my previous Hai Classic which lasted around 5 years. This one I purchased in June &#x27;14, and already has a short in the cord, not covered by warranty. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My third one in 10 years! I go with what I know works great and I have curly frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a mothers day gift and she loves it. Says it&#x27;s the best flat iron that she has ever used.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  It works well and does a great job flattening my hair!  I would definitely recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I use to have an amazing straightener that lasted over 10 years.  I could not find it made anymore.  This one works fine but not amazing!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well. It wasn&#x27;t factory-sealed or anything, but it appeared to be new.</li>
    <li> Works great and gets my hair straight &amp; smooth much faster than my previous irons.</li>
    <li> I have had like 10 different Chi flat irons, let me tell you, they are nothing compared to this one! The HAI iron is way better, i finish faster and my hair stays straight until i wash it again, also great for doing curls, i totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I previously owned a HAI Nustick for the past 6 years or so, which I received as a gift from my sister. I searched for so long to find the perfect straightener, and I was very happy with the NuStick. I took very good care of it, and nearing the end of the 6th year, it started to not get as hot and the coating on the ceramic was peeling. I&#x27;m very pleased that it lasted as long as it did- I used it just about every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, since the NuStick is an older model, and difficult to find, I looked for an alternative. This seemed like the closest one I could find and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It takes a little bit longer to get hot (+/- 2 mins), but has the same temperature settings and the cord is long. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for under $100.</li>
    <li> this straightener still works, even though i&#x27;ve bought it a few years ago. i ended up buying a second for my mom. it does a great job, and you should be confident buying one.</li>
    <li> It works wonderful.  High heat, creates a nice soft smooth feel to your hair.  The handle is also very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This product is the best for my type of hair! I have really tight curls (4a hair) and this gets it so straight!!!! I do 4 passes. 2 without a fine tooth comb and 2 with the comb. Then I put my hair on rollers for a little bit, my hair is so straight!!! And it has body and movement! If anything happens to this flat iron, I will be purchasing a new one. My hair is so soft and shiny. I can&#x27;t stop touching it. I love this flat-iron and I am glad I purchased this flat iron. :D</li>
    <li> I bought a new one to replace the exact same one I had for over 10 years.....Great Quality, works great.</li>
    <li> I had it before and I liked it, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I opened my package and it looked like a imitation HAI, I had a real one before. Now I know why it was 60 bucks.</li>
    <li> Best one and does not damage hair</li>
    <li> My wife was looking for a good and reliable product to take care of her hair and is really good that&#x27;s what she said, she is very pleased with it</li>
    <li> I have never flat ironed my hair before and it was very easy and fast.  I have a lot of hair, so I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it. I didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as I would like but I guess the problem is my hair. This iron heats up really quickly, I didn&#x27;t feel it damaged or burnt my hair, so I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> WORKED GREAT ON MY WIFES HAIR</li>
    <li> my 2nd purchase after the 1st one crapped out after 10+ years of use.  All my friend&#x27;s who have used this brand has dropped their generic crappy brand and bought this Hai.  SUPER affordable too!</li>
    <li> I love love love my HAI flat iron!! It heats up really quick and the style lasts all day, until the next! Whether I straighten it, flip it, or wear dramatic waves, I recieve compliments all day long. Definitly my daily must have tool!! :)</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and thick, therefore this product did not work well on my hair due to heat only going up to 400 degrees.(Needs more heat) It might be good for someone who’s hair is more straight, or more manageable.</li>
    <li> I had before and it lasted for years till I kept pulling on the cord to unplugg. A no no.  So reorder another one. Love it. The price is great. It&#x27;s easy to flat press. I take it everywhere with me. Doesn&#x27;t damage the hair. Recommend ordering from this seller. 👍</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these, the first one tanked so I replaced it with the same one. (the cord quit working at the base). It heats up quickly and straightens your hair professionally!</li>
    <li> So my hair dresser has this flat iron and I love hers, so I ordered this one and this was crap. I have had it for 2 month and this is not heating up anymore, does not work at all anymore, I feel maybe it was a knock off. Including it took a month for me to get the flat iron and when I contacted the people, they were no help...I will never buy this again..Money well wasted!!!</li>
    <li> Efficient, sturdy and very reasonably priced.  This particular flat iron was recommended to me by my hair stylist and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Bit pricey but great product I would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this when my Chi stopped working. It is a great size and works really well. It glides through the hair very smoothly, unlike the Babyliss I tried. I recommend this over the Babyliss.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron. Glides through hair, no pulling, heats quickly, and is spring loaded. I&#x27;ve tried other flat irons, but this one is great with a nice price. Perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best flat iron I ever had but it works fine.  Doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair.  This is the only iron that keeps my hair silky, straight, not frizzy, all day long - even on humid days!  It&#x27;s amazing.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It works great on thick blonde hair. Love Love this product. I t takes me 20 minutes to flat iron my hair. There is no frizz and it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy in humidity. Can&#x27;t ask for something better.</li>
    <li> I love my straightner! I had bought the same straightner 6 years ago, and I finally had to replace it! Great product</li>
    <li> I had this flat iron for about sinx months before it quit working on me and the manufacturer would not replace it or even offer to try to fix it.  I purchased this brand since my hairdresser was using the same kind.  After noticing that she had switched to another brand (Babyliss), I found out that her Hai flat irons did the same thing that mine did and she was also unable to have them fixed or replaced.  I&#x27;ve since purchased 2 different size Babyliss irons and haven&#x27;t had any problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. There are some copies out there and I almost bought one of them. Luckily I ready the reviews and they led me to this straightener. The cord connector on these is awesome. The trick to a long life is NOT wrapping the cord around the handle for storage. Doing that kills the cord connector much earlier in its life compared to if you loop the cord up per the directions. We have three of these being used between four girls at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best straightener.......</li>
    <li> Bought this for our daughter for her birthday &amp; she was thrilled. Said it works quicker than her old one &amp; leaves hair shiny without burning.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up nicely and works really nicely on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t grab and is nice and sleek.</li>
    <li> Very excellent 😌 no complaints! Leave my hair soft and silky 👍</li>
    <li> This is a great staightener.  Not only do I own one but also both of my daughters own one also.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener for a great price, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have hair that always wants to fight me and this flat iron is fantastic. It heats up quickly and works great. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Heats up fast. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> After several years of great service, my wife&#x27;s HAI Flat Iron quit. We were only too happy to find another at such a great price from Amazon. It arrived quickly and works just like the old trusty one. My wife is very pleased and uses it at least once a day.</li>
    <li> nothing to rave about...should have gotten a chi...</li>
