      <li>Both my mom and I enjoy using argan oil in the evening on our faces.</li>
      <li>right now I have a product i use and love.</li>
      <li>My review about Organic Argan Oil 100% from Zoika&#x27;s Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed very much Argan Oil from Zoika&#x27;s Morocco.</li>
      <li>Love the pure organic argan oil.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>The oil does not seem to have any special qualities.</li>
      <li>Soaks into your skin quickly.</li>
      <li>it does not feel to oily, it absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I also bought some for my daughter that was pregnant</li>
      <li>Not only was my experience with Zakia&#x27;s fast and seamless, the product was wonderful and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
      <li>The best part is that I have no sensitive reaction to it, and it seems to last all day without feeling as if I have \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my skin.</li>
      <li>Have tried a lot of products promising results for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>But for the first that I use I known that this product is specially for me.</li>
      <li>I also couldn&#x27;t ask for a better natural moisturizer for my face.</li>
      <li>use Organic Agrgan Oil twice a day and my skin is younger and I have more smooth complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>pleasant slight scent.</li>
      <li>It gets absorbed easily, without feeling greasy, and makes our skin soft.</li>
      <li>The bottle is very functional - doesn&#x27;t take up much space and the pump is going strong.</li>
      <li>Overall, very pleased I would prefer the more natural nutty smell argan oil naturally has.</li>
      <li>The prices are very reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>but when you read the contents Argan oil is only one of many ingrediates.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more when this supply finally runs out.  </li>
      <li>I had ourchasef Zakia&#x27;s Organic Shea Butter &amp; Argan Oil earlier &amp; love it.</li>
      <li>I am older and my skin had bone a muddy gray color, now the skin on my entire body is bright, soft, and supple.</li>
      <li>I thinks this gets absorbed by your skin while other creams sit on top.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few argan oils, some 100% pure and some mixed with something else, and by far Zakia&#x27;s is the best argan oil I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Finally, in my dealings with Zakia&#x27;s, both through Amazon and other websites, the customer service has been both personal and excellent.</li>
      <li>It feels luscious going on, absorbs quickly and completely with no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and soft, not thick and greasy.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s better to use on dry hair.</li>
      <li>After filing, I use Zakia&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>With just the smallest amount my skin feels so much nicer</li>
      <li>but I use it very sparingly on my hair or it will make it look oily</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and smooth with out feeling greasy and my hair is soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
      <li>I have used some other argan oils before but Zakia&#x27;s is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>After the first time, my feet were soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s main ingredient was argan oil</li>
      <li>Love the feel of this oil and especially the fact there is no left over oiliness you have to worry about.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend both the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is high quality.</li>
      <li>Zakia&#x27;s seems very pure, without any fragrance - I actually added a few drops of a favorite aromatherapy oil mix just for the pleasure of it.  </li>
      <li>At midlife, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my very sensitive skin and have had no allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>But I usually just unscrew the top and pour it into my hands.</li>
      <li>I can wear sandals comfortably, not afraid somebody will notice my flaky, dry chapped feet.    </li>
      <li>This oil is very pure and makes my hair &amp; skin feel so soft after applying and it will feel soft all day long.</li>
      <li>I had purchased a different brand Argan oul spray, which I disovered was not organic or even pure.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice organ oil.  no animal testing !!!  Cruelty free !! Soaks into your skin quickly. Scentless. Good stuff full disclosure :  they sent me this free sample for review.   and this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> At midlife, I have very sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t use beauty products with chemicals, or I break out in a rash. I live in a very dry, arid location, and I need something to moisturize my skin. I use coconut oil on legs and hands, but I LOVE this argan oil on my face, hair, elbows and feet. Oh my gosh! My feet. I&#x27;ve had problems with dry cracked feet since I was a teenager. Now, twice a week, I pumice in the shower and use a file on my feet before they are quite dry. After filing, I use Zakia&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil. After the first time, my feet were soft to the touch. It was amazing. I&#x27;m not embarrassed to have my man rub and touch my feet. I can wear sandals comfortably, not afraid somebody will notice my flaky, dry chapped feet.    I also couldn&#x27;t ask for a better natural moisturizer for my face. It&#x27;s light and soft, not thick and greasy. The best part is that I have no sensitive reaction to it, and it seems to last all day without feeling as if I have \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my skin. I just ordered another bottle (8 oz. this time), and I&#x27;m sharing my experience with all of my friends. This is a great beauty solution for me.</li>
    <li> exelent oil for dry skin</li>
    <li> Makes my skin gorgeous! Absorbs faster than any other body oil I have tried.</li>
    <li> Both my mom and I enjoy using argan oil in the evening on our faces. It gets absorbed easily, without feeling greasy, and makes our skin soft. My mom also puts some through her hair. Look forward to using other products</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this oil and especially the fact there is no left over oiliness you have to worry about.  It is a go to item for dryness and for use in making handmade lotions.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that &amp;#34;this&amp;#34; argan oil is great!  I am pleased with the product and it feels great.  I will re-order this product AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Have California 50 year old sun abused skin....unfortunately. Have tried a lot of products promising results for fine lines and wrinkles. Within days of using this oil along with the black soap, I already see a difference. Do not be afraid to put this oil on your face if you have normal to dry skin. It feels light, no smell, and actually feels less heavy than many creams I&#x27;ve tried. I thinks this gets absorbed by your skin while other creams sit on top. Already my skin looks softer and the lines are plumping out. I also put this on the ends of my hair. Will reorder this for sure.</li>
    <li> Wonderful high quality  product!  I use it on my face and dry areas of my body. Absorbs without feeling oily or greasy.  Moisturizes my face without breaking it out.  I also use it on my hair...but I use it very sparingly on my hair or it will make it look oily (may not do this on thicker hair, my hair is very fine and thin).</li>
    <li> Love the pure organic argan oil. I have tried a few argan oils, some 100% pure and some mixed with something else, and by far Zakia&#x27;s is the best argan oil I have ever used.  Good job Zakia, I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I like the product and the price.  I started using argan on my hair but love it for my skin too. I did not like the plastic bottle it came in (why no 5th star) so I transferred it to a brown glass dropper bottle.  Problem solved.</li>
    <li> I have used Argan Oil before and it was only so so.  This is an incredible product.  I started using it with beldi soap and a glove.  Now for every shower I put this on.  I use this daily.  I am older and my skin had bone a muddy gray color, now the skin on my entire body is bright, soft, and supple.</li>
    <li> Overall, very pleased I would prefer the more natural nutty smell argan oil naturally has. This product barely has an aroma.  However, it does its job and absorbs quickly and very nicely.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> great oil for hair, skin and body. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great, healthy oil.</li>
    <li> I like this oil for my skin it does not feel to oily, it absorbs quickly.  I have not tried it on my hair as it seems a bit to thick to put on my hair and right now I have a product i use and love. I will try it on my hair though and see how it works. The only thing with the packaging that I don&#x27;t like it the pump sprayer isn&#x27;t the best. But I usually just unscrew the top and pour it into my hands.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a different brand Argan oul spray, which I disovered was not organic or even pure. This is a good quality Argan oil at a good price. I had ourchasef Zakia&#x27;s Organic Shea Butter &amp; Argan Oil earlier &amp; love it. My only concern with this product is the oil is too thick for the sprayer &amp; as a result, comes out only in a strean, no spray..</li>
    <li> Very very pleased with product. I use on face and hands. Leaves such a soft feeling. Absorbs completely so no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Not too king on the smell or the overall product. Overprice.</li>
    <li> this oil takes a bit to penetrate into my face but smells wonderful ,not too greasy and does not make me breakout . my skin feels hydrated .</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of argon oil and Zakia&#x27;s is second to none in product quality. The prices are very reasonable as well. Finally, in my dealings with Zakia&#x27;s, both through Amazon and other websites, the customer service has been both personal and excellent. I highly recommend both the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Pulis</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t go on too easily on wet hair. I over applied and my hair was too oily. I think it&#x27;s better to use on dry hair. I haven&#x27;t tried on skin.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. This oil is very pure and makes my hair &amp; skin feel so soft after applying and it will feel soft all day long. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My review about Organic Argan Oil 100% from Zoika&#x27;s Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed very much Argan Oil from Zoika&#x27;s Morocco. It was surprise for me that I am not spend too much many for Argan Oil and this product helped me more than very expensive creams known brands that I was used to use to date.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I had a lot of problems with my skin especially with my darn. So I am try very carefully chose my cosmetics. But for the first that I use I known that this product is specially for me. No allergic problems.&lt;br /&gt;I use Organic Agrgan Oil twice a day and my skin is younger and I have more smooth complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product I am glad I can find to something good for me here. I wish that can help somebody else with a skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Agnieszka</li>
    <li> great skin oil. absorbs well. pleasant slight scent. top quality. recommended. dark bottle to keep oil fresh. would buy again</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Zakia&#x27;s Argan Oil. With just the smallest amount my skin feels so much nicer and I can nourish my skin so much better than I can with lotion. I especially like to use it on my neck and face as it is believed to help with signs of aging. Overall it makes my skin feel wonderful and has a very pleasant smell. I also bought some for my daughter that was pregnant and she loved using it on her stomach. I plan to continue using it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have used some other argan oils before but Zakia&#x27;s is my favorite.  I use it before I wash my hair.  I leave it in for about an hour n massage my scalp with it. After I wash it off my hair is so moisturized and feels great and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face as a moisturizer.  Leaves your face feeling great and not oily because it absorbs very quick.</li>
    <li> Meh. Nothing special. The spray does not spray. The oil does not seem to have any special qualities.</li>
    <li> I have been on a body oil quest for the last couple of years.  Not any more!  This is the best oil I have ever used!  It is excellent!  No cheap filler oils or other products to dilute the Argan oil.  It has very little smell and that goes away quickly.  Beware of other oils that call themselves Argan oil but when you read the contents Argan oil is only one of many ingrediates.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a nutty smell like a lot of other brands, this means it is very pure and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;This is high quality.</li>
    <li> This is the second Argan oil product I&#x27;ve tried in the past 4 months. I apply it morning &amp; evening instead of my previous moisturizer, lip balm and hand cream routine. It feels luscious going on, absorbs quickly and completely with no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel at all.  Zakia&#x27;s seems very pure, without any fragrance - I actually added a few drops of a favorite aromatherapy oil mix just for the pleasure of it.  My skin tends to be dry and at midlife shows the results of years of sun damage.  After about 4 months of using Argan oil, my skin feels plump and hydrated and the texture is good.  Next step, ditch the body lotion and go with argan oil, head to toe.  Zakia&#x27;s is a good value for cold-pressed, organic, 100% Argan oil.  The bottle is very functional - doesn&#x27;t take up much space and the pump is going strong. I have a smaller glass bottle with an eyedropper in my travel kit. Will be buying more when this supply finally runs out.  Zakia&#x27;s website says that she is from Morocco herself and gets her oil from the women&#x27;s cooperatives there.</li>
    <li> I used to use a hair finishing oil called Moroccan Oil. It&#x27;s main ingredient was argan oil and it worked pretty good but this product works much better. It&#x27;s not as thick and gloopy as the Moroccan Oil treatment and it&#x27;s about $14 for 118ml, compared to $40 for 50ml of the other stuff. You can&#x27;t ask for more. Also I can use it for my skin and cuticles, it&#x27;s a multi use beauty product, giving me even more bang for my buck. If you like to condition your hair and skin naturally, nothing beats argan oil. I&#x27;ve also used the Black Moroccan soap from this seller and it&#x27;s lovely, a thick paste that becomes a slick soap when used on the skin, it softens and lightly exfoliates. i left it on as recommended and scrubbed it off with a bath mit and my skin was soft as butter.</li>
    <li> This product is everything that they say it is and soo much  more. I already see a difference in my skin and can not wait to continue to use this product. I will definitely be buying this product on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> i was surprised when i opened the package and found a plastic pump bottle. most organic argan oils i have purchased are in amber colored GLASS bottles. i like the oil and will be using it up, it is no better or worse than any of the other 100% pure, organic, cold pressed brands i have purchased at this same price point. i wont be repurchasing this brand because of the packaging and i thought potential purchasers should know so they can make an educated decision.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, but I quitely use a little dab of it as it helps with my dry scalp and also my dry fingers. Shh....my wife better not be reading this review. Tsskkk..tsskkk..The wonderful thing is it does not smell girly, so I can mask it with my &#x27;manly&#x27; cologne</li>
    <li> Great oil, very good to use mostly at night, your face will thank you for it as you wake you with radiant and glowing skin. I have also used it on my hair and it gives a lustrous shine. Very good for the hands to especially for aging hands like myself.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. I use it on my long thick, almost knee length hair to keep the frizzies at bay. I also use it on my very sensitive skin and have had no allergic reactions. My skin is soft and smooth with out feeling greasy and my hair is soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Not only was my experience with Zakia&#x27;s fast and seamless, the product was wonderful and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Will definitely be purchasing from this partner in the future.</li>
    <li> Pure argan oil just makes me happy.This one is light so i can use it on my hair as well as my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Pure is also hard to find ,,,,</li>
