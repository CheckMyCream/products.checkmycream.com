    <li> I was hoping for a firmer nylon material. I bought it to put in a handbag I have that is completely open inside - no separations to divide the bag into two compartments to keep things in order. While the bag was adorable and I received numerous compliments on it - everything I put in it would fall over on it&#x27;s side and I would have to dig thru it to find anything. I was counting on this organizer to be the cure but sadly it&#x27;s not. It is such soft material that I have to fight to keep IT standing upright in the bag as well. However, it is better than nothing, so I&#x27;m keeping it and I just don&#x27;t use the bag as often as I wish I could.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very big picture is deceiving big time.. Don&#x27;t like it @ all..I was so upset when I got it.. MADE ME SICK...JOKE&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughters to use in the tote bags for school. Keeps all the small stuff from falling to the bottom of your bag</li>
    <li> Very compact, holds alot! Lots of pockets! Deep middle pocket is adjustable with snaps.</li>
    <li> Its convenient. Like the color.</li>
    <li> Excellent and very practic</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought it would be. Got it as a gift for a friend so I hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> roomie pockets&lt;br /&gt;perfect for changing from purse to purse</li>
    <li> I ordered the purple one so it would match a handbag and be easy to find and I thought it arrived in perfect condition! I like the way it has four snaps for it to expand and also so many pockets and zippered compartments as well as various size mesh pockets to find things easy. The main interior was big enough to hold an oversized hobo wallet! Mine also came with a separate velvet type material rectangular pouch that also has an outside pocket to slip something in. The top of the pouch has a button and loop closure I&#x27;m thinking this is for carrying cell phones? Or maybe you want to put sunglasses in there... In any case I am extremely pleased with the purchase and had no complaints whatsoever! This product is awesome to keep everything in one place and transfer to another purse or tote bag. I was even able to tuck away a fold up canvas rain hat..just in case I ever needed it. I love that it has little handles for lifting out.. I still have many spaces to fill up. For my purple hobo bag this is an ideal organizer so everything isn&#x27;t just falling all over the place and getting jumbled up.</li>
    <li> Love these! The greatest thing for someone that likes to change purses a lot!</li>
    <li> strap broke very easily only after one use.</li>
    <li> Great item to have. Keeps everything together great for vacations!!</li>
    <li> I have so many of these bags in different colors there great!</li>
    <li> Loved it when it came but the seams quickly started to come undone and the top straps started pulling out of it.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made but functional. Perfect for today&#x27;s large purses-organizes my stuff. This is my second one, but the first one held up better (it was a lighter color so it was dirt looking_ This one pockets have already ripped.</li>
    <li> Love mine it&#x27;s just how it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love my new handbag insert. It has lots of pockets and zipper compartments and the bag has handles so you can just lift it out of your purse. I have another bag insert but it is much smaller and can&#x27;t hold everything. This one is perfect!</li>
    <li> While I like this, it didn&#x27;t stand up to my constant need to change purses. Everything is in my purse organizer and when I wanna change purses I can just lift out and go but the handles have already started to tear. Or maybe I just have too much crap.</li>
    <li> Great item to organize your purse and facilitate easy changing from purse to purse.  Takes a while to arrive as it comes from China.</li>
    <li> I have been using it and find it very useful. I don&#x27;t use the zip pouches because the zippers get stuck.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my handbag insert. I hope be good quality.  The color is cute.</li>
    <li> love this, really helps keep your bag neat, these are great for gifts!!
