      <li>I love this product I have been using for years.</li>
      <li>totally love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I was looking for something more &#x27;grainy&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I got so many compliments about my skin.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended Aveeno products and I love them all.  </li>
      <li>I had to add more water as I scrubbed, as my skin seemed to absorb the gel.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is true!</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>They do what they say they will and are easy on the pocketbook.</li>
      <li>Aveeno Positively Ageless line is the best facial products I have tried, and I have tried many.  </li>
      <li>This scrub is great, though I don&#x27;t use it every day but rather every third shower or so-</li>
      <li>I used it during the week and my face felt smooth</li>
      <li>leaves your face smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love this scrub because it does the job, but very gently and leaves a moisturizing feel to my skin.</li>
      <li>It keeps your face really clean, and your hands too, so</li>
      <li>It is more on the gentle side, but I prefer that.</li>
      <li>Just a thought to use or not.. enjoy the scrub, it really is nice.  :-)</li>
      <li>Have only used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Positively Ageless Resurfacing Scrub, 5 Ounce once or twice but am happy with its performance so far.</li>
      <li>It is okay if you use a freshly washed, from the dryer facecloth ONCE ONLY.</li>
      <li>and it is my first time using it</li>
      <li>The shipment was late but great product.</li>
      <li>So if you can get used to it, rinse with your hands only, then blot your face dry with a nice clean paper towel!</li>
      <li>This product gently removed the top damaged layers to reveal younger, clearer skin.  </li>
      <li>This is quite a gentle cleanser</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really give a review on this prodcut as I just received it</li>
      <li>This bottle will last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno is a good mid range brand if you&#x27;re looking for quality and something that will work with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to cut down to 1x a week to see if that works better.</li>
      <li>It gets a little soapy and leaves your face feeling really clean, but not dry or tight, when you rinse it off, with your hands, with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;Big</li>
      <li>I saw a show on how quickly bacteria grows on a wet facecloth.</li>
      <li>I like the Aveeno products in general.</li>
      <li>This is a nice scrub, and you only need very little -- it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze out, probably for that very reason!</li>

<li> I had blotchy skin due to outbreaks and scars.  </li>
<li> I read previous reviews</li>
<li> When I use this product in the shower it does not feel harsh.</li>
<li> You only need a small amount as it is very thick and concentrated.</li>
<li> You wet your face and then rub gently in small circles.. but stay away from your delicate eye area.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this scrub because it was called a resurfacing scrub. I like it, however I thought the scrubbing beads would be stronger. This is quite a gentle cleanser and I was looking for something more &#x27;grainy&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Greatvfor exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I immediately noticed a difference in fine lines on my face! Smells great and is refreshing! Will buy again! Good price.</li>
    <li> totally love this stuff.  leaves your face smooth.  wish they made a body wash</li>
    <li> An excellent products thanks.</li>
    <li> Does what it says--resurfaces the skin.  I had blotchy skin due to outbreaks and scars.  This product gently removed the top damaged layers to reveal younger, clearer skin.  I am a fan!</li>
    <li> I like it, does the job well. You only need a small amount as it is very thick and concentrated. This bottle will last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno is a good mid range brand if you&#x27;re looking for quality and something that will work with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Aveeno products and this scrub is amazing. It is more on the gentle side, but I prefer that. It leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy. I have been using this for months and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub because it does the job, but very gently and leaves a moisturizing feel to my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Positively Ageless line is the best facial products I have tried, and I have tried many.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice scrub, and you only need very little -- it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze out, probably for that very reason! Maybe a nickel sized dollop. You wet your face and then rub gently in small circles.. but stay away from your delicate eye area. I had to add more water as I scrubbed, as my skin seemed to absorb the gel. It gets a little soapy and leaves your face feeling really clean, but not dry or tight, when you rinse it off, with your hands, with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;Big Hint: Most of the bacteria on our face comes from our facecloths!!!!! Yes, it is true! So if you can get used to it, rinse with your hands only, then blot your face dry with a nice clean paper towel! It keeps your face really clean, and your hands too, so when you use your products, you are not adding any bacteria into them either. I saw a show on how quickly bacteria grows on a wet facecloth. UCK! It is okay if you use a freshly washed, from the dryer facecloth ONCE ONLY. I just find that a select-a-size paper towel does the job perfectly, then I use it to finish cleaning up the sink!  Just a thought to use or not.. enjoy the scrub, it really is nice.  :-)</li>
    <li> When I use this product in the shower it does not feel harsh. However, immediately afterwards my skin is very dry and I am getting acne and redness since using it.  I&#x27;m going to cut down to 1x a week to see if that works better.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Aveeno products and I love them all.  This scrub is great, though I don&#x27;t use it every day but rather every third shower or so- it seems to give me the best results that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product leaves your skin feeling and looking great without any kind of metrosexual shine (you know what I&#x27;m talking about).</li>
    <li> I have some concern about the reviews and how they are posted.  Under night cream one would expect comments about night cream and not eye creams, cleansers, products with SPF, etc.   Is there a reason everything is lumped together?  I use, and like, several Aveeno products, but not the Ageless night cream as I find it too harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> Have only used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Positively Ageless Resurfacing Scrub, 5 Ounce once or twice but am happy with its performance so far.</li>
    <li> The shipment was late but great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the Aveeno products in general. They do what they say they will and are easy on the pocketbook. The fragrance used is very enjoyable and they work well.</li>
    <li> I got so many compliments about my skin.  What have you done to your skin is so radiant and glowing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really give a review on this prodcut as I just received it and it is my first time using it.. I read previous reviews and they said it was good, so I am hoping that it works for me. I used it during the week and my face felt smooth so that is a good sign.. Hopefully this product is good for me like the reviews said it would be...</li>
