<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fun to play around with but if you want some serious color I&#x27;d try a different pallet. After 30 minutes the Grey shadow faded and that was WITH primer. It made my eyes look dark and weird. I had to reapply it. On the up side none of them were broken and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed !Item arrived with powder all over it. The silver eye shadow was empty. Very disappointed as it is one of the colors that I would&#x27;ve use the most!</li>
    <li> Great colors! Ordered for a unicorn halloween costume makeup and it turned out great! I couldn&#x27;t believe this palette was so cheap for the quality of shadows!</li>
    <li> I wanted a set of bright eyeshadows without paying $145+ for a name brand. Colors are exactly as pictured and last for hours once you apply an eyeshadow primer. Lovely palette at a great price.. yo won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this so much! I am so crazy about Shany now! So pigmented and amazing!</li>
    <li> Love it, colors are exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great pigments and great price !!</li>
    <li> i bought this  to expirement with differant colors  and styles of eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt; when i opened the box i was a little disapointed mine didn&#x27;t have a mirror, but after testing a few colors out i fell in love with it, there is a great variety and pretty sturdy case.&lt;br /&gt;  if you&#x27;re looking for  vibrant colors  on the cheap then buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;l</li>
    <li> I received the package, two of my colors were broken upset about that dusted off the rest and began playing... I love to create a dramatic eye for the evening enjoy the lime greens a lot. Softer golds for the daytime. I add a dab of water to make the colors stick to my eye giving the color a more bold look, Seams to last/wear longer..</li>
    <li> Alright so I looked at this eyeshadow palette for a while before buying it, I looked at all the reviews, I looked at submitted pictures, I did the research, and then I gave in and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it I was incredibly excited. None of the colors were damaged. The shipping was really fast. Overall I&#x27;d say the colors are really worth the price. You get a ton of colors, and they&#x27;re super pigmented. (I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance, so they last all day for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, if I were going to do it all over again, I&#x27;d just buy one of the 88 palettes from [...], which from what I can tell is basically the same eyeshadow, except with over twice as many colors for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my 17 year old Sister in Law, and snagged it for 17.99.  She was thrilled with the gift.  Everyone asked where I bought it, and if it was expensive.  The colors are VERY vibrant, and they are extremely long lasting.  Unfortunately, one of the colors (black) had broken during shipment.  When I opened the package to check the contents, the eye shadow had transferred from the box all over my hands and dropped on my carpet.  I had to whip out the steam cleaner just to get the stain out.  Now THAT is some high quality pigment!  I would recommend this palette over the pricier department store brands.  I&#x27;m picking one up for myself now. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I Love this palette. The colors are amazing and I love the setup. Unlike the picture, the numbers of the colors aren&#x27;t printed on the plastic of my palette, but I like that better. The colors are set up perfectly for combining, which is a plus. Overall I really love this palette and definitely will order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for a Christmas present for my dauther, age 23.  She absolutely loves it, and several of her friends have commented on the cool eye colors she&#x27;s been wearing.  It is fairly small but a little goes a long way and the color seems to last most of the day.  I most likely will be buying her one next Christmas as well.</li>
    <li> This pallet has a great combination of bright the yellow is so pigmented it is comparable to highend makeup such as forevermakeup and mac. I would recomend this product to all reguardless of skill or proffession. The shipping was quick and inexpensive. When it arived I was sooo excited to see that it was super securly wrapped nothing was out of place or broken. Five stars all the way!!! Don&#x27;t listen to the negitive reveiws there very inacturate. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> At first I loved this, and the colors were so beautiful. But, the second time i used it, i found out that i was allergic..it made my eyes burn, and my eyelids turned red/purple. Which was wierd, because it was my first bad reaction to make-up.</li>
    <li> Many of the reviews on here said that the colors in the pictures were not what they got in the mail. However... the colors in the pictures were EXACTLY what I got in the mail! They are bright and colorful and feel velvety smooth on my eye. Love this eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> I was thinking about buying the coastal scents palette but i wanted something that could easily fit in my purse and that i could take along with me. I saw this and i got it for 11 dollars everytime i see it the price goes up. But at least i got it you will NOT regret it for your money it has colors the coastal scents do not have. Like pure white, orange, and red. (which is great because i love doing rainbow on my eyes). People are saying that the colors are a little smaller than a dime but that is not true it is only true for the coastal scents (my sister has it). The colors on this SHANY palette are about the size of a nickel if not bigger. Let me check real fast...ahhh nevermind. it is smaller than a nickel but BIGGER than a dime. Anyways the colors are great and highly pigmented. Thats all i gotta say(: buy it you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> the packaging was very poor and when my eyeshadow came it was broken into pieces! Im disapointed!!!!! it was at least 9 out of the 40 all shattered and broken</li>
    <li> This palette is so amazing! This is my first ever palette I purchased and its so cute and fun and has all the colors you could need/want. This is so perfect for what I was looking for and it was cheap. Would I suggest this to people? YES! I would totally suggest this to anyone/everyone!</li>
    <li> The palette is wonderful! It&#x27;s bright and colorful, just as I wanted. I only had trouble with shipping. My fourth pink, second red, and black were all cracked. The pink is mostly gone and crumbled on the box, unfortunately. Luckily, I don&#x27;t use that pink too much, though! Product itself is very nice.</li>
    <li> i received this pallete in great condition, nothing broken, and very fast shipping. i like that there are some matte and some shimmer shadows. i put some on in the morning for work and noticed that i had some loose eyeshadow around my lower lash area at the end of the day; and since i have oily eyelids the shadow started to crease, even though i had used some TOO FACED SHADOW INSURACE. when useing shadow insurance non of my other shadows creas at all.. and with just one little touch everything smears on you :(  overall, i say you get what you pay. this shany pallete is nothing compared to my $140 pret a porter pallete. but if you are a begginer at applying makeup and what something cheap and fun this pallete is for you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews.. My product arrived two days after I ordered it. It was in perfect condition, the colors are highly pigmented perfect for this spring! They&#x27;re long lasting especially if you use a primer, couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice :D</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I got what I was expecting even more due to the price I paid for it. The colors are very vivid and the do stay long on my skin. Also very glad with getting variable colors in this palette. Slim, light, love it.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette contains 40 basic colors for those of us who just want the basic variety of colors (blue, pink, purple, yellow, brown, green , etc.) in a compact  &amp; thin case &amp; don&#x27;t want to spend more on the bigger cases.  Also good for those  who travel and don&#x27;t want to bring the bigger cases with 180 or so shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it&#x27;s got a variety of pinks &amp; other pastels (which look best on me and are subtle).  I use the stronger colors minimally as they&#x27;re very pigmented, so I mainly use these for eyeliner &amp; apply with an eyeliner brush.  I like that it&#x27;s got a good selection of matte colors as well as shimmery and they last for hours.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because even some of the lighter colors are very pigmented and if you applied too much  or just used a color that ended up not looking good on you &amp; you try to wipe off the excess, it still looks pigmented but it just ends up looking faded, so you would have to just wash your eyes or use eye make-up remover &amp; start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend an eyelid primer so they go on smoother,  especially because they&#x27;re  powder, not creme, eyeshadows.  On that note, I wish they would  have added a few primer (cream-based) bins in this collection.  I also wish they would come up with creme eyeshadow pallettes and a pastel-only palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price &amp; selection of colors I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised with this new purchase. I tend to be very cautious when it comes to purchasing items online. Especially makeup; simply because it has a tendecy to crack or not be true to the color that I see online; however, this eyeshadow seems to be very different. I tried the colors and the pigment reminds me of MAC eyeshadows. Which is great considering this is more economical. Great investment and I can&#x27;t wait to put them to use. I will definitely invest in more of the Shany products. Being a makeup artist I have to make sure that my clients are happy and I believe they will be. Now it&#x27;s time to Youtube my new toy.</li>
    <li> For the price you cant beat this eyeshadow. The colors are very vibrant, especially if you use a primer before applying. I used two faced \\&quot;shadow insurance\\&quot; and the colors go on super pigmented and hold up all day. There are tons of great colors for summer and each one is about the size of a dime. There are so many colors to choose from that i&#x27;ve been able to do all kinds of different looks and have barely scratched the surface of the colors. I can see this pallet lasting a very long time if my toddler doesnt get to it. I dont think its fair to compare this shadow to high end shadows like MAC or Urban Decay. Like all things, you get what you pay for. The quality of these shadows are excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this palette because of the colourful shades, and I didn&#x27;t expect this much good stuff from a 9 dollar pallette. However, the yellow is not very pigmented. The purples are also not very pigmented, but it is shimmery and soft. Some of these colours are pretty good for gentle touches but if you&#x27;re looking for colours with a super packed punch, try Sugarpill instead. My favourite shade is the deep, very vibrant red in the right corner. In short, there are great transition shades, shimmers and mattes. I use them for cut creases, and the colours are good for looks that give colourful but soft impressions.</li>
    <li> Great product, sadly though the black in the palette busted before it arrived and it was everywhere. I can say though the pigments have sticking power because it was a mess to clean up. They are vibrant, beautiful colors however and I use this palette often. They offer a great variation in shades so you can layer and or  graduate colors.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure about this product since I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand but all the reviews seemed pretty good and I had a gift card from Christmas. I figured I wasn&#x27;t really losing anything if I totally hated it so I went ahead and ordered it. :P I placed the order Dec.29th but since it was the holidays it took longer to receive. I received it today Jan. 5th via USPS so it took about a week which wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Anyways, the packaging was good, brown packing paper and double bubble wrapped. Thankfully everything was intact and nothing was cracked or anything. I have not used the product yet but it looks pretty good, some colors are matte while others have a bit of a shimmer to them. I usually use MAC or Milani brand eye shadows so hopefully this stuff really works and lasts all day!!! So hats off to the SHANY brand company...awesome product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product based on mixed reviews, but now I&#x27;m so glad I got it.  I received the item in great condition (no cracks, broken colors, not even any loose powder or anything).  The colors are beautiful and look exactly as shown in the pictures.  The only difference is that the numbers aren&#x27;t printed on the plastic.  That is fine with me as those numbers wouldn&#x27;t have done me any good at all.  The size of each color isn&#x27;t too big or too small.  Overall I think this palette is great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Great pallet! A good friend of mine bought this for me for Christmas. I have a YouTube channel and I filmed it as soon as I had time. Pretty colors, I used some of the blues in this pallet too. Only down side is if you blend too much, they almost blend away to nothing. Make sure to use a flat brush to pack on the color, and a good eyeshadow primer. These always work well when wet :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find the pictures I took, so here I will attach the thumb nail I used for my video. If anyone wants to check it out and see how they perform, my channel name is &amp;#34;Kristie Caroline&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> beside the good price and good quality, I should say it has the best color ever. picture shows all the light color ,but i got all the hot colors, all metalic shades, kinda sexy tan shades, not so many pinks and yellows, it was mostly medium dark tan colors. I will buy more</li>
    <li> Great for any occasion</li>
    <li> these shadows are even prettier then the picture, I was glad that I saw them advertised so I was able to buy them.</li>
    <li> I definitely like the colors, but the packaging wasn&#x27;t very smart and a few of them were a mess (However, I expected this after reading a few reviews and it didn&#x27;t bother me too much).</li>
    <li> i was really impressed with these cuz i thought they were going to be cheap quality, boy was i wrong. the staying power of these colors id say is the same as MAC. very blendable. love it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical buying this at first... but read all the wonderful reviews and decided to give it a try. I am amazed at how highly pigmented these colors are. You don&#x60;t need much to have a really vibrant look. And it stays all day when using a primer.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Really vibrant colors and nice variety!</li>
    <li> Excellent array of colors.  Highly pigmented.  This is my first experience with Shany brand, and I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I love these eyeshadows. This was one of the first pallets I purchased and I was very pleased with it except I thought it was a bit overpriced. I would probably not buy this pallet again considering I could buy one from CoastalScents and get twice as many colors for the same price. Overall nice product tho.</li>
    <li> I love this pallete. It has these bright, pigmented colors (including a true RED, which is a color you really can&#x27;t find anywhere else for a reasonable price) but also includes a few neutrals to balance them out with. Some of the colors are matte, which is also hard to come by. All of the colors last all day, especially with a primer. The pallete itself is slim and is very easy to travel with and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> THIS PALETTE IS SO RICH AND BRIGHT IN COLOR.  PIGMENTS ARE AMAZING AND DEEP.  STRONG CASE AND EASY TO TRAVEL WITH.  I WAS A BIT SCARED TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT BUT WHEN I DID I WAS SO EXCITED AND HAPPY WITH PRODUCT.  YOU MUST BUY ONE YOURSELF.  F.Y.I  GREAT STOCKING STUFFER, BIRTHDAY GIFT AND CONGRATS GIFT.</li>
    <li> The shadows are small but well pigmented. They do last all day and are blendable however for $ 8 less i could get the CS 88 palette and get the shimmer shades there. I still use this but i find myself using the CS palette since it has double the shades. Also the company logo on the front takes away from the look.</li>
    <li> I gave this item 5 stars for good reason! First of all, I was ...born before 1970, I&#x27;ll own up to that... and asked for this as a Christmas gift due to 1. the VERY reasonable price and 2. the color spectrum. I figured it was a good thing to ask for from my husband-- if it turned out to not work for me, it wasn&#x27;t too much $$ at stake. It worked out better than I thought, and also better than ANY 20-or-more-colored-eyeshadow set. I grew up in the 80s, so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of these.  I am having more fun with this kit than I did with most makeup in my 20s. I mainly wanted to try out the greens and purples, and even though I do not look my age, have good genes, and stick to a beauty regimen every day of every year, 41 is 41.&lt;br /&gt;I have brown eyes, and was able to pull off even some of the brighter colors. For instance, the neon greens and even yellow. The violet hues (that are in no danger of being even partially blue) look great. I don&#x27;t use mineral makeup, because I saw almost the first day I wore it that 1. it didn&#x27;t show much on my skin, even the dark browns 2.what I did get to show up wore off fast, but worst of all 3. somehow it managed to accent any lines in my face I had. Not exactly worth being 3 times more expensive than regular makeup. The colors I have tried have been matte finish (if there are metallic ones, they are in the minority here--I think), so there&#x27;s no danger of looking a little skanky (a little like the ones I wore in the 80s sometimes) as long as you don&#x27;t use a ton. I was REALLY surprised that I could pull off the greens and yellows--though in all fairness maybe I should add I have some training as a make-up artist. Not enough so I could actually apply makeup to other women and do it professionally, but enough to know the basic things you do and do not do,some little tricks to get certain looks, and what looks good on me. Hint- invest in and use a set of brushes to apply all your makeup, toss the little lame mini-applicators -you know, the ones with a foam tip that come with eye shadow when you buy it in the drugstore and are an inch long I was lucky to discover this method over 20 years ago and would NEVER go back. The results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if I wasn&#x27;t on such a low budget right now I&#x27;d pick up a couple to give as gifts. The price is right, the packaging is elegant but practical (no danger of colors spilling over into each other, if you use the clear laminated cover). If you are young and only have a few year&#x27;s experience applying makeup, watch a few tutorials on YouTube. I would recommend this product to others that want to have a little fun experimenting with colors and enjoy applying makeup. A quality product barely over 15 bucks that gives you so many options, stays where you put it, and then is quick to remove later even without a special remover for waterproof mascara.  The brights didn&#x27;t make my eyes water slightly when I used them under my eyes, and I can&#x27;t say that for  many other eye makeup products-including ones that cost double the price. After 35, I found putting my makeup on was just kind of in a damage-control mode, and it&#x27;s nice to actually enjoy myself and have a little fun again doing this!

    <li> Go over and get Coastal Scents 88 pallete. It&#x27;s much better. This is so hard to get some color from it.</li>
    <li> im in love   not only me  my friends are loving it too  :)))  ya the black eyeshadow is just wat i use for eye liner  yup i use the black shadow for eyeliner  yes, you can mix the colors  i received this little bunny in its safe packaging and im really happy  the crazy thing about this pallet is that wat u see on the pallet is wat u get on ur skin   get em they are gooooood</li>
    <li> I came across this item thru watching a makeup challenge on youtube.  I was a little skeptical of purchasing this product but I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I was afraid the color would not show, but it shows up great.  When I received this palette all the colors were together, no shadows were broken, or missed. The colors are about the size of a dime but they go a long way. I recommend this product to every females, especially beginners. And don&#x27;t forget to purchase the primer to go with it as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and have been using it about two weeks.  It is wonderful.  The colors are vibrant and most of them are highly pigmented.  The other good thing is that these are very easily blended together.      I bought this item and wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot because I just wanted to experiment with different colors without spending an arm and a leg to do so.  I was very surprised that the quality of these shadows is so good.  Also, the amount of shadow in each pot is really quite a bit considering the fact that a little goes a long way with this product.  I am very happy and will order other products from Shany.</li>
    <li> I was worried about purchasing this product because some of the reviews stated shipping problems and color issues. I received a package in perfect condition (Double bubble-wrapped) and the colors were EXACTLY as vibrant as pictured. There was no dings or broken eyeshadows and the colors are really fun....some are matte and some are even shimmery which was a nice surprise for me. Really a great value - gave four stars b/c some of the shades require more applications than others to make them &#x27;pop&#x27;, but really really great!</li>
    <li> Ok...First off the packaging they sent it in is HORRIABLE..2 COLORS were DAMAGED AND AT LEAST 10-15 other colors were mixed because it must have dropped or something...I paid $17.00 just to get it shipped overnight..because I&#x27;m a MUA and I have to do a photoshoot...Each color is really tiny...and I dont know weather or not I should return it or just use it for the shoot and NEVER buy anyting else from this seller...Im really dissapointed....$48.00 down the drain!!</li>
    <li> This palette is very pigmented! I love it so much, when I&#x27;m looking for that special colorful look rather than my normal neutral colors look. I&#x27;m always picking up this one! Best purchase that I made. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my overall order and can&#x27;t wait to try on all the funky colors it comes with. I was a little upset with the shipping arrangements but in the end it all worked out!!! I definitly will be using you guys again in the future    Sincerely,    Satisfied Customer!!</li>
    <li> well it was delivered a lot faster than i expected. But when it arrived i realized that one of the greens where already broken being that it was all over the package.... And needless to find out it was, along with several other colors. I guess i can&#x27;t complain though being that the price was so low and the colors seem to work really well with my skin.</li>
    <li> I used these colors in Las Vegas last week. I am in love with SHANEY now, and I will be ordering more from this company. I love how the color pops out and sits nice and is vibrant.THIS IS A GOOD BUY AND NICE</li>
    <li> The colors are very very vivid! Whoever said that they weren&#x27;t must have gotten a bad palette. There are enough colors for some variety, yet not too many colors where you can&#x27;t choose. It&#x27;s perfect for beginners who don&#x27;t wear eyeshadow that much. My palette was in perfect condition when it arrived.</li>
    <li> The colors on this pallet are simply amazing. I LOVE bright eye shadows and the white that comes with it is actually great for a primer if you don&#x27;t have anything else to use. The colors are very vivid and they using the white as a primer the color stayed on ALL DAY without creasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly impressive for the cost and the amount of colors you get.</li>
    <li> In the pictures, the eyeshadows not only look much bigger than what they really are, they also look more vibrant. When i received this item it was poorly packaged and three dime sized eyeshadows were broken already. I cleaned the pallete and tried the rest, the eyeshadows them selves are poorly pigmented and way too compacted. You have to wet your brush to get the slightest color. Maybe i&#x27;m used to MAC quality but even cover girl is better than this stuff. Also the colors you see in the picture are not what you get in the pallete.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good color palate for a long time. I got this in perfect condition, a lot of the reviews said it came broken, and I even accidentally dropped it on the floor from a good height and not one circle broke! I was so happy! Absolutely worth the price, especially because its cheaper than most makeups. I&#x27;m allergic to a lot, but thankfully this one gave me no problems.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the eyeshadow palette due to many being cheap and very loose talc, but this is wonderful. Colors are VIVID and the shadow does not CAKE whatsover!!   Highly RECOMMEND it ;)</li>
    <li> This is my second product from Shany, and I have to say I absolutely love this company. The pallet is pretty small but the perfect size. The colors themselves are about the size of a penny. The colors are neatly organized and the perfect combinations. It also has its share of matte and shinny colors, say about 6/10 matte, 4/10 shinny. Over all this is a great product and a necessity for all people who love makeup yet cant afford MAC and other top name brands. Also, if your worried about the quality its self, its about the same as Cover girl and other teen girl companies. Over all: 10/10 :)</li>
    <li> I love love this palette i recive my order super fast i have no problem with any Broken eyeshadow great pigmentation, I recommend them</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS PALETTE FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND I LOVE IT!! ITS PERFECT FOR A BEGINNER WHO IS JUST STARTER OUT WITH MAKEUP AND WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH VARIETY OF COLORS!! THIS PALETTE IS THE PALETTE FOR YOU!! IT CAME PACKAGED VERY NICELY AND NOT ONE EYESHADOW WAS BROKEN!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> Lots of bright vibrant colors. Not the richest pigmentation once applied, but acceptable for the price. Shipping was quick, but one of the colors was broken when it arrived.  Overall a good purchase to fill out your eyeshadow colors.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is very high quality, I was actually surprised for how cheap this whole set is. And they give such a good selection of colors. The colors blend very easily as well.</li>
    <li> The pigments are no where near MAC, NYX or ever Covergirl. Each color is very sheer. Great for a young girl but not great for a professional business woman.</li>
    <li> OK,so i think this eyeshadow case is really cute  and totally affrdable, but as some of the other reviews have pointed out, the pictures make  it seem like its way bigger. theyre about dime size. and even when you rub yur eye shadow  brush against a colr, it doesnt exactly come out as you would think. you have to keep  dabbing in there. i would suggest buying a really good eye primer first. other than that,  its still a really cute eyeshadow case, with a good price. just remember, you get wat you paid for.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my friend for christmas. she&#x27;s such a bold person, this was perfect for her! each color has such bright and lasting pigment..and you can match any outfit! i was a little iffy about buying it, but all the colors came intact and not messed up even a little.</li>
    <li> BY FAR, my favorite eyeshadow&#x27;s pallete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GORGEOUS colors, stunning packaging, fast shipping, they arrived safe and sound, perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the colors last so long and blend so beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT just PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;strongly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant believe the quality of the pigments for such small price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy this again on a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> The good news is that the quality of the shadows is very good; they&#x27;re heavily pigmented and don&#x27;t smear too easily.  The reason I know this is the bad news:  the set came with two of the colors smashed to bits, and I got eye shadow all over my fingers just opening the case.  I had meant it for a gift, but I sure can&#x27;t give THIS one, it&#x27;s a mess.  My plan is to order two more of the sets, and hope that one of them is unbroken and fit to give.  Then I&#x27;ll return the other two.  I do wish they would pack &amp; ship fragile things with more care, and maybe some bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for a Christmas present and was really surprised at how pigmented the colors were. I will most definitely buy this for myself in the near future.</li>
    <li> Received this product today and the green shadows were crushed to pieces. The whole outside of the palette cover was green. The inside of the palette was also covered in green from the broken shadows. This was gonna be a stocking stuffer for my teenaged daughter. *frumps* Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> i love this pallet i have been looking for a good pigmented red color and the one in this pallett is awesome all the colors are very pigmented ...i was kinda bumed when i saw that there were numbers but hey the colors work great im defenitly gonna be doing a tutorial with this pallet and will post pics soon ...wanna check it out my youtube name is crystal420montanez check out some looks with this awesome pallet</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deja vu with this review. I received this as a Christmas present from my lovely husband just to be disappointed at opening it and finding the eyeshadow broken and dust all over the box.  Contacted Amazon and was told to return it for a replacement, which I received and lo and behold! also broken, and in even worse condition than the first one.  Not only was the Shany box dirty but even the Amazon box was dirty all over inside.  When I contacted Amazon, I was told I&#x27;d get a refund &#x27;CAUSE THEY COULDN&#x27;T GUARANTEE THE THIRD BOX WOULDN&#x27;T BE BROKEN.  Say what???  Yeah, even though I would have loved to use this product, which has very pretty colors and the palette itself is a pretty box, they can&#x27;t guarantee I&#x27;d receive it in perfect condition.  I read the other reviewers who also said they received broken boxes and I thought it was just bad luck, but I think now it&#x27;s just bad customer service.  At least they could have tried to send a third one, but whatever. I sent both boxes back and I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Shany Eyeshadow Palette Boutique (40 color) to supplement the assortment that came with my kit for Esthetician School. I could not be more pleased with the quality and variety of colors at this price point. There are more than enough hues, shades, and tints to do all the required eye makeup practices and to use for the practical exams. Also, for anyone who wants to execute some of the looks seen on the covers of fashion, beauty, and nail magazines, this kit is ideal.   Linda</li>
    <li> So... I got this product over a year ago. It is nicely thin! There was no mirror... The colors were pigmented superbly! I love love love them! I used some of the colors for hair chalking. I even mixed the dust with conditioner and the color stayed in for about a week.</li>
    <li> As long as you apply a cream shadow under or a base under then you will get great color!! I like it.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is great. To me its just as good as Mac. The colors are very bright and pigmented. Stays on all day don&#x27;t even need primer. The palet is small and the colors are about the size of a penny but its lasted me a while and still looks barely touched. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of this brand...its amazing and definately a GREAT buy. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends who love it as well.</li>
    <li> Ohhhhhhh mmmmmmm geeeeeeee. I&#x27;ve been wanting an eye shadow palette that had a good variety of colors at an affordable price. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the other palette&#x27;s with 120+ seemed like a good steal, but for me who doesn&#x27;t do crazy make up 24/7 needed less colors oddly. I can&#x27;t wait to start experimenting with them all!!! The palette arrived in a box with bubble filling to prevent breakage and none of the colors were broken/damaged. It also came in it&#x27;s own black box so it felt more official :)</li>
    <li> The colors are all vibrant and everything came packaged really well.</li>
    <li> I just received my 40 color platelet.  The purple had broken up an was everyplace.  And the brown had a chip in it. It was a mess an color was everyplace.  I see this has happen to others.  I think this problem should be fixed.  What a mess!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a week ago.  I had been eyeing several dif large eyeshadow palettes &amp; settled on this one bc of the pricing &amp; amount of eyeshadows.  Very good quality eye shadows in my opinion.  Bright colors that stay on all day &amp; stay how you put them!!  All are very smooth &amp; go on wonderfully!!  I LOVE all of the colors!</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of colors, very pretty; I imagened the whole set would be bigger still is good, manageable to get it in the purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------Jan 01/12------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well as I have been using them for a few months now I can honestly say they are useful. When I first saw them I thought they were really small but it has proved useful since I can carry many colors with me and it fits snuggly in most of my purses so I carry them often. I still believe the box is kind of flimsy but so far I have no casualties on my eyeshadows, but I think I&#x27;m also extra careful when I carry them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage on skin and pigment is ok if you know how to get the max out of them (priming skin prior to applying) and I personally have had them stand long hours without washing out, getting runny or greasy on my skin (as of now I&#x27;ve been living in a tropical country were sweating is almost mandatory, and I sweat quite a lot!) do not expect these shades to be all glittery, they are not, they cover your eyes well but they are not glittery (no problem with me as I happen to like them that way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone interested I sure would recommend it as long as you&#x27;re not expecting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) A big box with huge eyeshades.&lt;br /&gt;b) Super uber-quality cosmetics (seriously: look at the price, they are good but it&#x27;s not MAC either).&lt;br /&gt;c) A hard case that will stand come hell or high water.&lt;br /&gt;d) Brushes, sponges or anything to apply these shades.&lt;br /&gt;e) Glittery shades.</li>
    <li> SEGUN ME COMENTARON LA PALETA DE COLORES ES MUY BUENA PERO LLEGO EN MAL ESTADO POR EL VIAJE LLEGARON VARIOS COLORES DESTRUIDOS</li>
    <li> Wow! I Love my SHANY shadows! Arrived on time and no breakage. All of the colors were intact. I will be ordering this product for my daughters!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid Urban Decay user and was skeptical about ordering this palette - I&#x27;m relatively new to eyeshadows and realized how much I&#x27;d spent in Urban Decay products trying to get together a decent color collection, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot before dropping another 25-50$ on another palette from UD. I have to say, I&#x27;m happy with the results from this palette. Used with UD&#x27;s Primer Potion, the colors are true there is good payoff. All shadows arrived unbroken and well packaged. I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  We purchased it very close to Christmas day and I was concerned I wouldn&#x27;t get it on time.  Delivery was very quick and the product was received intact.  My daughter loves the colors and said they go on nice and the color stays all day long.  She was thrilled with this gift!</li>
    <li> I love the colors that came with the palette, very fun and bright and \\&quot;eye-popping\\&quot;. I love this palette, this is really good for people that are starting to use make-up or who want to be a make-up artist, like I do. The only thing I have to say badly about this product is that, I thought the eye shadows would come in the size of a nickel, but they came in the size of like a dime to a penny. They look bigger, like the size of a nickel, in the picture but they arent that big when you open the product. Also, when I opened it, the brown was cracked and spilled into the other colors, but didnt spill alot. Other then that I love it. Alot of colors in this palette blend in with my skin when I put some shadow under the brow. Cant wait to try out the 120 palette!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was enough colors but it actually worked out really well.  She loved it and uses it all the time so I consider that money well spent.</li>
    <li> at first i was a bit hesitant to get this eyeshadow palette cause alot of people were complaining that when they received it some of the colors were broken but i just thought that i would take a chance in ordering this cause i was really impressed with the colors and the price so i went ahead and ordered it. i just received my eyeshadow palette today and it was packaged properly and when i opened the box it had bubble wrap around the eyeshadow palatte. when i opened the palatte NONE of the colors were broken and it all looked PERFECT!!!! i really love the colors and my mom isnt really a makeup type person but she loved the colors too and was surprised at how much i paid for it. the delivery was very FAST too! i will be ordering from Shany cosmetics in the future!! ^__^</li>
    <li> I read through a lot of reviews before purchasing this product. I selected this one cause I didnt need 100+ colors but I still wanted a good variety. I like that it has both matte and shimmery colors. The colors are also both neutral and vibrant. I was worried cause a lot of others had their pallets damaged in shipping but mine came in perfect condition. The pallet is a little powdery but the colors look nice on and dont fall off easily. I used Urban Decay eye primer and the shadow stayed all day. I think that people are being a little rash by rating the pallet a single star just cause it was damaged in shipping. Still a great pallet for a great price.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews that stated the seller put in a gift and something about how nice the \\&quot;big mirror\\&quot; is. However, my palette shipped just like you see it -- no mirror or anything else. Just an FYI...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I don&#x27;t usually get \\&quot;colorful\\&quot; with my eyeshadow anymore, I wanted this palette because they are very nice to have, in order to do a variety of blending and what not. As others have stated, there are some matte colors that are a little fussy to blend well, but I think with an experienced hand and the right brushes, it&#x27;s possible. I&#x27;ve ordered the Shany brush sets and they work phenomenally! For the price, I would highly recommend this palette. The colors may be \\&quot;dime size\\&quot;, but don&#x27;t let that deter you from ordering. The size they are is PLENTY enough, since they are nicely pigmented. The black eyeshadow goes a LONG way since you really only want to use a bit, so it&#x27;s not too harsh. It works great as an eyeliner, as well, or to smudge out your existing liner so there aren&#x27;t any harsh lines. I&#x27;d order from Shany again!</li>
    <li> great and long lasting. I recommend</li>
    <li> I love it!  I would highly recommend using a primer because it really makes the colors pop!  They are so rich. I am buying the 120 as soon as I am done with this review. Great product. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. It is well,well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have never been a huge fan of eye shadow.  I typically only wear it when I am dressing up.  I love the way it looks at first and then regret wearing it by the end of the night because of the creasing and inconsistency of the color left behind.    I am very impressed with this eye shadow.  Not only are the colors beautiful, but this eye shadow really does stay in place.  I was shocked that after 12 hours of wearing it - it still looked like I had just applied it.  Whether you use eye shadow on a daily basis or were a non-believer (like me), I would without a doubt give this eye shadow a chance.</li>
    <li> I love this palette and I absolutely love how bright and pigmented each color is! Unfortunately in my case (and this is not the seller&#x27;s fault), Amazon had shipped my package with NO protection or padding whatsoever and thus the palette must have been thrashed around in the large box (it was a combined shipment with other items) and when I received it one of the colors were completely shattered. :( I was so disappointed because I had been looking forward to this product for a while, and it seems like such a headache to exchange it and wait another 2 weeks for a replacement that may or may not be shattered again. Anyway, the rest of the unbroken colors are amazing.</li>
    <li> 3 Colors broken, black and two of the greens, All over the other colors and all over the shipping box.    I feel ripped off big time.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this eyeshadow palette by the variety of highly pigmented colors.  It seems like the perfect choice for someone on a budget and to get such pigmented colors from a palette that is priced the way this one is, is great!  Perfect for what I had in mind, but I would recommend using a primer first.  Overall, one of the best eyeshadow palettes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> i would have loved this item if i would have got it. i ordered two months ago and i still dont have this item.</li>
    <li> I am very please at this pallet! The colors are bright, just what I wanted! I will defiantly order from them again, with no hesitation!</li>
    <li> one of the best eyeshadow the color is bold and beautiful, you get more than your money worth. It was delivered on time and the packaging is great the product doesnt dust off and it last long</li>
    <li> Okayy so I bought this pallete like2 weeks ago.. and its so so they are very well pigmented BUHHHHHH the eyeshadow feela very chaky and it deosnt last very well maybe its becouse I dnt use a primer buh I&#x27;m going to see how it goea on with the primer and another thing that I DISLIKE is that with my eco friends brishes it deoant pik up and of the eyeshadow idk if its my brushes so I ordered some from the same company they should be coming this week.. buh other than tha their not that great and their not that bad..</li>
    <li> A little brighter than I anticipated, but you can&#x27;t expect it to look identical to the pictures. Like the pallet so far</li>
    <li> I got this for myself for a Birthday gift and it turned out alot nicer then the picture. The packaging was nice, The pallet was long and slim so I can stick it in my makeup drawer without a problem.    The shadows had NO smell to them.  That seems to be a problem with some makeup pallets..Strange Smell..This product doesn&#x27;t have that...and I would recommend it to a friend...or buy one as a gift.</li>
    <li> Purchased the product as a gift.  The recipient remarked the the colours last quite long and are quite vivid.  I recommended the product to a couple of friends who also purchased the item.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and I am a happy customer. The colors are bright and show up nicely.</li>
    <li> This pallet does have some really nice colors but they aren&#x27;t very intense. I usually have to put down a primer and some white eyeliner underneath to get the colors to pop but for the cost and how infrequently I wear the very bright shades it wasn&#x27;t a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, I admit, because of bad experiences with inexpensive products in the past, but Shany proved to be a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows came nicely packaged and in a sleek, black, professional looking case, none were broken or anything. It does not come with sponge applicator brushes, so bear that in mind when you purchase (I bought the Shany 12 piece makeup brush set as well, so it wasn&#x27;t a deciding factor for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are vibrant, long lasting and very smooth going on. There was very little dusting, even when I didn&#x27;t use a primer, around the eyes or on the cheeks. This is easily the same quality as MAC products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I will absolutely recommend this to everyone I know. I will say be careful with the black shadow that comes in this palette. Even the lightest brushing with your applicator over the shadow will make the black go on very dark.</li>
    <li> This pallete includes some amazing colors. They are bright and fun to play around with for anyone like a beginner like me or a professional makeup artist like my older sister. We both loved trying out all these colors. The price ia also very inexpensive so that just added to my positive feedback. I give this a 5star for sure.</li>
    <li> The palette is kind of cheap, quality is better then quantity.</li>
    <li> I saw so many other palette and the reviews.I like to shop by reviews and i am so glad that it never let me down this is one thing i love about AMAZON that it have honest reviews.&lt;br /&gt;So just recieved my package and i already love the colors it have all the colors i needed cant wait to play with them.&lt;br /&gt;my advice buy it :)</li>
    <li> Product came in perfect condition. The colors are beautiful and extremely pigmented! I will definitely be purchasing more products from this user in the future.</li>
    <li> I just received my eyeshadow palette and although it is a bit smaller than I expected, I love it! My sister introduced me to Shany and she is a make-up guru. I am a beginner so it is perfect for me to experiment with. The colors are vibrant and perfect for the summer.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow is fantastic.  I love having all the colors to choose from every morning, and the black has been working great as a liner.  The eyeshadow stays on all day and comes off easily when I wash my face.  I have not been using a primer and the eyeshadow even stayed put during my 60 min Insanity Max Interval Circuit workout.       I have been using bare escentuals minerals eyeshadow for the past 8 years, and I was sick of the all the little expensive pots and the mess they leave all over the counter.  I am so happy I switched!      I debated over ordering the 88 coastal scents kits and still wonder if I should have ordered it since it was only a few dollars more.  At least this one fits in my makeup box and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the shipper needs to put more thought and care into the packaging because it arrived in a very thin cardboard box (almost exactly the size of the palette itself wit no Styrofoam or bubble wrap padding) and it was covered in what I thought was black soot. When I opened it I realized that the black soot was actually the black eye shadow that had cracked and spilled everywhere (and I mean EVERYWHERE) onto all the other 39 colors and all over the kit itself. When I opened the palette there was a rectangular clear plastic sheet covering the palette (similar to the kind of transparency film teachers use with overhead projectors in classrooms) but it proved useless as it protected nothing. It took a good 45 minutes and an abundance of Q-tips to remove most of the black powder off of the other colors. Since the width of each color is only about the size of a dime, the process was very wasteful (not to mention half of the black eyeshadow is gone).    Aside from this ordeal, I am satisfied and pleased with the overall quality of the palette. The pictures depicted here are pretty true to the palette in real life. The colors are matte and you&#x27;ll need to apply several layers with a patting (and not sweeping) motion if you want your eye shadow color to be as bright as they appear on the palette. I used these for Halloween to create a neon rainbow for a fairy look but it&#x27;s also great for everyday experimentation. The quality isn&#x27;t amazing or anything because I&#x27;ve used other eye shadows that blend more fluidly (like Lancome brand) but it&#x27;s good (especially for this price).    The manufacturers of this product emphasize how each compact is carefully placed by hand into the palette (yadda yadda) but it&#x27;s all pointless if it arrives in broken powdery pieces. Shany really needs to make a clear plastic adhesive that sticks to the palette (i.e. a quality seal) to preserve and protect broken compacts from tainting other colors.    If you&#x27;re lucky enough for it to arrive inprime condition, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> TRY THIS MAKEUP IT&#x27;S REALLY GOOD TRUST ME I KNOW MAKEUP LIKE SEPHORA AND THERE TYPES OF MAKEUP BRANDS THERE REALLY GOOD AND THIS PALETTE IS SUPER BLESSFUL TOO ME.</li>
    <li> i loved the pigmentation of this palette, but the damn thing gave me eye irritation and itching. had to get rid of it. could not use it for too long. ;(</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this eyeshadow case through amazon, the colors are awesome!! I have never seen colors like this in any store ( and i am quite the make up collector). The only problem was when I recieved my package three of the color had busted up and had gotton all mixed up with the good colors still. I cleaned that up but otherwise I was very happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> The colors on this palette is so pigmented and bright. Its fun to experiment with these colors. It came in perfect condition and before the delivery time. Happily grateful. :-)</li>
    <li> i was so impressed. back in april, my purse was stolen which happened to have my favorite palette in it. i was so upset. so i went for months looking for a replacement at any store i could think of, but they were either too expensive, not the colors i wanted, or just cheap quality. FINALLY i found this little baby and bought it. im so glad i did, its done nothing but wonders for me. i really like the greens and blues. ive never found a yellow that pops out so well, so i was so happy!! i definately recomend this item if your looking for bright colors.</li>
    <li> Item arrived with one color cracked. Sadly, this was to be a gift. Colors are pretty, but too &#x27;shiny&#x27; for one my age. Sad all the way around.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the shipping of the item. It arrived in perfect condition. The eyeshadow is very powdery and of a standard quality. This isn&#x27;t the high quality of Youngblood or a similar item. The colors are vivid, but they definitely need a primer in order to cover and stay well.</li>
    <li> First off because these colors are SOOO BRIGHT you should get eye shadow primer or it will not come out as bright. my eyeshadow was not broken. and it looks bright and exactly how it did in the pics on here. i love it so bright not sure waht colors to use i have teal green blue eyes but i will test some out!</li>
    <li> i recently ordered this cause i wanted something not too big but with enough colors to choose from and still be easy for me to carry around in my purse !! gotta say i made an excelent choice im loving all the nice colors especially the real dark ones !! fast shipping and so worth the money ur paying !!</li>
    <li> This make up palette wasn&#x27;t all that I expected it to be. It just doesn&#x27;t go on well enough. You have to put on like three shades just to get the colors to pop and the shadow still wears off even if you put primer on. I have had much better experiences with different brands that cost way less than this, and that doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. I was truly unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I received items on today from Amazon , for All is perfect , also color is veryyy cute . I fell assured to do order by Amamzon . Thanks a lot .</li>
    <li> I love eyeshadow, and now that I have seen this one, I can hardly wait to try this.  I can hardly wait to see how the great looking colors will make my eyes pop, and make my beautiful dark brown eyes look amazing and stylish against my dark olive skin!</li>
    <li> I am pretty new to wearing eyeshadow, so I was looking for a palette that would make it easy to incorporate color into my looks. So far so good. I recommend everyone getting a little bit of sticky tack to replace shadows that might come loose over time.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try all of the colors yet but so far I love what I got. Considering the price it was a great buy!</li>
    <li> When I got the eyeshadow, I was very excited. However, being as clumsy as I am, I dropped it soon after I had gotten it in the mail, and two eyeshadows broke. It was still in the package when this happened, which shows how fragile it is. One of the little metal circles of eyeshadow fell out, but I was able to put it back in. The colors are long-lasting and very vibrant, and I love that! There aren&#x27;t as many unique colors as I would like, but there are lots of greens and blues. Overall, it&#x27;s a very good product, but it&#x27;s just a little bit fragile.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but of good quality. If used with an eye primer, the color will stay true to color. It lasts for a really long time and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT AND IM NOT EVEN BIG ON EYE SHADOW..I EVEN USE THE DARK BROWN FOR COUNTERING</li>
    <li> I bought this pallet to get a variety colors... and this definatly did it!! great selection!! and alittle goes a long way. I use the black for a smoky eyeliner look all the time and it looks amazing. totally happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> The main photo on this eyeshadow palette is not the one you get when you order from these losers. It is all just a ploy to get you to order and buy and when the actual palette comes it is a different palette! My friend from work bought this one and she thought it was the palette from pics 1 and 2 but she received an eyeshadow palette like pics 3 and 4. As you can see pics 1 and 2 are not the same palette as pics 3 and 4. The one she got was boring and plain colors, like pics 3 and 4. She thought she was getting a palette like pics 1 and 2. This seller is deceiving and I was going to buy from them until my friend told me about it. I already contacted the seller about this and he basically told me that I don&#x27;t know how to read and that he prefers not to sell to me (which shows big-time lack of customer service skills, politeness, maturity). I&#x27;ll probably be contacting Amazon mgmt. about this seller.</li>
    <li> The palette is not what is advertised......i&#x27;m disappointed I feel cheated and wil probably not order from this seller again.  Just being honest.</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift, and they&#x27;re absolutely beautiful. I had my stylist play with them and they turned out fantastically! They were very easy to use, and reasonably bold even without a primer, plus the case is nice, stays snapped closed (unlike some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried) and is small enough to fit in an oversized or wide purse.</li>
    <li> palette was alot smaller than i expected, but the shadows are very pigmented. since i got it i&#x27;ve already used it on two different clients.</li>
    <li> I have never been crazy about eyeshadow before but I have to say I LOVE THIS! I wanted some fun colors for Halloween but I never expected I could actually fall in love with all the colors! Some of them have a little bit of sparkle which is cute! AND THE COLOR STAYS! I only tested it a bit but it was a little hard to wash off just with water which to me proves its going to last all day :) Also it arrived 1 day before it said it would! I ordered it on Sunday and it came on Tuesday!!I was VERY impressed! :)</li>
    <li> I just received this eye palette in the mail yesterday and I absolutely love it! The colors are vivid and shimmery and very pigmented. Excellent quality, especially for the price. I noticed my eye shadow lasts longer and looks more vibrant when I use it over a good primer. I used this over a coat of primer and then a layer of translucent powder to prevent caking, using the Shany 13 piece brush set, which is also great. I put it on with the Shany eye palette on 8AM and it is still looking perfect now. I like this product a lot and I plan to buy more from the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of colors for those of us who like to experiment a lot.  I also have two daughters who are working with makeup in different ways - one prefers a classier look, the other is an artist - and changeable by the day... :-)      The colors are as advertised, lot of vibrant sample sizes of lots of different colors.  As a result, I recommend that the shadows be blended with primer (both to conserve the sample and also for setting power).  For my youngest daughter, I like that she can take these strong colors and mix them with other shades to create the exactly right color for her - which also allows her to exercise her creative, independent side.</li>
    <li> Just received my palette and i gotta say i am extremely happy that i chose this one. The colors are vibrant especially with primer. Only thing i wasn&#x27;t too pleased about is that the palette came in a box but not well protected. The black color shattered but all the others were intact. Other than that for the price and quality i would purchase from them again. I want to post some pictures but  i guess the system in down at the moment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, it has very nice pigmentation and i used a couple of the colors for my halloween costume and they worked perfectly! shipping was great it came after 5 days of ordering it</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. Bright hues. A little goes a long way. Held up nicely for long period.</li>
    <li> I just love the colors its very nice I mix a lot of them and its very soft not hard and dry like most eye shadow..You don&#x27;t have to rub hard just a tap will do the trick will be purchasing more from this company..</li>
    <li> This palette has soo many colors to choose from. My new favorite eyeshadow pallette ! Shanny never disappoints, I have make up brushes by them too. Fantastic</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both ordered these eyeshadows. We both really enjoy them. The eyeshadows go on easily and stay on. Doesn&#x27;t seem to crease on your eye either. Love the colors. I think, the pictures show exactly what the shadows look like. They are small circles but my daughter and I both are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect. Mine arrived in the mail today, all the colors are gorgeous!! I was looking for something with a lot of bright, neon, colors and this surely delivered. It looks just like the pictures, and each eyeshadow is around the size of a nickel! I have not tried any of them out yet, but I cannot wait to! It arrived quickly and very well packaged. I would recommend this item for sure!</li>
    <li> this is a really nice palette. i love it. the palette i got is the same one that is pictured it just doesn&#x27;t have the numbers under the colors which is fine. it arrived earlier than expected and was packaged very well so none of the shadows were broken. it has a nice mixture of matte and shimmery colors which i like. i read some other reviews saying that the shadows go on sheer. the only ones that go on kinda sheer are the matte ones, but that&#x27;s how most matte eyeshadows i&#x27;ve had are. you just have to add a little more onto your brush and if you use a nice primer and pat the shadow on instead of brushing it on, you&#x27;ll get plenty of color. the bright colors are VERY vibrant which i love! the only color i&#x27;ve had an issue with is the black. its a mess! its hard to blend and it was hard to clean off of my brush. the colors stay on very well when you wear them with a primer. i wore a few of the brown colors to work (i work 12 hr shifts at a hospital) and with all the running around and stuff i did, it stayed on all night and never creased. overall the palette is pretty cool and the colors are very pigmented. i kinda wish i had just gotten the coastal scents 88 palette instead though since it has more colors and is around the same price. i&#x27;ll probably be buying one of those pretty soon and just use this one to travel with. :)</li>
    <li> i purchase this for myself and everytime i wear a color i always get completments.i even purchase one as a gift for a friend,most eyeshadows you put on this look dull but this comes on shiny and that what i like..</li>
    <li> The picture is not the product you get in the mail. The colors are not as vibrant, a little larger than a dime, spaced far apart, not labeled with numbers, and of poor quality. This makeup reminds me of the stuff you buy at the Dollar Store or the stuff little girls will play with. Shany products suck and are a discrace to what wearing makeup is all about. No one wants to wear clown makeup unless you are a clown. The texture does not pick up well on your finger, it is grainy and streaks. It is a shameless thing to send an inferior product; not only is it false advertising it is also stealing. I would be embarrassed to even give this to someone; it is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love love love this pallette!! Great buy!</li>
    <li> i got my order for the shadow a day before i was suppose to and immediately opened and tested it all the colors are so pretty and bright and it goes on smooth and perfectly and last hours i love shany&#x27;s eyeshadow some of the best i&#x27;ve had and used in years</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this item. Especially the red eyeshadow. The colors are awesome. I would reccommend this product to the makeup lovers like myself.....&lt;3</li>
    <li> THE COLORS WERE SO VIBRANT AND CLEAR... THERE ARE MAC SHADES AND SHADES WITH A BIT OF SHIMMER AND I LOVE TO MIX THE COLORS AND GET DIFFERENT LOOKS. ALL THE SHADOWS CAME IN ONE PEICE!! NONE WERE BROKEN OR OUT OF PLACE. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Im disappointed in SHANY cosmetics. Almost every eyeshadow I have bought have not been packaged correctly, leaving the shadows broken, and spilling on me after opening the palettes.It shows in one of the pictures that it has a brush, but I didn&#x27;t receive one. The colors are vibrant and beautiful,I just wish most were not broken!</li>
    <li> Not all the colors are true to its shade. Even with primer.</li>
    <li> Only wish this had a mirror. Beautiful colors .The quality is wonderful. You will never find this kind of color payout at this price elsewhere. Colors melt into the skin. Just love shany eyeshadow. True blendability and long wearing.Great product.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Strong color that stays! Inexpensive and bright. I&#x27;ve never bought makeup online, and I was very nervous but I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase. I&#x27;ll buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love love love this makeup!  The colors are so bright and a little goes a log ways.  Just wish they were bigger, colors are smaller than a dime but great product!</li>
    <li> THE COLORS WERE PRETTY BUT SELLER NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON PROTECTIVE PACKAGING. MY EYE SHADOW WAS DAMAGED AND RED EYE SHAWDOW WAS ALL OVER THE OUTSIDE OF MY BOX, THE CONTAINER AND WHEN I TOOK IT OUT IT SPILLED ON MY CREAM RUG AND WAS ALL OVER MY HAND. WORST PACKAGING I EVER SEEN.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors! All the eyeshadows are soo pretty and most of them go on pretty easily! It&#x27;s so quick and easy to create fun looks with all these colors! Whatever color you&#x27;re wearing, there is a color in this palette that will go with it! The Eyeshadows are a good size and the eyeshadow case is so sleek that it fits great in a suitcase for when you go on a trip! I absolutly love these eyeshadows!&lt;3 This was a great buy! You won&#x27;t regret it! Promise!</li>
    <li> The three greens in the third row are pretty much the same color in the palette I have.&lt;br /&gt;Yep, they&#x27;re all about the size of a US dime.&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Go on smooth, stay put for the day.&lt;br /&gt;A good choice for people who want to experiment with different colors without spending too much money.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive eyes/skin. At times it made me a bit teary.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, it works perfectly</li>
    <li> I recieved the product in three days exttremely fast. All the makeup was intact clean and clear... I do agree with others does seem powdery but I still havent used it yet so we will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> LOVE this pallette! There are SO many colors to chose from, and it glides on so smoothly. I personally prefer to apply with Shany&#x27;s brushes for the best outcome. This is professional-grade make-up for an affordable price! LOVE LOVE LOVE this make-up!!!!</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing. I have never found such vibrant colors and these colors are amazing. I have. Right red bangs and side bangs and I use the red in the right top corner for my eye brows and it looks so good. It&#x27;s not to powdery and not to hard. This palette is amazing. I am buying it again</li>
    <li> These colors really pop!! The colors are bright and brilliant and go on beautifully. There is a great deal of variety in this case. The packaging is sleek and compact. The colors stay on well and also show up well on the skin.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to order this product. I love eye makeup, especially bright pigments. When I received it, I opened the box and when I went to open the actual palette, I discovered 2 of the 40 shadows were broken. Black pigment got all over my hands and stained the clothes I was wearing. I called Amazon and they agreed to ship me a new one. They did, and it was broken as well. I didn&#x27;t even have to open this one to see that broken green shadow filled the bubble wrap they put it in. The pigments seem to be very strong, but what&#x27;s the point if some of the makeup is broken and the rest is stained by the broken product? Amazon is giving me a refund, which I will put toward a product I know can be shipped without being broken! I don&#x27;t blame Amazon at all for this, I think Shany has a problem with their packaging. Would not buy from this brand again.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get my eyeshadow palette, because I love using bright colored eyeshadow when I go out! I&#x27;ve also worked jobs where I&#x27;ve had to wear all black, so I&#x27;ll splash some bright shadow on to accentuate my personality! :  I would recommend the Shany Eyeshadow Palette Boutique, 40 color to any girl that&#x27;s looking for quality eyeshadow at a great price!  Thanks Shany Cosmetics!</li>
    <li> To start with, this product arrived with most of the colors broken into bits. When i tried to apply it, the different colors were colorless, i tried to miss and match brighter colors, but they remained colorless. It wasn&#x27;t visible on my face, it looked powdery, like a powder color paint kids use in class to draw. I should not have purchased this product, i should have gone for MACs instead, which was what i later opted for.</li>
    <li> Love this palette!!  Great pigment and stays on great!  I use primer).  Color selection is awesome, and I loved having more color options!!</li>
    <li> What a nice  palette of eyecolors. There are 40 colors and should satisfy any d picky colorist.  They are easy blended and the artist can custom make colors to suit any customer.  As we have so many skintones, I think this is an answer to the frustration of getting it just right. I think anyone will be pleased with the outcome.  Anyway, it is fun to use.  Remember, if you are not satified, you can return any item for a replacement or a reund.</li>
    <li> Ok, so for one, I love the whole appearance of this product, so compact and cute. The colors are  REALLY beautiful and really pigmented. I would&#x27;ve like more yellows (only one really), but mixing it with the more reflexive cream color (next to it) really makes a difference. I&#x27;m of African decent and therefore have brown skin. I tried the pigments without and with eye shadow base. With base it looks GORGEOUS. Without base however, it STILL looks lovely. I was sooo happy to get this package (ran up and down stairs to find the mail lady before she left to the post office, the elevator took too long and 6 flights is nothing when you want your product &gt;.&lt;). I was thinking, \\&quot;ugh, PLEASE don&#x27;t let me have wasted my money\\&quot;. And I&#x27;m really happy I took the leap. I wanted to recreate a cute look I saw (on a Korean pop star &gt;.&lt;) and the colors took to me (I think so anyway) and looks just as playful and &#x27;funky&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t expect this to come so early either! (3 DAYS! When I was promise 5-6) I was sooo happy this was Amazon fulfilled, because they really do ensure that the products come in record time AND it was USPS too! The price was NOT too steep at all for the quality (and believe me, I am and E.L.F girl alll the way, but I just felt like their more pigmented and &#x27;neon&#x27; colors weren&#x27;t for me, I usually shy away for them and stick to golds and browns). Another point that made me smile, was that this is a small business! Well so says the package. I&#x27;m really happy to see this company really try to please their customers. And I&#x27;m REALLLLLLY happy with the product, so very! I have not worn this for an extended time as of yet, (if I am disappointed, I will update this review, though I doubt I will be O_&lt;), but I feel confident that on the day I bought this for, it will shine and do me proud! DAEBAK (big win in Korean) for sure! Keep it up E.Travis INC aka Shany!</li>
    <li> Although I had originally hoped for the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; colors when I found this product, I was still immensely pleased with the metallic colors that I received. The colors, when applied properly, are very vibrant, and are very fun to mix (not mix together, but using different colors for a single look). All the colors are complementary to each other...I&#x27;ve yet to come across a color combo that is NOT pleasing to the eyes. Pun intended. :)  Product came with a few extras which I was VERY pleased by. Great customer service, shipped super quickly, and is so impressive, my coworker purchased a set of her own after seeing mine. I will definitely be buying other products from them!</li>
    <li> This seller always ships quickly and always puts in a nice little gift with your order. The colors are all very nice and most of them work well with the smokey eye look.</li>
    <li> i was expecting something ells when i got it but i still loved the color</li>
    <li> I have been trying SHANY&#x27;S products and I must say I really like this.  I am extremely  pleased and would continue to buy these products.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow palette! I just received it 3 days ago and have used it each day. The colors are exactly as pictured (pics 1 - 4), very vivid (better than NYX eyeshadows). You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of color either.  I also use eyeshadow primer (bare escentuals brand) before applying. I&#x27;m sure you can use any brand of primer. I can&#x27;t wait to try with my new Urban Decay primer potion.  Each eyeshadow is about the size of a U.S. nickle, not like a dime as someone else stated in their review.  This one does not have a mirror. I&#x27;m very glad I waited for this set to be back in stock. I also received a lip gloss and eye liner with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I literally got my order within 2 days of ordering it! I am very pleased with the service and I like the palette alot! The colors are very pigmented which is nice. It&#x27;s very vibrant, but the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is bc the yellow is not as intense as the rest of the color and I was really looking forward to see a bright yellow color, but overall good product!</li>
    <li> Colors and pigments are amazing.  The neon pink seems as if it shouldn&#x27;t be used as make-up.  I tried all kinds of make-up remover and it would not come off!!! I needed to use other make-up to cover it up for a few days.  Maybe my skin is just really absorbent.  No irritation or complaints.  Product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I just received my Shany Eyeshadow Palette Boutique, 40 color and I am so pleased!  The colors are magnificent and very close to the colors shown.  My colors are a tad darker than the colors shown in the image, but they are still so beautiful that I also took photos to show others in case they wanted more examples of what the palette really looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had to try the colors as soon as I opened the package.  I used the NYX Eyeshadow base, even though I&#x27;ve never used one before, because it was recommended by others who have purchased this product.  The colors on my lids are vibrant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I buy products online (which I do more than shop in store), I read every review and comparison shop to make sure that I am getting the best product for my money.  I don&#x27;t like returning things, and have been disappointed many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the colors in the palette were intact and the case was spotless.  I definitely will order from Shany again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you have the same experience I had.  This purchase was inexpensive, but I definitely received more than I paid for this product!</li>
    <li> I really like the eyeshadow palette and it is perfect for someone like me who is experimenting for the first time with some bolder eyeshadow colors than are available at the local drugstore. However, it arrived with the silver grey color pot broken and silver dust all over the packaging which was annoying. I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers mention that this product arrived broken so this is something that needs to be addressed. I didn&#x27;t bother returning it because so far I have been happy with all the other colors. I have the Shany makeup brushes too and am having a fun time creating some new looks.</li>
    <li> The best eyeshadow I have ever owned. The colors actually go on exactly how they look. I have since purchased some expensive Urban Decay shadow and it was not as good as this eye shadow. I only purchased two colors (when two of my colors from this palatte had run out) and they were not a satisfactory replacement. From now on I will only use Shany shadow. I recommend it to everyone I know, I buy it for all of my friend&#x27;s for Christmas. Everyone loves it! It works even better if you use an eyeshadow primer and use shadow brushes rather than the sponge that it came with.</li>
    <li> I am certainly not going back to \\&quot;brand\\&quot; name make-up. I was skeptical about this product as it&#x27;s only a fraction of the cost that I woul&#x27;ve paid for Sephora make-up, but, wow, these eyeshadows are exceptional. Pigment is strong and lasts all day. Great buy.</li>
    <li> The colors in this kit is very bright and i like that...overall, shipping was great, nothing was broken...everything was peachy keen. definitely buying from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought Shany makeup before but have been looking at it for a while now. So happy that I bought this pallet. Its pigments are Beautiful. It has a great range of colors. Perfect size to put in my makeup box and carry with me all the time. I model part time and need makeup that will stay all day long and this lives up to its name. Great product. A must have for any makeup enthusiast! I bought the 96 pallet as well and a few other Shany products and only had one broken circle during shipping. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> The make up came the next day so fast delivery, none of the shades were broken. Very vibrant nice colors and at first it goes on well but a couple hours later, the eye shadows comes off so definitely need a primer. Love the product so far though.</li>
    <li> Pretty high toned collection for the price, with lots of color group choices, very good for a makeup artist or the makeup artist in yourself!</li>
    <li> Though I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist, I consider myself a makeup expert, having used several department and drugstore brands of cosmetics for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love NYX and was hoping that SHANY would be similar in quality. Sadly, it was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, the concentration of pigment in each color is very low. Therefore, upon application, each color appeared much lighter and powdery. After seeing myself in powder blue, (reminiscent of the 1970&#x27;s) I discarded the entire palette.</li>
    <li> AMAZING THE ONLY THING I LOVE SO MANY COLORS AND STAYS ON</li>
    <li> The colors showed up great on my skin.  I definitly use some colors more than others so I will be purchasing this palette again very soon</li>
    <li> I love this pallet of beautifully vibrant colors! The colors are actually more saturated then they look in the picture. Just keep that in mind... The actual size of each color in the pallet are bigger as well. There are matte and lightly glittered colors which also didn&#x27;t show up in the pictures that well. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied with the pallet. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a smaller pallet to start off with or a small enough one that can fit in their purse. :-)</li>
    <li> Eye shadows are really pigmented and love the variety  of colors!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy putting on make up. I like the fact that this product was economical and I knew I could not find this in stores cheaper. I am very pleased with the colors, I should be a model for it since I get compliments all the time with my new colors. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous. I love vibrant eye make-up and live on a budget. This is exactly what I was hoping for. The colors are amazing (ever richer and brighter in person). Put a little primer on the lid first and you barely need to use any shadow...the pigment is rich and bright! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping too! I ordered it on Wednesday and it was at my house by Friday.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about ordering due to the bad packaging ratings but since this particular product had good rating I decided to give it a try. My product was perfect, shipping was very fast only took two days. The eyeshadows are gorgeous and are just as good as my MAC and Sephora eyeshadows. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors!!!!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE EVERY COLOR!!! GREAT PRICE FOR QUALITY EYESHADOW!!!!!</li>
    <li> I needed a colorful palette for the summer and this is exactly what I needed. Great price and merchant ships product relatively fast.</li>
    <li> The colours blend really well but, they were a little lighter than what i thought they were going to be,&lt;br /&gt;but all in all it&#x27;s a really nice palette (:</li>
    <li> Just received my Shany 40 palette a couple of days ago, and so far I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it! I&#x27;ve only tried out a few colors and they were absolutely grog! Highly pigmented, it lasted in 95 degree weather with no need for retouching. I did use a primer so it made the colors pop even more. It arrived in excellent condition,no broken shadows. So if you&#x27;re looking to expand or start your shadow collection this is the palette for you!</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned redhead and the colors are all great on me!  I highly recommend all of the colors.  Taking the set with me to Las Vegas!</li>
    <li> I personally have never had any problems with Shany and at least on my skin tone the color pay off is amazing.  I got this palette and I didn&#x27;t have any broken shadows and I love the packaging.  I will be buying Shany again in the future because I think it&#x27;s a great company and it&#x27;s so affordable :).</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast! The colors look great, my only complaint is that they didn&#x27;t come with the an eye shadow applicator. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Im keep purchasing this item for gift purposes, and everyone is so happy with it, I tried it on my skin, and the color you see on the palette will be same as what you applied in your skin, pigments are from really good materials. they stick on your skin, I&#x27;m in love with this palette. Im planing to purchase some for christ mas gift for all my family. maybe one of the reason i keep buying is that seller is keep sending FREE gifts via this item. long story short, lovely kit.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, vibrant colors.  Glide on and blend well.  Great customer service, too!  (Seller also threw in a few little goodies.)</li>
    <li> i love it. it has all the colors i use but the only thing is you have to put several coats because the colors are not bright when you put it on as it seems.</li>
    <li> I expected tiny slots of color that would break apart when applying my brush, but it comes out very smooth and (with a good primer) the colors are amazingly vibrant and long lasting. the slots are still rather small, but i&#x27;d say larger than a U.S. dime.. i recomend this fabulous product to anyone in need of vibrant eyeshadow (also, the dark colors, like black, are very nice looking)</li>
    <li> Nice bright and pigmented colors, you honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with authentic Shany products. I got this palette for my sister and now she wants a bigger one lol. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Just got this a couple of days ago &amp; i have 2 say i am very happy i bought this eyeshadow palette! The colors are beautiful &amp; they stay on for a long time! I recommend this 2 any girl who loves makeup! LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the bright colors in this eyeshadow kit. the colors are true. They arrived in great condition. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I would purchase this alone based off the array of colors in the palette, and the price point, if you were to get all these color from MAC would cost you way over $350.  So if you are a beginner and just starting out and would like to experiment this would be great to have, get a color wheel learn about color theory and make yourself a true makeup artist, Nalo Jones professional makeup artist and beauty expert based in Los Angeles can view web site at [...]</li>
    <li> To get the pigment I want out of these colors, I have to use my fingers to apply the color to my eyelids. Kind of disappointing if you&#x27;re looking for a vibrant color set.</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented and long lasting. Colors are accurate and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The ingredients weren&#x27;t listed when I purchased, otherwise I would have skipped it. I&#x27;m not fond of mineral oil in my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is nice-looking, a range of colors, and although the pans seem small, let&#x27;s be honest: how much eyeshadow do you REALLY use? I like that it&#x27;s plain packaging, no frills, and portable. Sadly for me, even with a variety of primers, these colors aren&#x27;t NEARLY as pigmented as I had hoped. They fade too quickly, and I&#x27;m not one of those people who has time or space for touch-ups on the go. If you need all day power (8+ hours), skip it. However, for a night on the town or to match outfits for a short time, or even start building a collection, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I picked this palette up on a whim and I&#x27;m pretty pleased! There is a nice variation of colors and they blend very nicely. They&#x27;re not super pigmented on their own so I definitely recommend using them with a primer (I used them on top of TooFaced primer and they were SUPER bright). It&#x27;s a fantastic palette for the price and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for some bright colors at a reasonable price. I did take one star off because the case has no mirror which I tend to find annoying, but other than that this is a fantastic little find!</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so stain worthy. I love the colors and shades and they&#x27;re all bright and amazing. They layer fantastically for more opaque colors, and have a good amount of shimmery colors. I would definitely buy again. The only complaint I do have is after using certain colors, especially the reals and greens, my eyelids are stained for a couple days. And that is wearing the shades on top of foundation. Overall good product, just a few irritations with it. Would still recommend.</li>
    <li> The Eyeshadow Palette is beautiful, fun, bright colors; very affordable. In order to avoid fading or creasing, just use an eyelid primer</li>
    <li> I was incredibly excited for this item but the entire box arrived powdery and several of the colors were already broken!</li>
    <li> The pigment in this eyeshadow is fantastic!! Colors last all day. Very pleased and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> English:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my girlfrined and she love it, she said that was great and it came with some extra gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Espa&amp;ntilde;ol:&lt;br /&gt;Compr&amp;eacute; esto para mi novia y le gust&amp;oacute;, dijo que era chevere porque vino con regalos extras.</li>
    <li> I thought the make up was really good. It looked just like the picture. Especially for those who like to practice make up or just trying different colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving the colors on this palette, and with a little eyelid primer, they will last for hours. I have recently purchased a make up case and brushes from Shany, and I am very satisfied with everything. I definatly will be buying more things through them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality, for the price. It was delivered quickly with no eyeshadows broken. If they&#x27;re broken an easy fix is just a little bit of rubbing alcohol in the eyeshadow color and press the broken pieces together (used this once on an old palette i received that was broken).</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was a little sceptical of purchasing this item because I did not want broken make up. When I opened the box I noticed that at least one was broken due to the powder that was falling everywhere. Thankfully the only broken one was birght orange and not something I would use normally so it was no biggie. The eyeshadow itself is very pigmented and with the use of a primer stays on and looks amazing. I will deff look into more Shany cosmetics products!</li>
    <li> I recieved my order on time and in good condition.  I was surprised when I opened the cover.  These colors a very bright, which I seldom wear (out of shyness mostly).  I experimented with these eyeshadows for a couple of days, and felt confident about wearing them.  I recieved a lot of compliments.  I suggest that anyone who orders this set be ready to experiment with it to get the best looks.  If you are one of those women who only wear eyeshadow only one way then you may have a problem.  These shadows are very pigmented, but blend wonderfully.  I recommend these to everyone.  I got past my fear, so if bright colors scare you order this and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;  LINDA W</li>
    <li> I just got this and I was trying to be cheap but this palette is great I did expect something a little bigger but this was an awesome buy super cheap fast shipping lots of colors a little of everything the size isn&#x27;t ridiculous it fits pretty nicely in my makeup bag overall I would say I&#x27;m super happy with this product</li>
    <li> For the price of this set it is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea the colors would be so highly pigmented and soft, not chalky in the very least. It has a nice texture to it and the slim case is perfect for traveling. It is my one go-to source for eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Pigmented and blend-able</li>
    <li> The darker colours are bright and nicely pigmented, but some of the lighter ones like the yellow and pinks are almost invisible. The color doesn&#x27;t stay on terribly well, even with primer. It&#x27;s usually gone by the middle of the day for me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eyeshadow that was bold in color and stayed on. I find that this kind of eyeshadow typically goes on bold but then sweeps away when blending, leaving a light tinge of color that doesn&#x27;t last. This shadow, is bold and lasts! You can blend the colors without sacrificing the boldness, and it sticks very well so I would imagine it would last all day (although I have not tested it out yet on an all day look). I would be careful with the darker colors...a little seems to go a long way. I would definitely recommend this product for people who enjoy experimenting with bold color in their makeup.</li>
    <li> the colors are so vivid they look beautiful, i had the concern they would break on the way but came completely intact!! It was what i was expecting :)</li>
    <li> You need a primer for sure. Without primer, you cant even see the color on your eyelids barely....</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented and bright. You don&#x27;t have to use much to get it to show nice and clear. But I was trying to do a blue-to-purple sunset kind of design, and it didn&#x27;t work out well. The colors all mixed together on my eyelid. Ten minutes after I&#x27;d put it on it had smeared into one big bluish violet color :(</li>
    <li> This is an excellent gift idea for teen girls. I have bought four of these to gift over the last year and every time time I got great remarks back about the quality and the bright colors.</li>
    <li> Colors were nice and rich. Package arrived fast, very well protected (with bubble wrap) and none of the colors were broken in the palette.</li>
    <li> This is a very low priced palette.  I didn&#x27;t expect the quality to be amazing at that price, but I did expect it to be better than it is.  As is my usual routine,  I used an eyeshadow primer and the shadow still didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours. Additionally, the colors are difficult to blend.  This palette is probably best suited for children to play with or if someone wants to play around with colors.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful but they are not as vibrant on the skin. The darker colors such as black and browns will do ok but I&#x27;m disappointed about the rest.</li>
    <li> I am a sucker for an eye-shadow palette and I have (I hate to admit it) dropped a couple of hundred dollars at a shot at Sephora. I love Urban Decay and Too Faced and, in budget palettes, Sleek. I am going to be comparing this Shany palette against these other, much more expensive palettes. But first let me say that for the money the Shaney palette is impressive. The shadows perform much better than some other super cheap palettes, like Hard Candy (the Walmart brand) or some of the cheaper drug store brands (e.g. Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild). The Shany shadows are very smooth to the touch, only slightly powdery, well pigmented, and true to color. Even without a primer, the color lasted me all the way through my Hallowe&#x27;en party. The shadows are not, however, as good as UD or Too Faced (not surprising) nor quite as good as the Sleek (the closest competitor with which I am very familiar) or the best of the drug-store brands (e.g. the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible eye shadow pans or the Maybelline Tattoo). What are the difference? To my eye, the biggest difference is the quality of the color blend. The Shany are mostly pure single tones. The more expensive palettes are usually a blend of tones. This is especially true of the UD, which have among the best blending of tones that I have found in any shadow products, but it is true for my other, more expensive palettes. I do have one palette with similarly pure tones, the Sleek Ultra Matts V1. Both are very bright, almost \\&quot;neon\\&quot;, colors. They both cost about $10. The Sleek palette is only 12 colors, although bigger pans, against the Shany 40. But the Sleek colors are slightly purer, slightly more pigmented, and in texture smoother and less powdery. The two palettes are not perfect substitutes. The Sleek colors are all matte, while the Shany is a mix of matte and relatively subtle shimmer. With 40 shades, Shany palette contains more close shades, making shading and blending together a little easier. Which would I buy if I had only $10 to spend? The Sleek. Am I sorry that I own both? No. In short, if you like to play with eye shadows and your budget is modest, this palette offers a lot of value for a very small price. After trying this palette am I about to go out and buy a bunch more Shany palettes? Not immediately. Will I EVER buy another Shany palette -- almost certainly yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some complaints in older reviews about packing of the palette, so I should say that my palette came inside a box and three layers of bubble wrap and was in perfect condition on arrival.Sleek.

    <li> This pallet is great, I love the colors. Only thing is that it does take a lot of layers to get the desired affect.</li>
    <li> I Read all the reviews I was excited to Purchase the Palette, When it came ti was ALL POWDER! SMASHED!IT WAS NOT PACKED IN ENOUGH BUBBLE WRAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;EYE SHADOW IS DELICATE, ONE WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE PROPERLY PACKED! From the Powder I see That it could have been A PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT! I AM SO SAD!!!</li>
    <li> This palette is great. It is has a lot of fun bright colors in it. I love the color pay off.</li>
    <li> Yes they need to change the picture, but dont put negative feedback because the picture isnt updated, the picture is there, its just not the main one. CALL THEM IF YOUR NOT SURE!! God knows how many products they have on Amazon, they cant keep track of all of them. I know how positive feedback is everything to a company so Im glad to give you 5 stars.  Anyway, The company i work for partners with Amazon too. I handle the feedback and orders, so i was expecting alot from my first Amazon order. Not only did they ship it the same day it even came with a free gift. I would love to do business with them again.</li>
    <li> I love the color assortment! I would give it 4 stars but I am a median skin tone African American (however I do wear dark tone foundation) but some of the colors didn&#x27;t or would barely show on my eyelids. If you wear the eye shadow alone it will last a 2,3 hours, well it did for me anyways. If I am out all day, I will wear a primer before applying the eye shadow.  I would recommend this product plus I have order similar products from the seller &amp; would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Love the colors...awesome product !</li>
    <li> I was watching some reviews on this product and a couple people were saying that they received their product all broken up and all over the place. I surprised to see that when mine arrived that it was intact. There was one shade that started to crack but I repressed it with some plastic and a penny and it was as good as new. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Nice colours must buy. Ladies great brand  for a night out meeting job interview day look all in one. Very affordable</li>
    <li> This is a great palette for playing with new colors and techniques. The colors are bold without requiring several layers, and they blend well. The brights are especially fun to play with, but there are also a lot of more subdued everyday colors as well that you can get a lot of mileage from. My only complaint is that the shadow doesn&#x27;t stay put very well, even with some primers, but I find that finishing sprays or powders help quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I TOTALLY LOVE THIS PALETTE! I always have problems with most palettes I can get locally in my country, mostly because they are too shimmer and I usually don&#x27;t wear those type of eyeshadow colors. I LOVED this palette because most of them are matte, but they do have some sparkly colors. The colors are pigmented and they last a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice, but the product came damaged..</li>
    <li> Hi I just received my shany eyeshadow palette and some of the colors are broken ):</li>
    <li> I do not do my make up often but when i do I love to have the wow factor. There is so many colors and I love how it stays on. GREAT COMBO!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this since it wasn&#x27;t a name brand but the reviews convinced me. I am still using this product. I didn&#x27;t open it right away since I was using up other shadows. The colors last most of the day. I do live in fairly dry San Diego, CA so I don&#x27;t know how long this would last in more humid areas of the country. I love the blues and greens. I use most of the pinks for blush and it lasts for quite a while. I am definitely planning on trying some of their other products. This was a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> The colours are just right for me. The finishing is smooth and i would recommend it to all women. I really love it</li>
    <li> I love all these colors and have used them at least once! They aren&#x27;t really that shimmery so I like that. I wish there was a couple more dark shades, the dark ones they have don&#x27;t really come out that dark. I am looking for a new pallet now, because I sadly dropped this one twice and there&#x27;s lots of missing pieces now. But overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a mix of fun colors, go for it!</li>
    <li> My sister got this an loved it. And she never let me use it but I got my own and I absolutely love it! A lot of reviews were saying it was cracked or broken or wasn&#x27;t strong. I put 1 layer of color on (over a base) and it worked magically. I was such beautiful color on my eye and I was pleased. It got here a day earlier than the original delivery date so I only waited 4 days for it to arrive. I ordered it on the 12th, the weekend happened and now I have it on the 16th. I wasn&#x27;t broken at all either. The only thing that it didn&#x27;t have were the numbers next to the colors, but I don&#x27;t care. It works and I  love it. I do recommend this to anyone who loves makeup and wants some color or just to play around. It is good for daily wear and play.</li>
    <li> item was broken when i received it</li>
    <li> The colors are not as bright on the skin as they look.. they are actually pastel and shiny...thank you but i wont purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this pallet. The colors are beautiful; some are pigmented and a few are shimmer. The pallet itself was packaged really well, so none of the pots were disturbed. I also love the look of the pallet, I just wish there was a mirror in it.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend: Without a doubt I would recommend this pallet; so gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This palette has weak pigment. The colors don&#x27;t show up well at all, no matter how much you layer or how much primer you use.</li>
    <li> I really love it this eyeshadow are perfect :) The colors are all very nice and most of them work well with the smokey eye look. I recomended 100% :)</li>
    <li> Pigmented OK, very flaky and product is difficult to apply due to the flakiness. Not long wearing, even with a base, Lots of fun colors!</li>
    <li> I use these in art work. The highly pigmented powders go on smoothly with a slanted brush.  I replace other Art chalk pallettes which were hard as bricks which is, I guess,  why someone made Pan Pastels. I am honestly not seeing much reason to switch any time soon to those. A set of 20 cost over $80.  More volume, sure, but I can buy these many times over for $80</li>
    <li> Very pigmented , long lasting I hit pan on many colors. I would defenitly purchase this again. I think all shany products a most def worth the money</li>
    <li> These colors are vibrant as long as you prime your eyelids first. I love them and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> colors are really nice and potent but the consistency is very chalky. I would recommend using a very good eye primer before application.</li>
    <li> Great variety and good quality eyeshadow.  Very bold, bright colors.  This kit has lasted my wife a really long time (~2 years now) with heavy use.</li>
    <li> love the price but the pigments are fabulous in quality! soooooo many fun colors to play with &amp; great at blending</li>
    <li> My fave!!! I plan to buy more</li>
    <li> Shadows didn&#x27;t apply well, in order to get the color as seen on Amazon you have to pile it on, thereby leaving  caked on look.</li>
    <li> This palette is exactly what I was looking, the colors are cute pigmented, excellent purchase for the price. The shipment was on time and in perfect conditions. Recommend this item!</li>
    <li> as a bigger to eye shadow this is a good start but the colors aren&#x27;t all that good. So I won;t especially buy this again</li>
    <li> Nice colors, love the variety</li>
    <li> I use some colors everyday, and a lot of the colors come in handy for costume purposes. Some colors have a little shimmer, most are matte. Fun to play with</li>
    <li> This brand of makeup is wonderful. The colors are bold and stay strong the whole day. This can be applied wet or dry. Easy to blend and easy to remove at the end of the night when its time for bed. Some colors are Matt and some are shimmer. Great for layering.</li>
    <li> I just received these today and couldn&#x27;t wait to dig in. The colors are so bright and enticing. I&#x27;ve only used the orange but, it refused to show up on my skin. I was just packing it on without any real results. I tried wetting the brush a little to see if that would help and that only made things worse. Overall, they&#x27;re not bad, they just don&#x27;t show up as bright as they look in the palette. I would have thought it was because I&#x27;m very dark skinned but, another Shany palette I have shows up really well on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is with this one though. I&#x27;m not going to return it because I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for them plus, I&#x27;d like to try out the other colors.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this item so pretty and affordable, really pigmented and love the colors so good! They stay on your lids for long</li>
    <li> I love the way it was boxed up! All the cool free samples. But the makeup is amazing I order off their personal website and I love them so much. I will be ordering more!!! Eyeshadow showed excellent and lipsticks are to die for!!</li>
    <li> The colors of the eye shadows in this palett are so bright! I love them, and they make such a great gift for friends! They are just as pretty on too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great that you can get a variety of colors, but they seem to look very sheer when applied.I have to keep adding more for the color to be seen on my face. I am a chocolate-skinned girl, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the reason why it&#x27;s so difficult to see at first. A cheap quality for a cheap price I guess.</li>
    <li> It is lovely and great colors but no brush that is what is wrong no way to put it on. I would have liked to have a long brush to go with it and to put it on.</li>
    <li> Love this eye-shadow palette, great colors, very good pigmentation, last long and very good quality. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried SHANY cosmetics before...but now I&#x27;m so glad I did! I originally bought it as an add-on gift to get free shipping with an order but now I&#x27;m hooked! The price is so inexpensive but the colours are very vibrant, blend well and last all day for me! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the color shadings and hold of the makeup, easy to get off with the help of lotion and doesn&#x27;t wear out as fast as other eye shadows, i definitely will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> For a beginner set it was great for me. Easy to apply with finger or brush. A truly great buy</li>
    <li> I bought this for an 80&#x27;s costume party with the plan to give this to my daughters afterward.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the shadows and was actually able to use several of these colors for everyday wear.  Now if I could just get my girls to return it.</li>
    <li> I am struggling to understand how any one could review this item poorly. Shany makes excellent products at extremely affordable prices. Period. Not to mention this is the most well packed item of this nature that I have received. It was sent in it&#x27;s original box/packaging of course, which had a layer of bubble wrap around it on the INSIDE (to explain better, it was in the plastic case that houses the eye shadows, with the plastic sheet to cover the colors, then closed and wrapped in a sheet of bubble wrap, then placed snugly in the manufacturers thin black box around the case) THEN the black box was wrapped in more bubble wrap, a couple layers, taped around it with secure packing tape (not crummy scotch tape) and then placed in an amazon box, with a crap load more packing around it. I almost could have thrown this box at my wall and not cracked a single color in this palette, with the way they packed it so securely. So if any one received this broken, I can&#x27;t imagine how, when I have purchased several other eye shadows in the past that arrived totally fine with far, far less packing. But if you did get it with one or two cracked shades, a dab of rubbing alcohol sitting in the color will fix a broken eye shadow. That&#x27;s one.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly is the quality and the bargain. These colors are excellent, and go on very close to how they look in the case. IF you use a primer. But that goes for any eye shadow. I use primer for all brands of eye shadow, from my cheap carry along stuff in my purse, to the expensive items in my make up kit. PRIMER PRIMER PRIMER. Makes a world of difference. But even without it, these aren&#x27;t that bad any way. Without primer you can achieve a softer look if desired. The quality is even good enough to use for make up artists. I would say so at least.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the value/bargain. Yes, you are getting a fantastic deal at this price. Obviously. I paid $9.75 for this set with free shipping (though I did spend the qualifying $35 for free shipping on other things, so I don&#x27;t know how much shipping would be if this was my only purchase) And that&#x27;s for FORTY COLORS. Yes the colors are small, approximately dime sized, but if you know how to use them, they can last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say about this, or any eye shadow? I don&#x27;t know. It feels good on, makes pretty colors, works like eye shadow...looks like eye shadow...must be eye shadow! Some eye shadows are crap, yes. Some are so dull that even with primer you can&#x27;t get the color you see in the palette, or they flake, or just look like a child wiped them on your eyelids, no matter how well you blend them. But that is not the case here. Now you can go to the pharmacy/convenience store, get to the beauty section, and go pick up some big name eye shadow quad for $8 that only gives you 4 colors and falls apart after a month. OR get this. Because this is a much better value. End of story.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that ONE single color on here, one of the pinks, looks like it was pressed against. Almost looks like a finger smudged it, like someone picked it up the wrong way and their thumb kinda pressed into one of the colors. But it&#x27;s not broken or too smushed, just looks *almost* like a slightly pressed and smudged finger print on it. Which was a little &amp;#34;ugh&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t pleased but then I thought &amp;#34;Mmkay. So someone grabbed it wrong at a factory somewhere maybe and their hand slipped and they accidentally poked one of the colors, or it got messed up a little in processing. But the color isn&#x27;t cracked or broken or missing and it&#x27;s fine, and if it was accidentally touched I can wipe that shade off with an alcohol pad to be sure, so why would I give it bad review over one tiny, stupid little thing that doesn&#x27;t affect its use?&amp;#34; and THAT is what gets me about reviews. People gripe over the stupidest, smallest things. Cut it out! Beyond that I am 110% pleased and will be purchasing many more shany items. Their brushes for one...not the best at all, but nowhere even close to the worst for the price! I don&#x27;t use them often but I keep a pair in my case for my own every day use. For pro jobs I have better ones. But their make up is fabulous. Would definitely recommend.e best at all, but nowhere even close to the worst for the price!

    <li> Ive heard so many good things about SHANY and how great the prices were. The colors are very pigmented and bright. i tend to like the eye shadows with glitter in them and this palette had some :) very happy with this palette.</li>
    <li> Fair price, well pigmented shadows, great colors. GREAT DEAL! Ha!I love this palette. I will buy from SHANY again! I love their brushes as well!</li>
    <li> this one is awesome, the colors are bright and vibrant. was wonderful for my wedding</li>
    <li> Beautiful colours, was actually surprised though that the image made the set look a little larger than actual. Packaging needs to be reinforced a little more re shipping as received 1 colour chipped. But happy overall with my purchase.</li>
    <li> THE COLORS ARE VERY LIGHT &amp; YOU COULD HARDLY SEE THE IT UNLESS YOU KEEP APPLYING IT OVER &amp; OVER AGAIN</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I am when I buy eyeshadow and I find that it&#x27;s very flaky and doesn&#x27;t go on well. This happens way too often for me. I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for bright eyeshadow that is very pigmented and goes on well. I stumbled across this palette set, and it looked like what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I decided to give it a try. The colors go on so well! It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. The only downside is that you don&#x27;t get very much of each color, and it doesn&#x27;t come with brushes. I had to supply my own. Other than that, I am satisfied. I would buy this brand makeup again, and I recommend this to anyone looking for great bright eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> There are so many colors and a great selection of them as well. They can be used for any occasion even halloween.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised. This palette is as shown in the pictures. There are some matte and shimmer shades about equal amounts of each and no metallic shades. The bottom row are neutral colors there are soft shades and brights a very nice mix. I have done a pink and purple look and a blue look and the shadows are creamy and soft and last all day. The only thing that bothers me is they don&#x27;t say anywhere on the packaging where this is made. I&#x27;m sure in china.</li>
    <li> Besides the horrible delivery method...which damaged the black colour...i use occassionally and love the colours...i am dark skinned so some doesnt show that well more recommeded for the fair skinned women</li>
    <li> I guess its okay, but not for those of the darker hue skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile and I love wearing eyeshadow and playing with all the colors. The only color I&#x27;m nearly running out of is the white. For me, this has lasted about a year and it is AMAZING. Tip, suggest that you use a primer to bring out the vibrancy of the colors. Only concern I had was that when I opened the package the outside was covered in the orange shadow and a couple of the colors (they&#x27;re in little tin casings inside their slots) had been turned upside down and knocked loose out of their slots. I assumed this happened during shipping of course and luckily not much color was lost or no real damage to the powders had been done.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 6 year old daughter to play with bc she was using my makeup all the time. She loves this. It has a lot of colors and its lasted her a while. I will definitely buy her another one.</li>
    <li> This is a great pallette. Worth every dime and more. Love it!!! I will buy another onee soon because it great</li>
    <li> nice palette, colors are pretty good</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loves all the colors in a convenient package. Some of the colors I wouldn&#x27;t use but she loves them. Great gift for a teenager.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow has a strong paint smell, for those with allergies might be a problem. I gave it up weeks after trying to use it. The pigments dont stay long, and the smell irritated me.</li>
    <li> REALLY GOOD PALETTE. THE COLORS ARE SO VIBRANT AND THEY SHOW UP SO GOOD. THERE IS NOT ONE COLOR THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND ON THIS PALETTE! I RECOMMEND THIS! A MUST-HAVE!</li>
    <li> Delivery &amp; package arrived in fair condition... A little dusty... Eyeshadow works great.</li>
    <li> This product was very good i am a brown skinned girl and the colors were vivid . I would definitely purchase more!</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this product I read the reviews which were good, there were more good then bad and  thats all I needed. When I received the product it was exactly what I ordered and intact and in perfect condition. Then colors are even prettier and more vibrant in person.I recommend this product to customers who are on a budget and cant afford MAC or Sephora cosmetics like myself.</li>
    <li> I saw this same pallet on you tube along with the 120 pallet. Late night bordem lead me to makeup tutorials on you tube lol. Anyway I read the reviews and the only concern I had was am I going to get one or two colors that are broken. I guess I am lucky because it came in today both pallets where in perfect condition no broken colors. The 40 pallet was in bubble wrap x2 and placed in its origonal box (sorry about the spelling) and the 120 pallet was bubbled wraped alot i had to take scissors to unwrap it lol. I have tried the lighter colors first and found that if you apply a base and then use a cream thick pencil liner in white or a nude color the shadow sticks better and shows up really well without over doing it. For the more vibrent matted colors a simple base before applying the shadow works great. Also if you have a cream liner in the color you want to use use that as well to help make the color last longer. its a poor girls trick when she runs out of primer or decreaser. aka me lol i hope this review helps you.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely time frame. IT was nice conducting business with you the service was great</li>
    <li> First off, it arrived in a little over 24 hours which was awesome! I bought this as a birthday gift for my neice who enjoys giving \\&quot;makeovers\\&quot; to her younger sisters and cousins. The colors are vibrant and beautiful, there is a nice variety of colors and the case is sleek &amp; easy to handle/open. I have not used them but they do seem to be good quality eyeshadow - I think they would be great for play or to wear out! All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase and am sure I will be doing business with Shany cosmetics again.</li>
    <li> I love the colors on this pallet.  For the price you really can not beat it.  A little tip to consider is purchasing an eye shadow primer before using these colors, eye shadow primer will help keep you eyeshadow from creasing and helps the bold colors really stand out! This is still one of my favorite pallets and I got this a few years ago!</li>
    <li> These colors are so rich and very pigmented. If I put on a color I know it will be there all night and won&#x27;t melt off like some eye shadows. I love mixing the beautiful colors to make a dynamic look.</li>
    <li> Very vibrant colors, highly recommend with a eye shadow primer like MAC, worth every it for its great price.  Love the neutral colors.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow, with a lil bit you can paint both eyes. Good quality. Def will buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I got my first one... or I should say I got my first box right away. It was opened on one end and was missing the palette. But I got another one sent right after and it arrived just in time for halloween!</li>
    <li> Amazing pallet! Strong pigments! In Love.</li>
    <li> To dusty n they don&#x27;t bring up the bright colour</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to buy again the colors are great and they stay on with primer I&#x27;m happy and it came very fast</li>
    <li> We all know you get what you pay for. At ten bucks for all those eyeshadows (even though each \\&quot;pot\\&quot; is small), you can&#x27;t expect top quality. Mine did not arrived broken as some other reviewers have stated. The product is very, very chalky. The color ends up all over the place...the powder scatters everywhere no matter how careful you are. You&#x27;ve gotta have your foundation brush for clean up after you apply it as it does not stay put. Also, the colours are not all that intense unless you apply lots of it, which equals lots of clean up after application. I have not tried it with eye primer, however. Maybe that&#x27;ll get me better results.</li>
    <li> I love this palette!! It has so many diffent shades of color and it was not broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> The price is just right for this wonderful product. the colors are so bright and light weight no need to wet down at all! using a little primer helps but it stays on solid all day! (not water or sweat proof) I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I received my palette today. These colors are soooo beautiful.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Just received my Shany Palette, 40 color. The packaging was neat and safe (I worried that makeup would be damaged via shipping) All the colors popped and were beautiful. I even played around with it, wish it came with a small brush or mirror, but all in all it is a great product. I feel like I got my monies worth.    ~Marlena</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered this for me the other day and I got it today. I had read many reviews both good and bad, the bad ones saying how it was damaged apon arrival. Mine was intact and had the exact colors shown and even looked brighter in person and had no funny smells to them. I can&#x27;t wait to try them and create some cool looks. I showed them to my mom and she wants one now :) Some reviews said they got extra gifts with theirs, I didnt.. I do not mind though.. Im not even upset tht it had no brush or applicator because I have many of them anyways. I will invest tho in a eye primer to see if they do show up better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this pallet a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it! The colors are very much pigmented. My fav would have to be the dark pinks and purples. My complexion is carmel so the browns dont really show up well. Over all, I think its a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This product came nicely packaged so none of the colors where damaged.  I like the shades.  This is a nice compact for the amount of colors available.  First day of wear today and already received two compliments and its only 8:30a.m.</li>
    <li> I bought this pallet a few months ago and was very sceptical about trying it out because i never heard of the brand...i recommend this pallet for ANY AGE woman..its so compact and discreet and has nice vibrant colors..the shadow lasts me all day until i take it off..i used a primer to get a better hold...and the second good thing about it is the PRICE...shipping and packaging was great, i got it in the mail in 3 days!!! it was worth the wait, i was so excited to actually try it out and see how it works..overall i think its a good pallet for anybody to have:):):)</li>
    <li> I am always on the go so this palette comes in handy as I have different shades all in one place.  I found it good for travelling as all I needed to pack was this one item for eye makeup and not several small eyeshadows.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The amount of each color is small, but you get a great range of colors. You will need to use a primer with the lighter colors or else build them up. But! The colors last /insanely/ long. Mine was on 18hours before I washed it off. That&#x27;s longer than a lot of department store eyeshadow last for me.</li>
    <li> Amazingggg!!!! Absolutely love this product! All the colors are highly pigmented and bright. They pick up well and do not creese and go on perfectly and blend well too. :)</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive my eyeshadow. I read some reviews where they had a problem with it being broken and thankfully I did NOT have the same issue. It was well packaged! I instantly tried it on and it works great. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this for my birthday and will purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> Colors are very pigmented, I love my palette.</li>
    <li> Great Transaction!  Love the Product!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful colors and awesome packaging. I was way happier then I thought I would be.</li>
    <li> Love these colors they really help me pull my look together... The powder isn&#x27;t stiff like some making it easier to distribute the colors evenly without having to go over the same spot repeatedly... I will definitely order more shany products.</li>
    <li> I have bought several Shany products and they are consistently great makeup products.  I have an Makeup Artistry Business and their makeup is highly pigmented, gentle and stays put.  The ONLY issue is the packaging - it isn&#x27;t the strongest plastic...but if you aren&#x27;t too rough on the packaging it will work just fine. Again the makeup itself is awesome and would recommend it to anyone that wants highly pigmented makeup with lots of different choices!!</li>
    <li> I got this on a whim as I generally wear more natural makeup. I figured it would be nice to have brighter colors for summer. I was impressed when I opened the packaging, it was very pretty. Once I opened the eyeshadow box I first noticed that the colors are very pretty, and very bright, exactly what I wanted. The pigmentation is very nice. The eyeshadow itself is very powdery and makes a little bit of a mess, but I&#x27;m ok with that. I&#x27;ve been wearing a pinky color all day and it&#x27;s still there; hasn&#x27;t smudged a bit. Overall a good product and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST palette I&#x27;ve ever purchased! It colors really pop without applying a lot of layers!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing! Pretty cheap too!</li>
    <li> amazing colors! they are so bright and stay on all day! I love Shany! I will order again and recommend them!</li>
    <li> Some of the colors don&#x27;t stay on even when I used the concealer, eye shadow base (mostly the soft ones). I just stick with the ones that work.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and saturation off this makeup,  but the eyeshadow comes off very easily. I&#x27;ve had dinner success using printers and barrier sprays to make them stick better, but if you happen to touch your eye it&#x27;s all over. Unlike other, my set came in tact.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter and she just loves them. The colors are highly saturated, the powders blend beautifully, and they last all day.  We&#x27;re very pleased.</li>
    <li> Please please please please please listen to me, dont get this. Its just powder! It has no pigmentation none so ever. I am saving you money. by telling you. The colors dont like what they should on your skin. Its should be illegal to sell this product on as amazon.</li>
    <li> I use a white primer under these shadows and the color stays all day. I honestly love this. I have eye shadows from NIX and Sephora, they hang right in there with the pigment and wearablity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.. only reason I gave 4 stars is because my black was broken. The entire case was covered in black shadow powder. I know this isnt the sellers fault, more so the postal service. It was tightly wrapped in bubble wrap and a tight box, they did what they could but maybe they should tape the colors down for xtra safety. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> high pigmented, lots of colors</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a palette. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, nor do I change my makeup much from day to day. But at night...this was perfect! Before going out all of my friends wanted to use the palette and couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap it was. We&#x27;re used to paying $3-5 for just one eyeshadow. To have all of these colors to mix and choose from, we were overwhelmed :). Great product for anyone who wants to change it up a bit. Love the pale pink with some of the sliver and black (to make grey) blended together it turned out beautiful on my green/blue eyes.</li>
    <li> good for the price love the colors just wish they were brighter. The color is long lasting. Wasn&#x27;t broken when I received the pallet. Packaged very well !</li>
    <li> Love the bright colors and it stays for about 6 hours or so.</li>
    <li> Very good eye shadow palette.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother.  For the money it&#x27;s of good quality.  The shadows themselves are not overwhelming pigmented, but they are very pretty &amp; still work very well.</li>
    <li> I love it it had all of the colors you need accept maroon but it was amazing shany is my new favorite cosmetic company its even better than revelon!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I received it today, the pigmentation is great when using Nyx eye shadow base. It is beautiful and some of the shadows have glitter which is amazing. Overall love it amazing product</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye shadow!! The colors are very vibrant and stay on all day (I use primer). I&#x27;ve never found such bright colors that stay on so long. The individual colors may be small, about the size of a dime, but I&#x27;ve never used up eye shadow before and its more than enough for someone like me. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy and would buy this brand again!</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter wanted this palette to experiment with colors as she begins wearing makeup.  She loves all the choices and the texture of the powders.</li>
    <li> My palette arrived in just a couple days and it was intact. It was packaged with bubble wrap around the compact itself as well as around the box insert, so nothing was broken. Perhaps Shany revised their packaging since some of the earlier reviewers received a broken product. The colors are great! I definitely recommend using an eye shadow base (NYX white creme base is only $5.59 here on Amazon!) as it really makes the color pop and stay on well. I&#x27;m happy to have all these new colors in my collection.</li>
    <li> Well pigmented and works well over a base like nyx jumbo eyeshadow pencil.  The red color stains my skin- but most reds and redish pinks do.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had a multitude of colors for such a cheap price. While the shadows may be small, they are nicely pigmented and when used with a primer they are great. Very good for the money conscious make-up lover or colorful college student.</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE ITEM I RECEIVED! I CAREFULLY READ THE SELLERS NOTES ABOUT THE PICTURES POSTED AND HOW THE COLORS DIFFER FROM THE MAIN PICTURE. THEY STATE IN ONE OF THE PICTURES HOW THAT PICTURE BEST REPRESENTS THE ACTUAL COLORS IN THE PALETTE. THE ACTUAL COLORS ARE GREAT! THIS SELLER HAS PROVIDED ME WITH SOME OF THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED BOTH TIMES I HAVE PURCHASED FROM THEM AND THEY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE SURE I WAS HAPPY WITH THE ITEMS I PURCHASED. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I did email first and was told the eyeshadow would look most like pictures 3 and 4. Each color is a little smaller than a US dime. The darker colors are great. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND using an eyeshadow primer, such as Urban Decay Primer Potion, before applying these colors as it will make the colors stay on a lot long, appear more vibrant and you&#x27;ll be able to use less makeup for a brighter look. Trust me, girls, if you don&#x27;t have a primer, GET ONE! :) I&#x27;ve added a picture of my actual set above, it closely resembles the sellers 4th picture. I like how it has a huge mirror in the case. I personally think this is a great deal for the money. I use a lot of MAC, Urban Decay and Smashbox eyeshadows, and I feel, if used with a primer, these colors will do just as well if you&#x27;re on a budget. Even though you don&#x27;t get a ton of each color, they&#x27;re more pigmented than drugstore brands, like Cover Girl, Wet n&#x27; Wild, etc., so you need less when applying.</li>
    <li> Great colors, wear nice  with primer or without. Good selection and combination to create any look. Small portable case, if you are buying this item, make sure you look at pics 3 &amp; 4 , those are the exact colors you will receive if you decide to purchase them. Would recommend to beginners, to people who like to experiment with make up, or anyone who is looking for some color fun!</li>
    <li> I bought the Metallic color set. It arrived BEFORE schedule and absolutely no damages.  It looks just like pictures 3 and 4. The colors are bright and shimmery- just what I was hoping for.  I also bought the 110 color set for my sister for Christmas.  Good quality- unlike those cheapy department store gift sets that are wayyy too powdery and dull.</li>
    <li> There is no question about this one, I really love this palette, Its almost my everyday palette, its so shimemry and shiny, besides It appears to be water proof</li>
    <li> Loved the makeup. Bought it as a gift for someone and now I think I&#x27;m going to buy myself one too.</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing. I am indeed satisfied with this purchase. The price is very good and I would recommend this palette for anyone who is into makeup just as myself. I would definitely be purchasing products from SHANY again. With regards to the packing it is very safe and well packaged, there were no damages and it came right on time. Please try this product and others from SHANY, Christmas is right around the corner and this is a perfect gift for friends and families!</li>
    <li> This pallette is perfect for someone who wants to play around with makeup, try out new looks, and get used to working with colors.  All of the shadows are good quality and highly pigmented, though like a lot of other reviewers I do recommend using an eyeshadow base to help get the most color payoff from the shadows.  I recommend NYX Cosmetic&#x27;s white eyeshadow base to get the truest and most vivid color payoff (even better than skin tone primers) plus it is less than $10, much less than primers/bases like those by Urban Decay.  The 40 colors are all very bright and there is enough variety to allow for a wide range of makeup looks.  Used with a good base, these shadows will go a long way, and will give you lots of color to play around with if you are experimenting with new looks or unfamiliar techniques.  And considering that this entire pallette is the same retail price that some companies charge for a single pressed shadow, it&#x27;s easy to see the value in this collection.  Don&#x27;t fear: this isn&#x27;t the cheap, chalky powder you sometimes find in value kits (think of those gift sets you see around the holidays where you get a cute case and truly terrible makeup!) - these shadows are small but as good as other pricier brands.  If you are just getting started, or need a cheap way to change up your look, this pallette will serve you well.</li>
    <li> The colors come out just the way the are in the palate! Very bright! Some of the best eye shadows I bought for the price! Thanks Shant cosmetics :))</li>
    <li> Its very lose cheap make up. Doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. Its kinda falls off you eyes. Didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I ordered one for myself and it arrived intact &amp; on time. The colors are high definition. Its hard to find all the colors it has in one palette. So I was happy to see that. My friends and family members loved it so I ordered two more. Good purchase. FYI &amp;#62;&amp;#62; It does not come with brush. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars otherwise its a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Love these  eyeshadow they really work and inexpensive</li>
    <li> I looooove this! It came on time, not broken and amazing! The colors are beautiful and even more than what i expected. I&#x27;m so happy to finally have bright yellow and green that doesn&#x27;t fade as soon as i put it on. I use a primer potion of course which makes these colors even more fantastic. I have already ordered more items from Shany. Great products.</li>
    <li> The color selection is out of this world.  I love this. It goes on so smooth.  It is easy to blend the different colors.  Delivery was very speedy.</li>
    <li> this is a great palette! love the colors and love that some have a little bit of shimmer and others are matte. so excited to have this as part of my make up!!</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are amazingly vivid. When applied with a white primer base they are even more so. The go on smooth, are easy to blend and are very pigmented. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Very bright color mesh well with dark color . I love these shades ... Must have if you like bright colors</li>
    <li> The shadows themselves were very beautiful colors however, when I opened this, the entire outside of the case was covered in a black powder that I could not remove no matter how hard I tried. I scrubbed the outside down; but still no good. I ended up having to break off the lid and cover the whole thing in plastic wrap so as to not get the black powder everywhere. Incredibly disappointing. Definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am giving it 4 stars because I expected the colors to be a bit brighter and they go on a bit softer... even with primer or a shade stick. With that being said, the colors on this palette are gorgeous. There is an array of shimmer or matte which I appreciate very much. Shipping was extra fast and the product was intact when it got here. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I received my palette yesterday and it was is great condition no broken cakes.  I love the colors they are so vibrant and fun and strong for a great price this is a must have</li>
    <li> My girlfriend received these eye shadows as a birthday gift and she loves them. The colors are vibrant and beautiful and they apply very well. They stay really silky and don&#x27;t crease as much as some other brands. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> nice colors and well arranged. I am very happy with what I ordered, and this company, Shany, seems to be good low cost makeups and accessories for every day use.</li>
    <li> I love this Eyeshadow. It&#x27;s a must-have ladies. I receive numerous compliments every time I wear. People always ask what type of eyeshadow is this and where can they get it. I glady tell them it&#x27;s Shany Cosmetics and it can be ordered off Amazon. Once my best friend and Aunt saw it I had to order them some as well.The number one question I&#x27;ve received lately is \\&quot;Is that Mac?.\\&quot; with a smile I reply and say NO but it&#x27;s just as good. I love it!!!..</li>
    <li> Im 25 and this is the 1st makeup I have ever bought. The colors are just as the picture .Love it will order from them again</li>
    <li> Just received my Shany Eyeshadow Palette in the mail yesterday, I was expecting a smaller palette but it turned out to be bigger so I was very pleased, plus I loved the colors. I would definitely continue to buy Shany products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that the seller included a nice little gift with some of the orders, I guess I wasn&#x27;t that lucky! lol :)</li>
    <li> This is my first eye shadow palette and i absolutely love it! The colors are bright and go on really well. None of the colors were broken when i got it either. Only downfall is that they do not have names under the colors like they do in the pictures. Worth the buy though.</li>
    <li> This palette is absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful pigmentation. You lightly swatch it and the color is amazing. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d repurchase this exact palette because it&#x27;s a little bright for me, I&#x27;m more into natural/nude colors. But the orange is gorgeous and the red. I could just go on and on about this palette, beautiful!</li>
    <li> Beautiful....color POPS!!</li>
    <li> Probably... definitely the best eye shadow set I have ever purchased. Eye shadows are very good quality. Use this set almost every day. Colors are vibrant and even more with a primer underneath. Has a lot of colors that are harder to find...red, yellow, lime green, and bright pink to name a few. Highly recommend. I plan on buying more Shany products in the future</li>
    <li> I TRRYED IT WITH MY GOOD PRIMER AND THE EYE SHADOWS WONT STICK..I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE... BUT FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> perfect for the price colors as is and they look great on,i was very please even on the darker skin tone</li>
    <li> These eyeshadow&#x27;s are awesome and the price makes them even better.. I would say go for it! I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of eye shadow ranging from lancome to maybelline...i can tell the difference in quality. i guess it&#x27;s not shocking that this product wasn&#x27;t of the same quality considering the price, but i found it very difficult to apply the colors. it just seemed like no matter how much i was putting on, there was barely any color, and it wasn&#x27;t very smooth.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for lol. I was excited when I received the eyeshadow pallet. When I opened the pallet two pods were broken, which did not  bother me. So when I got my eyeshadow brush to test one of the eyeshadow color immediately notice it was VERY powdery. When I started to apply it to my hand, the pigment was weak. However, when I used my e.l.f eye primer it made a HUGE difference. I will not be buying any shadow from this company.</li>
    <li> This was definitely worth buying! I love how vibrant the colours are and how you only need to put a little bit of the eyeshadow on your brush to get a full colour! The packaging was great and there were no problems with cracked shadows of scratches on the pallet. I would have liked for the lighter colours to be a tad more pigmented but otherwise, I don&#x27;t regret buying it :)</li>
    <li> Great when you are on a budget, just make sure to use an eye shadow primer because they are not very potent.</li>
    <li> The eye shadow stays on all day, even under the hot lights of the stage, so I had to go and find more products from SHANY and give them a try.</li>
    <li> You can compliment any outfit or mood from this rich arryr.  The small individual sizes are wise, since eye makeup should be replaced after a year to prevent bacterial buildup,  A definite bargain at the price..</li>
    <li> Im so glad i got this, they are cheap and really pigmented. I will be ordering more colors.  Good product. :)</li>
    <li> these are some great vibrant colors.  i recommend with a primer to make them really pop. i was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality - much better than expected, and good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Its not as great as some others stated, but I tried it and found out for my self. Some colors are very vivid and some are not. Its not too bad if you have the time to brush on the layers to reach the look or color you desire.</li>
    <li> I receive this product yesterday and i was very disappointed wen i open it and saw most of the eye shadow was broke it was a mess the outside of the box was full of eye shadow but i can&#x27;t return it because is gonna cost me more then the actual product!!&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learn!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sister and she said some of the shadows disappointed her but she said using white eyeshadow primer and damping her brush helped. Overall the price was pretty great. I think it has good value and I liked the packaging.</li>
    <li> OMG for the price you pay, these are some great shadows. I use all high end products, and it is expensive, so I thought let me try something different and thank God I was not wrong, because there is hope:) Definitely would recommend. Stays on for the whole day, if you dab your brush in a wet sponge and then put the eye shadows the color becomes more pigmented.</li>
    <li> My package came today when I came home from school.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this product! NONE of the eye shadows were broken. And it came before the delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;The colors were super bright too! I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> Eye shadow stays put and looks great.  Shipped fast and goes great with the their eyeliner.  A couple of the shadows were mashed up when arrived but they still work and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Shany eyeshadow palettes for the past 6 years. They are nice pigmented colors. I will continue to use Shany palettes because in my eyes hey are just as good as the more name brand cosmetic lines</li>
    <li> Second time ordered.  Nice colors and good value.</li>
    <li> This product is good once you apply eye shadow primer. The pots are US dime size. I read one review that stated the pots were the size of a nickle, maybe not a US nickle? Overall, the palette has vibrant colors, and not all of them are matte as I expected, hence the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I love MAC makeup and this is just like it! I was so surprised!  Great quality, I am so happy with this product</li>
    <li> I purchased a huge 180 eyeshadow set from Shanny and it was AHHHH-MAZING!!! (I am pretty sure its 180). I decided to get this one since it is smaller and has all your basic colors that are popular or common to most of us that are wearing eyeshadow. This was shipped to me and was very nicely packaged. The black was broken but you are going to have that happen regardless of how well they package sometimes. I really love this set becuase its so convenient and in a very nice slim line black case. I have used just about every one of the 40 colors and they all stand up to the great pigmentation rule I have. I have been using my Shany Professional Brush Set with these eye shadows and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I suggest this to anyone who is looking for new colors and a great product for an AMAZING price!!!! Thank you Shany Cosmetics for making such great products that I dont have to pay a fortune for. Everyone has been complimenting on my makeup lately too and its all thanks to these great products!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister whose skin is fairly medium and of normal skin type . She said that the makeup wasn&#x27;t of a good quality and it was not bold enough. I would recommend this to anyone of a fair skin tone and oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have to give this one star. I am a makeup artist and was looking for a pallets with a variety of colors but not as expensive as other brand name products. Lets just say you get what you pay for. I used my UDK primer underneath and the color payoff was terrible. I even used my MAC paint pot before applyinbthe shadow and same thing. Even after building the eyeshadow I just wasn&#x27;t happy. This pallet is for someone who doesn&#x27;t have high expectations with their product. Maybe a teen would love this. But for my line of business it doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> So when I bought this I was hoping for a few bright really good colors, However all of the colors are really vibrant and I love them all! Especially the greens, pinks and YES RED!!! Finally a bright red that lasts all day and goes on bright without primer. Fast shipping and Great Seller!</li>
    <li> These colors are great - they blend very well and you get an assortment of shiny and matte colors, that look great even on darker skin.</li>
    <li> Nice colors. I have to put a few applications on for the colors to show. I use eyeshadow primer to help get the job done. Am pleased with the results. The colors are vibrant and stay put.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I received this palette because I love it! The colors are amazing and I love it! So bright and fun! I tried some and it works very good!</li>
    <li> Great color options and it&#x27;s actually small and easy to take with me! Awesome price too!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s shany need I say more.</li>
    <li> I just go the product today, so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used it a lot quite yet. But I know I will be! The colors are even brighter than they appear in the photos. Also, for the price, I am very impressed with the color payoff! I&#x27;m excited to use it once I get back to school! Definitely going to be more courageous with my eyeshadow now that I have such beautiful colors to use.</li>
    <li> got the palette quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;colors are fun.  it goes on fairly well, but not as true to the palette color as i would have liked.  typically, i use urban decay, inglot or mac; it is not up to that quality, but either is the price.  it is a great supplement for those days that you want a little fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;size of each color is great.  not to big; feel like you are wasting money.  not to small; wish you had more of that bright purple that matches your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i use this all up (and i will cuz it is so fun), i will buy this or the bigger one again.</li>
    <li> I have quite a few shadow pallets but this is the one I use in most cases. There are so many beautifully pigmented colors to choose from,there is bright or neutral and matte or shimmer. They go on very smooth and last all day. FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE COLORS IN THIS PALLET. I DIDNT GET ANY ADDITIONAL GOODIES BUT I GOT IT IN RECORD TIME AND IN PERFECT CONDITION... VERY NICE...</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is far from generic. I put it on before I went to work, then went out And then I went to bed. When I woke up the next morning the markup still looked like I just put it on! Worth every penny</li>
    <li> Yes! These colors are beautiful. I don&#x27;t wear them often because I don&#x27;t wear makeup often, but at least when I&#x27;m ready, I have great color to choose from O:-). Yay :-D!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase. The assortment of colors in this palette are as phenominal as they are vibrant. The colors last all day, if used with a primer. I use smashbox, and it helps the colors stay put.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying more from Shany cosmetics! This is a great gift for the holidays!&lt;br /&gt;The cons. I dont like that the case is so huge, i wouldnt dare carry it in my purse for fear of the shadows breaking. i would love to carry these shadows with me. Some of the shadows would be great for halloween. A little too daring, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> mostly all i saw were bad reveiws one was that the colors were wrong and they were only the size of a dime so why should i waste my own money on a bunch of samples and why should someone else</li>
    <li> im black so not all colors show up well on my skin. thse colors are full and they look great on me. My best friend used the red and it really had that &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; look to it. must have for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter.  It was really nicely made, pretty and was a really good price as well.</li>
    <li> I asked for this for Christmas because I figured it was cheap enough for someone to buy it for me and I wanted to have some fun with different colors.  I normally use MAC or Bare Minerals eye shadows.  I learned a long time ago that spending money on cheap eye shadows was basically throwing your money away.  Oh my goodness, these shadows have completely revolutionized how I feel.  The colors are vibrant and beautiful on.  They&#x27;re so rich and full and have great coverage.  You don&#x27;t need a lot either.  I like to mix really intense colors with the more neutral ones when I wear these for work.  I use Painterly by MAC for an eyeshadow base but I have extremely oily skin and the humidity of Florida usually means that my eyeshadow is creased and pretty faded by the end of the day.  Not with these eye shadows, though.  I have no idea how they do it but they stay on.  I&#x27;m kind of shocked at how well these work.  So glad I tried them!</li>
    <li> I totally agree with previous reviews that a primer is a MUST!!! This is not MAC but if you use a primer first you will be much happier. I loved that all colors are represented (reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues,purples,pinks,silvers), lots of versatility. A great palette!</li>
    <li> I think that this eyeshadow palette is absolutely beautiful. The size is perfect for me, because I do not use all of the possible colors that are given in the larger makeup palette. I am very excited in experimenting with the colors on my own face. Also, I tend to be an individual who likes to get a great deal on whatever I am buying. When I was browsing through all of the eyeshadow that Amazon provided for me, I chose this one over all of the others. This was due to the fact that this item was the best price for the colors provided, and sizing option.</li>
    <li> I love this palette and for what you get its worth every penny. Especially compaired to ones sold in stores with less color choices,</li>
    <li> So so cheap....does not stay on your eyes at all.  Smear</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the pigments are strong and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented. I have even worn this shadow without primer! Great!</li>
    <li> Every time I buy from Shany I feel so happy,,, such a good palette, great colors... Well packed &amp; and they come even before the time ;)</li>
    <li> super pigmented but stains like crazy</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try and spice up my look. I must say that this colors are beautiful, I can&#x27;t wait to try all of them.</li>
    <li> SO BEAUTIFUL I RATE THESE HIGHT BC I LOVE THE PRODUCT I WOULD DEFF RECOMMEND TO FRIEND THANKS SO MUCH</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good color palette... I had a couple that were broken upon delivery but other than that it has been ok. The colors are not as pigmented as I hoped.  There are a lot of drugstore brands that are more pigmented and last longer. However the color options do make it fun!</li>
    <li> I lLOVE this makeup!  The colors are so bright and they stay on so well!  I have ordered several products by shany since.  Very great quality!</li>
    <li> I love this palette it being my first! I love the colors, the dark colors are extremely pigmented, a little goes a long way. The lighter colors are cute and soft might have to pack it on some but the end results are beautiful. I had no issues with delivery everything arrive on time I would Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> yes would recommend i usually dont use this many colors but for the price very nice i would definitely buy one for a friend</li>
    <li> I own palettes by Nars, Sephora, Bareminerals and Lorac. Let&#x27;s just say that you get what you pay for and leave it at that. This does make a good gift for a child who likes to okay dress up though.</li>
    <li> No complaints especially for the price. I found the colors to be vibrant on the palette but, on the dull side if I didn&#x27;t wet my brush before applying. Wet your brush and have fun. I ended up giving it to my daughter because I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that this is made in China and I have serious concerns about the manufacturing practices in China, so I am not sure whether this product is safe.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I received this item with no problems! I tried out the colors and they were very bright and noticeable. Although the shadows don&#x27;t blend very well and rub off very easily if your looking to just use it for testing colors and practicing its pretty good.</li>
    <li> Being dark skinned it&#x27;s hard to find colors that stand out and these definitely do. I don&#x27;t know about any one else&#x27;s but mine was packaged just fine so nothing was broken. For what I paid it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Love it for the Price... GREAT Practice MAKE UP😘😘😘</li>
    <li> Niiiiiice.....can&#x27;t beat the price and quality. Looks beautiful on my AA complexion. I use primer underneath. Love love love</li>
    <li> Many bright colors. Nice variety.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and my cousin loves it</li>
    <li> Great variety of all colors. Wears well and all day. Highly pigmented. I have sensitive eyes but these work for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t understand what I was getting. Some people said it was the picture, some said the second picture was more like it...They keep changing them so every time I visited the page it was a different item up there. I called their number and asked them if that picture was the one I would receive. I really needed the hot bright neon colors. They told me that they didn&#x27;t know and I should just get it and see and if I don&#x27;t like it return it. But seeing as some of these comments go into detail on their customer service I am not going to chance it. Great price for something you won&#x27;t get.....</li>
    <li> I have to say these eyeshadows r amazing I fell in love with them the colors r so pretty and they last all day :) this is the best product I got...i do recomnend this to every one!</li>
    <li> i love it, it has variety of colors, shipping was on time, and it comes with the two trays of eye shadow.</li>
    <li> The colors are wayyyy more vibrant than you can see from the pictures. Pictures cannot do it justice. Very pleased (:</li>
    <li> I bought this color set because of the brilliant color scheme and I was not disappointed.  I use it with Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer and the colors stay on and vibrant all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about time I got myself one of these! Nice selection of colors that go on smoothly. Definitely use primer to brighten the look!</li>
    <li> i love this palette  it is great  i would def recommend using a  white based primer (NYX has a great one you can get on here for like five bucks or something cheap) to maintain the brightness cause the pigment tends to fade with out it but i still love it  the colors blend well all matte no shimmer which is nice cause then you dont get a ton of glitter under your eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it a lot and i would buy again if it ran out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also i dropped it a few times and none of them broke and that is pretty cool, pretty pretty cool</li>
    <li> Pretty colors. Stay on well. Nice and light weight. Just amazing colors like red, green, pink, browns,etc. They even have some colors with with and without shimmer. I enjoy using it everyday or on special occasions.</li>
    <li> Ok this is my second time buying this palette! Shany is becoming one of my favorite makeup brands. I had purchased this first back in 2011 and everyone always complemented me on how lovely my eyeshadow was. After using it I played around with other brands and recently I made the mistake of purchasing another eyeshadow brand on Amazon. This palette looked just like the shany brand but wasn&#x27;t pigmented at all. I ended up throwing it away because if I buy colorful eyeshadow I expect it to show but instead was very bland!! Well a week later I decided to purchase this palette again. The packaging was newer and it was protected perfectly. I even purchased the fushia blush palette [[ASIN:B0061KQF2K SHANY Cosmetics Fuchsia 6 Color Blush Palette, 8 Ounce]]and I&#x27;m so happy I received them both. Shany is high quality and affordable. Before I go out I feel like a makeup artist. I will continue to support this brand and you wont be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I get compliments every day about this eye shadow!  The colors really look neon.  I am very beige and was worried that some of the colors would not show.  They all go on well, show well and last all day.  I will definitely get this brand again.</li>
    <li> Colors especially white and yellow aren&#x27;t coming  out as expected but some of the colors are very nice and pigmented</li>
    <li> When your looking for a kit with a nice variety to choose from for a goo price this is it. Also this is both matte and shimmer. so best of both worlds. great for just starting out or as a basic keep in a back up bag.</li>
    <li> So I thinking $8.00?? yeah this would something my 7 yr. old would end up with. But then I received this palette and was so please with the product. I will be definately be making another purchase for Shany Cosmetics, AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 17 year old sister for Christmas along with the NYX eyeshadow base, which makes the colors oh so very vivid. She loved them, and so do I. In fact, I may end up buying some for myself!</li>
    <li> I am always in the market for a bargain when it comes to makeup. In my experience cheap shadows don&#x27;t hold up, but Shany has changed my mind completely. If I were to compare these shadows to another brand I&#x27;d liken them to MAC. They&#x27;re excellent for blending, have a creamy yet not texture &amp;  the staying power is unbeatable. I use these in my kit everyday &amp; plan to add more!</li>
    <li> This palette is actually much better quality than expected. The colours are decently vibrant - And match the picture pretty accurately. The eye shadow goes on well and feels and looks smooth, And the palette will last you quite awhile as well.&lt;br /&gt;Also another good thing is the size, It fits perfectly in most of my medium sized purses and it&#x27;s a good travel palette as well- Sturdy, Thin, But great. Good value if you want a palette and will fit the most picky make up lovers.</li>
    <li> Long lasting love the colors...smiling again thanks shany</li>
    <li> I was incredibly pleased when I received this palette. The packaging was perfect and all the shadows were intact. However I do wish the darker shades were more vibrant. But, all in all, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> when I got it in the mail, all the colors were all mixed up, the make up was all over the place it was a big messy mess. I wasted my money ordering it!! :(</li>
    <li> Lots of random colors that don&#x27;t go with much</li>
    <li> Works really well if you have a base! ( like NYX milk) Then the pigments really stick and last. If you don&#x27;t use a primer or base, then the colors will apply. But wont last. I think it&#x27;s a great pallet I really do. The colors are great. Like I said. Just make sure you know a thing or two about makeup before buying.</li>
    <li> As an amatuer ballroom dancer, I am always needing dramatic eyes for performances. This palette lends every color you could need for any application from totally soft to very dramatic! Highly recommend. Used with the NYX eye shadow base, the colors stay forever and don&#x27;t crease!</li>
    <li> Yes, there is a wide array of colors, But... they are tiny, obnoxious colors that  chalk up and don&#x27;t stay on your brush.  Bottom line, if you like makeup  and you want to play, this is your palette, otherwise it&#x27;s not an every day for most women.  I would suggest using this for Halloween makeup.  TIP:  Do yourself a favor and use loose powder under your eyes as the fallout from these shadows is pretty heavy and you will end up having to redo your face makeup. I would also suggest a primer since the colors do wear off after several hours  and will not last  for the duration of an evening out.  Hope this helps</li>
    <li> This palette was so soft i had never had eyeshadow this smooth feels like mineral powder and was a great price as well</li>
    <li> vibranmtes colors look good but do not shine matte bone</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know jack about this item personally. Bought it as a gift, the person loved it. End of the story.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I am a person who always seeks the brightest, boldest colors. I am very pleased with the darker colors, such as the purples. The lighter shades seem a little bit muted, but that&#x27;s okay because I didn&#x27;t buy the palette for those colors in particular. The price is exceptional and if you are someone who likes to match your eyeshadow to what you are wearing, you will be set with the Shany 40 color eyeshadow palette without breaking the bank. I do wish that there were more shades of orange, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few years back, &amp; it was in perfect condition,&lt;br /&gt;no cracks or damage to the colors. When you see how bright the colors are in the package,&lt;br /&gt;beware that they aren&#x27;t super bright. If you want bright colors that pop, I strongly suggest using a good eyeshadow primer!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is an amazing purchase, I use it every day to highlight my eye&#x27;s natural color, or for some playful pop!&lt;br /&gt;There are a few earthy tones to choose from, so you can go from chic &amp; edgy to relaxed &amp; warm quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: GREAT for makeovers. xx</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Shany eyeshadow palette-40 color. First let me say, I was very impressed with the wrapping of the product,it ensured that the item was handled with extreme care. Shipment was lightning fast and received on time. Product is amazing and is as described.  I will definitely purchase more Shany products. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This palette is so amazing for the price you pay. I will continue to buy this. The colors are outstanding and well pigmented!</li>
    <li> Some of the colors, like the blues, have great pigment, while others, like purple, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously for the price, it will not be like pricier brands, but some of the colors in this palate are useless because they have very little color, even when a primer is used.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it the colors are so vibrant and blends so well i can mix them or go night or day time looks.lol. Kisses</li>
    <li> The colors are so nice, wanted to try a small one before ordering a large one, very nice for beginners in make up.</li>
    <li> Not much to say great kit.  I have been able to do a ton of looks and the quality is really good.  All you need is an eye shadow primer, so it doesn’t come off and you’re on your way.  You can do smokey eyes in a ton of different colors.  I do a natural smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;The case is actually pretty quality too, as I dropped it onto tile and most of the time that would be it, gone.  It actually held up, I only lost one color.  The packaging is really good and they really protected the product.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> i love the selection of colours but i wish there was more to the size of the colours. i was hoping that the discs were a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Nice and so many colors</li>
    <li> Recived it with powder all messed up inside. Did not use.</li>
    <li> ......they are nice but they so have a tendency to crack and break easily. But i do like the colors athey are vibrant and beautiful .</li>
    <li> Just received this today and was so excited and it did not disappoint me, it came in perfect condition, very happy with this palate, haven&#x27;t try any of it yet, but I will and will be back to update it for you guys :)</li>
    <li> It comes with a lot of wrapping paper, which it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was okay with this because it&#x27;s for a present. A teenager. But when I opened it to check it and see if it was what I bought, I found this information inside that they are approved by PETA. That means obviously they haven&#x27;t used animals to test their products and that was so important to me so I from now on love SHANY.</li>
    <li> love this the colors are really bright and bold specially over white eyelines dont need much and the color holds up for along time over the white eyeline fade out faster if you dont use a base to hold it with.any base will work used white eyeliner or stick concealer</li>
    <li> Thank you so much!! Arrived in perfect conditions!!!</li>
    <li> tiene hermosos colores tal como se ve en la imagen y se marcan muy bien en los parpados cuando se aplica, perfecto para hacer múltiples combinaciones</li>
    <li> got this today- very excited to use it- they colors were all intact, bright, perfect. good selection of eye shadow for a cheap price- definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> The 40 eyeshadow colors are just beautiful! The case itself that they came in was carefully packaged and had lots of bubblewrap around it to make sure it was safe on it&#x27;s way to my door. Great product and I will be ordering more from this company!</li>
    <li> It really does have a nice pigmentation. Not bad!</li>
    <li> I love these colors, I use them all the time. This pallet is much more pigmented than I anticipated and I love that. Clearly you don;t have spend a ton of money to get a ton of value.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of colors to have if u like wearing bright colors! It has colors that are very hard to find good quality eyeshadow that both looks good and lasts well! This set of colors has surprised me in the way that it does both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing i loved about this set was that it has the bright colors that you want to stand out but it also has blending colors and others you want to tone the brights down or to mix with them (blacks greys whites peach etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors i got were identical to the color set shown in the picture and they came in great condition. :)</li>
    <li> This makeup palette is very cheap and inferior. You can get better deal for that money. BAD, BAD, BAD product. PLEASE, DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I loved it this eyeshadow palette. The colors are wonderful and I really recommend this item for everyone that are looking for different eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette is amazing! I haven&#x27;t tried out all the colors but so far from what I&#x27;ve seen the colors are really pigmented. The packaging it came in was very nice and none of the shadows were broken. The only downside is the palette is a little bit hard to open.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set. I own Sephora eyeshadow and hate how it flakes off and the colors are not vibrant enough. This set has the perfect vibrant colors I was looking for and it doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
    <li> Lots of different colors to choose from! Some are shimmery. Works well for eyeliner too. I use this palette almost every day. I love it.</li>
    <li> I got it through my Husbands Amazon prime add on.The delivery was pretty quick, but I was very dissapointed with the packaging. The box was twice wrapped even then the eyeshadows were damaged. The pigments were pretty nice, but could be better.</li>
    <li> Wow, really impressed with the quality of these shadows. Highly pigmented and goes on smoothly and evenly. Great deal!</li>
    <li> Just looking at the picture online is difficult to gauge the colors of this set, even with the description.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are really bright...and at my age (I am a senior citizen!), I&#x27;m just not bold enough to try the bright colors.&lt;br /&gt;There are some I can use, though and they look good and stay on long.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price - I use this for costume makeup and not for everyday use; it is not high enough quality to use every day.</li>
    <li> Great size! so u can carry it with you anywhere, the colors are great! and enough to come up with a gorgeous look!</li>
    <li> I like it. The colors are very bold.</li>
    <li> Arrived in two days. Package was well rapped and secure. Didn&#x27;t have an issues. Already have more on the way.</li>
    <li> I like the various colors that are offered. All are bright and work well with my skin-tone. Have to use a lot to get the vibrancy of the color. I thought the amount of the shadow given per circle would have been a little bigger but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price! Delivery received in 7 days.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Iv&#x27;e had this for 7 months now and still going strong, I love the colors and they are still as bright and vibrant as the day i got them. Iv&#x27;e even dropped it a couple times in the sink using it. If it came with a mirror it would make it even better, but I still love it!!</li>
    <li> Since the price was so cheap, I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first. Delivery was fast. All the colors show up as on the pallete and pictures. I cannot believe the price. I will definetly repurchase and will reccomend to friends and family. Stock up before the price rises!</li>
    <li> Very matte, and I still never figured out how to get the colors to pick up pigment. Gave it to my step daughter. Did nothing for me...</li>
    <li> Color is vibrant and very worth the purchase. I recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s just starting out with blending and highlighting because the colors blend easily.</li>
    <li> I received this and one of the colors were broken and left a big mess in the box and in the case. The colors are very pigmented with or without primer. Its lightweight, compact and all in all a good product. I would recommend this but I should have ordered a palette with more colors.</li>
    <li> Colors were bright and beautiful. Recommend getting it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I ordered and it had all the colors depicted in the picture. The colors are all matte except for silver, which is expected, and they are easy to apply. Will definately purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love the colors they are highly pigmented obviously only with primer im using the urban decay potion primer</li>
    <li> The products were absolutely awesome. I loved the way it was packaged, very neat. I was very skeptical about ordering eyeshadow palettes online because of the terrible reviews I&#x27;ve heard but I was EXTREMELY impressed with the products. I also love the fact that the products came much faster then I thought. Please feel to contact me in the future if you need me to review cosmetic products. Email: mandi04mandi@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> Cuántos colores! una paleta muy versátil para la creación de diferentes looks. Solo tuve inconvenientes con un rosa que me costó un día sacarlo.</li>
    <li> Got these in the mail pretty fast, had great packaging so nothing was broken when I opened it up. The colors are amazing, they look just like the pictures. Stay on pretty long too! It fits nicely in my purse so I can bring it if I want to do any touch ups. Glad I bought this product, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the hhis eyeshawdow!! It goes on smooth and prefect</li>
    <li> When I opened up the palette, the black was broken and had floated around onto the other colors. I think I got to it in time. I&#x27;m sure the other colors are fine but it pissed me off. Of all the ones to break and get into the pretty, light colors, the black one! Grrrr &amp;#62;:I All the other reviews said things were broken - and it&#x27;s true. It was packaged nicely though. The seller tried their best obviously.</li>
    <li> Loved the variety of colors, kinda wished that it came with an applicator , but is great overall.</li>
    <li> Heads up to anyone that purchases this from the seller Makeup &amp; Gift Shop.  In the picture, the product is clearly a palette of colors.  However, I received a small box of pigments that were in pots.  Yes, there are 40 of them, but they are improperly marked as a color palette when they are in fact separate pots of eyeshadow.  My photo shows what I actually got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m not going to be one of those ignorant reviewers that leaves one star because I &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t get what I want.&amp;#34; No, what I got is simply the potted version of the palette (maybe the palette is discontinued?).  The quality of the product is impressive.  Each color is very pigmented and blendable.  My only concern is that, since they are in pots, the application process is really messy.  The shadows are a super fine (almost powder) consistency so they love to fall off the brush and get everywhere. Also, the plastic pots the product comes in feels like they will break easily, so be careful not to drop them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and the color array is awesome.  But I wanted to make a review letting others know that you might not get what&#x27;s in the picture. 4 stars for quality; one star off for being inaccurately portrayed.</li>
    <li> I love those colors im in Puerto Rico and this brand are unknown and all my friends love the colors and the pigmentation. Is a good product.</li>
    <li> I really love this item i purchased.  It did not disappoint.  I just wish it were smaller. Have been using ever since!! Great product.</li>
    <li> Great colors but it had one color broken and it had land in some of the other color but other than that it was great</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette the colors are gorgeous I have used this for a long time.  Also it stays on all day which I love my lid might crease a bit but not bad.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun colors for bold eye shadow looks. It is long lasting and bright. Should be used with an eye shadow base, though, to enhance the color.</li>
    <li> i was kinda scared ordering eyeshadow through the mail because i was afraid of the color breaking. It was in perfect condition. came in on time. and a good price!!! wonderful gift for any girl!</li>
    <li> only one was completely broken and one was only missing some. I love the colors there are a wide range and not just different shades of the same color.</li>
    <li> I recieved this one in gd shape. :)</li>
    <li> One of the best palettes I&#x27;ve ever used. Color is bright and vibrant even without primer.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors perfect for all colors of what ever I wear and all creative designs just perfect and no animal testing love that</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it ZERO stars, some of my shadows were BROKEN. All the colors are sheer and hardly any pigment! I have yellow undertoned skin, and these colors looked AWFUL on me!</li>
    <li> I like it but I need to find a product to go with to make the colors last longer what I have is not working with it</li>
    <li> Very well Pigmented! over all a Great Product!!</li>
    <li> It was good..I like it</li>
    <li> This is a good palette for beginners like me.</li>
    <li> They are perfect, matte, bright colors and other</li>
    <li> Awesome! came on time and as it is makeup i was worried about it being broken or cracked - everything was in great shape - can&#x27;t wait to put it it to use &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Colors are vivid, pigmented,and pops with eye primer. I wanted something small in case I didn&#x27;t like it. Gave it a practice run and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she loved it.  She usually buys MAC but still liked this economical palette.  I think its a good buy.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying because some people said that it came broken but mine was fully intact! It is a great product but I do recommend some eyeshadow primer. Also to the reviewers who rated one star because it came broken that&#x27;s Amazon&#x27;s fault so you shouldn&#x27;t downgrade just because your delivery service messed up. But that&#x27;s all and I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette on the 7th of August and received it today, the 9th. It was wrapped very securely and arrived safely so 5 stars for the shipping and handling. I haven&#x27;t tested all of the colors as yet but the ones I did test were highly pigmented and very beautiful. I&#x27;m of African-American descent with a very dark complexion, so finding colors, make-up really, that really suits my skin is very hard, but these colors came out brilliantly. I do use an eye-shadow primer because colours tend to fade on my skin, but even without it these lasted for quite a while. Each color is about the size of a dime and there is a very good variety. I highly recommend this palette.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how bright and long lasting the colors are! I bought this for roller derby, so I can do some really cool makeup for my bouts and I am impressed that the color doesnt fade or sweat off as the game goes on! I have sensitive skin and was worried it may cause allergies, and it didnt! The sizes/amounts are great, packaging was perfect, and it came earlier than expected. I would definitely buy from again and high reccommend.</li>
    <li> I love this giant array of eye shadows.  The only thing I have trouble with is making the decision each day on which one to wear.  The colors I&#x27;ve used so far (about half) have all been very vibrant.  You don&#x27;t get much of each color- each cirle is about the size of a dime, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love how pigmented these shadows are. They go on so well and smoothly. I love all the fun colors in this palette for any event or season! I would TOTALLY recommend this to everybody in the world if I could! These definitely work with sensitive skin, mine didn&#x27;t react at all. This palette lasts me a long time... LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it arrived appearing exactly as it does online. I made this purchase along with a Shany brush set, and I would absolutely recommend this product. The colors come out vividly -  just wish there were more! Great pallet to have for any occassion. I was also concerned about the packaging or receiving broken pallets, but I my package arrived ahead of time, and in perfect condition. I am looking forward to trying more Shany Products!</li>
    <li> 40 bright shadows, that are long lasting. If you love the Party Girl palette you will love this one. Shany products are twice as good as some of the leading brands.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail today,it was a gift from my Amazon wishlist. To be honest this palette was added on my list as an extra,when I added a set of Shany brushes. I&#x27;m in shock at how well this stuff works! Even with very little primer,the colors pop! I&#x27;m a makeup snob and tend to buy only high end products,but this seriously proved that sometimes you can get a lot of bang for your buck! The colors are bold,and on trend and you get quite a bit,it&#x27;s a large round nickel sized tight pressed pigments. I will be ordering more from this company,and plan on doing a great review on my blog!</li>
    <li> I loved the color and how they lay,on my eyelid would deff. Ive been Recommending this to friends since ive bought it</li>
    <li> The colors are bold &amp; bright. I was surprised by the quality. Previous reviews say it wears off, I would disagree. I only moisturize my face in the morning &amp; do not use a primer and it stays all day. The colors a very vibrant &amp; fun. I especially like the pinks &amp; blues in this palette.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. She has been having fun with different color combos, many that look really good that she said she wouldn&#x27;t have bought before.</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I received this in the mail.  I had been waiting for it since December because of it being held due to a book I preordered.  Sadly it came broken.</li>
    <li> thank you for the rapid delivery colors are gorgeous</li>
    <li> For the money you really can&#x27;t beat these eyeshadows. The colors are vibrant as pictured and the pigments on the skin are just as bright. I&#x27;ve made sure to use a primer first to make sure they keep their color and for the most part they do. Eyeshadows rub off easily on me so I know it&#x27;s not just these shadows. The palette came pretty quick as well, got the two day shipping and they came in two days. So, so far I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this palette! The colors are beautiful and last well for this price...... Yes, I am a freak for MAC eyeshadow, so I know what good eyeshadow looks like...... This here, is VERY VERY nice for this price! I love it!</li>
    <li> Some of my palettes were messed up.</li>
    <li> I bought this to experiment with colors other than the normal brown eye shadow I have worn 20 years. This is a great way to try new looks without spending more money on single shade pots. Overall I learned that brown looks best on me - haha!</li>
    <li> i don&#x60;t know to much about it but my wife loves it, it looks very well on her, its easy to carry and all for a good price!</li>
    <li> love the colors! so bright yet suttle because they dont go on too strong. such a cool palette. Good for all ages</li>
    <li> This palette has an array of colors but they fail to stay on for an entire evening. The colors look highly pigmented when you open the palette but once you actually apply them, then that&#x27;s a different story. Not sure if you can use them for a base when applying better quality eye-shadow but that will be what I use it for...(You get what you pay for!)</li>
    <li> Colors are great, very soft &amp; pigmented. Gave a set to my cousin, she loves it as well. these colors remind her of easter they&#x27;re so bright.</li>
    <li> the colors are very pretty and last a long time even without primer! its a great product. I hope you like it</li>
</ol>
