<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This makeup is the best makeup I have ever tried hands down!  I apply it with a brush and it blends PERFECT every single time.  I can&#x27;t see myself going to another brand!</li>
    <li> The color was off. Looked counterfit or old.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I purchase this sooner?&lt;br /&gt;It comes on white, like an actual cream, and changes on your face into a miraculous foundation. I know, I come off a bit weird, but this is the absolute best BB Cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase this forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, I have severely dry skin, and it treats it well. Does it mask things? It does!)</li>
    <li> Very light and natural make up.It makes you look as if you were wearing nothing, however adds in light to your skin. I also dont leave my home without first applying the 100% Sun block on my skin, by Banana Boat!. I see my skin so beautiful and shinny, the more natural look I get the more complements I received.</li>
    <li> I am currently using Garnier BB cream light/medium for combo skin and love it. I have combo skin that leans towards oily. This L&#x27;Oreal BB cream combats that well, but I think it may be a little too drying for combo skin. For oily skin or sweaty days, it&#x27;s great. I was advised to get medium, even with my relatively fair skin. It&#x27;s a great match. Overall, I would get again, but prefer Garnier&#x27;s product for most days, most uses, especially wirH the SPF in there. The L&#x27;&#x27;Oreal is a great second choice most days, and a first choice on hot days.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite B&amp;B cream . It is the first time I buy the medium . Usually I use the light but nothing beats it . It covers every single black head you have on your nose. I have tried other ones that are more expensive and did not like them . I highly recommend this one, look now more . Great price great product!</li>
    <li> I am torn how to rate this product. I absolutely love this stuff- goes on smooth, great even coverage, and can be worn with no other foundation for a nice, natural look. That said, it does help foundation stay longer. I wore it all summer and loved it! But, as my tan faded and my normal light skin tone returned in September I found that I absolutely couldn&#x27;t wear this anymore. It was WAY too dark for my skin. So, I bought the lightest one they make and that was still too dark. C&#x27;m on L&#x27;Oreal- make one for us gals with truly ivory skin... PLEASE!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It seems to work well although I thought that it would help even out my skin more.</li>
    <li> I love this product. in a nutshell I will just say that it actually works and blends in with my skin. it is more like a fondation and can not double as concealer.</li>
    <li> people buy this wonder cream I love it that&#x27;s actually my first time trying and believe it or not this wonder right here erased at least 6 years of my face instantly. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it but what ever it is my face and bb are very best friends from now on</li>
    <li> This is a very good product....very good coverage and smooth. Matched my skin tone and blended well. I like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s totally replaced my foundation makeup.  Leaves my skin soft, covers well without looking cakey and doesn&#x27;t oil up my skin later in the day quite as much as all other makeup I&#x27;ve used.  Some reviews I read mentioned rough texture, granular beads, etc., but mine has been smooth as silk and glides on quite easily.  Not sure why the difference in experiences.  Different strokes for different folks I reckon.</li>
    <li> I bought this BB creame for myself but it got discovered from my daughter later and the creame disappeared out of my bathroom. So I had to order it again. It makes a fllaweless skin without the heavy feeling of a liquid make up.</li>
    <li> I will never go without this product.  Puts a wonderful finish on my skin.  I have tried other products that are way more expensive.  I went back to this BB cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have a somewhat light olive toned skin and use the medium.  It blends like magic, just like the name suggests.  It comes out a sort of creamy white with specks of colour, and once you apply it, it evens skin tone and covers mild blemishes really well, leaving a natural-looking complexion, even with a re-apply later in the day.  It&#x27;s a staple in my makeup kit for sure, I think I&#x27;m on my 4th tube!</li>
    <li> I am a recovering beauty junkie. I have a ridiculous amount of products and have tried just about everything. Of all the BB Creams I&#x27;ve tried including the high end ones like Philosophy, Urban Decay, Smashbox, Stila, etc. this is the best. I call it Photoshop in a Bottle. It goes on light and blends your imperfections perfectly. It leaves your skin with a glow. I had a doctor&#x27;s appointment where I was told to not wear makeup but of course I couldn&#x27;t go out wearing nothing so I had a tiny bit of this on. The doctor asked several times about what I used on my skin and commented on how glowing and perfect it looked. Believe me, my skin is anything but. It&#x27;s 100% the cream. I will buy this product for life. You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for quite awhile...I love it  and I got a better price on here.  I had to order four to get the Prime rate but that&#x27;s okay because my daughter loves this cream too.  I use the medium color because  it gives you a natural looking tan. If you put it on immediately after you put moisturizer on it goes on smoothly and without pulling your skin.  Sometimes a dab of water works too.</li>
    <li> I love the finish of this BB in my skin, at first I thought it was kind of light, but it turned out to be perfect for my tone.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am really amazed at this cream. Just a little dab under my eyes takes years off and masks the circles under my eyes. Really great product that I won&#x27;t be without now. Blends really well so I don&#x27;t have to wear anything else and I don&#x27;t have to wear it all over my face either.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it does not cause me to break out. If I could give it 10 stars I would because it is so gentle on my sensitive skin; nearly all makeup makes me break out. I have used many BB creams but if I were forced to use one for the rest of my life, this would be it. I have some sun spots, age freckles, and a little acne scarring. This BB cream comes out as a silver looking liquid and when put on your face magically transforms, matching facial color perfectly. This can be used as an everyday light makeup look or can be mixed with other products for a glamorous night look (a sexy shimmering night look). When going out, I apply a thin layer of L&#x27;Oreal Magic as a base/ primer because of its primer qualities; I then apply a thin layer of Physicians Formula BB cream and Physician Formula organic powder to set the makeup and give my face a matte finish- followed by a little bronzer in flattering regions. The makeup stays all night long, while dancing or whatnot and comes off easily before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Meijer but I would definitely but it on Amazon because it&#x27;s less expensive</li>
    <li> it is what i was expecting i love this product it will make any skin very smooth&lt;br /&gt;and lines free +++++++++ it does it to me  :))))</li>
    <li> Very thin formula, and no SPF like most BB creams have. I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different brands and I like this the least.</li>
    <li> its helps but it is very orange, i&#x27;ve used the light for some time but got a tan so decided to get this since the light was now too light but it&#x27;s very orange i had to load up the foundation to even it out. i wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have never used a B.B. cream as part of my daily makeup regimen but am so glad I began.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I smooth if on first before using my foundation and it makes my skin look way more flawless than before. I just tried this on a hunch and it has worked out so I wanted to tell other people about it in case they are unfamiliar with these types of creams.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product !! It&#x27;s light feeling and great coverage</li>
    <li> So the coverage is nice but if you have oily skin. It won&#x27;t be for you. I have combination skin but it using this product it made my face oily and breakout!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a good price. There is a noticeable difference in my complection. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments on how my skin looks since using this product. I highly recommend the cream.</li>
    <li> I love how light it feels on my skin and gives great coverage especially for not being a normal foundation.</li>
    <li> Best BB cream for oily skin. Everyone complements me for my &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin. Not shinny though. Does not break me out while everything else does. I use it with neutrogina salicylic acid stress control acne wash and my face is clear and ready to go. No foundation necessary.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I do not need to use make up anymore. It really covers good and unit face color perfectly. I look like very healthy girl with this :P</li>
    <li> It breakout my skin every time i use it ............</li>
    <li> I found this on a blog and the woman was right! It is the perfect filler! I even wear it alone sometimes w/o foundation and my skin has a very smooth and pretty look!</li>
    <li> I love the coverage of this, goes on nicely &amp; has a great matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love the color (and the price)! I originally tried this from a sample i received in the mail. I also tried the Loreal youth code illuminating cream in medium (which i actually preferred over this one--but it was a bit more expensive). Overall,a great product from a company I trust.</li>
    <li> easy to apply! no thickness, no oily feeling, enough coverage!</li>
    <li> OUTSTANDING.  Can&#x27;t say enough great things...  The color &amp;#34;flexes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; to my skin tone perfectly and it has an excellent texture.  I have sensitive, mildly dry skin that is prone to redness.  I have looked and looked for something to cover these flare-ups without it looking like make-up.  As a guy, it&#x27;s pretty important to me that it looked as natural as possible.  I dab it on with the tips of my fingers (start with a little - you can always use more) and keep tapping it into my skin, as it starts to turn from the grey color to the color of my skin, I sweep it out from my cheeks down and out towards my jaw and the sides of my face.  The coverage is perfect but looks natural and not caked-on or artificial.  5 Stars, y&#x27;all...</li>
    <li> I will only ever buy this as my coverup or foundation. It is perfect and my face turns out beautifully when I wear this! It is light, but covers well and gives my face a pretty look.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  I use the deep in the summer and I look like my face is tanned.  switch back to medium or fair for the winter.  I don&#x27;t like heavy foundation and this works great.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is amazing, it covers, protects, and makes your skin look so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would have had it years ago! I tell all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> Great product that works really well.  I have tried several bb creams, and this is one of the better for &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; cosmetics.  I purchased both the light and the medium, I have medium toned skin and use the light shade around the eye area and the medium on the rest of my face.  Sorry I didnt write five paragraphs lol!</li>
    <li> What I like most about this BB Cream is that it is so lightweight.  When you apply it, I have found it is better to &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; it on than wipe it on.  It covers age spots (I have just a few), and brightens your face.  When I began using this cream, people began to compliment my complexion (I&#x27;m 56).  Also, you don&#x27;t have to wear any powder over it.  The only thing I&#x27;m not wild about is that after about 4 or 5 hours, my complexion appears a little &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; (looking like it&#x27;s a little oily).  Not a huge problem; I just take a tissue and blot my forehead, nose and chin.  It you like a matte finish, this is probably not the BB cream for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim at a duty free store because I had used other B.B. foundations and loved them.  This was the top!  While I had no idea that this cream also added a hint of color, what I loved about it is that, immediately, and for several hours afterward, it eliminated my &#x27;shiny&#x27; skin and gives me this fresh, and flawless skin that looks great in daylight and in pictures, It is so light that I don&#x27;t even feel you&#x27;re wearing a foundation.  On a special occasion, I had my daughter try it and since then, she has been asking me where I got it and wants her own.  I ordered several tubes of it to give to my girls and to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  I will use the light color in the winter and medium in the summer.  Both are amazing!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brand of BB cream. I tried a few others and I keep coming back to this one! Purchasing it on Amazon was both convenient and affordable!  It was cheaper on here than it is buying it from the local Walmart! I will buy from here again definitely!</li>
    <li> my fav bb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT</li>
    <li> this def is some kind of magic when you put it on. Influenster didnt have an option but i have this in the skin color &amp;#34;MEDIUM&amp;#34; but the packaging on mine is the old school packaging before they changed it. im sure the formula is still the same though. So..i like this product alot! it comes out of the tube white with hints of colored beads and then as you blend it into your skin it automatically turns into the color of your natural skin tone! Pretty neat! i would say it is light coverage, medium if you apply in layers. (for me i only need to slap it on once) i wouldn&#x27;t suggest this if you have acne prone skin because it is a light coverage and can get a little oily throughout the day. The only thing i dont like about this is the grainy texture it has at first. I usually put two medium sized lines along my cheeks, two lines along my forehead and a dot on my chin and blend it all together. would i repurchase? maybe! but theres a crap ton more products i want to try before i find a faveorite. Right now this product is in my project pan im doing and im almost all the way gone with it! yay (:loved it but its time to move on and try some new things!</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s unfortunate that reviews for this product are listed separately based on the color.  So, make sure you also check out reviews for the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a user of Lancome foundation, but didn&#x27;t wear it all that often because I&#x27;m just not fond of the weight of the makeup and how it can rub off.  On top of that, I live in the Phoenix area, and the heat would just melt anything I put on my face anyway.  I&#x27;ve always liked the idea of tinted moisturizer, but there again, the stuff seems to slide off my face.  So I&#x27;ve taken to just wearing powder, or nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product because I got a sample in a magazine, and I love it.  It looks a little like a facial scrub when it first comes out of the tube (pale color with what looks like tiny beads or granules).  But when you smooth it on, all that seems to disappear, and you&#x27;re left with a nice, smooth, matte face.  It covers my minor discolorations and sun damage perfectly, it has a nice, touchable finish, doesn&#x27;t rub off at all (even in the Phoenix heat).  I love it!  It \\&quot;perfects\\&quot; my skin without looking made up.  It does such a good job coloring minor skin discolorations that I actually feel like I want to add a little bit of blush to put some color back.  That&#x27;s not really a complaint, just an effect of putting something on the face that covers skin tone variations, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers have complained about an orange or pink undertone;  I have not found this to be the case.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because, generally speaking,  I tend to use as little product as possible, so I apply this lightly.  You do have to work somewhat fast to rub it in/smooth it on, otherwise it seems to go on a bit thick in spots (and the color is heavier/shows in the creases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product meets my needs.  Helps my skin look better but doesn&#x27;t look or feel like make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last comment about the color:  I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews where they say to goa color lighter than you think you need;  many specifically said that the medium was too dark/too orange for them.  I basically have fairly light skin, but a moderate tan.  The free sample I tried was \\&quot;light\\&quot;, and I thought it was ok, but a little too light for me.  I bought the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; and find it perfect for me!  The best I can advise is to try to sample them in the store, or, like I did, find a \\&quot;bogo\\&quot; type offer and buy 2 colors (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use the lighter one in the winter).  : )  I think the price is quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love this product....indoors only. The second you step outside though it will look like you have joined the ranks of the Twilight vampires. This stuff is SPARKLY in the sun. I love the sheer even coverage that this product provides though indoors. It is just enough to improve the look of your skin while still looking very natural and it matches my skin color very well. It doesn&#x27;t provide much moisture though. The tiny beads in it actually slough off all of my dead skin when I apply it. Three stars because it does not provide the moisture I expected it to and is really only for indoor use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for those days you dont want to have too much coverage but it sometimes is annoying that u have to use your fingers to apply rather than a brush and for me, a brush is quicker than fingers but its still a good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different brands of BB cream and this one is the best.  Most of the others just seem like tinted moisturizer, but this one covers all the little flaws and makes you look and feel great. I don&#x27;t need any other makeup with this; it does it all.</li>
    <li> Nice product, good light to medium coverage, starts out gray and grainy, but spreads nicely and eventually the color matches!  This is another one best applied with fingers, and remember to moisturize dry areas and wear a sunscreen to protect you skin!</li>
    <li> this the best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> I love that it blends in, and seems to be almost invisible. The price is reasonable, and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it evens skin tone and gives a smooth appearance.  I still use mineral foundation over the top, but I&#x27;m applying less.  My daughter uses the BB Cream and sets it with powder.  Awesome either way.</li>
    <li> The best bb-cream I have ever used. The color is great on my face and it&#x27;s not too moist I can use my make up and my skin doesn&#x27;t look oily. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good covering product.  I did need a little more moisturizer, as my skin is on the drier side.  Good product, and the investment was minimal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. Not life changing but I like using it under my eyes before I apply my make-up.  I feel it helps smooth under my eye a bit.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading it had good coverage and based on the amount of positive reviews. I hated it. It felt heavy, the Medium started out white but ended up being way too dark for my skin, the texture is very grainy probably due to all the glitter in it! Yes, it sparkles. I have dry skin and used my Olay moisturizer and serum before yet it my skin still felt dry and \\&quot;cakey.\\&quot; I normally wear Tarte foundation in Light and it provides the perfect moisture, I just wanted the other mineral and vitamin benefits of a BB Cream. So, for me this BB cream was a huge NO GO. I have since purchased the Skin79 and Garnier Skin Renew and ended up loving the Garnier much better due to the light feel, moisture and adequate coverage.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. an everyday staple in my cosmetic purse.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I received a sample in a magazine...LOVED the sample!  It was creamy and made my skin look great-Then I purchased a tube and was so disappointed-It was watery, grainy and just did not absorb-made my skin look pale and sort of gray-ish-</li>
    <li> It moisturizes, evens out skin tone and covers minor flaws. It is like a sheer foundation that feels and looks great.</li>
    <li> Grainy.  Used once and threw it out.</li>
    <li> My good friend was over for the weekend and upon her arrival I noticed how her skin looked really good. It always looks good but just looked better.  So the next day as we were getting ready she was showing me some of her recent finds in cosmetics.  We both have olive complexions so we share products.  She shows me the Loreal BB cream and says this is now what she uses and she really likes it.  Ah Ha! So I decide to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background.  I use makeup sparingly as I have an active lifestyle and my decision is more based on not liking to take all the stuff off at night.  But I always apply sunscreen and usually a light foundation and powder for that extra barrier between my face and the California sun. But if it was not for the sun, I probably would not wear any foundation. I have an olive complexion and I am even-toned and have good texture.  I always have issues with my skin getting oily around my nose and forehead and I am always striving for the most natural weightless feel and look.  I have tried many high end foundations and they are good but I am never wow&#x27;d. So....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tested the color by putting a dab on my wrist and watched it disappear into my skin!  I put my sunblock on and  then applied this product. I tend to apply lightly and spread with my fingers going even more lightly as i get to the outer edges of my face. My first observation was that it was translucent, it did not feel like i had anything on my face and it erased imperfections. As for the color, it looked natural and there was no difference in the color from my face to my neckline. I then put a light dusting of my face powder over it which made it even better. So off we go to our outdoor event and we are there for hours in the 75 degree sun.  I did not notice any sparkles on my face or hers and when returned home I did not have the usual shine on my forehead and around my nose and I still looked even toned.  If I could love a product, this is it! I am very happy with it and how it looks natural. I get compliments and people think i have no makeup on :) If it was not for my friend having the Med color I probably would have guessed to use the light color because although i am olive I am very light, my friend is more tan/olive but the color looked good on both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who love the natural look, I would give this product a try.  The price is great so what&#x27;s to lose? Not much but a lot to gain if you like it! I hope it works for you like it did for me.</li>
    <li> I like the way it looks and feels, however, it breaks me out on my chin and between my eyes.  I now just use it under my eyes and in the corners on days I do not sleep well :-)</li>
    <li> From all the bb creams I have tried (garnier (makes me look shinny), ponds) this one is my favorite, is the smallest container but it last me a long time, it does not make me look shinny and the color just match my skin tone. for me this one is the best one</li>
    <li> Received it super quick within 2-3 days and was just as pictured.  Saved me a few bucks and I&#x27;m happy! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream. You can just put one layer on or add another for more coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost a year. I tried almost every brand from cheap to expensive. I love using this as a base to my foundation.</li>
    <li> it came light, not medium, even tough the wrapping said so.</li>
    <li> I have tried several BB creams. I&#x27;m Asian with medium tone skin--sensitive to comedogens. I even tried the Korean ones that claim it works great for Asian skin. They just made me breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is much lighter and thinner than others--so not as much &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; as other thicker BBs. However, it goes on much smoother and it&#x27;s perfect for my needs. It also stays on through the day and does not get cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this is medium--it first goes on grey and it slowly adapts(?) to your skin tone. Many people have complemented me on my skin tone since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note--I still use base moisturizing cream before I put on this product. I use Estee Lauder Time Zone products for eye and face.</li>
    <li> Kind of liquidly...comes out white but then blends in. At first it looked like powder and shows my dry skin but then blends in. Feels like im not wearing anything.  I enjoy using this product for work/casual plans so I don&#x27;t have to cake makeup on and still look like I tried to put myself together. Going to keep using instead of my garnier bb cream for now :)</li>
    <li> Well, I personal think this is ok.&lt;br /&gt;It shouldn&#x27;t call BB cream at all because it&#x27;s a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cover as much as ASIAN BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it ok but just disapointed that it doesn&#x27;t have sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Youth Code BB cream. get double of the products for serveral bucks more and it can compare to estee lauder BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;But estee lauder is even lighter and have SPF 35 while Loreal have SPF 15</li>
    <li> First off, I am a 25 year old guy and I use it. Why? well my sister recommended this after she noticed, that my acne leave scar and she hated it, so I was like what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you man/woman, have to be very careful of the amount you use, its really trial and error, I have brown skin, so I use medium, its a little drying, and I do have dry skin, so I apply moisturizer first. If you are oily don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns yellow, when you start to blend it, don&#x27;t worry when it dries up and your natural oils blend in it looks natural, but apply too much and you definitely know something is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product, I will buy this again, skin looks good afterward, what the heck I will keep it.</li>
    <li> This product is probably a good product. The tube arrived sealed, but was empty except for a couple of drops. It apprived as promised, but it was just emptry.</li>
    <li> Good primer and blends well with my skin. Not having perfect skin, I still have to put foundation on top of it. It&#x27;s also quite small so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be finishing this bottle soon if I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have dry to combination skin that is blemish prone and has a tendency toward redness.  I tried a sample of this product thinking it would be great for times when I needed to go natural (aka camping) but didn&#x27;t want to have blotchy skin.  I put my normal moisturizer on first then applied the BB Cream. To my dismay it made my whole face so dry my skin was flaky! I have already done 1 day of excessive moisturizing to try to rehydrate my skin and its still not back to its normal state.  I&#x27;ve heard BB creams can be drying, but this is ridiculous! If you have skin that tends to be dry, stay away from this product! However if you have very oily skin, this may be a product that really helps to dry that out.</li>
    <li> I tried several BB creams and this one gets my vote. Comes out white  and goes on tinted. I used it on just half my face and asked my best friend to rate the &#x27;before and after&#x27;. Her verdict: &#x27;Where did you get this, I want one right now!&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I break out easily when trying new products on my face but not once did this BB cream irritate my skin or make me break out. It is very easy to put on, blends easily with my skin tone (I bought the medium tone) and a small drop goes a loooong way. I don&#x27;t even use any foundations anymore since this cream is enough. I just use a bit of powder on top to set it for the whole day. LOVE IT! I already stocked up.</li>
    <li> The only BB cream I use! I have combination - more oily skin and this does wonders for it.</li>
    <li> Not the fault of the product...but I had an allergic reaction.  My daughter uses it all the time and lives it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Target so I could compare it with Stila&#x27;s 10 in 1. I went with Loreal because it doesn&#x27;t include SPF ingredients, which irritate my skin (I get that in my Anthelios moisturizer). So for me, that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The color was fine; I tried it on the back of my hand. The texture is a little harsh; you can feel the microbeads. On my face, however, it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 34, and have fairly good skin tone with some uneven areas. I hate wearing foundation because it feels heavy and settles in or amplifies my crow&#x27;s feet after a few hours of smiling. I don&#x27;t have crazy deep wrinkles or anything, and without makeup I&#x27;m usually mistaken for someone 23-27.&lt;br /&gt;Magic BB did not go on very smoothly, and after it did blend in it had settled into all the nooks and crannies. I gave it a few minutes to see if it would melt in, blended again with my fingers, but nope; it was dry and acting just like a foundation with the lines.&lt;br /&gt;On the other side of my face I tried the Stila product. Perfect blending and smooth application, and zero settling in the lines. Which sucks because its expensive and I wanted to hate it. Hours later, still no amplified wrinkles, and it works like a great primer with my powder compact (Clinique).&lt;br /&gt;Now-if you don&#x27;t have fine lines, or maybe just not in the areas that get used all day when you smile, the Magic BB DOES cover more than Stila, so I can see people with smooth skin loving it.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing-so I tried it on my hands first, and when I rinsed them off, the Magic BB was actually repelling the water. No idea if that&#x27;s helpful, but I thought it strange for a light tinted cream!</li>
    <li> I found this cream too dry.  Goes on thin, watery.  When you shake and then open to dispense the thin liquid will spurt out if you are not careful.  Way too dry for my face.  However, i CAN recommend L&#x27;oreal YOUTH CODE BB CREAM.  That glides on and feels great.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have ever used a BB cream and I love it!!! It is so light, not heavy like my other foundations and gives such great coverage.  I use with a Kabuka (?spelling) brush and it goes on flawlessly. Will be buying this from now on!</li>
    <li> I saw review on YouTube...and i think it is only ok not enough coverage and little bet feeling greasy for me.</li>
    <li> Has a very natural look. Smoothes out imperfections in skin without leaving edges where applied.</li>
    <li> I am loving this for the summer or those days I don&#x27;t really want to look like I have a ton of makeup on. It really evens out my skin tone and has pretty good light coverage. My skin looks healthy, but not shiny and that is  HUGE deal for me. I have a combination skin so I was really scared to use something so light on my skin. I love the look I have at the end of the day as much as I love it when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;To use this I apply some sunscreen, moisturizer and then this BB Cream. On top of that I use some concealer, set everything with a powder, pop some mascara and everything else is optional. I won&#x27;t say my skin looks absolutely flawless, but I really didn&#x27;t want that from this BB cream. This just gives me a great glow, my skin looks even and feels very soft. It blends really easily, too. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars if because you might need to use a bit more product than you&#x27;re used to to cover your face. Other than that I recommend you give this a go.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much better this product is than the Maybelline version. Maybelline never dries completely and stays shiny and wet looking. This product disappears immediately. It&#x27;s not the most coverage, on the weekends I use a slightly heavier foundation, but for my purposes, I never go totally without makeup, this is perfect. It gives you a base to put your blush over and enough moisture and SPF protection for a day of errands.&lt;br /&gt;I use dermatologist grade retin A and my skin is fairly even toned. although I am somewhat fair I still need the medium color and the next one down is just too light, not that this product has much color. It seems all the stores are sold out of medium. It must cover a huge range.</li>
    <li> Light but nice - not heavy - have not used it long enough to really comment on improving skin.  Time will tell</li>
    <li> Amazing good coverage feels hit and blends beautifully</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this on my skin. It provides coverage without looking or feeling heavy on my face. I tend to have dry skin with redness and this moisturizes perfectly and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I mix this with the Lumi primer, gives a light coverage. prefect for me I ordered light color for the winter months. that worked well.</li>
    <li> very light and not greasy</li>
    <li> My favorite of several other drugstore BB Creams!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Contains NO SPF.  For me - NO itchy skin, NO odd scent, NO greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;- Encapsulated tint.  Slightly gritty feeling instantly disappears as the color beads break down when product is applied.&lt;br /&gt;- More lotion than cream.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most days, I use this for light, even coverage.  Because it isn&#x27;t a cream and I only use a small amount,  I do have to apply this quickly before it sets.  Still, I LOVE that it feels like I have nothing on my clean skin.  On days when I need SPF protection, or want more coverage, I wear BE mineral make-up over it.</li>
