<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved this argan oil. It was very helpful to nourishing my hair. It has all natural ingredients. in it. I used this for free for review purpose for a month and thought it was wonderful. It def. started to bring my damaged hair back to life. I use it as leave in treatment and also just for shine and light moisture. It is excellent and works great without having to use too much unless for leave in treatment , where you also do not need to much. You can see my Youtube . https://jeadoreme.wordpress.com/</li>
    <li> Felt very heavy and sticky even with just a little it didn&#x27;t really penetrate my hair it felt as if just stay in the surface overall very sticky. I returned it. didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> great oil for the hair, works great</li>
    <li> Love this! really makes my hair shine.</li>
    <li> This oil treatment works wonderful on my dry overly damaged brittle hair, once applied it instantly smooths out my split ends and frizz. My hair is more manageable and all frizz free.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on other reviews on Amazon.  I also received a note from the seller about use, etc. which was helpful.  Since I have a short hair, I only need a very small amount which I use for styling purposes.  It&#x27;s a very good product, especially when used in the winter time because it reduces static and my hair is healthier looking especially when it&#x27;s cold and low humidity weather.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I am obsessed! I have been raving about it to my friends that complain of dry and damaged hair. With only one treatment my hair was softer shiner and felt overall more healthy and less brittle and dry. This does not leave your hair looking oily or greasy the next day even with the added oil after your shampoo. This is honestly one of my new MUST HAVE hair products. I will be purchasing this again for sure!</li>
    <li> Besides this product being light and easy to use (read the directions) the customer service has been fantastic. The company checks in with you to be sure you are 100% satisfied with their product and to see if you have any questions they can answer.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I bleached my hair out over a year ago and as it is growing out the ends get that horrible dry, fried look. I use a hair dryer and straightener and needed something to help my hair. This product has been great. You can do a 10 minute &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; condition before you get in the shower, or leave it on for as long as 24 hours for a deep condition. Ultimately, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. My hair is happy and healthy looking now, which makes me happy!</li>
    <li> I have been loving this Total Hair Repair Oil ever since Foxbrim sent it to me to review a few weeks ago!  The oil is a blend of Organic Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Grapeseed Oil and Sunflower Oil and all those ingredients combined make for a very powerful hair oil that not only nourishes &amp; repairs damaged hair but it also gives it nice healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s formulated for all hair types so anyone can use it.  I have colored, blond, dry hair and my daughter has colored, kinky, curly, damaged hair and it has made a huge difference for both of us.  I like to apply the Total Hair Repair Oil by Foxbrim to the ends of my hair as soon as I get out of the shower and then I also use a little after my hair is dry and styled to help smooth any flyaways.  As a result, I have soft, manageable &amp; silky hair.  Plus, if I have any left over oil on my hands I just rub it into my skin and it also leaves my skin soft &amp; silky!&lt;br /&gt;I have fast become a huge fan of all things by Foxbrim.  I feel really lucky that I have had the chance to able to review a lot of their products, they have all been amazing!</li>
    <li> I use a blow dryer, flat-iron, or curling wand pretty much every day and the barrage of heat styling leaves my hair damaged, dry, and unruly. To compensate, I’ve taken the recommendation of top stylists and shampoo only every other day. Plus, I’ve been more diligent about getting regular trims. These things help, but the biggest change I’ve made is to try incorporate hair oil into my hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several that are all good, but I LOVE Foxbrim’s Total Hair Repair Oil. What makes it different is that it combines several plant oils to restore hair’s shine and silkiness. It&#x27;s super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it look greasy, stringy or seperated. It can be used on wet hair or dry hair (sparingly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks better than ever!</li>
    <li> I allowed my oldest daughter to color the underneath of her hair pink and we have fought for months with the dryness and then I was given this amazing product for review purposes. I left it in her hair for a few hours and then blowed dried it and I was absolutely astonished at how soft and healthy her hair looks again! I am super happy with the results! This is an amazing product!!!!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way for this one because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. A few drops is all I needed  It works as a styling liquid and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I love that it softened the strands and it gave instant luster to my dry hair. My hair became smooth and it definitely looks healthier. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a week now and I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I have hair that has a mind of it&#x27;s own. One day it will be frizzy, the next flat as a flitter but always, always driving me insane. I love this for how easy it is to use as an addition to my routine for my hair. It keeps it soft and managable whether I use it as a conditioning treatment and rinse it out, or put it in and leave it as a stlying tool. Without leaving me feeling greasy or looking like I have not washed in days. Great product!</li>
    <li> This oil does everything it says it does. My hair doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, easy to use and takes the hair.  I have long, frizzy and curly hair and it calms it down.  Does not totally get rid of frizz but helps and keeps the hair soft and healthy.  Especially good for dry ends.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s useful, can make your hair more strong.</li>
    <li> My sister gave to me as a gift, and I like it! It fulfills my needs</li>
    <li> I tried all kinds of conditioner, oils, deep conditioning treatment and so on to treat my hair dryness and frangibility but every time I became more disappointed! Some of them worked for a short time and some of them didn’t work at all! I recently tried “Foxbrim’s Total Hair Repair Oil” which it is suppose to effectively nourish and completely restore hairs. That what it says. I looked at its key natural ingredients which look helpful including: Organic Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Grape seed Oil, Sunflower Oil.So, I started out putting it on my roots and scalp and massaging it into your hair. The very best point of it was the oil has no scent and it is non greasy and my hair didn’t look oily after using it. It left my hair feeling soft and absolutely frizz free. my hair now looks so strong and healthy, super-soft, and very shiny. After a month, applying it 2 times a week, it repaired damaged shafts and split ends and my hair looks healthy,shinny and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;I wish instead of cutting my hair I applied this treatment before! So, it’s life and we learn everyday! Learning from our mistakes!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I heard a lot about Argan products never tried the oil and my first time trying it it&#x27;s so nice to use and it makes my hair feel extra shiny and makes my hair feel fuller and I like the feel of it when I am done using it. After I showered I did put some in while my hair was damp and massaged it around my scalp/head. I assure you you will feel 100% better buying this product and it last a long time I don&#x27;t over due putting a lot in you need like a quarter size amount and rub it in your hands and than moisture it through your hair and your good to go. I love how it made my hair feel extra curly as well. I&#x27;ve never seen my hair full and full of more bouncy curls. Which is weird so it helped a lot.</li>
    <li> One use produced amazing results! My very fine curly hair dried with no frizz and no product. Just put this on overnight, what a difference! I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several people.</li>
    <li> Nice to use but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference compared to other products. In fact, I&#x27;m more apt to pick up and enjoy the results from using Organix coconut oil over this product. The company simply suggested that I use it a different way (I was coating my hair in it for hours hoping that it would result in soft locks) and never offered a refund for a product that presently sits untouched.</li>
    <li> very good product, leaves hair very soft.  I liked it because there are not a lot of chemicals in this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair and I absolutely love it! My hair was damaged and weak but now it is strong and vibrant. It is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I tried this Argan Oil on everybody&#x27;s hair. It is so much better than the Argan Oil that you can buy in the store. My sister loved it so much she stole it from and she&#x27;s talking about buying a bottle so she doesn&#x27;t run out!!! You only need a little bit of product for your hair, it&#x27;s not greasy. My hair was soft and smooth all day.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast and arrived before expect the only thing that i would note is that this is a glass bottle and was sent to me in a bubble mailer. A majority of the product spilled out because it was some what cracked but of what i did test i loved. It does have a strange smell so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells please beware of that. Like most argan oils a little goes a long way! This oil is super easy to apply and i highly recommend this because it does have some amazing ingredients! I did a change in my hair after the first use usually my hair is really dry on the ends and after using this it no longer is as dry! Totally recommend only flaw is in the shipping packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review!</li>
    <li> I have this product in my hair as I am writing this review, I like the spray nozzle for application and the way my hair looks and feels after washing it out, this is a great hair product!</li>
    <li> I have severely damaged hair and this has been a wonderful product.  I use it every other day, leaving it in my hair overnight.  I like it so much I am getting ready to order it again.  Shipping was fast which is always awesome when you need something in a hurry.</li>
    <li> The best of the best....a wonderful oil....thank you so much and also for your good and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim organ oil hair repair. I used this this morning before I wash my hair. I love how it makes my hair shiny. I don&#x27;t personally use shampoo nor conditioner, and this product is amazing. I also used this as a styling gel type of thing and it worked great. I am really short hair and i love them. This is perfect for my no-poo routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received this with a discount to provide my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on my hair. I love it and would definitely but another one in the future</li>
    <li> This product has saved my hair. I dyed my hair a month ago to put a crazy hair color in it and it became very damaged. It felt the consistency of straw and it was a horrible hassle to brush. I will say I like this product. I read the directions wrong but it did so much. I was not supposed to use so much but my hair was so absorbent from the loss of protein. I probably used half a bottle the first time but I don&#x27;t regret it. I let it sit in my hair and soak it up for a day and a half. (I&#x27;m a stay at home mom so I have the time). I have to say it made such a difference. By the time I washed the oil from my hair it was completely different. I won&#x27;t lie I was pretty sure I&#x27;d have to do it a few times to get the result I wanted but it was a pleasant surprise what a difference it made. My hair was softer and not as hard to brush. The straw feeling is mostly gone. I&#x27;m pretty sure a couple more treatments should help it get back to normal. I went to cosmetology school so I&#x27;m used to cholesterol treatments, but this is better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This product was given to me free for my unbiased product review. These comments are my own.</li>
    <li> I used this argan oil repair treatment and it left my hair feeling so smooth and manageable. My hair tends to get very very dry. I have soft bouncy curls, and i had to start washing my hair only 2x a week becaus i was stripping away all the oils. Even now it still gets dry, but these oils left it feeling so shny bouncy and healthy! Im excited to see my haor this shiny i will be uploading a pic tomorrow as it dark already. But this bottle is a life saver, all i have to do is apply it for a few minutes to an hour or two before showering. Thank you for allowing mr to review this product! These are all my honest opinions. I truly love it</li>
    <li> What a great product! I wore my hair in a cute pixie style fo 30yrs. When I became bedridden I thought what can I do THATS positive. I decide to grow my hair out for wigs for woman/children with cancer. My hair is very dark brown and now mid- back in length. I apply a small amount on a hand then rub together fast to heat it up. I then start about 1-2&amp;#34; down from hair root and quickly run it down hair shaft. There is some shine but my husband loves the feel of my hair. (I&#x27;m 62 he&#x27;s 72 both young in mind and heart) your hair will feel so soft I just can&#x27;t belive it! Your hair won&#x27;t look greasy if you stay with the recommended dose. I even have started using it on my 8lb medical alert dog. ( this is not suggested or mentioned on label) she has very dry skin from a medicine and what a change. I put two drops and massage through after brushing her. I apply to her once a week after her bath. I can&#x27;t stop petting her!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will never run out. The bottle will last a very long time IVE had no flaking build up just extra soft hair with a lovely sheen. All my DRS nurses want to know &amp;#34;what have you done to your hair!) I tell them right away. Never hide a great product from your friends. I&#x27;ll be searching to see if they have other products. ENJOY:-).</li>
    <li> Works I use it for dry skin but I mix it with lotion first. Great seller here.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! In the ongoing quest to make my life more natural and organic I bought this to replace a silicone based hair serum. I was a bit hesitant because my hair isn&#x27;t exceptionally dry and at times can air on the side of oily but I needed a product to protect my hair from heat damage. (For reference I have a ton of normal hair, untreated and long.) I am starting out, as suggested by the manufacturer, with only a bit of oil, about a dime sized amount. After blow drying this morning my hair feels amazing. A lot of fly-always are tamed and my hair is very soft and shiny, not heavy and/or oily at all. I applied it after showering (towel dry) and made sure not to work it to close to my scalp. The only, minor, drawback is the smell. After styling my hair has a slight sunflower oil smell but it is minor and would in no way deter me from purchasing this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for my hair! Living in a sub-tropical climate is hard on my hair and this tames my hair beautifully!</li>
    <li> So far, it has helped. I have thinning hair and breakage is a concern. Seems to be helping. :)</li>
    <li> This works great on my daughters hair. She had very thick and tight curly hair. It is difficult keeping it moisturized healthy. I finally found something. I even took her to the hairdresser yesterday and she asked what I was using because her hair looked so much better then usual!!! 😊</li>
    <li> Its just like baby oil,I use just a couple times just little tiny bit and I dint like it left my hair greasy</li>
    <li> This is the real thing. Uses it after shampoo; a few spritz on the scalp, and style my hair.....Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Great product.  No bad smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I apply it over night once a week and wash it the next morning. Since the first application my hair looks healthier, soft and nourish. I have straitgth, thin and dull hair that gets oily in the roots (I have to wash it every other day) and dry in the middle and ends (due to the hair color I apply monthly). This product brings my hair back to life!</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Argan Oil is great stuff. it smells mellow and feels silky when using. Ive liked the shine and nourishment my hair has gotten since I started using this. I have noticed my nails are nicer too. Its a nice dark sturdy bottle. I did get a discount for reviewing this product to give my honest unbias opinion. I like it. I would buy it again and I would recommend it to my friends. I am pleasantly surprised that I even had a use for Argan oil and now I wouldn&#x27;t even pass it up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I was ecstatic to recieve this product for my reviewing purposes. My hair is so dry, brittle and split. I know most of it is from everyday pollution but pulling it back in a ponytail all of the time sure doesn&#x27;t help! The first thing I noticed while using this was it has no scent. That&#x27;s awesome! I also noticed it takes very little to accomplish the job so use it sparingly! I leave it in overnight about once a week and my hair looks amazing! It took a few treatments to get it looking really good again but it was worth it. It didn&#x27;t take long to put it in my hair and I just washed it out with my regular shampoo the next morning. My hair is sooo soft and managable. I have hardly any frizz left and my hair is laying much smoother. I had my hair trimmed a few weeks ago and have not seen any since. That&#x27;s good for me! I usually see them again after about 2 weeks. This has definitely nourished and repaired my hair. I recommend it, especially to you pontytail wearers!</li>
    <li> This is,good stufff.Works great.Good for the hair and I love it.Honest seller.Fast shipping.Thank you</li>
    <li> Best argan oil I have ever used. Leaves my hair healthy, shiny, and feeling great!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It makes my hair so soft and shiny. I highly recommend it, especially if you have curly or frizzy hair. I have also used it before shampooing.</li>
    <li> As a woman that has had frizzy hair my whole life, i know what it is like to try products after products. I&#x27;ve looked like a lion because of how frizzy my hair is. I like how this oil does not have any smell to it and leaves my hair frizzy free. I like that i can quickly massage it into my hair before taking a shower or sleep with it on. I loved that i didn&#x27;t need to use a lot of the oil to repair my hair, so the bottle will last a while.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like it. My hair type is lighter, thin but I have a lot of hair. I thought it would be a great alternative to other argan oil products that leave my hair silky and shiny with a high price. This leaves my hair unmanageable and straw-like, impossible to blow-dry if used after a shower. If I use before a shower like the directions say, I don&#x27;t notice a difference. I let it sit and treat over night but didn&#x27;t notice a big difference. I can see where someone with curly thicker hair could benefit from this product.</li>
    <li> Container: The product comes in an amber glass bottle with a pump applicator top. It easily dispenses a small amount of the product with each pump. This product is not tested on animals, is made in the USA, and is good for 12 months after opening the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Argan Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Olive Oil, Grapeseed Oil, and Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: The directions say to pump a small amount into palms, apply for 10 minutes, 2 hours or overnight, then shampoo, and can apply a small amount as needed for a styling fluid and restorative elixir. It only takes a few pumps to dispense enough to cover ends and about 7 inches of hair to the roots. Immediately, it smoothed my hair, added a great shine, and helped my hair look hydrated. The next day, I shampooed and applied conditioner. I could tell that the Hair Repair Oil had done it&#x27;s work. My hair remained smooth, hydrated, and had a glossy shine. I did add a little bit to smooth the sides of my hair where I had not fully applied it. This is the first product that has actually lasted beyond a shampoo. My hair remained hydrated and glistening for 2 days until my next shampoo. Even after that my hair looked more hydrated and was much easier to manage. I have continued my use of this product, using it about once a week to maintain the look of clean, shiny and manageable hair. It is not greasy and did not seem to go anywhere other than into my hair shaft. No mess on pillows or clothes. It has definitely improved my hair&#x27;s texture, as it is usually dry and frizzy. Now it is much smoother and I have significantly less problems with the frizziness. I do sometimes use a tiny amount between treatments if my hair does become frizzy. I have had many compliments on my hair since using the Total Hair Repair Oil. I do plan to continue use of this product because it actually works and has kept my hair looking great. While you might not get exactly the same results, I think overall you will be satisfied that the product does what it says. My big piece of advice is to not use too much. You can always add more, but if you get too much on the hair it might look oily. This has been excellent for my dry hair, so if you hair is not dry, use even less until you know how it will make your hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of products by Foxbrim and I have been satisfied with them all. While your results may not be exactly like mine, I would recommend this product for everyone looking for improved hair manageability and ongoing smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.ctly the same results, I think overall you will be satisfied that the product does what it says.

    <li> I used this repair oil as a daily moisturizing product and I really love my results. The perimeter of my hair gets really dry because it does not stay under my bonnet while I sleep. Foxbrim&#x27;s repair oil helps keeps the perimeter of my hair moisturized to the same consistent of the rest of my hair. This oil is not oily at all and it quickly absorbs into your hair without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;The oils that make up Foxbrim total repair are very quality natural oils. Organic Argan oil helps make hair shinier, softer, and silkier. Grape seed oil has moisturizing and conditioning properties, and reduces hair loss. Jojoba oil treats dry scalp, strengthens the fibers of the hair from the inside, and encourages hair growth. Sunflower seed oil stimulates natural hair growth, and keeps your hair smooth, soft, and healthy. Shea butter is also in this product and it helps to soften hair, lock in moisture, and protects against heat.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim Total Hair Repair Oil is a quality hair styling and treatment product. You will not be disappointed and you will love your results. (I received this product to review, but my opinions are my own).</li>
    <li> Love this oil, it has everything that&#x27;s needed to add nutrients to my hair. in combination with flat ironing, my hair felt like butter.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim’s Total Hair Repair Oil can be used either as a hair repair treatment before shampooing or as a finishing/shine oil when styling hair. While I’m very familiar using oils during styling, I had never tried using oils as a deep conditioning pretreatment. To use as a pretreatment, Foxbrim recommends pumping a small amount into palms and applying evenly on hair (as much as needed, depending on your hair length).  Leave on 10 minutes, 2 hours, or overnight and shampoo as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a quarter sized amount (lots of hair) and left on for 10 minutes to see how fast/well the oil worked. After shampooing and conditioning as usual, I noticed my damp hair was easy to comb out even before adding any styling products. I like the convenience factor — in-shower deep conditioners keep you stuck in the bathroom but this way I can easily put the oil in before doing housework, working out, whatever and then just shower as usual when I’m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the oil blend on a different day as a finishing oil in lieu of my usual argan oil and was pleased with the results — my waves were soft and manageable even after air drying. I really like how Foxbrim’s Total Hair Repair Oil functions well both as a deep conditioning pretreatment and as a styling oil and I&#x27;m very glad I received the product to review.</li>
    <li> Love Argan Oil!  I use Argan Oil on my face &amp; now I have an Argan Oil for my hair.  Now that it is summer, I can really use this oil.  My hair gets dried out easily.  I get the dry split ends, even though I get my hair trimmed every month.  I also get my hair colored so this is the best product I can use for my hair.  I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  Honestly, this is the only product I need for my hair! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I usually avoid oils since I have curly hair and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one. A little goes a long way for this one and I am still on my same shampoo schedule I was prior to using( not greasy like I thought it would get after a day)It works as a styling liquid and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I love that it softened the strands and it gave instant luster to my dry hair. My hair is smoother and definitely looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product for your dry and damaged hair, this is a good one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> I decided to try this out, my hair is dry and brittle due to bleaching it, now you know Asians should not have blonde hair, lol. I used this since I was given this to review and I will tell you, my hair is soft and healthy again, and still blonde, lol. I love this stuff. I has also made my hair stop breaking and I am just very happy with Fox brim.Their products are excellent.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much I love this product!  Since I have been using, my hair has never been softer or fuller.  A little really does go a long way with this product, so use sparingly on dry hair so you don&#x27;t get that oily, weighed down look.  I like to use this product before shampooing (leaving on for about 5 minutes before using shampoo), really concentrating on the ends. I then use about 2 drops mixed with my styling cream before blow drying.  This stuff is absolutely amazing and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my hair. I saw an increase of smoothness within a few days! I&#x27;m surprised I waited this long to try it.</li>
    <li> Has made my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I use it regularly and it keeps my hair looking great. I have fine hair and this does not weigh it down at all. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I received this order today and it is awesome!  I love the way it makes my hair look and feel.  I have a lot of damage due to coloring etc.  This revitalizes my hair in just one application.  It is definitely an effective way to restore your hair back to it&#x27;s natural beauty and shine!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for every type of hair.  My hair tends to be on the more oily side and I cannot use as much of it as other people, but it slips into my hair really easily and spread on.  After application, my hair looks so healthy and full of life.  Not only does it look good in the moment, I have the added benefit of repairing heat damaged hair over time.  I did receive this product on a promotion for reviews.  I really really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> When I got this product, I thought ti was just 100% Argan oil. When I got it though, it is an Argan oil Hair repair MIX. This is even better though as it has coconut oil, shea and other really great oils for hair care. I took a shower and sprayed a little in my hair and worked it in. My hands felt so soft after doing so, but my hair was absolute silk. I love that the top of the bottle has a little pump type top, because it&#x27;s a bit easier to get into my hair than a dropper bottle. Foxbrim oils are fantastic and this one does not disappoint! High quality and has a light lovely smell. I highly recommend. My hair fees so nice and looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> What I Love about Foxbrim&#x27;s Total Hair Repair Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I love Foxbrim&#x27;s high quality products, customer service and 100% money back guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I used it as a moisturizing 10 minute mask, and my wavy hair is frizz-free &amp; bouncy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ll probably use this as a mask 1-2x/week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I can tell that my hair feels silkier and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided this product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I received the Fox Brim Hair Repair oil free and for review.  I was very skeptical because I am used to cream rinses and hair masks. Putting oil  in my hair did not see to make sense as I am trying to void oily hair.  I used the spray pump and worked the oil into my hair.  It seemed to stay in one spot so I used a comb to make sure it spread through evenly.  I must admit; it did look oily.  I left it in about 10-15 minutes and then shampooed it out.  I felt like I had to really lather the shampoo through my hair to get rid of that oily feeling.  I also used a conditioner as I normally do.  My hair did not come out any worse for the wear.  It still styled nicely.  I use a blow dryer practically every day, so  am sure that &amp;#34;drying out my hair&amp;#34; makes it lose some of its essential oils.  I would use this again the way I did.  I would probably not use it as a styling fluid as another suggestion.  I guess if you have really dry hair, that would be something to consider.</li>
    <li> I used this product after I would shampoo, condition and deep condition my hair weekly, I also used the product every other day in my hair to help with my braid outs so I would not get any frizz. I like this product it didn&#x27;t smell weird it came out of the bottle nicely. It didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, a little goes a long way also.&lt;br /&gt;I love how shiny my hair was and how it stopped the frizz, I have damaged hair from chemical relaxer so this product was great for my hair, I used it as a leave in conditioner and my hair looked and felt great. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair will look after continues use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I’ll start out by saying that I have natural curly hair. It isn’t the pretty ringlet or spiral type, but the frizzy type. When I keep my hair shorter, I do get those nice ringlets. But, as my hair grows longer, they fall out of shape and turn into a frizzy, wavy mess. On top of that, I color my hair frequently which tends to dry out my hair, especially on the ends. I was excited to hear about the Total Hair Repair Oil because it claims to strengthen, moisturize, and keep the texture of hair, which is exactly what I was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the bottle in the mail, the first thing I noticed was that the product comes in a glass bottle. To me, that was already a major plus. Not only is it sturdier and BPA free, but I can also re-use the bottle for something else once I use all of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I’ve used the oil in my hair 4 times. The first time, I left it in for 20 minutes. The next time, I left it in for 2 hours. And, the remaining 2 times I put in in for about 5 minutes before my shower or bath. Each time that I used it, my hair absolutely feels soft and looks very shiny. I loved the fact that the oil washes out completely so that after your hair dries, you don’t seen any of the oil left over. I will say that a little goes a long way with this stuff. Since my hair is very thick, I’m used to having to use a lot of product just to cover all of my hair. But, 2-3 pumps was enough for my whole head, and I have pretty long hair. If you have shorter hair, one pump would be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that this oil makes my curls a bit more “bouncy”. By that I mean, that they held their shape longer without being pulled down as easy by gravity and the weight of my hair. All in all, I loved this oil and recommend it to any one out there who has my hair type, and even those who don’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This review is 100% my own opinion and is written in my own words.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been seaching for a good oil product for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Super glad I found this! It makes my hair so soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for new ways to make my hair healthier, and repair the damage that I have from coloring, heat styling, and everyday damage. This oil is different than some of the other treatments I&#x27;ve tried. These light natural oils nurture your hair from the roots to the ends. It strengthens and hydrates at the same time. It helps with split ends, which I think most of us suffer from. It adds shine, which I&#x27;m always looking for. This oil works for all hair types. It&#x27;s a plant based formula, with sunflower oil, Argan oil, Panthenol and shea butter. The way this works is that the sunflower oil nourishes and prevents breakage, argan oil creates a seal for the hair cutical, panthenol fills in the cracks, and shea butter builds volume. On top of that it also contains Jojoba oil, and grapeseed oil. This is an all natural and organic product, which I love. There&#x27;s nothing harmful going into your hair. This oil is also made by a company that I stand behind, Foxbrim, I have had nothing but great experiences with their products, and this one is no exception. My hair feels so much healthier, it is shiny, and easy to comb through, the scent is mild, and you don&#x27;t need a lot for each use. It&#x27;s a quick and easy treatment that takes 10 seconds, and works all day. My hair feels softer, stronger and healthier than it has in a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> I love the results. My hair is healthy and there is no more breakage or dryness. I love that it is now smooth and shiny. I recieved this product to review.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Argan Oil Hair repair has made my hair feel soft and amazing.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected. Received product for discount to provide honest feedback. Aplus shipper and great product. Cant complain at all. Will buy again at full price.</li>
    <li> This oil is lovely on my hair. It is great for frizzy areas as well as dry ends. It is Not greasy or runny, but absorbs quickly. The oil gives shine and a little fullness for my thin hair. A little of this oil works perfectly. One pump is all I need for my shoulder length hair. I have tried many products to reduce frizz and give my hair shine and this oil is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> This oil works like magic. My hair is extremely dry and damaged due to execessive coloring, I used many good products that worked slightly on moisturizing the hair, but this oil works on the inside of the hair. It&#x27;s marvelous, it also worked perfectly for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve been playing with some fun colors in my hair, and of course, playing too much will ruin it. So far, I&#x27;ve used this as an overnight treatment under a shower cap and as a daily leave-in product. Both ways make my hair wonderfully shiny and soft. I am careful to not use a lot as a leave-in, but my hair does not appear greasy or oily -- just curly and shiny. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice, leaves my hair really soft, I only use a couple times a week so my hair doesn&#x27;t get to oily</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this oil I used as a sealant and may hair felt very supple and soft. Looking forward to see how it will repair my hair s this is only my first time using it</li>
    <li> I have very long/wavy hair. It was a bit damaged and frizzy which tends to happen a lot during the summer. At first I was worried about using any kind of oil on my hair since it also tends to get a little oily. This Foxbrim Argan Oil is AMAZING. My hair looks beautiful and is significantly less frizzy. It also doesn&#x27;t get oily right away which tends to happens when I use other oils. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now. I apply it every time I wash my hair while it&#x27;s still wet. I have yet to have a complaint about it. LOVE IT *I acquired this item through AMZ Review Trader for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, it is very concentrated and for that reason you cant use it in high quantities, some drops are enought to have good results.  I liked it, i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Did not work as described.  Left my hair feeling gross, the best I can explain it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Foxbrim’s Total Hair Repair Oil and I love how healthy my hair looks. It combines nutrient-rich plant oils to effectively nourish and completely restore hair. Feed your hair with nature’s best. Now’s the time to replenish dry and damaged hair to give you the beautifully strong, healthy looking hair you desire and deserve. Key natural ingredients include Organic Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Grapeseed Oil, and Sunflower Oil. I like to put this on my hair about ten minutes before I shower. I start at the ends of my hair and work up until any damaged hair is covered. After ten minutes, I shower and do my regular hair care routine. I have noticed my hair feels and looks much healthier after using, especially after I use a flat iron or any other hot hair tools. I received this complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I believe are good and I personally use.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. I can really smell the grape seed in it. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair so incredibly soft. This product is worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> it takes just a few drops on wet hair and i can comb my tangled hair.  it comes out shiny when dry.  I use a round brush and keep brushing it till dry and it calms the frizzies.  I probally won&#x27;t buy again because i found something cheaper from my hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it does not do anything for my hair, actually the opposite it disturbs my scalp. I tried it overnight, as well as just a few minutes before washing my hair and the quality of my hair did not improve and it actually irritated my scalp so I stopped using it after a few weeks. I am starting to question the reviews on Amazon, but maybe it does work for some people.</li>
    <li> My hair felt a lot better after using this it felt more healthier</li>
    <li> I have very thick and course hair, and no matter what I do, it never seems to look very healthy. So a friend recommended that I try Argon Oil, that they had great results from using it. So I decided to give it a try and see how it worked. I love the huge bottle it came in, it will last quite a long time, and comes with a convenient dropper. I make sure to put it in my hair everyday after I shower and fix my hair. It gives it a healthy sheen and it looks so much better. It also helps to maintain the natural frizz in my hair, and makes it smooth. I highly recommend this, it is a great product and for the size bottle you receive it is a great value. I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> I have used this item a few times now and I love the way my hair feels the next day - I have been putting it in my hair at night and then I wash my hair the next day and it is not as dry as before - also I know you can use this as a leave in conditioner for your hair after you wash your hair.  Smells nice also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my hair looking good in the morning and nicely conditioned before washing again - winter is hard around here and it is cold and dry - hair tends to fly away and this keeps that from happening.  I love the products from this company - everything I have tried I have liked,</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim but so glad I did. I use it overnight and wash it out in the morning. My hair actually feels healthier. I prefer to use this than less washing. I actually like how it makes my scalp feel too. I have to think it&#x27;s all the different oils working together.</li>
    <li> I got an unfortunate perm last year so I was excited to have the opportunity try out this oil! Very good stuff! It helped with breakage and dryness.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this product.</li>
