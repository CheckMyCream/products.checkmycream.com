      <li>The aroma is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>love Plant Therapy oils.  </li>
      <li>Trying to incorporate it into more potions and lotions.</li>
      <li>Despite great care, too much oil is dispensed.</li>
      <li>mostly use this oil for cooking, specifically for chocolate production.</li>
      <li>I love putting this in my water for a refreshing drink .</li>
      <li>so I am delighted to have been able to purchase a large size.</li>
      <li>I have found their oils to be far superior to others when it comes to quality and fragrance, and I love that they offer organic for many of their oils.</li>
      <li>Quite strong.</li>
      <li>So, it is fine</li>
      <li>All have been pure and effective in each application  </li>
      <li>Will enjoy finding what all I can do with it.</li>
      <li>Orange oil is useful in so many ways</li>
      <li>This is a very strong and pure orange oil.</li>
      <li>email contact with the owner of this brand has me satisfied that he knows what he&#x27;s doing and that these products are as pure as he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good strength for the low price.</li>
      <li>I had been getting on that famous cyber marketplace straight from the presses in India, halfway across the world.</li>
      <li>This brand is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>What can happen is that the oil will produce a mild to severe immune response (rash, swelling, histamine reaction).</li>
      <li>A few drops (perhaps 3 to 5) will add a distinct and delicious orange flavour to about a pound or so of home made chocolate (I make it from whole cacao beans).</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased and hope to put it to use soon.</li>
      <li>This orange oil doesn&#x27;t smell as my last bottle of another brand, but it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>The same applies to most essential oils, although some are fine undiluted (for most people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The aroma is great too and I will put it on a small piece of cottonball and put in my shirt.</li>
      <li>Pure orangeiness!</li>
      <li>like buying a candle it burns but no real room filling freshness, same, so spray stuff or buy car air freshner works best in  room overall, not fancy but works and cheap.</li>
      <li>but so far both kiddos skin are fine.</li>
      <li>Love this essential oil, quality product</li>
      <li>One drop is enough and lasts many hours.</li>
      <li>So much better than standard orange extract.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely purchase this again and again!</li>
      <li>Love this orange essential oil.</li>
      <li>And large amount for the $.</li>
      <li>Love that you get 30 ml for not very much cost.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have other sweet orange oils to compare this with, so I can only write about it on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Really gives the orange flavor.</li>
      <li>Because citrus oils can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, I&#x27;m not presently putting on my body, but perhaps in the winter I may do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I have noticed that this oil is not nearly as strong smelling as that India oil, nose right on top of it</li>
      <li>Really sweet smell, works great, doesn&#x27;t stain and am even thinking about putting a drop or two in my lemonade for a little &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; in the flavor - but not sure if it can be eaten.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Having tried the Cinnamon and Sweet Orange oil, I have now ordered quite a number of Plant Therapy Essential Oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Citrus oils are particularly prone to do this.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy sweet orange oil provides long lasting fragrance in diffuser with sweet almond oil as the carrier.</li>
      <li>I am new to using EO&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Sweet orange is very refreshing and uplifting during those cold, gloomy winter months.</li>
      <li>this is a great oil, although may feel a little weak smelling compared to many other oils, which is normal for orange essential oil.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s cheap and makes a lot with what little is in the bottles...</li>
      <li>I use this oil in the same burner or warmer that I used for the India oil, same tea light candles and in the same room.</li>
      <li>This essential oil is very fragrant which is just what I was looking for to use in my dish</li>
      <li>That way i can liberally use a very pure essential oil for things such as cleaning and putting in  humidifier without wincing.</li>
      <li>sure everything was to expectations, especially on such a small order.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using essential oils for years but was never devoted to any particular brand until I found Plant Therapy oils.</li>
      <li>I purchased this essential oil to put a few drops on some wool balls for laundry - I only need a few drops to help infuse my drying clothes with a great orange scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two bottles so far and have no regrets.</li>

    <li> Really gives the orange flavor. So much better than standard orange extract.</li>
    <li> this is a great oil, although may feel a little weak smelling compared to many other oils, which is normal for orange essential oil.</li>
    <li> Great product, received when promised.</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil, quality product</li>
    <li> The aroma is fantastic!  I will absolutely purchase this again and again!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! And large amount for the $. I mix a tiny bit into my cloth diaper wipes solution for my twins. It does say possible skin sensitivity on the bottle but so far both kiddos skin are fine. Think it would be irritating if you directly put the oil only on your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my maple necked bass&#x27;s, and the back&#x27;s of my other bass necks(as the other wax&#x27;s and oils can be sticky).</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil to put a few drops on some wool balls for laundry - I only need a few drops to help infuse my drying clothes with a great orange scent. I also use it as part of a cleaning and deodorizing house spray solution. Seems to be great quality. Nice and strong and I haven&#x27;t even used a third of my bottle yet. Great Buy! Did I mention it was Organic? Ya that is a double thumbs up cause of that. 10 stars.</li>
    <li> Smells just like an orange. Will enjoy finding what all I can do with it.</li>
    <li> I am using this oil for my new, green approach to cleaning my house. The ingredients used include choosing essential oils for both their beneficial properties and their scent. Orange is an antibacterial and makes cleaning smell delicious, itss a must have and this is working for me!</li>
    <li> Great works well with patchouli. ..thanks</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Trying to incorporate it into more potions and lotions.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a very strong orange scent.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent, my clients and I love it! Sweet orange is very refreshing and uplifting during those cold, gloomy winter months.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to EO&#x27;s through doTerra.  Their costs were prohibitive so I gave Plant Therapy a try, and wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  Their oils are just as high quality, and excellent prices.  This orange oil smells heavenly!  We diffuse it daily.  Love it!</li>
    <li> awesome oil!  Smells wonderful and is perfect for the products I needed it for!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Orange oil is useful in so many ways so I am delighted to have been able to purchase a large size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used this item yet, but once it arrived I had to open it and take a whiff.  It&#x27;s not a fake-smelling orange scent.  It reminds me of the orange oil that you would buy for conditioning wood furniture- like what orange rinds smell like.  So far I&#x27;m pleased and hope to put it to use soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for soap making and I love the scent of the soap (as do others!) It has a nice orange smell without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> This brand is pretty strong. One or two drops gets the job done. I will try some of the other oils as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Quite strong. Am currently using it for homemade laundry soap. Seems to be doing the trick. Good strength for the low price.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is very fragrant which is just what I was looking for to use in my dish soap.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast and the packaging was excellent. Product arrived safely.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Either my nose has gotten numb or just used to stronger stuff I had been getting on that famous cyber marketplace straight from the presses in India, halfway across the world. I use this oil in the same burner or warmer that I used for the India oil, same tea light candles and in the same room. After 5 disappointing uses I have noticed that this oil is not nearly as strong smelling as that India oil, nose right on top of it I still can&#x27;t smell anything, what drips on my fingers every now and then only smells for about 5 to 10 minutes. I won&#x27;t waste my candles on this product and will just use it straight out of the bottle which actually smells stronger and stays in the air longer.</li>
    <li> I adore Plant Therapy oils. Always fresh, always great in purity.</li>
    <li> Love this orange essential oil. I use this in a bottle mixed with vodka to re-freshen my sheets, curtains and couches. It makes my house smell great!  It reminds me of the orange groves my grandparents lived on. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this! I use this for keeping pests out of my home...mainly spiders and silverfish. It works wonders, it smells nice (way better than all those chemical cleaners or pest control), totally safe around kids and pets, it&#x27;s cheap and makes a lot with what little is in the bottles... I also use this for a stress relief for my hubby and it does the job. I&#x27;ve purchased two bottles so far and have no regrets.</li>
    <li> like buying a candle it burns but no real room filling freshness, same, so spray stuff or buy car air freshner works best in  room overall, not fancy but works and cheap.</li>
    <li> I make my own toothpaste and use copious amounts of this oil - it is delightful.  I have also used it on my face at night (no I haven&#x27;t burnt to a crisp afterwards despite all the dire sensitivity warnings) to try and fight acne, and although it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d&#x27;ve liked for that, my skin did feel and smell very nice and look brighter in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using essential oils for years but was never devoted to any particular brand until I found Plant Therapy oils. I have found their oils to be far superior to others when it comes to quality and fragrance, and I love that they offer organic for many of their oils. we recently started replacing toxic store bought products with natural ones that we make ourselves. I love adding the Plant Therapy oils like orange and lavender to our soaps, detergents, cleaners, pet shampoos, insect repellent etc. they smell wonderful and are so much better for us than the chemical laden stuff we used to use.</li>
    <li> love Plant Therapy oils.  Price and size is good.&lt;br /&gt;use for homemade product</li>
    <li> This is a very strong and pure orange oil. A little goes a long way, which makes it last a lot longer. Great oil for the price!</li>
    <li> It smells good but it is heavily diluted, probably in a ration of 1 to 30. This is slightly perfumed oil, not essential oil. Imcomparable to undiluted essential oils.  I had bought 4 essential oils at once and all were unsacceptably diluted. I tried to return them but could not.  I recommend you don&#x27;t buy anything from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Nice strong orangy smell.  This one actually drips out like it is supposed to. So, it is fine and I use it to add to white vinegar for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Works for what I am using it for. I used it to add fragrance to my cleaning products. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> I knew that I was getting a good, quality product with this company, they have a very good reputation. what I did not expect was to get a follow-up email making sure everything was to expectations, especially on such a small order. very pleasant surprise. I will continue to recommend this company</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this essential oil, and this product range/brand in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First some prelude on my background: I do not consider myself an essential oil expert, although I have had an active interest in (and made regular use of) aromatherapy and essential oils for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have other sweet orange oils to compare this with, so I can only write about it on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My email contact with the owner of this brand has me satisfied that he knows what he&#x27;s doing and that these products are as pure as he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use this oil for cooking, specifically for chocolate production. A few drops (perhaps 3 to 5) will add a distinct and delicious orange flavour to about a pound or so of home made chocolate (I make it from whole cacao beans). Because it is steam distilled there are no solvent residues in this oil, and because it is from organic oranges it does not degrade the organic status of my chocolate. It also adds a nice touch to cream of pumpkin soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried the Cinnamon and Sweet Orange oil, I have now ordered quite a number of Plant Therapy Essential Oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that some essential oils can create or provoke sensitivity in the user if used in an undiluted form on the skin. Citrus oils are particularly prone to do this. What can happen is that the oil will produce a mild to severe immune response (rash, swelling, histamine reaction). Therefore I recommend using this oil in a carrier oil when applying it topically. The same applies to most essential oils, although some are fine undiluted (for most people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no hesitation to recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> The oil is nice. However, the reducer, the plastic insert that should make drop by drop measurement possible, is sized incorrectly given the viscosity of the oil. Despite great care, too much oil is dispensed. I use a small amount of orange oil daily; this product is more frustrating than energizing. Do not buy this brand if drop accuracy is necessary.</li>
    <li> i do like this smell smells like oranges but smell dont last long i hav to use alot at a time</li>
    <li> Yum Yum  I love putting this in my water for a refreshing drink . Taste  yummy and great price for  organic</li>
    <li> Bought this to scent my home made surface cleaner recipe, and I LOVE it!  Really sweet smell, works great, doesn&#x27;t stain and am even thinking about putting a drop or two in my lemonade for a little &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; in the flavor - but not sure if it can be eaten.  Anyway, great product at great price!</li>
    <li> Love a good citrus smell</li>
    <li> Love that you get 30 ml for not very much cost.  That way i can liberally use a very pure essential oil for things such as cleaning and putting in  humidifier without wincing.</li>
    <li> Pure orangeiness! I put in tea or in food. The aroma is great too and I will put it on a small piece of cottonball and put in my shirt. One drop is enough and lasts many hours. Because citrus oils can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, I&#x27;m not presently putting on my body, but perhaps in the winter I may do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You never know what you&#x27;ll get when you order something online, so when I smelled and tasted how pure and delightful this was, I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy sweet orange oil provides long lasting fragrance in diffuser with sweet almond oil as the carrier. I&#x27;m using P.T. lemongrass,  cinnamon bark, peppermint, sensual synergy  blend and pain aid roll on synergy blend. All have been pure and effective in each application  I&#x27;ve tried. I combine orange oil, lemongrass and peppermint with distilled water in a spray bottle to use as insect repellent.  It&#x27;s very pleasant and a safe mix for humans and pets.  You must use caution as with all substances you apply to skin.  Get a book.  Unless you are a mosquito or a fly, that is. It doesn&#x27;t kill them but they leave you alone.</li>
    <li> smells awesome. use it to scent my vinegar cleaning water and homemade air freshener.</li>
    <li> I wanted a massage oil for a surgical scar and bought this to add to jojoba oil. It smells wonderful and time will tell with the scar.</li>
    <li> I am new to using EO&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t have another to compare it with as of yet.  But it performed well in my products.</li>
    <li> This orange oil doesn&#x27;t smell as my last bottle of another brand, but it&#x27;s nice and I appreciate the size.</li>
