<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Delivered on time. As advertised</li>
    <li> This is the one of the 5 random perfumes purchased in amazon for gifting purpose. Its pretty difficult to buy perfumes that you haven&#x27;t tried earlier, just by looking at description and reviews. On the initial try, the scent comes across as so strange and powdery that i thought will have to return it. However the smell gets better with time. This is definitely a very old fashioned perfume, to be enjoyed by the older ladies, so will gift this to my grandmother.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this!  Nice to have it back in my rotation! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely perfume you can wear every day. The bottle is beautiful as well with the embossed Swan design. The price is definitely great and affordable. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> dont know yet very nice bottle....nice smell, wife has not used it yet.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied. My mother thought this was not sold in the US anymore</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for someone in their late forties, and it smelled terrible to them and myself. I thought this perfume would be really good for a mature gift for a woman, but I had no idea it should have been for an older woman in her sixties. I saw all of the good feedback, but in the end it was a major disappointment for a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite for more than 30 years, and I consider it my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;. I may try and like others, but I always end up going back to Vanderbilt, and I still get compliments on it. It is one of the most long lasting colognes that Ive worn and aside from the clean scent...lasting a long time is very important. I hope they dont quit making it!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my mom.  It&#x27;s her favorite scent.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift, perfect price!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is just like I remember.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> I always use this perfume</li>
    <li> I purchased Vanderbilt for my sister&#x27;s birthday and was she surprised as well as greatly pleased.  Vanderbilt is her favorite scent.  This was such a good bargain I purchased two for my sister instead of one.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite and she gives it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who requested it.  needless to say they were pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, good price, good quantity. This has a very light scent to it. Not too heavy. Best used right after a shower in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice Perfume And Smells Good !</li>
    <li> The product is great and the price was cheaper than I found in the stores and very convienent to have it shipped directly to my house.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Very very good, i like this. Thank you</li>
    <li> Good price, shipping ontime</li>
    <li> When I used this fragrance initially my friends and I did not like the scent. I decided to give it away but after more usage I have come to appreciate the scent. When I am wearing same it&#x27;s just up in my nostrils. I have gotten to love it now.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy, I also bought the body spray and it smells just the same, both are great.</li>
    <li> A classic from the 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> She wanted it but it turned out she did not like it so my sister got to keep it for her later</li>
    <li> This was my moms favorite scent and brings back fond memories.  So glad I found it, light scent and was a great price for such a large amount.  Now its my favorite too.</li>
    <li> Very good buy, careful packaging and a beautifully light fragrance. I have seen this twice what I paid for it through Amazon at local drug stores.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas present for my wife she love the spray fragrence. And uses all the time</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait till my perfume arrived. It was a birthday gift from my husband, believe me he was glad he purchased it for me. I love the way GV perfume smells on me.</li>
    <li> Loved it then. Love it now</li>
    <li> This is very watered down and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> The product came quicker than expected and met same criteria as in store purchase with a much more affordable price.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite fragrances. Love it !!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years and still get complimented on the fragrance.  It is subtle and does not over power people.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other companies, you get the same thing as the photo you see, and yes you get 3.4 oz for that price. I was very happy with my order, and will order from them again when I need more.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent but it was&#x60;t for me, I bought for a gift, personally I would&#x60;t use it.</li>
    <li> I really like how this perfume smells.  It is clean, and not pungent.  I will buy this again for sure!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price, beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> Via my wife: \\&quot;I love Vanderbilt.  I have loved it for over 25 years.  This purchase was a great disappointment.  The scent is so weak that I can&#x27;t smell it on my skin only 30 minutes later.  Usually I can smell Vanderbilt throughout the day.  But this was a waste of my money.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My mother had been looking for this scent and thought it was out of production because she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  She was so happy when I found it on Amazon and gave it to her for Christmas.  :)  Personally it seems very 70&#x27;s - 80&#x27;s scent but it&#x27;s reminiscent of my mother and aunts, so the nostalgia makes it very pleasant for me.  Good present item for the women in your family.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere in town.  Thank you for providing this item at such a good price!</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever!  Price was fantastic.  Perfume smells wonderful.  Shipping was great too!  I was very happy with the purchase in every aspect.  I won&#x27;t need any more for a while, but when I do, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I like this light, slightly sweet cologne and have been wearing it for years. Everything else seems too strong and overwhelming. Too bad it&#x27;s not made anymore.</li>
    <li> Great price. Love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I should have given this review a long time ago. I will order this again, it is my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume in a group at least two or three people comment on how wonderful it smells and want to know what it is. What I find interesting is that it seems to develop subtle differences depending on the wearer as if it were adapting its chemistry to each individual. The result is something unique and personal. If you are looking to try something different give this old classic a try.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the scent. It is exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> This is such a great smelling perfume. I have used this for years and I never get tired of it. The bath powder is great too.</li>
    <li> this has been my moms perfume forever and she cant do without it.... always buying it for her when she needs it</li>
    <li> My Mother always enjoyed this fragrance, it really made her day to get this as a gift!  Thanks for the variety of products you have.</li>
    <li> Wife review: It is perfect for night go outs. It smell very sweet and the smell keep it in the cloths. I have been asked about it because it is a very powerful scent. If you don&#x27;t like sweet EDT don&#x27;t buy it otherwise it is great</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this forever!</li>
    <li> my favorite cologne for over 20 years</li>
    <li> This fragrance is strong and probably not for anyone under the age of 60. I was sad I didn&#x27;t like it because I was given it as a gift. Very matronly. All I could smell was strong powdery rose not unlike old fashioned bath soap. Not necessarily a bad thing, but not my preference. I am sure it would last a long time on the skin, but I was too busy scrubbing it off. lol.</li>
    <li> Smells like an old lady perfume</li>
    <li> Long time user thanks</li>
    <li> THE GREAT highly recommend, safe and fast delivery</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite from all time, it is not strong, yet it smells amazing, bought 2 just in case, will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Great price, and the three bottles I ordered arrived in perfect condition. This was one of the best packing jobs that I have ever received. See you next year!</li>
    <li> Nice, light fragrance.  Have worn this for years.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i buy this perfume thru Amazon and i just love. Now i know i can buy for my sister &#x27;cause my sister loves too.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume of all time!</li>
    <li> Came immediately and packed well.  This is my day to day go to scent.  Was happy to find it so reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and so does her man</li>
    <li> My mother loves this stuff</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume...I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  Great price too!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, it silvery light and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> My fiancee mentioned that she used to wear Gloria Vanderbilt one day we were talking about perfumes. See, the one she was wearing at the time I didn&#x27;t like, and we had not talked about that before. So, as a result of the conversation, I went out and get it for her. Well, she is pleased, and I am too. The fragrance is great.</li>
    <li> Do not like having to type a narrative just to post rating.</li>
    <li> Horrible perfume. As soon as I used it gave me a very bad rush.  Not sure why.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> My mother has used this product on and off for years, and introduced me to it several years ago when she found it again. I love it as well (which makes for competition to buy up the bottles we find, since the local stores are a pain about restocking it).</li>
    <li> love the smell ,People always say I smell so nice so pretty</li>
    <li> Gift for my sister.  This is her favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Goes on with one scent &amp; slowly evolves.  It was a favorite years ago; no longer true.</li>
    <li> My BBF always smelled sooo good and I kept asking her what it was and then I would forget later when looking at Good Smellies in the stores... So, one day, while taking to her on the phone, I asked her again and looked it up on Amazon... (where, of course, they have EVERYTHING)  and sure enough here it was... Living in a rural area, Amazon makes it sooo nice to shop and have things delivered..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the Smell... It is just right... Not tooo strong but yet strong enough... I love it...</li>
    <li> This is, in my opinion, the sweetest, sexiest and most romantic perfume ever around. A great gift for your girlfriend, wife, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for Gloria Vanderbilt!!</li>
    <li> I choose it cause my late husband used to buy it for me and it was as expected the old familiar scent it brought back some good memories</li>
    <li> My Mother-in-law loves it.The smells stays with you. And it smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t too strong. Most of all she loves it.</li>
    <li> The product was received and met all expectations. This is a genuine product and was offered at an attractive price.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but my elderly mother really likes it.  Her expensive gift set perfumes keep disappearing in Assisted Living, so I wanted something for her that was mild, and inexpensive.  Its not for youthful tastes, I would say~  Definitely not a trendy fragrance.  It arrived very quickly; I think 2 days.  Price was great.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Large bottle and it&#x27;s the same smell as years ago.  I receommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> So glad you have this. It&#x27;s my fave!</li>
    <li> Extremely disatisfied ! This scent in not fit to wear.</li>
    <li> I have used Gloria Vanderbilt for at least 20 years and loved every min. of it.</li>
    <li> So happy to have finally found a source for this, my favorite fragrance of all time!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite cologne and I can&#x27;t find it in  the stores.  This is the second year I have ordered it  from Amazon and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Great price and in stock. Purchased as a gift for my mother, her favorite. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Looked exactly how it is pictured! Made a great gift.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother and she loves it....</li>
    <li> My favorite all-time cologne. Have been wearing Vanderbilt for 20+ years. Bought an extra bottle at this great price just because!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a feminine scent that would have lasting power. I love the notes in this so much and the layers that come after the day of wearing it are awesome. Starts out strong and ends the day with a gentle aroma of sweet white flowers. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments one being from a male colleague that exclaimed &amp;#34;I love when you come to my office because you always smell so good.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It is the exact product description and arrived a day earlier! It was a gift for my mother and she&#x27;s super happy</li>
    <li> This vintage perfume is available at some local drug stores but it is ridiculously overpriced.  This online product arrived and the recipient was ecstatic to wear it again and it brought back happy memories.  I would purchase this item again.  Some claim that this online version that is cheaper lacks in substance in regards to its scent.  I believe the smell is still fragrant and worth the buy.</li>
    <li> yes this is my item  thankyou i just the item .is perfect  i know what is hard the send thankyou</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it last a long time on your skin. The price wasn&#x27;t bad at all either.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful and perfect price for a nice smell.  This is my favorite product which I try to  keep on hand all the time.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom because she likes this. The product is awesome and smells great I recommend it for anyone</li>
    <li> I think he will smell very fast</li>
    <li> My favorite! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Smells good and a great price. I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes and cologne but this Vanderbilt is mild and doesn&#x27;t set off my allergies.</li>
    <li> This is not what is used to be. I cant even smell it 5 minutes after I put it on. Bottles I have bought in the past lasted all day and then some!</li>
    <li> Best fragrance for my wife.  I love it!</li>
    <li> great product, great price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite fragrenc of mine and of my wife.  It is not to strong but gives a gentle clean and sexy smell.</li>
    <li> Always have liked this perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells like power.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
    <li> Happy wife, happy life!</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, only needs essential oils to fix perfume.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised love the scent</li>
    <li> The product and the brands themselves have been time-tested. That is why it still has a market and demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is unfortunate that Amazon.com markets the same product using different nomenclatures with different prices to meet the interest of the different venders. When I placed the order for 3 items I did not realize that I was ordering the same identical product at three different prices. I thought each was a different product of the brand Gloria Vanderbilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result the recipient of the gift had to laugh at my stupidity. Unfortunate and it left a different unhealthy taste in shopping on Amazon.com. Regrettable, but true.</li>
    <li> Brought it as a Christmas gift for my Mother and she loves it. Shipping was quick and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> love this perfume.  Sometimes hard to find.  Smells fresh, not heavy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best fragrance out there I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years! Couldn&#x27;t find it in our local stores but amazon came through for me again.</li>
    <li> Este producto es el que siempre he usado. Me encanto cuando lo encontre en internet.  Es muy bueno lo recomiendo.</li>
