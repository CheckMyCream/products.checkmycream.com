      <li>It smells warm, sweet and feminine and the lotion</li>
      <li>It smells like roses in my opinion , which I love &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;Great price for a full sized bottle :)</li>
      <li>just as nice as the first bottles  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge lotion girl...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s horrid, stinky, cheap fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Thicker than most lotions and is really good for dry skin especailly hands and feet.</li>
      <li>Flowers and Sweet Spices.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d actually encourage them to purchase here based of the price and good reviews on the seller.</li>
      <li>The lotion ever love it love it fragence last all day.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and how b silky smooth and soft it goes on</li>

      <li>probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but that is because they are so many other smells and brands to try, and I would like to try more things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty girly</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance of Pink Chiffon and own it in several configurations, including the spray cologne.  </li>
      <li>,this cream is so sweet and also has your  skin very soft and ice.</li>
      <li>Pink Chiffon body lotion is such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is soothing but not overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>boyfriend loved this smell so much, he thought it was unbelievably girly.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes this fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use because you just press down on one side of the top and the lotion comes out on the other side.  </li>
      <li>When you are through, you just press it down and you never have to take the top off.  </li>
      <li>people, less is more.</li>
      <li>Item came in earlier than expected and was in great shape, with the packaging carefully wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>The bottle is the new bottle</li>
      <li>Pretty simple.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s alright since it looks prettier than the old version.</li>
      <li>recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the other pink chiffon items (shower gel, body spray)</li>

    <li> Love the scent! Great price, love this lotion.</li>

    <li> Great scent! Never been disappointed with anything from bbw before, and this came quickly.</li>
    <li> just as nice as the first bottles  I bought smells wonderful will purchase more</li>
    <li> Bath &amp; Body Works Pink Chiffon body lotion is such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is soothing but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;The price including shipping was fine.&lt;br /&gt;My only con is that it took forever to get here!</li>
    <li> Why would anyone rate this well?  It&#x27;s horrid, stinky, cheap fragrance.  Please do the world a favor and buy something good or don&#x27;t wear fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people, less is more.</li>
    <li> I made my purchase of this item in the Bath and Body works store for $11.00 plus tax. I feel like an idiot now because the online price here is actually cheaper for one - shocking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend loved this smell so much, he thought it was unbelievably girly. I&#x27;m a girly girl, but this smell didn&#x27;t suit me. I don&#x27;t mind it, it is a good smell - but I prefer something fruity or savory compared to flowers. Like apples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great smell, though. It reminds me of what I would think a Ballerina would smell like. Flowers and Sweet Spices. Like Potpourri made from rose and summer flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but that is because they are so many other smells and brands to try, and I would like to try more things. I would suggest it to friends though - I&#x27;m pretty girly and so are my friends. I&#x27;d actually encourage them to purchase here based of the price and good reviews on the seller.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and how b silky smooth and soft it goes on</li>
    <li> I got these for my mother for Christmas. She loved them and uses them regurly.Great price.She says that she would love some more.</li>
    <li> Item came in earlier than expected and was in great shape, with the packaging carefully wrapped in bubble wrap. I bought this for one of my mother&#x27;s stocking stuffers because she really love this scent and it&#x27;s not always in the B&amp;B Works around our house so I&#x27;m hoping she&#x27;ll love it. The bottle is the new bottle so it&#x27;s not like the picture but that&#x27;s alright since it looks prettier than the old version.</li>
    <li> I adore this!! Smells great and girly and the price was really good in comparison to in stores! :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the other pink chiffon items (shower gel, body spray)</li>
    <li> The container I received is the newer one, not the one depicted on the website.  It is very easy to use because you just press down on one side of the top and the lotion comes out on the other side.  When you are through, you just press it down and you never have to take the top off.  I love the fragrance of Pink Chiffon and own it in several configurations, including the spray cologne.  It smells warm, sweet and feminine and the lotion of course smells the same.  In addition, the lotion keeps your skin moisturized for hours and pleasant-smelling as well.  It looks very pretty displayed by my bathtub.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> pink chiffon is bomb it has  a scent that last all day long,this cream is so sweet and also has your  skin very soft and ice. i think i will buy more of it.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite smell and will buy again.</li>
    <li> excellent aroma, happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> The lotion ever love it love it fragence last all day.  Thicker than most lotions and is really good for dry skin especailly hands and feet.</li>
    <li> This was a deal for sure! I love the smell and the bottle was a nice size.  I will order another bottle soon.</li>
