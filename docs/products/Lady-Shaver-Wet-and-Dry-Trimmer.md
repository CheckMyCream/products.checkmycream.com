    <li> Works great.  I higher recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this works very efficently and does the job  This is my 3rd one the others just wore out</li>
    <li> Fast and efficient, as long as the batteries are fresh.</li>
    <li> It did not work even when I tried my own batteries.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I have.  Only reason that I had to buy another one was because I dropped the first one,  It still works but the on off switch broke in the fall.  But I loved this shaver so much that I had to have another one.</li>
    <li> It is a great little trimmer. I love it. This is my second one</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the shaver.  i would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Lady Shaver many years ago on a TV show, and loved it then.  After the small mesh screen on it recently got damaged, I was so happy to find Amazon carrying this item!

    <li> This is my fourth one. Two were gifts and the other two were for me so I could have a spare. I&#x27;ve had mine for at least a 6-7 years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I just recently bought the second one just to have.</li>
    <li> when i first turned it on i was scared. its sound and vibration was loud and strong, my hand was shaking. its shaves pretty good and there are some hairs left behind but its good. with long hairs it kinds hurts when you use it. so when i shave my legs i first shave a quick touch up with a razor then i use the trimmer. and so from there weekly i use it because it doesnt hurt as much with little to no hair. great product recommend</li>
