      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Have been using for decades (since they discontinued their cake mascara which was my all-time favorite!)</li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I got it at an amazing price here on Amazon as an add on item and thought why not.</li>
      <li>what kind of mascara they use.  </li>
      <li>and this is the perfect mascara for me because it darkens the lash without lengthening it to much.</li>
      <li>I do not have allergies of any kind</li>
      <li>It honestly looked like it had been around for YEARS.  </li>
      <li>the brush is awesome it really spread out the eye lashes ..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all types of mascaras and it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of brush, claim to fame, or marketing ploy they never work as good as old faithful Great Lash!!!</li>
      <li>One of the best and a classic for a reason.</li>
      <li>Came quick and works great</li>
      <li>It smeared very easily too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend shelling out more for hypo allergic or making your own.</li>
      <li>Still is the best mascara as far as I am concerned.  </li>
      <li>This mascara is, by far, the best looking mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>Wife looks nice now :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, never mess with the best, Maybelline!</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>and if it looks too good to be true, it is.  </li>
      <li>Top rated mascara forever.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve heard so many people claim it&#x27;s a holy grail item for them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t waterproof as so many are</li>
      <li>and it lasts all day without leaving or smudging I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This brush makes me have spider leg lashes if I apply more than one coat.</li>
      <li>I like it because no matter how many layers I apply, it does not clump.</li>
      <li>Magazines and reviewers still choose this as a top buy.</li>
      <li>I love that this is not waterproof.</li>
      <li>the $2 one is better.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, MANY mascaras over the years</li>
      <li>and I always wind up back with good ol&#x27; Maybelline Great Lash.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s more of the wand than the mascara itself.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite masacra.</li>
      <li>This has always been my favorite &#x27;go-to&#x27; mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Great Lash before, but I guess it was \\&quot;Very Black\\&quot; not</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t find it that great of a mascara.  </li>
      <li>Maybelline  mascara is my favorite mascara and by ordering from Amazon saves me money  because it&#x27;s cheaper than anywhere else that I purchased  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>when this mascara is better and at 1/5 of the price.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara, just not the washable formula.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even had co-workers ask me if I&#x27;m okay.</li>
      <li>But most women buy mascara to lengthen and/or thicken their lashes and this just doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>Those pricey products just weren&#x27;t any better, and sometimes they were just awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess if you&#x27;re lookin for a mascara to give your lashes a darker color and nothing more, you&#x27;d be satisfied with this.</li>
      <li>I had to keep adding more and more just to get my lashes to be noticeable .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this in the past and it was okay but the last two times I used it I had a horrible reaction. My eyes are red swollen itchy and I&#x27;m miserable.</li>
    <li> My favorite &amp; only mascara for literally decades. I use it ten curl lashes.Come out perfect.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most evil things ever brought into existence!  I look like Quasimodo my eyes are so swollen.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I have to warn others..... do not use this! I just found out what has been causing my eyelid horror and it is this! Itchy, red, scaling eyelids and under the eye.. worst thing ever!</li>
    <li> I had a horrible allergic reaction to this mascara - twice.  Swollen lids, excessive discharge, red irritated eyes.  The irritation lasted about a week and I had to use a prescription eye drop.  It was horrible.  I used to use this product all the time, but they must have changed the formula.  I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> I also had SEVERE allergies after using this makeup and I NEVER get sick or have allergies.  It made my eyes swell, get puffy, dry, and itchy.  It was so bad, I will have gone to the doctor 4 times because of it.  No makeup for 10 days to clear it. NEVER buy this ever.  Horrible chemicals inside.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this mascara as its been around forever and magazines swear by it. I got it at an amazing price here on Amazon as an add on item and thought why not. Well it did absolutely nothing for my lashes. The brush was thin and nothing special. I had to keep adding more and more just to get my lashes to be noticeable . Then I watched a movie and shed a few tears and it was a complete mess! Black everywhere! I had previously been using IT Cosmetics mascara which is not waterproof either and this never happened!  I had to wash my entire face. I wouldn&#x27;t even try the waterproof version of this, if available, because if this did nothing for my lashes I&#x27;m pretty sure the waterproof one is the same. Not happy at all with this and cannot understand why editors choose this as the gold standard in mascaras. I guess they never cry.</li>
    <li> I buy this brand of mascara all the time, so when it arrived I never thought to keep the packaging.  Unfortunately the mascara is significantly dried out, so when I try to brush it on, there is barely any one the brush.</li>
    <li> I did an incredible amount of research trying to figure out what in the world was making my eyes so red, itchy, and puffy.  At first, I thought it was just the cold, dry air of winter.  I tried all kinds of creams - nothing worked.  Finally, I decided to go with a process of elimination and stop using my Maybelline Great Lash mascara (along with a few other eye makeup products).  The reaction went away over several days, and I was afraid to go back to any of the products I eliminated.  However, yesterday I decided to give Maybelline Great Lash another try to see if I had a reaction and BAM!  A few hours later, the skin around my eyes became extremely itchy, red and puffy.  Then I started reading other reviews of many other people who had the same exact reaction.  I do not have sensitive skin, and have never had a reaction from makeup before, so whatever is in this stuff (shellac?) must be pretty a pretty harsh ingredient.  Hopefully they realize how many people are getting this reaction, and they remove the ingredient.  Until then, I will stick with a different brand.</li>
    <li> This is great mascara. I spend too much on make-up but I never switch from Maybelline. It is tried and true!</li>
    <li> I used this product and my eyes were left swollen, red, dry and very it by. My eye were actually hurting and I had a hard time opening my eyes for three days straight. Same with their eyeshadow. Until something here is fixed I would advise u to use your money for something else. Even Victoria&#x27;s Secret mascara is better than this</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for year&#x27;s love it goes on quickly comes off easily and does not give you racoon eye&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Very bad allergic reaction.  I&#x27;ve never reacted to any type of makeup before, so I&#x27;m not normally sensitive.  My eyes are red and swollen.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it was this product, so I gave my eyes about a week with no eye makeup.  They cleared up, but after using this mascara again last night--very carefully, just on my upper lashes to avoid skin contact--I started getting irritated and by morning I look like Quasimoto.  So embarrassed to go out to today but I have to. Yes, they need to change the formula or pull it off market until it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to this, but I&#x27;m rating it a one star because it is just a crappy product.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this because I&#x27;m cheap. I&#x27;ve never used it before but I&#x27;ve heard so many people claim it&#x27;s a holy grail item for them.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this mascara is probably the worst I&#x27;ve tried ever. Even Wet N Wild the $2 one is better. (And that is saying a lot) This mascara provides color only. No volume, no length, even after multiple coats. I felt like the more coats the worse it looked actually. ALSO, the brush, my god, why is it so tinty??? Just annoying. Such a fail.</li>
    <li> As others have stated I never experienced a problem with a mascara or any make up for that matter before but this product caused my eyes to burn and turn red. My left eye especially was swollen. Horrible product!</li>
    <li> I am 53 years old and I have only used this mascara &amp; brand since I started wearing makeup in junior high school (70&#x27;s). Anyway, I am allergic to everything under the sun &amp; this mascara has never been a problem for me to use. This mascara is absolutely wonderful. It goes on great &amp; makes my eyelashes very long. I have always gotten compliments on my long eyelashes when in fact it&#x27;s been this mascara. I use high end eye shadow from Macy&#x27;s but I will never change from using my mascara. I do not understand why people spend so much money on high end mascara when this mascara works better. It lasts all day &amp; night. It never has to be touched up. It&#x27;s been an awesome product after all these years.</li>
    <li> Have been using for decades (since they discontinued their cake mascara which was my all-time favorite!) bought a pricey brand about a month ago that had good reviews when it was time to get new mascara,  waste of money didn&#x27;t work as well and smeared too, came back to Maybelline.</li>
    <li> I tired this seveal years ago and still use it on occasion.  In general I prefer a thicker product.  For me I find this to work very well darkening my lasher but it will not thicken or lengthen.&lt;br /&gt;For some people this makes it an excellent option.  It&#x27;s formula doesn&#x27;t clump or get gummy due to its thinner formulation. I find it *wetter* than other options...which has its good and bad points... It is easy to apply but I tend to have to re-touch the under eye area after. I don&#x27;t find that it gives *racoon eyes* after its dry...  It wears very well and is pretty reasonable to get off&lt;br /&gt;The absense of fibers, etc.  makes it a good contact lens product.  And the colors are very good.  I think that this is a great and inexpensive product that will work well if all you want is lash coloring.</li>
    <li> This mascara is horrible!  I used it yesterday and today my eyes are red, puffy, swollen, dry and itchy.  I look absolutely awful!  I&#x27;ve never had any problems with mascara before.  I did research online today and this seems to be a common problem with this product.  If you do use this product, I recommend trying out a small amount and plan ahead...don&#x27;t use it if you have any special events that you need to look decent for!</li>
    <li> Have used this FOREVER -- tried other mascaras over the years, but I always come back to this!  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Classic. One of the best and a classic for a reason. Always reliable.</li>
    <li> I love the Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, but I bought the Blackest Black for the first time a few days ago and I had a terrible reaction to it. I only put mascara on my upper lashes, but from wearing this mascara my upper and lower eyelids are incredibly itchy (the top lids are much worse than the bottom) and swollen and extremely wrinkly and my upper lids are starting to peel; I look like I&#x27;ve aged 20 years in just two days. I originally thought it was the new eyeliner I&#x27;d purchased at the same time as this mascara, so I threw it out and continued to use the mascara and the reaction is getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened to me with the Maybelline Unstoppable eyeliner in the Cinnabar color a couple of years ago. I usually wear the Espresso color and the store was out of it, so I bought the other brown option (the Cinnabar) and I had the same exact allergic reaction that I&#x27;m having with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I get home from work it&#x27;s getting scrubbed off my face and the tube is going in the trash. My eyelids are on fire and I look horrible. I&#x27;ve even had co-workers ask me if I&#x27;m okay. Not cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, not only is it making me look like a haggard old lady, it doesn&#x27;t even go on very well. It&#x27;s kind of thick and clumpy... so not worth this hassle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to makeup until I purchased this mascara. Shortly after I started using it, my eyelids started itching badly. After a few days, my eyes were swollen, itchy and my eyelids were wrinkly and flaky. I thought I just had an eye infection, so I stopped using eye makeup for a few days and it started to clear up. I was starting to suspect the mascara, so I tried it once more, and sure enough the symptoms came back. Be cautioned!</li>
    <li> I like this mascara because it&#x27;s cheap, solid black and a safer formulation than others. The reason why I have to give it only three stars is because it comes off very easily (probably good for my health but not my look!). Lots of football player looking days here in the south FL summer.</li>
    <li> I was so beyond disappointed when I opened the tube and found the world&#x27;s smallest-rinky-dinkiest mascara brush ever. Its so small it takes about 4 coated to make it look like its on.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money</li>
    <li> Been using this mascara for 10 years, amazing!</li>
    <li> I am proud to say I have been using this mascara as long as it has been around!  Still is the best mascara as far as I am concerned.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do ­ colors and thickens eyelashes without smudging. It is inexpensive yet much better than many of the over priced big brands.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> Best mascara for the price on the market- no wonder it&#x27;s been around so long!</li>
    <li> Ugh!  Smudges too easily.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible reaction to this product. My eyelids are red, swollen, and itchy. It&#x27;s a horrible feeling. I&#x27;m not sure what is in the product that isn&#x27;t in other mascaras but I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. I threw it away and will never buy I again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is one of the cheaper drugstore mascaras. It is alright. The only problem I have with it is that it smears on your bottom lashes easily. It transfers to your eye bags and well.. It isn&#x27;t so bad that it makes you look like a panda but it is noticeable. I would probaly recommend this for winter when it isn&#x27;t hot unless you live in a place where it is always cold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;I recently, nine months, started to order from Amazon because CVS and other stores have gotten so expensive. The mascara is on my subscribe and save. I do not order the water proof but have not had problems with smudging. It probably lasts me a month to six weeks. I usually replace it after four weeks because I use it almost seven days and week. The product isn&#x27;t necessarily gone so I&#x27;m not sure how long it would last, I just feel four weeks is long enough. You can tell when you&#x27;re running out of mascara because you don&#x27;t get the volume.&lt;br /&gt;I like the small brush. I tried the big brush once and threw the mascara away. The big brush doesn&#x27;t define my lashes like the small brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using Great Lash by Maybelline for a *long* time, and I have tried mascaras from Chanel, MAC, Shiseido, and many more.  This is actually my favorite of basically everything I have tried so far, and is under $5!  It makes my eyes pop, goes on dark and smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump at all.  This is also the only \\&quot;non-premium\\&quot; make-up product that I use on a daily basis.  The rest of my cosmetics are from Bare Escentuals, MAC, Chanel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I allergies go, I was surprised to read about all of the allergic reactions on here.  I am very sensitive to cosmetics, wear contacts and have *severe* allergies, but this mascara has never been a factor.  I&#x27;ve actually had much more expensive mascaras give me a reaction, but not this one.  I guess it just depends on the person.  However, I think it is worth a shot for under $5, and if you&#x27;re not allergic, you will more than likely make this a life-long product.</li>
    <li> A good mascara for everyday use, but not what I choose for a dramatic look. Looks great and lasts all day when used over a lash conditioner (to thicken and lengthen) after lashes have been curled. This is one of the darkest black formulas I&#x27;ve ever used, and it looks great. It&#x27;s a long lasting formula with minimal clumping and no flaking. The only thing I hate about it is that if it gets in my eyes while washing off, it BURNS so bad! Same if I cry while wearing it! Loreal and Rimmel mascaras do the same thing, but not as bad. This mascara burns more than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite masacra. It doesn&#x27;t clump or smudge at all! And the price can&#x27;t be beat! I have natural long eyelashes and this is the perfect mascara for me because it darkens the lash without lengthening it to much. If you&#x27;re looking for more volume you might want to look at other products as this is more of a darkener than anything else.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this, especially if you have a special occasion coming soon. It&#x27;s 3 days before Christmas! I never get allergic reactions to anything and this Maybelline Great Lash Mascara Blackest Black made both of my eyes itch and my left eye is so swollen I can barely see out of it!!! I&#x27;m embarrased I&#x27;ve had to come to work like this for the last 3 days!!!!     ~fustrated and disappointed!! that&#x27;s right girls \\&quot;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ONE!!!\\&quot; Tell your friends and family!</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife loves!</li>
    <li> Best mascara on the market at any price range.</li>
    <li> I have never had allergic reaction from mascaras, but i got a really bad one from this. My eyes itched for two days straight. Also, my top and bottom eyelids were swollen for a whole day. Watch out for the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This mascara is, by far, the best looking mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought. It goes on smoother than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and leaves NO clumps. I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years. All my other makeup is MAC, Bobbi Brown and other brands found at Nordstrom. But every time I&#x27;ve strayed to try a fancy mascara from the pricier brands, I&#x27;ve been disappointed, and I&#x27;ve always come back to Maybelline for my mascara. I LOVE it. However, if you have ALLERGIES... you may be sensitive to it. For 20 years, I&#x27;ve never had a problem, but all of a sudden, I&#x27;ve found myself allergic to it. My eyes get red and swollen, and the only thing that makes them better is to stop using this mascara. My doctor told me them sometimes we just develop allergies to certain things. I&#x27;m just sad it had to be this. But just because some people have an allergy to it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product. If you can wear it, go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I can&#x27;t wear it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of mascara since I was 16 years old, and it never disappoints. Through the decades, I&#x27;ve tried out other brands (some from much more expensive department store labels) but I always come back to Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash. I now order through Subscribe and Save and it comes every 3 months. It&#x27;s great to do it this way because when a new one arrives I throw out the old one. That way I keep it fresh and maintain cosmetics hygiene!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara goes on easily, does not clump, is a nice strong black, and washes off easily. I do NOT like waterproof mascara and I never order waterproof mascara. I love that this is not waterproof. Oh, and the price is also right!</li>
    <li> I thought it was just me until I decided to read others&#x27; reviews.  I used this while on vacation along with a new eye make-up remover and woke up the next morning with swollen, itchy eyes.  It took a few days for it to go down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t even bother trying a little.  I tried this mascara again about a month and a half after the first incident.  I only put put it on a few bald lashes (I had eyelash extensions on) and only on the top.  By the end of the day my whole eye started irritating and the next morning again, I had swollen eyes.  JUST DON&#x27;T USE!!!</li>
    <li> I had to go to urgent care because the ingredients cause such a horrible reaction! I&#x27;m on day 3 of severe swelling, itching and burning. As soon as I put it on I noticed an irritation. At least now after looking at reviews I see I&#x27;m not the only one! 10% of users had a reaction to this mascara. Wow..</li>
    <li> Great mascara - and it washes off with soap and water.  I don&#x27;t like using makeup remover or oils and this is a good looking mascara that washes off easily and quickly.  Looks great too.</li>
    <li> good product for the money</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It is very basic but does the job. It lasts me for months before I need to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old, and I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Great Lash Mascara since I was about 15.  I have tried other brands...including very expensive brands...but I always ended up going back to this product.  Those pricey products just weren&#x27;t any better, and sometimes they were just awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not alone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, out of curiosity, I just asked 3 of my female coworkers what kind of mascara they use.  2 of them reached into their bags and pulled out those familiar pink and green tubes and waved them in the air with glee.  The 3rd one said she used GL, also, but didn&#x27;t have her tube with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, never mess with the best, Maybelline!</li>
    <li> I was very allergic to this mascara.  My eyes were puffy and swollen for weeks!  I stopped using it for a while, and my eyes were fine.  I tried it again one day, and the same itchiness occurred.  Beware!</li>
    <li> My grandmother used this, my mom uses it, and I will use it forever.  It&#x27;s the best mascara, hands down.</li>
    <li> Always use Maybeline!</li>
    <li> I love the Maybelline Great Lash Mascara and have used it for years.  Blackest Black, Black Noir, whatever black mascara they have works for me.  I no longer wear contacts but have occasional dry eye, so between the mascara and eyeliner, I&#x27;ll have smudging as the day progresses.  I can&#x27;t lay blame on a particular product when I&#x27;m putting in eye drops.  My favorite thing about this mascara is that it&#x27;s washable.  Others may say they&#x27;re washable, but I am not interested in tugging and pulling at my lashes to get remaining mascara off, or washing a second time....that&#x27;s why I use this mascara and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> The best mascara ever, hands down. All because a brother loved his sister! Way to go!</li>
    <li> I got this mascara a couple days ago, and I just started using it today, and it was terrible! It made my upper and lower eyelids itchy, swollen, and red. I never have complaints with makeup, but with this product I would not recommend, and seeing all these similar comments, I don&#x27;t understand why they are still selling it. I will never by maybelline again.</li>
    <li> This is the good &#x27;ole stand by mascara. Great for everyday use that won&#x27;t bust your budget.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, just not the washable formula.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see the other reviews about stinging, because I thought it was just me!  I have very sensitive skin and allergies, and was able to wear this mascara, but often experienced stinging and burning.  It also flaked off under my contact lenses, and smeared easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Maybelline products, but must give Great Lash Mascara two stars.  Try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Million Lashes or Cover Girl&#x27;s Clump Crusher instead.</li>
    <li> She loves this, and uses it regularly. She was always having trouble finding it, and now it just shows up about the time she needs a new one. Its GREAT.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time. It is the best and most affordable. Lasts pretty long. I keep one in the car</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews in magazines and on t.v., naming this as the best mascara on the market.  I have never been allergic to a cosmetic but this product burned my eyes every time I used it and accidentally got a little bit inside the lid.  The brush is small (some may like that, some may not) and it is not the slightest bit clumpy (excellent) but the reaction I had to it outweighed the positives and I returned it and got my money back.</li>
    <li> I heard great things about this so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. It&#x27;s nice, goes on easily and looks as black as I expected. The only downsides is that it does cause clumping so I had to use a different mascara brush for that. But besides that, I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Im sorry but when it comes to mascara i refuse to believe any mascara will lengthen my lashes, thicken them? Yes but im not into spidery lashes. This is by far the blackest mascara I have ever used and it lasts all day without leaving or smudging I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This one isn&#x27;t waterproof as so many are so it works great with contacts. Local stores have discontinued it so they have room for all the new versions (I tried and hated several). This was also has a normal sized brush-the large brushes are much more difficult I think. This one&#x27;s just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to find it here!</li>
    <li> Ordered on Thursday received it Monday! Awesome shipping, and as long as tgis mascara has been out this my first time trying it and I&#x27;m loving the deep color!</li>
    <li> I dunno I love this mascara. I think it&#x27;s long lasting even though I didn&#x27;t get the water proof one. It&#x27;s nice and black and lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Very swollen and painful reactions on my eyelids. I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, so it took me a few months to realize that whenever I used this mascara, I was guaranteed to get a sty or three within a week.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the amount of time and money I&#x27;ve wasted because of this mascara. Like many other reviews (21 out of 201) my eyes got red, swollen and severely itchy for days. Obviously not everyone had allergic reactions but 10% is A LOT! I had no idea this mascara caused it at first. I had to go to an allergist, ENT, and dermotalagist and take steroids and stay away from anything topical/cosmetic for over a week. The only thing that didn&#x27;t make me claw my eyes out was Cetaphil moisturizer. When I finally healed the first time I assumed it was from my facial cleanser or eye makeup remover. So I tossed everything and bought new hypoallergenic products. Yesterday I used this mascara again and by evening my eyes were red and itchy. By morning they were swollen. How the hell they are still selling this product without a disclaimer is beyond me! 22 reviews of people having sever allergic reactions is significant.</li>
    <li> have always loved Maybelline products!</li>
    <li> I have tried many, MANY mascaras over the years and I always wind up back with good ol&#x27; Maybelline Great Lash. It&#x27;s dark, easy to layer, easy to apply - perfect.</li>
    <li> Mascara causes eyelash line and eyelid to become red, itchy, and scaly. It took my eyes about a week to recover. The first time it happened I thought it was allergies. Didn&#x27;t wear any makeup for 2 weeks. The first day back wearing makeup, I only used great lash. My eyes became irritated within 3 hours of applying. NEVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Great!! This mascara lasted a really long time and the black was really dark.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was that when I apply the mascara on my bottom lashes, the mascara runs a little so I have to keep wiping under my eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> A few hours after trying this mascara, my eyelids were swollen and red and my eyes were burning. It got progressively worse before improving.   It was supposed to be hypoallergenic!  It is horrible.  I buy inexpensive mascara all of the time but this one I will stay away from.</li>
    <li> Came quick and works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used this product for years without issue ... until December. Like others, I believe they have changed the formula.  Red, swollen, itchy eyes is what I got for my money.  Thinking it may have been a bad tube, I tossed it and bought a new one.  Same thing happened.  WTH is going on and why did they change the formula?????</li>
    <li> Ladies always ask me what brand I buy and are shocked to hear that I don&#x27;t spend $25 a tube.  I&#x27;ve used this brand for 20 years and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> When I ordered black mascara, I was looking for full coverage on my lashes. Not just a little.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is made like my colored top-coats. Only made to cover a small part of your lashes and not look like your actually wearing mascara. I&#x27;ll stick to my lash blast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Great Lash before, but I guess it was \\&quot;Very Black\\&quot; not \\&quot;Blackest Black.\\&quot; Now I won&#x27;t ever touch a Maybelline product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I used the mascara, my eyes swelled up. I thought it was an allergy to something else (dust? mold? stress?) so I continued to use the product on and off. It took me a week to figure out it was really the mascara. Itchy, swollen eyes -- this product ruined my holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After googling the product, I see that I&#x27;m not the only one with this issue -- which leads me to the question: why is this product still available for sale?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this, I&#x27;ve advised anyone and everyone (doctors, girls at Sephora, friends) to avoid Maybelline at all costs. Using the much pricier but eye-safe Diorshow Blackout mascara now. At least I don&#x27;t have to worry about my face becoming a swollen mess again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, Maybelline.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years and have always preferred it because of the good quality at a low price.  Warning!!!  I just opened a new tube and was very disappointed.  The brush is gigantic.  It does a good job of dispensing the product.  The big problem I see is that this gigantic brush, more than twice as big as the old brush will use up the product much, much faster.  I bought May Kay several years ago and had to use my Mabyline brush to dispense it because they went to an all plastic wand that I hated.  Message here is to save all of your old Mabyline wands and reuse them in the new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as usual, the manufacturer is trying to dupe us into buying more of their product with tricks like this.</li>
    <li> Maybelline Soft Lash Mascara is the worst mascara i have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product about three years ago and i had a horrible reaction to it: severe itching, peeling, scaly skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never had any problems with reactions to mascaras before this.&lt;br /&gt;At the time, i googled this product and many, many others were complaining of the same symtoms.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since, i have had problems with the skin around my eyes. I wish i had sued them or something.&lt;br /&gt;I have since learned they test their products on animals. Can you imagine what the poor animals had to go through when they tested this product on them? Despicable.</li>
    <li> I wish I could show you a photo of what I look like right now.  Quasimodo is a great description.  Ive used this mascara before without any problems in years past.  This time when I bought a brand new tube, my eyes immediately got irritated.  At first I thought it was my eyeshadow which Id had for a while.  I replaced it, and was still getting red, puffy eyes.  I feel like I have cuts along my eyelids and they are so dry and itchy.  Ive used aquafor to keep the moisture in with hydrocordisone cream over that to keep the itch down.  It honestly is the most miserable thing ever and they need to pull this product from the shelf.  Its easy to say that this shouldnt get bad reviews just because IVE had an allergic reaction, but Ive used this product before with no issues.  The company has changed something in the formula to make it this way.....its horrible!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product, literally, for a few decades.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive mascaras throughout the years just to see if I was missing something......and I&#x27;m not.  I find this $4 mascara continually to be the best.  Why spend $25 or more for Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clinique, etc. when this mascara is better and at 1/5 of the price.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I have used Maybelline mascara, as well as several other brands of mascara, in years past with no problems at all, but for some reason, this particular formula has resulted in a severe allergic reaction in the form of dermatitis on both the upper and lower lash lines and the surrounding skin. My eyes are swollen, itchy, and inflamed, and I am extremely displeased to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if the content of this article is still relevant, as it was published in 2009, but it discusses similar cases resulting from Maybelline&#x27;s use of shellac in its mascara at that time. I do not know whether shellac is to blame for the strange reaction that I and approximately 10% of the other customers who have posted reviews have experienced, but it may be worth looking into:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/717746_5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of which chemical component of the formula is responsible for causing such dermatological irritation, it is egregiously irresponsible of Maybelline to continue marketing this product without a warning, considering that a significant number of individuals on this page on Amazon alone have experienced an adverse reaction, a number which far exceeds the four patients named in the case study above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown out the three tubes of Maybelline mascara that I have purchased and do not intend to purchase any more mascara products from Maybelline in the future.</li>
    <li> Just your basic, no frills mascara for ever day wear.  A bit smudgy and messy if you&#x27;re not careful (and maybe a little bit even when you are).  For the price, if you&#x27;re not looking to bring your eyelash &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; game, this one will do the trick.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;ll purchase. I went to Walmart and they were out so for the first time, I purchased my mascara via Amazon and it was a great choice! I got it in less than a week! The price was BETTER than the store! You bet I&#x27;ll be back!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always considered buying this brand because I&#x27;ve seen it advertised in several magazines as a &amp;#34;best beauty pick&amp;#34; so I thought it must be good.  I really don&#x27;t find it that great of a mascara.  I think it&#x27;s more of the wand than the mascara itself.  It&#x27;s a very thin brush and you have to coat your lashes like 20 times to get decent coverage.  I also prefer curved mascara wands because I think they make application easier than straight ones do.  This mascara has a straight wand.  I&#x27;d rate this product as average.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a basic mascara, nothing spectacular. Good for my 12 yr old daughter who has just begun experimenting with makeup.</li>
    <li> Best mascara. I love this product.</li>
    <li> i loved the mascara but the brush is SUPER small, its even smaller than the brush i have for eyebrows. Other than that i loved it, ive used this brand for a long time i have tried others and i keep going back to this one!</li>
    <li> Maybelline  mascara is my favorite mascara and by ordering from Amazon saves me money  because it&#x27;s cheaper than anywhere else that I purchased  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> For a good price, this mascara goes on easy and lasts a long time. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have this on auto ship every two months, since that is when the recommendation is to replace any mascara. I don&#x27;t need to try and remember how old my mascara is, or figure it out when it gets clumpy or bothers my eyes. Soon as the new one arrives I throw out the other.</li>
    <li> Cheap price, cheap product. BUT- it does the job! it works fine, came on time, and I wear it everyday</li>
    <li> Along with many other users, I also had a severe allergic reaction to this product. I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything in my life, but this mascara made my eyes swell up to softball size (not a good look). It took over a week for the swelling to go down and another week after that for the itching to subside. It was horribly miserable. I even did a patch test on my arm beforehand (which I do with all cosmetics)… Not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend shelling out more for hypo allergic or making your own.</li>
    <li> Good product. Not irritating to the eyes, goes on smoothly and does not leave residue on skin.Does leave some black smudges on face at the end  of the day,somewhat difficult to wash off .</li>
    <li> I love this product.it works great for lashes either real or false lashes.The product came pretty fast too.thanks again.I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have used Maybelline&#x27;s great lash mascara for years. It lasts all day, and does not smear. The quality is far better than any of the more expense brands I have tried. I think this is the best mascara you can buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this mascara for years, with contacts or glasses. It washes off easily with regular cleansers. It will run on hot days or if you tear up, or get water on your lashes, so the waterproof counterpart is perfect for rainy days.</li>
    <li> ALL STAR MASCARA-KEEP COMING BACK TO THE CLASSIC!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this mascara after going mostly make-up-less (with the exception of a few days here and there, and a little bit of eye-liner more often than not) for a few months - last summer I had the mascara as well though there was no make-up-less period preceding my use of it then. Last summer, after buying great lash, I developed swelling along my eyelid. It wasn&#x27;t anything awful, but people noticed and it was annoying to deal with. I didn&#x27;t make the connection until I recently re bought great lash, and wore it for perhaps a minute before taking it off (testing it out). A few hours later and my eyelid is pretty severely swollen, and a bit itchy. I wish I knew what the incriminating ingredients are. I wanted to make yet another review warning potential buyers in store or online. I haven&#x27;t had any history of reactions to make up products before... Be very wary if you choose this one...</li>
    <li> Does not itch or burn after sweating/swimming.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried many before coming back to Maybelline.  It goes on easy, the brush is substantial enough to come the lashes, and it comes off easily with warm water--no rubbing or irritating oils needed.</li>
    <li> A classic for a reason! Great brush and a nice black color. This is more of a wet mascara than dry. I feel like it gives a nice natural look, getting every lash, but doesn&#x27;t give a lot of volume or length. It is still a classic makeup staple.</li>
    <li> And there is a reason...  It works! Not if you want star eyelashes, but if you want pretty everyday normal person eyelashes.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time; my wife loves it and was for a good price. I’m completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I did order this and I am happy I received what I wanted today.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer waterproof but, I can use this too.</li>
    <li> Like many others I have used this mascara many times before.  Early December 2014 I purchased a new tube and have had a allergic reaction. Red itchy swollen eyes for over a week.  I bought new makeup (a different kind) and had no problems until yesterday when I mistakenly grabbed the Great Lash in a rush to get ready. I realized it after putting it on and went to work.  By the end of the day my eyes were red, itchy and swollen again.  I do not have allergies of any kind so there must be something different in their product or this batch.</li>
    <li> Brush part of Mascara is too small and doesn&#x27;t really work....</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 30+ years. Good mascara. Lasts a long time and does not get clumpy very fast.</li>
    <li> Got this in time, I opened it up and the packaging was ripped and barely securing the product in place.  It honestly looked like it had been around for YEARS.  After opening, crusty black chunks came out and the wand was completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASTE of money and if it looks too good to be true, it is.  Pay a little more when it comes to makeup products!  Especially when purchasing online.</li>
    <li> I totally love this mascara.. the brush is awesome it really spread out the eye lashes .. i am very satisfied</li>
    <li> This mascara is a great product for everyday. It&#x27;s a classic! The standard brush is great and I don&#x27;t have clumping issues.</li>
    <li> Read this article on medscape I had an allergic reaction made my eyes terribly puffy red and sore. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/717746</li>
    <li> Using this mascara for over 20 years. I try to switch to Dior but alas, can&#x27;t get away from the reigns of the Queen! Great Lash Mascara by Maybelline!!!! Full and thick and clean. Eyelashes the entire day!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for a low price! I&#x27;ve tried expensive name brand mascaras, and I keep coming back to this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of mascaras and it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of brush, claim to fame, or marketing ploy they never work as good as old faithful Great Lash!!! Period.</li>
    <li> Good mascara for the price.</li>
    <li> love it. and cheaper on amazon than in stores</li>
    <li> Spend a little more money, you&#x27;ll be happy you did. This mascara was so clumpy and wet looking. It smeared very easily too.</li>
    <li> This is the mascara I always go back to. I try other brands, other formulas, but this one&lt;br /&gt;works best for me so I&#x27;m stickin&#x27; to it.</li>
    <li> This has been a beauty staple of makeup artists and mascara fans for years and I cannot for the life of me figure out why. I guess if you&#x27;re lookin for a mascara to give your lashes a darker color and nothing more, you&#x27;d be satisfied with this. But most women buy mascara to lengthen and/or thicken their lashes and this just doesn&#x27;t do that. It doesn&#x27;t clump, but it also doesn&#x27;t do anything else for your lashes. I really tried to give it a chance but it ended up in the garbage. Such a waste. Good thing it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> With all the choices out there, it&#x27;s great to have a product that is reliable.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product since I liked Maybelline&#x27;s GREAT LAST. After 8 hours of wearing this mascara my eyes were itchy and red. By evening my eyes were almost swollen shut. It&#x27;s been 12 hours and after applying ice packs and hydro-cortisone my eyes are still itchy. Bad investment!</li>
    <li> this is a good mascara and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite &#x27;go-to&#x27; mascara. Wonder product! Having it delivered every 2 months helps me know when to discard the old tube without racking my brain as to when I bought it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash! I have been using Great Lash for at least 40+ years. I have tried other mascara&#x27;s from Maybelline and other cosmetic companies and I always come back to Great Lash. I was blessed with long lashes but with this mascara my lashes go from long to super long, I am always getting compliments from women and I always tell them to try this product. I&#x27;m also very glad that Maybelline has not discontinued this product as it sometimes happens and I will continue to purchase Great Lash as long as it&#x27;s on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought this by accident. I usually use this brand but its the \\&quot;lots of lashes\\&quot; one I was looking for. That one has a tapered, tear shaped brush that is made of a different material. I like it because no matter how many layers I apply, it does not clump. However, I decided to try this when it came in. I&#x27;ll use this as a lesson learned because this mascara gets all over the place and clumps badly. I&#x27;m not sure if the other one I normally use is a different formula too, but I can see a huge difference between the two. This brush makes me have spider leg lashes if I apply more than one coat. Which, with this brush, you have to apply more or you may as well not wear mascara at all because one coat will not get your smaller lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to make this one work, but after the third day of trying I went to CVS and picked up the stuff I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;now that I think about it, I think the formula must be different because it made my eyes water and itch a little too.</li>
    <li> Top rated mascara forever. Magazines and reviewers still choose this as a top buy. I don&#x27;t use it, but my mother does and she loves it. She&#x27;s tried all expensive brands and always ends up back with Maybelline.</li>
    <li> This smudges and gives me racoon eyes</li>
    <li> Wife looks nice now :)</li>
