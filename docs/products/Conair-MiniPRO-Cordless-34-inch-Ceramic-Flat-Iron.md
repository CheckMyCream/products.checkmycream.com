### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The idea of this straightener is awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best hair straightener out there</li>
      <li>I travel quite a bit from work and thought this would be ideal for touch ups when on the road.</li>
      <li>Love it great for traveling or in a hurry.</li>
      <li>The device is sturdy and has a nice weight.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It IS nice to use a straightener without maneuvering around a cord.</li>
      <li>, my wife let this thing warm up to try it on her hair.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice non-electric straightener.  </li>
      <li>Would be handy for a trip, but I purchased it for camping trips.</li>
      <li>My husband is excited to take it apart and see how it all works. :P</li>
      <li>Customers deserve better.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with its performance despite its limitations.</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s start with the love: I love that it is cordless.</li>
      <li>most of them seem to provide.</li>
      <li>and I love how it heats evenly across the iron.</li>
      <li>elaborate:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been my experience that most curling irons</li>
      <li>We had high hopes it would be a great way to take care of her hair while on the go.</li>
      <li>Works well when you are limited to stuff and works great for touch ups!</li>
      <li>Someone with fine hair would be ok</li>
      <li>Also, make sure you enjoy the smell of butane before you use this, because it will be with you for the rest of your day.</li>
      <li>This product does not provide a good grip on the hair to get it straight.  </li>
      <li>Lights up quickly and is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to set up.</li>
      <li>Easy to put together</li>
      <li>Make sure you press the off button when you are done and cool</li>
      <li>That being said, I do think this is fine when you are roughing it or need just a touch up on the road.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, fantastic when you are on the go.</li>
      <li>I love how light it is and when I travel how it quick it heats</li>
      <li>But reality quickly sunk in when attempting to put the wacky battery into this thing became a huge ordeal.</li>
      <li>This little gem is no replacement for your every day corded straightener, but for camping and travel, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>Super easy.</li>
      <li>This straightener doesn&#x27;t get very hot (and I even have fine hair)</li>
      <li>From reading the description of this flat iron, I really didn&#x27;t have a very good understanding of how it was going to work.</li>
      <li>The ceramic finish doesn&#x27;t cause tangles and helps fine hair like mine just glide right off of it.</li>
      <li>The blade and clip are nice and wide, and the unit is light and easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>but it does heat up quickly.</li>
      <li>You have to make sure the safety cover on the cartridge is secure if traveling on an airline and remember not to get it anywhere near a heat source.</li>
      <li>I got this free for review, and I guess I just didn&#x27;t understand exactly what I was getting.</li>
      <li>While the idea and concept are great, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really do anything.</li>
      <li>But, I don&#x27;t think that it would be worth the effort.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am able to touch the plates with my fingers and barely feel any heat.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s pretty impractical for her.</li>
      <li>This product does not get hot and it does not straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>First, you must retain the butane cartridge&#x27;s cap and you must remove and recap the cartridge after every use.</li>
      <li>price is low, and I do love the idea.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the anxiety, even though it works very well on my hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Camping is exactly the thought that came to mind when I got the Conair YOU Pro Thermacell straightener.</li>
      <li>Own other Conair butane products, do not purchase this one.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter who is in dance class and wanted something to touch up her hair quickly between class&#x27;s it doesen&#x27;t get near hot at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that it reaches the advertised 410 degrees, but it gets hot enough to make an impact on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t count on it as a primary straightener; but, for travelling, it actually works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And IF I could carefully pull it along without catching, it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to smooth my (already straight) hair, much less straighten or curl my very fine hair.</li>
      <li>And, it never got hot enough, light was on and all, to really straighten my hair well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Generally speaking, I find Conair products to be well made and very well priced.</li>
      <li>They only allow one cartridge per passenger on airlines for overseas travel, so this is important.</li>
      <li>It makes a hissing sound and smells like lighter fluid.</li>
      <li>She also has very frizzy hair-</li>
      <li>Leaves hair straight and looking like</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Disapointed I have very corse hair</li>
      <li>I mean, if you must have straight hair when the power&#x27;s out or when you&#x27;re out camping, yes, this is a good idea.</li>
      <li>It heats quickly, and gets hot enough to do the job.  </li>
      <li>Does not heat up to any significant degree and was unaware that it cannot be returned.</li>
      <li>The straightener, however, doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to compare with the conventional plug-in kind.</li>
      <li>you have super thin, super fine hair</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and to a high enough temperature to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I was not at all comfortable with powering this straighter on like one would a lighter, especially given the butane cartridge is three times as big.</li>
      <li>I got it for my daughter, because, when I was in high school, I&#x27;d had a curling iron like this.</li>
      <li>so I have to remember to keep it up high because the cartridges are poisonous and highly flammable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whatever the reason, whoever was high when Conair&#x27;s design team was coming out with new product ideas, this thing works.</li>
      <li>What a great idea for a product, but this one is very poorly executed by a supposedly respected hair product company like Conair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one for one star reviews, figuring nothing can be that bad, but in my opinion, there was nothing I liked about the product, on top of the fact it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>It seems like such a great idea, especially for international travel, one less outlet issue to worry about.</li>
      <li>the seam where the ironing piece is attached to the shaft of the flat iron has a huge gap which catches several hairs with every pass, either causing me to let go and start over or rip out/break off the caught hair.</li>
      <li>As others have noted, it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere close to being hot enough to straighten her hair.</li>
      <li>this product cannot get hot enough to go through it.</li>
      <li>degrees sounds hot enough, but what do I know...</li>
      <li>The clamp is a little too loose, but heats up nicely.</li>
      <li>maybe if the iron portion was a little smaller, she felt, it might have worked out better for her.  </li>
      <li>Would really still like a refund for it if at all possible.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light-weight, and actually works.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t  have a strong grip and it took a long time to heat up...and when it was on for 15 minutes it was not very hot.</li>
      <li>I tried multiple times and 260 degrees was as high as I could measure, plus the temperature drops fast once you open it up.  </li>
      <li>the product actually arrived there were some very specific instructions about how, exactly, the cartridge would have to be lit and heated to prepare the flatiron for use.</li>
      <li>But, unfortunately this did not get nearly as hot as advertised, it was warm... but never hot enough to even de-frizz the ends of my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The box indicated that the unit would reach 400+ degrees F, and it did get hot, but the temperature probe we use for cooking only showed between 200 and 250 give or take a few degrees.  </li>

<li> At least it isn&#x27;t unbearably hot.</li>

<li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use a flat iron, but this just doesn&#x27;t seem to do what I need.</li>
<li> The flat iron will ignite, but will not stay ignited.  </li>
<li> It has only a limited one year warranty.</li>
<li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to work with her very thick, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> There are specifics about how long it should stay heated and why you can&#x27;t leave it heated for too long.</li>
<li> My wife tried it on her hair and it did straiten it, but it took a long time for one section.  </li>
<li> Then when I wanted to return it says because of the butane I can&#x27;t even return it, so it was a waste completely of my money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a little disappointed with the flat iron.  It doesn&#x27;t  have a strong grip and it took a long time to heat up...and when it was on for 15 minutes it was not very hot.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t pull it through your hair without it snagging and pulling your hair out.</li>
    <li> There are things I love about this product, and things I hate. Let&#x27;s start with the love: I love that it is cordless. Take it camping and you don&#x27;t have to wait in line at the crowded shower house for the only plug on the wall most of them seem to provide. The ceramic finish doesn&#x27;t cause tangles and helps fine hair like mine just glide right off of it. One cartridge lasts for months so you can use it a long time. They only allow one cartridge per passenger on airlines for overseas travel, so this is important. It is much less hassle than electric since you need an adapter overseas for plugs. I know someone who forgot and fried their curling iron in NZ when they plugged it in without an adapter. OK, now the things I hate: I have dogs and grandchildren so I have to remember to keep it up high because the cartridges are poisonous and highly flammable. I have to remember to order extra cartridges, and I hate having to order anything. It has only a limited one year warranty. It&#x27;s been my experience that most curling irons I&#x27;ve had only last about a year. If this one lasts longer than a year I&#x27;ll delete this part from the hate list. You have to make sure the safety cover on the cartridge is secure if traveling on an airline and remember not to get it anywhere near a heat source. Fire scares the heck out of me so I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the anxiety, even though it works very well on my hair and I love how it heats evenly across the iron. So, there are the pros and cons of my experience. Judge for yourself.</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit from work and thought this would be ideal for touch ups when on the road. It is easy to set up. Remove and retain the cap from the butane cartridge.  Simply insert the butane cylinder into the straightener&#x27;s handle. Pressing the on button couple of times ignites the butane cartridge. It makes a hissing sound and smells like lighter fluid. but it does heat up quickly. I don&#x27;t know that it reaches the advertised 410 degrees, but it gets hot enough to make an impact on my fine hair. Make sure you press the off button when you are done and cool the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There are however, some aspects that make it less than convenient. First, you must retain the butane cartridge&#x27;s cap and you must remove and recap the cartridge after every use. It does not come with a carrying case which contributes to the likelihood that something will get lost or misplaced. . There is no light to indicate that it is ready (heated sufficiently to use; you can see a gold light when it is ignited) which is unfortunate. That being said, I do think this is fine when you are roughing it or need just a touch up on the road. I was pleased with its performance despite its limitations. There is a one year warranty.</li>
    <li> This little gem is no replacement for your every day corded straightener, but for camping and travel, it&#x27;s perfect.  It heats quickly, and gets hot enough to do the job.  It&#x27;s very light-weight, and actually works.  Easy to put together, you pop in the canister, put on the end cap, push one button to turn on, then press another button to ignite the heating element. Pop the canister back out and put the cap on to store.  Super easy.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair straight and looking like I had a pro doing it. Will save a lot of money and time having this in my home!!!!</li>
    <li> Does not heat up to any significant degree and was unaware that it cannot be returned. Own other Conair butane products, do not purchase this one.</li>
    <li> This cordless hair straighter works as advertized.  Basically it is a propane heated hair curler.  The device is sturdy and has a nice weight.  It heats up quickly and to a high enough temperature to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat like a gas grill, to get it going you &amp;#34;turn on the gas&amp;#34; and then click the starter &amp;#34;several times.&amp;#34;  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that I was always afraid it wasn&#x27;t lit.  The instructions say the curling iron has a window you can look through to see the flame, but not so the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought when I got it that I could use fuel that I buy for our lighters and small soldering torches, but the fuel is in a proprietary container and you are not supposed to do this.</li>
    <li> Love it great for traveling or in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is in dance class and wanted something to touch up her hair quickly between class&#x27;s it doesen&#x27;t get near hot at all. We were very disappointed. Then when I wanted to return it says because of the butane I can&#x27;t even return it, so it was a waste completely of my money. Would really still like a refund for it if at all possible. Can email me at sherylm_61@hotmail.com</li>
    <li> This product does not get hot and it does not straighten my hair. The worst thing that its not eligible for return. Don&#x27;t buy its just not worth it.</li>
    <li> Awful. Did absolutely nothing for my hair.  Not hot enough to straighten. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> This product does not provide a good grip on the hair to get it straight.  As such, it&#x27;s pretty useless for me.  I have the Conair cordless curling iron and will just continue to use that instead.</li>
    <li> The clamp is a little too loose, but heats up nicely.</li>
    <li> Disapointed I have very corse hair this product cannot get hot enough to go through it. Someone with fine hair would be ok</li>
    <li> Hair ties are my friend when I go camping. No matter if it&#x27;s humid or not, my hair frizzes to a Ronald McDonald mass, and there&#x27;s no taming it. I just tie it back or up and pray nobody&#x27;s taking pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camping is exactly the thought that came to mind when I got the Conair YOU Pro Thermacell straightener. I can&#x27;t imagine in what circumstances I&#x27;d be needing a butane-powered hair straightener. Outdoor overnights? Power outages? (In which case I&#x27;d hope the thing also provided a light!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, whoever was high when Conair&#x27;s design team was coming out with new product ideas, this thing works. It&#x27;s like a big outdoor torch for when you&#x27;re lighting candles or charcoal on the grill - except that heat instead of flame is the result (well, I hope it&#x27;s the result...I can&#x27;t imagine that having  your hair on fire is the goal here!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS nice to use a straightener without maneuvering around a cord. The straightener claims to go over 400 degrees, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. At least it isn&#x27;t unbearably hot. It worked...OK. I mean, if you must have straight hair when the power&#x27;s out or when you&#x27;re out camping, yes, this is a good idea. I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, I find Conair products to be well made and very well priced. I&#x27;ve rarely been disappointed with them. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed with this straightener - more puzzled and amused! So yes, if you need your hair straightened in any environment where you won&#x27;t have access to electricity, this is your hair appliance! (I&#x27;m personally waiting for their next implement, the butane-operated blow dryer!)</li>
    <li> I got this free for review, and I guess I just didn&#x27;t understand exactly what I was getting. I&#x27;m not one for one star reviews, figuring nothing can be that bad, but in my opinion, there was nothing I liked about the product, on top of the fact it didn&#x27;t work.  First, I was not at all comfortable with powering this straighter on like one would a lighter, especially given the butane cartridge is three times as big. You literally click it several times while you can hear the gas hissing out. I have a small bathroom, but the whole place instantly smelled like butane. And, it never got hot enough, light was on and all, to really straighten my hair well. On top of that, the base and handle don&#x27;t clamp the hair well enough to do anything even if it did heat like a plug in straightener. I will be trashing this.</li>
    <li> The YOU wasn&#x27;t too bad, though it was a little freaky to load a butane cartridge into the shaft.  The box indicated that the unit would reach 400+ degrees F, and it did get hot, but the temperature probe we use for cooking only showed between 200 and 250 give or take a few degrees.  The blade and clip are nice and wide, and the unit is light and easy to hold.  I got this from the Vine since we do a lot of RVing and sometimes you don&#x27;t want to run the generator for less essential things.  My wife didn&#x27;t like the feel of the iron, and she didn&#x27;t like the way it heated...and that&#x27;s why we measured the temperature.  To me, 200+ degrees sounds hot enough, but what do I know...I don&#x27;t use a curling or straightening iron.  She gave it a 3 based on the heat and feel of the wand in her hand...maybe if the iron portion was a little smaller, she felt, it might have worked out better for her.  Overall, we consider the product average.</li>
    <li> While the idea and concept are great, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really do anything.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use a flat iron, but this just doesn&#x27;t seem to do what I need.</li>
    <li> From reading the description of this flat iron, I really didn&#x27;t have a very good understanding of how it was going to work. I read this &amp;#34;With no plugs or batteries needed, you can use this styler anywhere. The replaceable Thermacell butane gas cartridge lasts for months of use. &amp;#34; And so I realized it ran off a butane cartridge. But, I wasn&#x27;t prepared for how that would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product actually arrived there were some very specific instructions about how, exactly, the cartridge would have to be lit and heated to prepare the flatiron for use. There are specifics about how long it should stay heated and why you can&#x27;t leave it heated for too long. There were safety warnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this flatiron for my daughter because I thought it would be convenient to use with the &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; feature. But, honestly, she&#x27;s rather afraid of it because of the setup. So it&#x27;s pretty impractical for her. She also has very frizzy hair- which is why she wanted a straightener. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to work with her very thick, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> The flat iron will ignite, but will not stay ignited.  In other words, after clicking it on, it turns itself back off nearly immediately.  It will not heat up and is useless.</li>
    <li> This straighter is inexpensive - and works about as well as you would expect for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t count on it as a primary straightener; but, for travelling, it actually works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a backup straightener, then this isn&#x27;t a bad option.</li>
    <li> The idea of this straightener is awesome. I got it for my daughter, because, when I was in high school, I&#x27;d had a curling iron like this. The straightener, however, doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to compare with the conventional plug-in kind.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money! I purchased this product for an upcoming camping trip and I will not be packing it along with me. I am able to touch the plates with my fingers and barely feel any heat. I purchased the following curling brush/curling iron combo several years ago and was not satisfied with the performance either. However, it did heat up somewhat hotter:http://www.amazon.com/ThermaCell-Conair-Compact-Curling-Iron/dp/B004TA7B04/ref&#x3D;pd_rhf_cr_s_cp_5_N4QJ?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;07WA0QNFZB3BTS2F6TNF Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product, you will disappointed!</li>
    <li> For camping only. This straightener doesn&#x27;t get very hot (and I even have fine hair) so basically I use it to straighten the hair that frames my face, while camping only... Not for home use but is portable and cordless. Runs on butane.</li>
    <li> I used a Infrared thermometer to measure the temperature and the maximum I got it too was 260 degrees, which is not close to the 410 degrees advertised.  I tried multiple times and 260 degrees was as high as I could measure, plus the temperature drops fast once you open it up.  My wife tried it on her hair and it did straiten it, but it took a long time for one section.  I think for traveling it could work, but don&#x27;t expect something comparable to an electric straightener.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is terrible. It seems like such a great idea, especially for international travel, one less outlet issue to worry about. But, unfortunately this did not get nearly as hot as advertised, it was warm... but never hot enough to even de-frizz the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you have super thin, super fine hair then this could be an option, maybe. But, I don&#x27;t think that it would be worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;The price is low, and I do love the idea. But, it did not work at all.</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, this thing is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To elaborate: the seam where the ironing piece is attached to the shaft of the flat iron has a huge gap which catches several hairs with every pass, either causing me to let go and start over or rip out/break off the caught hair. (Ouch.) And IF I could carefully pull it along without catching, it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to smooth my (already straight) hair, much less straighten or curl my very fine hair. (So, useless.) Also, make sure you enjoy the smell of butane before you use this, because it will be with you for the rest of your day. (Ick.)&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time imagining a situation where one might actually need to straighten one&#x27;s hair without a plug, and, maybe, if you are that desperate, you might not mind all the product flaws. As bad as this experience was, I&#x27;d go for the ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only benefit? My husband is excited to take it apart and see how it all works. :P</li>
    <li> This is a really nice non-electric straightener.  Lights up quickly and is very easy to use.  Would be handy for a trip, but I purchased it for camping trips.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, fantastic when you are on the go. I love how light it is and when I travel how it quick it heats up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier to use than my regular one! Too bad the batteries don&#x27;t last longer!</li>
    <li> Used this on our resent camping adventure. We have a pop up but were limited to power so I figured I would try this. Let me tell you all of us ladies (6 of us) used it and all have varying hair type/length. It&#x27;s not the best hair straightener out there but come on I was camping 20 something miles from a paved road!! All the girls bought one so they didn&#x27;t have to keep using mine. Works well when you are limited to stuff and works great for touch ups!</li>
    <li> When I got this Conair YOU Pro Cordless ThermaCell hair straightener in the mail and gave it to my wife, she looked at me with excitement about a product we could use on cruises and while traveling. We had high hopes it would be a great way to take care of her hair while on the go. But reality quickly sunk in when attempting to put the wacky battery into this thing became a huge ordeal. It&#x27;s not exactly user-friendly. Once we finally figured it out (the instructions were not very clear at all), my wife let this thing warm up to try it on her hair. Completely and totally useless! As others have noted, it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere close to being hot enough to straighten her hair. What a great idea for a product, but this one is very poorly executed by a supposedly respected hair product company like Conair. SHAME ON YOU! Customers deserve better.</li>
