<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the brush. Love body brushing!</li>
    <li> When I received the brush, there was no handle! It said right in the description (since changed) &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34;. I was very disappointed that I had to return it!</li>
    <li> Bristles are very stiff and uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. I can definitely tell that using this every day has helped my skin. The bristles are stiff, but don&#x27;t hurt - the brush really feels nice on my skin. The one I ordered came with a detachable handle. I ended up using the brush without the handle, and the cut away area on the top where the handle fits in has some pretty sharp corners. My ONLY complaint is that it&#x27;s somewhat easy to nick your hands on those corners (I have done so a handful of times). This is a great product - I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a good body brush and I&#x27;m enjoying having it.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to do my dry skin brushes. Not only does it buff away dead skin, but it&#x27;s fantastic at boosting circulation and lymphatic drainage, and ultimately ridding the body of toxins.</li>
    <li> As a heads up this has super stiff scratchy bristles; not soft at all. Might work for some people and not for others.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I love it. Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> I bought this brush from another retailer for dry skin brushing, I a saw pretty decent difference after the first use. Just make sure to rinse the bristles when you first buy it, it is made with natural wood. The bristles can scratch if your skin isn&#x27;t used to it or very sensitive, but it does what it is suppose to do. Ill see how the bristles hold up over time, usually when you use a brush that gets wet you want to place it face down to dry so the water doesnt swell the wood and make the bristles fallout...But overall it seems to be a great product.    *** Update March 26 2011***    Ok so after 2-3 dayS of use I did let the brush get wet and it damn near cracked into two pieces after it dried. This brush doesnt have a protective coat to keep the water from soaking into the wood. SO THIS IS REALLY FOR DRY BRUSHING ONLY!!</li>
    <li> Just got into dry brushing and this is the perfect brush for it</li>
    <li> Very invigorating!  Absolutely wonderful. Leaves my skin feeling so soft. Amazing how much dead skin came off my body. Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Broke during the first use.</li>
    <li> nice brush, feels good when using it.  Really need to include directions with it instead of making purchaser have to go online to see how to use it.  there is a technique to it.</li>
    <li> My wife said that this brush is exactly the same that is used in her physical therapy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush I would buy it again. Its very good at removing the top layer of dead skin, and stimulating the lymphatic circulation. Its a great addition to one&#x27;s overall health.</li>
    <li> the only problem is that the brush part will come off the stick/handle sometimes when hanging in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love it!  My skin glows.  I use it once or twice a week before I shower, and I am just amazed at the difference it makes to my skin and my body.  Highly recommend.  You do use it dry.  Do not get it wet.</li>
    <li> The handle is removable so you can switched the way you use it. In the first use it will release some of its bristal but after the second use your fine and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Kept it in the shower and it started to look like it was mold growing on the wood where the bristles at , but it worked good just do not leave it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love it. The handle comes off. Does the job. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and feels good on the skin. The bristles are reasonably firm, but with light pressure this brush is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like the brush but if you keep it in the shower, paint comes off on your bath wall.  I would keep it away from water when not using it.</li>
    <li> Really scratchy and handle slips out but decent</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price and this is my first time using this brush and I like the way it felt. Good investment.</li>
    <li> After I got turned on Kris Carr, I learned all about dry brushing and began researching it on my own.  I did a lot of research and this was the best dry brush I found by far.  It is very sturdy and holds up when when you wash it every now and again.  Does a great job scrubbing your extremities...even the hard to reach spots.  Would not recommend using this on your face; I tried that and the bristles and brush are too big and too harsh.  Use this brush for everything but your face...get a smaller brush for your face to protect that delicate part of your body.  I like to dry brush every morning before I jump in the shower...but don&#x27;t forget to moisturize when you get out and dry off...because your skin can become somewhat raw if you don&#x27;t give it a little moisture after brushing off your top layer of dead skin cells.  I love to moisturize with Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s Jojoba Oil...does miracles on my skin and especially dry spots like my elbows!</li>
    <li> bristles continue to fall out each time I use brush...hopefully that will stop soon. Nice length handle for ease of use.</li>
    <li> Fast delevery, excellent product!</li>
    <li> seems to be a good quality.</li>
    <li> This product works just as said. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try skin brushing. The long handle is a must have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tremendous advocate for dry-brushing, as it has highly improved the quality of my life.  I tend to dry-brush twice daily, upon rising before I shower, and again before bed.  My skin loves me for it, and I believe it does impact your circulation system, and definitely improves the quality of cellulite.  Plus it makes you feel alive - and one can&#x27;t go wrong when developing a loving self-care routine, of which this can be a wonderful addition.  I find that dry-brushing before a shower, and following up with coconut oil afterward has created the softest, most vibrant skin of my life.  I tried several brushes before this one, and it is the best so far.  Definitely go with natural bristles if you are looking to dry brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry brushing, but it is a lot rougher than a loofah, so take it easy at first.  If you have super sensitive skin or are diabetic, I&#x27;d probably stick with a loofah for dry brushing.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for my morning dry brushing ritual. This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased. The first one lasted almost a year and I was so pleased with the quality that I wanted another one. I also got one for my mother too. I especially like the way the wooden handle attaches and detaches for convenience of use.</li>
    <li> Best brush like this I&#x27;ve even seen or used!! Makes the brushes at bed bath and beyond feel crazy cheap!!! This is a phenomenal brush!!! It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s just well made, the bristles are so densely packed into it as well</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy brush, easy to use.  Can be used for wet or dry scrubbing. Good price for a skin brush w/natural bristles.</li>
    <li> My partner and I love this. The detachable handle is a great feature. The bristles are firm but comfortable, and we&#x27;ve experienced no bristle loss at all.</li>
    <li> I had been dry skin brushing with a cheap target one and I knew I needed to upgrade. I actually bought two off of amazon and love them both. This one is amazing! I was hesitant because some of the reviews said it was too hard. However, I love it for that reason! I feel as though it&#x27;s actually working and the whole brushing experience is better! The other one I bought is a little softer so sometimes I use it for my upper body instead of this one. But this is my go to one! I&#x27;m loving it! And it&#x27;s less scratchy after you use it a few times. If you have sensitive skin you may want to try a different one or work up to this, but I love this one!!</li>
    <li> After researching several products, I decided on the Jensen brush.  I like that it can be used with or without the handle.  The handle slides in place easily and stays put while brushing. The bristles aren&#x27;t too hard or too soft.</li>
    <li> After purchase for a family member who does not shop online, the price dropped the day after, significantly. Same brush was to be had at the local overpriced health food store for half the price of Amazon. lame.</li>
    <li> I have given up soap and water and brush instead.  I find I feel cleaner after a good brushing.  I got this brush because it looked like it was all one piece.  I have other brushes and the handle always is falling off.  Well this one is not all one piece the brush can be hand held and the handle can be detached but when I want the handle to stay on it does.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brush during some tough detoxing and found it helped keep my lymph nodes open and draining  I still use baths to soak like with epsom salts after a good brushing.</li>
    <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t imagine this product being used on humans.  The bristles are strong enough to rip the skin right off your hide. I went to Walgreens and bought a soft-bristled brush for about $10 - then summarily threw the Bernard model directly in the trash.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is very firm, smells great, exfoliates effectively,  and seems sturdy enough to hold up over time. Great price, great buy!</li>
    <li> Nice longer bristle so the brush, which seems a little stiff at first, feels pretty good on the skin. And the long, removable handle is nice too.</li>
    <li> Use it every day and it does the job well and I recommend it if you are looking for a nice body brush for dry skin brushing.</li>
    <li> Hard as a rock good for brushing a horse ......... choose another  or get new skin very very very stiff</li>
    <li> The quality of the brush is great but as a body brush the bristles are to hard and rough for me.</li>
    <li> Did not come with handle.</li>
    <li> Bought for my father and he said that it will &amp;#34;take your hide off&amp;#34; he was not very impressed so he is not using it at all</li>
    <li> advertised as one piece with long handle but has no handle at all</li>
    <li> I do not like this shower brush at all.  The bristles are very rough.  It is only good for the elbows and knees.  It was advertised as something completely different than what it actually is.  In addition, the handle will not stay attached to the brush.</li>
    <li> Really no handle? I read other reviews saying the same thing but I thought, that can&#x27;t happen to me! Wow was I wrong!</li>
    <li> I use this item to dry brush prior to showering. It is an excellent product, hardly any shedding of bristles, the handle is smooth and comfortable to hold, and the perfect length for easy use.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m a weakling, but it just hurt a little too much. I like to scrub hard with loofas, so I was in for a rough surprise with this little dude. The handle is not worth beans, however.</li>
    <li> Very poor product. The brush has few bristles and the handle falls off every time I try to use it. Won&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> Had to return this.  Not soft enough</li>
    <li> Its a brush, it is bristly.  Not Much to say here.  Seems like a good product and will do a good job scrubbing for you.  It is pretty stiff when you get it so just be aware.  Have fun brushing!</li>
    <li> Really good. Must try.</li>
    <li> Great for dry brushing!</li>
    <li> I use this for a dry brush and I love the size and quality it was a little stiff at first but you just use it lightly and as time goes on and your skin gets used to it and it wears in you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this brush for anyone to use as a dry brush. The handle is a good length to reach down to legs or your back.</li>
    <li> I bought this to &amp;#34;dry brush&amp;#34; my skin before showers.  I removed the handle as it works easier for me to not have it.  Clearly the handle is necessary to brush your back.  It is not a hard brush, but it will take some getting used to if you&#x27;ve never dry brushed your skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality, very stiff.  This brush will last a long,long time.  would recommend it highly, highly, highly, and highly and highly.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very very stiff on this brush and makes using it uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Great for dry brushing.  The Tampico fiber bristles are a bit harsh until you get used to it.  I&#x27;d give it a higher rating but the brush head falls off and some bristles fell out a bit after a couple of uses.  Hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> This brush is NOT &amp;#34;one piece&amp;#34;.  It is TWO pieces - a brush head glued onto a handle.  The head fell off after only two uses.&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, if it WERE actually a one piece brush, it would be pretty nice, the bristles are of good quality and the brush head is nice and big.  But unless you want to be stuck with a wooden stick and a cury brush rather sooner than later, I would strongly recommend you shop on...&lt;br /&gt;I returned both of the brushes I bought, one in two pieces and the other one already wobbly in the shower in less than 1 week.  I&#x27;ve been around this mulberry bush before - NEVER buy a bath brush that consists of a brush glued onto a handle.  This is a case of false advertising.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for dry body brushing. It&#x27;s not as soft as I thought it would be, so know that ahead of time. I think that comes with natural bristles but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. I didn&#x27;t think the handle separated from the brush, but it does! However, I found that it&#x27;s just easier to use with the handle on.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Even though I have sensitive skin, I thoroughly enjoy dry brushing my skin with this product. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was not sent a brush.  When I opened the box there was a handle only.  I can say it was very stress free to return and my money was in my account remarkably fast.</li>
    <li> Dry skin brushing is the only thing that gets my circulation moving and makes my skin soft. I stopped doing this for a couple of years and this winter I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. I immediately started brushing daily again and within a week or two my skin was lovely again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush. I takes some time to get used to because of it being very stiff, but it is one of my favorite ones now.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love the option of detaching the handle.</li>
    <li> I am giving it 3 stars. This is due to the brush coming apart frequently. Other than that the bristles and handle length work great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to remove cellulite, aka for dry brushing. It has work fabulously and I will continue to use the brush 2-3 times weekly.</li>
    <li> Nice but it&#x27;s starting to warp and fall apart after only a month... I don&#x27;t think that it will last.</li>
    <li> Love the end results of using this brush...my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> used glue to secure this item because it did not stay secure - also did not come with rope so i had to tie one to it in order to hang in shower</li>
    <li> Even though the bristles are natural they are still too harsh for my skin. I love Bernard Jensen products so this was a disappointment to me..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush.... it does it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just begun to utilize this detoxifying regimine twice/day.  One must look up how to utilize this brush properly, because it isn&#x27;t just for brushing cellulite away.  There is so much more to this than just exfoliating and cellulite reduction.  It&#x27;s ultimate purpose is to stimulate the lymphatic system, which improves your overall health, plus reduces cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for the health conscious looking to up their game!</li>
    <li> Good quality &amp; great feel.</li>
    <li> Perfect bristles for dry brushing &amp; I love the dettachable handle option.</li>
    <li> Brush is very hard for the skin.</li>
    <li> Bristles are way too harsh-something like it would be good to scrub floors with.</li>
    <li> Today I received the brush and used it for dry skin brushing before I showered. I will now do this every time before showering! After cleaned my hair and face, while still in the shower I used coconut oil all over my body and then lightly rinsed it off. The shower water temperature was cold throughout (on purpose).</li>
    <li> just didn&#x27;t like it. It hurt the softer parts of my body.</li>
    <li> Developed mold within months of use.  Handle would not stay on.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought to use as part of my dinacharya. Great for dry-brushing to increase circulation and exfoliate dead skin cells. The handle is great because you can keep it on for the hard to reach back area or take it off for smaller surfaces like arms. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Good sturdy brush to stroke on the skin</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about it firming cellulite and I&#x27;m still not sure I really notice a difference BUT it has significantly reduced my keratosis pilaris (aka chicken skin on the back of my arms). I&#x27;ve been saddled with the condition after my 3rd pregnancy and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away despite the lotions and potions and recommendation to use a clarisonic brush by my dermatologist to exfoliate. That puny brush wasn&#x27;t exfoliating deeply enough to make a difference. But this brush has made a BIG difference in the redness and reduction of unsightly little white bumps.</li>
    <li> I received the bristle brush without the handle as described. The only reason I picked this was because I wanted LONG handle...disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is intended for dry brushing. The handle slides into a groove on the back of the brush head and remains secure while using the brush. The bristles felt stiff and prickly the first time I used it, but my skin felt invigorated afterward. I became accustomed to the feeling after a few uses.  And of course YOU determine how lightly or firmly to brush. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the bristles are really stiff and hurt my skin when I use the brush.</li>
    <li> Not necessarily bad but not exactly what I expected.  I think it was my expectation that a natural bristle would  not be this rough.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! A quality dry brush that is affordable!</li>
    <li> Bristles are much too stiff for body use and will flay the skin off of you if used with any pressure</li>
    <li> Great brush with removable handle.</li>
    <li> When the brush arrived, I was concerned the bristles could be too harsh.  Well, they&#x27;re not.  After just a couple of uses, it seems to be just right. Wonderful way to begin each day with a dry body brushing. The long handle is very convenient, and it&#x27;s natural wood gives it a nice, clean look.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I jump in the shower, and while dry, I scrub my whole body in a circular motion. I read you should push toward your heart. When I am working on my back and legs, I find this tough, but I keep going around and around. My chest is tender, so I don&#x27;t use it there. I soap up my bits and pits once the shower starts. I simply rinse the rest of my body off. My skin looks and feels AMAZING. Without stripping the oils, but by removing the dead skin, my skin glows. My dry feet and hands are moist and smooth. And a wonderful side effect is the cellulite is diminishing as it gets great blood flow through stimulation. I am giving the brush as a gift to all my friends and family this year.  Dry brushing is one of those things you hear about but it sounds so painful and unlikely, I just didn&#x27;t believe it would work. What a miracle!</li>
    <li> Not sure what to say. I use this for dry brushing so it&#x27;s holding up fine. It&#x27;s a pretty corse bristle but my skin can handle it.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too hard.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...for removing all of your skin and cleaning down to the bone.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have dry brushed the skin on my legs before showering for the last few months and my legs are visibly smoother. I wish I had taken before and after photos. I try to love my body no matter how it looks but smooth skin and eliminating cellulite are nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Never recieved the handle. Not to happy about that.</li>
    <li> Great dry brushing brush. Easy to pack with removable head. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too harsh and the two parts a coming apart every time I use it. But the reach is good as well as the grip.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these.  They were both junk.  They are not one piece as the description states.  They come in two pieces and they do not fit together at all.  The head kept falling off of the handle.  Even if I could have gotten the head to stay on, the brush wouldn&#x27;t have lasted because the handle is so flimsy.  One of the brushes had several bristles coming out and they were all over the bag.  I sent them both back and purchased a quality body brush from Whole Foods for the same price.</li>
    <li> great quality.  would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping.  Item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The brush has fallen off the handle as others have mentioned. As for the bristles: they are what I expected and perform as expected. Varying the pressure is the best option for getting the desired results.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. Its very good product. I used it only once on my legs when i first received it and it bothered my skin slightly b/c it wasn&#x27;t used to the fibers. Once I did it a few times it got used to it and i could feel and see the difference in my skin tone and texture it was soft and seemed like it had a health glow to it(that was only on my first use!). Taking a shower afterwards really helped to my skin was super soft and radiant. Use it 10 mins before a shower and another time in the day. They say brush in long stokes toward the heart. Nice simple design.</li>
    <li> Brush is great.  What it does for your body is even better.  Skin is smooth like it never has been before.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin brushing!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few days ago and it just got delivered to me today. This product gets delivered in two pieces, the actual brush and then the handle. Just as I went to put the handle onto the brush (using a very gentle force), the brush itself split right down the middle. So far it has not broken completely into two parts. I am either going to get some wood glue to repair it or completely return it.</li>
    <li> Great dry brushing tool to detoxify the skin.  On a few occasions, the head has popped off the handle while in use, but this hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem.  Overall, I am pleased with the quality, and the length is perfect for using on the back without assistance.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but I think my legs are getting thinner using a dry brush!</li>
    <li> I just started to do the dry body brushing. This brush is quite hard but I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I get used to it. I like how the long handle can be removed easily.</li>
    <li> I use this for dry brushing and I absolutely love it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this brush is amazing and relaxing. I used it on my husband and he loved it!</li>
    <li> A friend shared with me how great her skin has been since she&#x27;s started dry brushing bore showering or bathing.  After a little research I found out how dry brushing helps the blood circulation and can reduce cellulite somewhat.  I do recommend that everyone research for themselves.  The brush is great and what&#x27;s good about this particular brush is that it has a removable handle.  It&#x27;s a little rough to the skin in the beginning, but after a few days its soothing and refreshing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and now several of my friends and relatives use it.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together-two pieces. Ive used the brush, as directed, starting from feet up, and it feels great. Gets the circulation going!</li>
    <li> Everyone has a hard time washing their backs without a partner. This gives anyone the ability to reach their backs.</li>
    <li> Scrubs really well and good for just about the whole body. The bristles are nice and firm. Reminds me of the one my grandparents had. My husband loves it. It&#x27;s exactly what he wanted. Only suggestion is DO NOT HANG IT. The bristle head has a tendency to slide off the handle when hung and depending on the fall and how many times it falls it will crack. The bristle head fell twice and cracked, however it is still usable so now it lives in the shower caddy. I have no problems recommending this product.</li>
    <li> This seems to be everything it should be! Quality construction and the long handle makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> It is a little gem of mine, I have to admit! I think it&#x27;s terrific and it leaves me feeling great. I have very soft, sensitive skin and it did make it red and irritated at first but it&#x27;s absolutely not unbearable by any stretch of the imagination. Everyone&#x27;s a little different but I feel reviewers saying it&#x27;s too rough either were expecting NONE of that or are a tad dramatic maybe. Dry brushes are brushing away your dead skin and you will feel it. It always makes my skin very hot where I brush it but I love how my skin feels afterwords--and it makes me positively GLOW! I felt gross realizing how much dead skin I had on me after the first use and seeing how much got kicked up in the beginning. It&#x27;s much less dramatic after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I docked a star was because I&#x27;m not a fan of the handle. I feel like it&#x27;s going to give me a sliver and it falls off the brush head a lot on me. The handle slides into place on the brush back and that is nice so you can use the brush head by itself if you want, but it&#x27;s not very secure. I work til late at night and the bathroom, where I brush after work, is right near other bedrooms and I wake everyone up with the loud clatter crash of the head falling off. I use it mostly holding the head now for fear it&#x27;ll fall and that&#x27;s not very convenient. I did push the handle into place hard, but, that&#x27;s still an issue for me.</li>
    <li> Let me correct my last review. The brush is hard on my skin I stopped using it in the shower and more before I shower. It&#x27;s cracking from only three uses underwater. THIS IS NOT A SHOWER BRUSH ITS A DRY DRUSH. I do not recommend using on delicate skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good sturdy brush but it is not one piece. I specifically chose this one because it was supposed to be one piece but once I got it I decided to keep it and use it. It works great, but it does come apart. These brushes don&#x27;t last long so I&#x27;ll look for another one when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> My first ... but I don&#x27;t know how it could be better.  I use it once or twice a day:)</li>
    <li> zi have not used thsi brush as much as the complexion brush, but it is relaxing and I do fall asleep quicker when I do use it.  My goal is to use it 2 times a day, now that I see the effects of the small one.</li>
    <li> The bristle are strong, but once you are use to it this brush works wonders. I love it so much!</li>
    <li> A must have for dry skin brushing.  I have given this brush to several as gifts and always purchase a new one for myself when it gets old.  Easy to travel with because you can slide the handle on and off.  Good idea to take the brush off when clean the brush or otherwise the wood may swell and make the brush difficult to take off until the wood contracts again.</li>
    <li> The bristles were way too hard for my thin skin.</li>
    <li> The bristles are just right for my skin, though they seemed to be too stiff at first.  The wood on this brush is very smooth.  Nice workmanship.  I have not washed, or even wet it yet.  The handle is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  Not too rough, but rough enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush almost daily for about two months.  My skin glows, feels super smooth and soft.  Bristles are stiff and may feel scratchy at first, but you get used to it.  Your skin feels warm and awake after brushing.  I brush for a couple minutes before hopping into the shower.  I thoroughly enjoy this brush and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great quality product! I bought lesser quality ones and upgraded to this one and you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin brushing is very healthy for you. Read up on it if you aren&#x27;t aware of the benefits.</li>
    <li> Dry brushing is so good for health!!  Exfoliates skin, increases circulation, helps stimulate lymph drainage!!  Highly recommended for ALL!!  SELLER 100%!!</li>
    <li> happy with the brush. I actually use it in the shower instead of dry like i see it is recommended for. really strong bristles not give my back a nice scratching.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Not too hard and not too soft - bristles are stimulating without being scratchy.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, other than the fact that the head tends to work its way off. Not a big deal, you just push it back on until a couple weeks later when it falls off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are not too hard, not too soft. I dry-skin brush every day before my shower and love the energizing, tingling feeling you get, not to mention all the unseen benefits. I like a brush that gives me a little oomph, so I can feel it, and this brush does that without rubbing my skin raw. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This brush is way to harsh. I&#x27;ll keep it handy for the next time I need to strip paint.</li>
    <li> This one never came with the stick portion of the brush so I never got to try it in it&#x27;s true form. I never did anything&lt;br /&gt;about the arrival issue with it so part of it is my fault but I didn&#x27;t want to bother since it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Good bush, but stiff. more for the floor than the back.</li>
    <li> Great for dry body brushing. I bought one for myself and my husband. Makes your skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> great brush... stiff and sturdy.. you may need to work you way up to this brush... expert skin brushing level.</li>
    <li> Came on time. I&#x27;m using it every night; good piece of equipment</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy handle with option to remove the brush head.</li>
    <li> many years ago santa brought everyone this item. this was a replacement item because it was so popular. excellent item that is a solid part of daily routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good brush. I heard about dry brushing and had to get myself a brush. This one has firm bristles, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I kind of wish I got one with softer, but this one gets the work done perfectly anyway.</li>
    <li> The handle on this brush is too short and the bristles are extremely hard. Rough on the skin. I would not recommend this shower brush.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time and I just recently used it. The bristles are a little hard. But  I grew up on using a bath brush, I know that there is a &amp;#34;breaking in period&amp;#34;. For me I like a bath brush it cleans and exfoliates the skin better and less expensive that other items that are on the market.&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t mind going back &amp;#34;to the old ways&amp;#34; I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great brush ... really scrubs the skin .</li>
    <li> If you like bathing with steel wool or carpet nails then this is your brush.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too rough, some people might like it though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Jensen&#x27;s brush for many years and it&#x27;s far and away the best body brush available.  End of story.</li>
    <li> I am new to the technique of dry brushing and this product came high recommended.  I was not dissapointed. Great quality and price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush for dry brushing. The bristles are too harsh for me and feel like they are scratching my skin instead of simply exfoliating my skin . This product fell short of expectations. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Brush works great on my body.  Very hard for back.  Would be better if the handle was a bit curved I think.  Washes and dries easily.  Nice quality.</li>
    <li> Bristles are very stiff and scratchy at first- feels like sandpapering the skin. BUT with use you get used to it. I noticed a big difference just with the first use- vast improvement of softness and texture. I&#x27;ll update after using at least 30 days but I have a good feeling about this one. I like that the handle separates- I only need the handle for my back, I like the control of just holding the head of the brush.</li>
    <li> Nice stiff bristles, good quality wood, but quite heavy in the hand.</li>
    <li> I probably should have read the reviews instead of looking at overall rating.  I did a search for bath brushes and this came up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush will crack and be unusable for shower scrubbing after only a couple of uses.  It is a nice looking brush and it scrubs well, it just won&#x27;t handle the water at all.  I was looking for a wet scrubbing brush, not a dry one and the info in the description says nothing of this at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect, works like a charm! Been dry brushing for a week and it feels great!</li>
    <li> This brush is very rough. Plus after 3 uses the bristles started falling out in clumps, one or two I can handle but an entire hole is empty in my brush.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I will buy again for sure. Well made.</li>
