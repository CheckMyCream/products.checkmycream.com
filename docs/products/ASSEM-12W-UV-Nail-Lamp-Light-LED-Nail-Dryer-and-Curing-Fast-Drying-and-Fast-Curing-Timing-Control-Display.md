      <li>but it gets the job done wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Very happy customer.</li>
      <li>This worked great with my Gelish nail polish.</li>
      <li>Works great,  had no problem curing my gel manicures</li>
      <li>the design is very nice as well.</li>
      <li>wonderful my wife and daughter love it and use it all the time.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This light is great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>The light is very sleek looking and works great.</li>
      <li>I assume this is ok, just keeping fingers under light longer</li>
      <li>Super Fast shipping, Great Item.</li>
      <li>Quick and efficient!</li>
      <li>it is lacking, but it took longer for the LED light to cure my polish than my UV lights.</li>
      <li>I can put my whole hand in, but the thumb doesn&#x27;t cure as well because the light doesn&#x27;t get to it well.</li>
      <li>I can fit my whole hand in it.</li>
      <li>I had to return this for a higher wattage.</li>
      <li>Using ibd no cleanse top coat I only needed the 30s cure time...once!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all.</li>
      <li>Wife loves it and it is so much cheaper than going to the salon and having her nails done.</li>
      <li>If also arrived very quickly -before the expected arrival date.</li>
      <li>and then an additional 60 to be sure they were dry but may not be necessary</li>
      <li>As a professional nail tech I would definitely recommend this product.</li>

<li> I was wondering if there was anyone that could help me out because I don&#x27;t know if I am using the wrong gel polish or what buy mine never seem to cure</li>

    <li> I assume this is ok, just keeping fingers under light longer and it is drying the nails instead of letting them be tacky.</li>
    <li> I like that I can put my whole hand in, but the thumb doesn&#x27;t cure as well because the light doesn&#x27;t get to it well. It takes longer than my previous model.</li>
    <li> wonderful my wife and daughter love it and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> If you are going to opt for an LED lamp instead of UV, this is not an upgrade. I would guess it is a low voltage or wattage or whatever sciency output it is lacking, but it took longer for the LED light to cure my polish than my UV lights. If you want to reduce your 2min UV dry time to the 20 sec. LED time, it isn&#x27;t going to happen with this guy. Might have to spend the $200 on a legit one but I&#x27;d rather wait 2 min a coat at that rate.</li>
    <li> Super Fast shipping, Great Item. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Cures all five fingers at once.  Quick and efficient!</li>
    <li> I had to return this for a higher wattage.</li>
    <li> Product works but slower than the OPI LED nail drier.</li>
    <li> Works great,  had no problem curing my gel manicures so far.&lt;br /&gt;And the design is very nice as well. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all.</li>
    <li> I am having some problems with my gel polish curing. I was wondering if there was anyone that could help me out because I don&#x27;t know if I am using the wrong gel polish or what buy mine never seem to cure they are always tacky.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and it is so much cheaper than going to the salon and having her nails done.</li>
    <li> This light is great. I can fit my whole hand in it.</li>
    <li> As a professional nail tech I would definitely recommend this product. It was a little smaller than I was expecting but it gets the job done wonderfully. Using ibd no cleanse top coat I only needed the 30s cure time...once! I have yet to try it with gel polish but when I do, for those wondering I&#x27;ll write another review on that as well. But as of yet, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This worked great with my Gelish nail polish. Very happy customer. Just some advice I did let my nails cure under lamp for 90 seconds and then an additional 60 to be sure they were dry but may not be necessary</li>
    <li> Kinda big to store out of the way, but saves my wife a lot of money on nail care.</li>
    <li> I love it! I was reluctant to start using gel polish and I&#x27;m so glad I did. The light is very sleek looking and works great. If also arrived very quickly -before the expected arrival date.</li>
