<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had to fix wat broke off orher than that looks great</li>
    <li> Cute head piece but kind of hard to get it to stay in place when wearing it out. The material is flimsy so I&#x27;m always afraid it will break if I try to adjust it at all. Up side is for the price it&#x27;s a cute summer piece.</li>
    <li> Very pretty! I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments. It ships fast and looks as pictured.</li>
    <li> I bought this headpiece of a whim and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve done. The picture on here doesn&#x27;t even do it justice it&#x27;s so pretty in person! I wore it for Halloween &amp; it was the perfect finishing touch for my costume</li>
    <li> Broke before even used</li>
    <li> Cute but broke immediately.</li>
    <li> Product was  good.Nothing too special. It was kinda confusing at first. And kept getting tangled.I now use it as a necklace lol</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I decided to wrap this around my ankle for a day, and ended up never taking it off. People loved it. I loved it. It has continued all summer long on that ankle without breaking, turning, or irritating my skin. Totally the best anklet ive ever had, for less than $2. Brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ehhhh. It&#x27;s pretty but it does fit rather oddly. For the price I paid, however, I would say the seller must be getting these for free, bc it is easily worth more than the $1 and some change I gave them.  In any event, it was a great thrill for my teenage cousin who ended up getting it, and it&#x27;s not nearly as &#x27;cheapo&#x27; looking as I expected it to be for the price.</li>
    <li> very pretty fits well...color is amazing the blur stones are this pretty blue-green color...was ship two before time...happy with product</li>
    <li> Did not fit well. Would be great for a kid/teen.</li>
    <li> I love this headband, it is super cute and looks just like the picture. I recommend you buy! Fabulousssssss find!</li>
    <li> Cheap don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
    <li> This is cute. It looks like how it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> Got this for a Jasmine costume. It is very cute.  I love it.  I am supposed to write more but thats all i want to say</li>
    <li> I really love this headpiece</li>
    <li> Recently went natural so I decided to try to do somethings to doll up my hair. I is really cute and I feel so regal in it.</li>
    <li> ME AND MY NIECE WERE LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT LOOK WE CAME ACROSS THIS PIECE OF JEWELRY.. WE BOTH HAD TO HAVE ONE..  THEY HAVE MANY STYLE AND COMES IN GOLD OR SILVER. ME AND MY NIECE LIKE THAT THEY CAME IN GOLD AND SILVER.. HAVE JEWELRY FOR ALL PARTS OF THE BODY ASWELL... THE MORE WE LOOKED THE MORE DIFFERENT STUFF WE FOUND.. THIS WAS SHIPPED FAST AND PACKAGED WELL... I AM GOING TO BUY FROM THIS PERSON AGAIN, HAPPY HUNTING ON YOUR NEW LOOK .. ME AND MY NIECE ARE..</li>
    <li> hard to put on where its fixed correctly and does bot stay on long falls right away difficult to wear</li>
    <li> This is a nice find! I love unique accessories such as these.I was not disappointed! It is very beautiful and affordable.It looks just like the picture.I love this product!:D</li>
    <li> Great product . The gold tone is very bright and shinny. Not sure how long it will remain like this.  Quality also seems good. Overall very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Love it. Fits perfectly. I have a big head lol..I recommend it. I just would like to see more stone color options.</li>
    <li> An actual bargain ! Very pretty doesn&#x27;t tangle easy . But need extra care if you want it to last a bit longer .</li>
    <li> So pretty. I have worn it as both a headpiece and a necklace. I continually get compliments. Nice piece.</li>
    <li> We use this in our play. It was really ease to wear and looks very pretty. I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I was looking for a cheap head piece just so I could get a bohemian vibe and I love it. I reccomend this if you want to have some fun and try a new look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: The headpiece was kind of tight on my head so I had to extend it a bit.</li>
    <li> I just received it and it broke right away please don&#x27;t wast your money</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s so cute! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it to the club!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for I guess... it popped immediately after one wear. Well.. it didn&#x27;t even make it all the way through to the one wear.</li>
    <li> Its a very good looking decorative chain for the hair making a woman feel pretty and femenine.</li>
    <li> Loved it! It looks exactly as the picture! Must buy! Shipping takes a week of so but totally worth the wait.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. came in a little earlier but it looks EXACTLY how it looks in the picture and im just in love with it.</li>
    <li> I received my headband earlier then the estimated shipping date which was a plus. It&#x27;s a great buy for the price. It&#x27;s not really gold but more of a copper gold but it&#x27;ll work for me for the price. Packaging was great and the product exceeded my expectations. Would buy again! I gave the product 4 stars because of the color not being gold.</li>
    <li> Its very cute and it fits my big head well. It looks exactly like the picture. I straighten my hair just to wear this cute head band.</li>
    <li> adjustable, good value, my sister wore it casually for a day out and to her school&#x27;s Egyptian themed winter formal. She said it didn&#x27;t fall off or bother her while she was dancing; she even forgot it was on. Nice find.</li>
    <li> Stones were too heavy and pulled chain down into eyes. Wasn&#x27;t able to wear ever</li>
    <li> It was broke as soon as I put it on! Very cheap</li>
    <li> I really like this head piece. I&#x27;ve had it for long period of time and the color hasn&#x27;t washed off</li>
    <li> Its beautiful... Thx :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t pin it decently in my hair. No matter where I place it, it sags somewhere else.  At least it was incredibly cheap</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great hair accessory I bought it for my mother and she loved it and she&#x27;s gotten so many compliments about how nice it looks it looks really classy really elegant great quality I really recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Its cute and its adjustable(thank goodness bc i have  quite the large head) and its cute and highly sophisticated! I love it, only downside is that one of the chains fell off and i had to remove it since clipping it back in was too hard. They get tangled easily so have a manequin to put it on. Its an awesome beautiful product</li>
    <li> I ordered this headpiece and thought it would look great for our Persian party but they failed to mention that it takes over 3 weeks to receive it.  I waited and waited but it didn&#x27;t come so I would definately advise give yourself at least 3 weeks if you want to get it in time for your event.</li>
    <li> Love This Metal Headband! Not Too Tight, Sits Perfectly On Your Head And Adds Something To Your Outfit!</li>
    <li> I like it and I haven&#x27;t wore it yet but it I will be wearing it with my hair when it get a little cooler that way I won&#x27;t sweat on it and it won&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> Took long to get here but got here just in time and it is Absolutely love this looks great for the costume i made. Must buy</li>
    <li> Its cool. Nothing like I expected. I&#x27;ll wear it one day.</li>
    <li> Really pretty, delicate piece. Looks just like the picture.</li>

    <li> I was ripped off. Never received the item, supper disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, looks just like picture, love it!</li>
    <li> It came with one of the rhinestones unattached and I had to fix it but other than that it&#x27;s super cute and unique</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love it!! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Sooo cute! It&#x27;s just what you wanted if not better. I got soo many compliments for this piece. You will def be the center of attention.</li>
    <li> Lovely design, felt like a goddess when I wore it! Four stars only because it was broken on one side when it arrived but was easily fixed.</li>

    <li> Its so pretty and it fits great! Looked great with my dress.</li>
    <li> I love this hair jewelry band, it fits perfectly and it can be adjusted as well very nice to do different hairstyles with. The color is pretty.</li>
    <li> These head pieces were deficient .i ordered 3and each one was lopsided or missing pieces .of course they came from China so who can afford to ship them back .what a waste of money .never again.👎</li>
    <li> difficult to wear, would not stay on and also broke upon arrival... tried to put it together but didn&#x27;t work...&lt;br /&gt;i threw it out... waste of money... wish it was better quality and made better...&lt;br /&gt;would be very pretty to put it on... disappointed with purchase... would not buy again...</li>
    <li> I love this chain head band, it so cute and it fits my head perfectly only problem is the stones colors looks crack like a brown lines around them but i still love it!</li>
    <li> &#x27;stones&#x27; look a bit odd, but it came in one piece and looks alright, and my sister does like it.</li>
    <li> Cute accessory! I love it!</li>
    <li> The color of the stones are more turquoise than the picture shows. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It&#x27;s comfortable and I like to pin it in place with bobby pins. It looks kinda cheap and is delicate but then again it&#x27;s a low price. Worth the price though.</li>
    <li> Loved it. So beautiful, even more so once it arrives. It&#x27;s very strong, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll break anytime soon, and it&#x27;s so femenine. Love the accesorie.</li>

    <li> It looks exactly like the picture. Very good to dress something up or for a costume. I would recommend especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this hair chain all the time :D.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice but for some reason it came with a piece of chain broken :/ Next time please recheck products before shipping</li>
    <li> I was pretty unhappy with this head band. It was cute in the picture but when I got it, it broke in half. I don&#x27;t know if it was just poorly constructed or what, but I was pretty mad because I was excited to wear it. Won&#x27;t be buying this jewelry anymore!</li>
    <li> received it last night and all 9pcs came I love them. It looks great There adorable fits my head perfectly thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what it looks like.</li>

    <li> Beautiful piece arrived quickly adjustable which was a plus</li>
    <li> Very cheapy, costumey.  What did I expect for the price?  :)  Will be great for a Halloween costume.  I would NOT intend to wear it as &amp;#34;fashion&amp;#34; in any sort of serious manner; strictly for giggles.</li>
    <li> I love this and get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. The stones are lighter then they look. It&#x27;s adjustable. Super cute.</li>
