<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it didnt work for me at all, i got it to help me with my dry hands, they flake and crack, this cream did not work for me...</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used! My hands get chapped every winter, mainly caused by the liquid hand lotion from work-it dries out the skin really bad. My skin cracks and bleeds, when they get so dry. This is the only thing that has helped them. Vaseline and Vitamin E couldn&#x27;t help. I always keep some on hand, and have bought it for my daughter, who also likes it.</li>
    <li> My hands always get super dry, cracked and sore during the Winter months.  I work in an office so I&#x27;m dealing with alot of paperwork so my hands are super susceptible to paper cuts which turn really ugly and painful due to the dry skin.  It seems like I have tried every hand cream on the market.  My husband actually teases me because my bathroom shelf if full of hand and body lotion rejects.  I stumbled across this hand cream during a desperate search for some relief and decided to give it a try.  I have to say that I really love this stuff and it definitely is a MIRACLE!  After the first application I noticed immediate relief.  Now within a weeks time of using the cracks on my fingertips have healed and my hands and fingers no longer feel like sandpaper. I&#x27;m so happy with this stuff and my husband likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very generous tube and is a great value.  I highly recommend to anyone who suffers from dry and cracked hands.  Mine were probably the worst and it has really helped me!</li>
    <li> I purchased Miracle Hand Repair a few years ago locally. When my hands become rough and red from kitchen work I suddenly remember my Miracle Hand Repair; surprisingly it seems to have an immediate positive effect. I was delighted to find the product on Amazon.com because I had not idea where to find it again locally.</li>
    <li> I work in the restaurant industry so I am always in water and cleaning supplies, so needless to say, my hands are beat up!  I love this because while it is thick going on, it rubs in fabulous and does not leave your hands feeling sticky and gross like some lotions do. I keep it at my desk at work and beside my easy chair at home cause I use it ALL the time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother who is quite rough on her hands.  She uses it quite often and says that she can tell the difference.  So, I will certainly order this again when she needs more of it.</li>
    <li> Very soothing on skin. The aloe in it really feels soothing. I reach for this all the time. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Miracle of Aloe hand repair cream  is great, I use it every night.  It soaks in right away and feels great.  I highly recommend this product!!  I will buy again and again</li>
    <li> Great for dry hands and works wonders on the feet</li>
    <li> I must say I picked this up at a store on a whim. I have always had a winter problem with cracked skin on one of my thumbs. After suffering most of the winter, I found my tube tucked away in the bathroom and gave it a shot. I used it religiously every day after washing my hands. It took a few days, but it seemed all of a sudden, I saw marked improvement. I quickly bought a bigger tube from Amazon as I didn&#x27;t want to run out. I was very skeptical that anything could help, but I think this is a great product and I am a believer!</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical when buying this product, I bought it for  a friend for xmas who suffers from chronic dry hands. Wisconsin weather is not kind to skin! This product made both of ur hands soft and repaired our skin after one day of using it. I had tiny little crack on my hands from the cold and they were gone instantly. This product is not greasy, its rather thick and creamy. I am hooked!! It&#x27;s worth spending a little more on something if you know it&#x27;s going to work rather than buy a multiple bunch of cheap products that do nothing. TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Will defintely by again!</li>
    <li> This looks like some sort of scam junk product. Its not, don&#x27;t be fooled, this is the best hand lotion I have ever used. I once had a job washing dishes and my hands got chapped and cracked and bled, this stuff fixed it and turned them into &amp;#34;soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34; in less than 2 days. No joke at all. If you need a daily hand lotion, this probably isn&#x27;t what you want, however if you need to fix serious damage to your hands, you can&#x27;t buy a better product.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is wonderful.  For my job I have to wash my hand so many times they dry out easy.  Since using this cream my hands are soft and free of the winter dryness.</li>
    <li> Almost the perfect product&lt;br /&gt;Good results&lt;br /&gt;But had propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;A very toxic product, it&#x27;s claimed safe and harmless but that&#x27;s a bunch of lies..  some people are allergic to PG and have gotten there lymphatic System poisoned. Side effects of lymphatic system side effects are swollen lymph nodes which can cause cancer....</li>
    <li> Based on some glowing reviews, I was looking forward to trying this product and bought one for myself and one for my mother.  I am disappoined.  Just another average hand cream, certainly no miracle!</li>
    <li> I have had dry hands for my entire life. They crack and peel terribly. This is the only hand lotion I use now and as long as I use it morning and night my hands stay much better. Still a little dry later in the day but the stuff does soak in. So I just grab a bit more. No greasy feeling at once once it soaks in.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work. on my feet, does not do the job it tells on the label misleading life to short to have rough feet</li>
    <li> I suffer from very dry skin.  Of course, this condition worsens with the colder, dry winter weather.  My fingertips aren&#x27;t catching on clothing any more.  I truly enjoy this product and will purchase more when the initial tube runs out.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream---my husband and I both use it---the tube lasts a long time with continual us; we both recommend it highly to everyone--have been using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is awesome. I use twice a day, morning and evening.  My nails are cuticles are not the greatest.  With the use of this product you would not believe how great they are now.  Also, I have many allergies, and Miracle Hand Repair has no bothersome ingredients, no parfumes, etc.  I love it.  I would not be without it.</li>
    <li> This product works as described and I am very happy with the results.  I have tried numerous products and this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> This works great but is kind of heavy on the toxins/chemicals. But for very dry feet it really helps a lot</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, but hard to find.  I&#x27;m delighted you had it, and thank you.  It does a superior job on hands that work hard.</li>
    <li> This lotion seems to just sit on the surface, does not penetrate or soften. My hands just end up looking shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hand cream. I am a nurse who washes my hands at least 50 times a shift. My hands have gotten super dry and uncomfortable. I have been faithfully using this hand cream at night and have noticed a great improvement in my hands. Definitely improves dry, cracked hands.</li>
    <li> I really like this hand cream, both for hands and for feet. It&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve found that actually heals the cracks on my heels which I get every summer when I wear sandals. Using this cream twice a day on my heels keeps them soft and crack free. This company also sells a foot cream, which I have tried, and I think the hand and foot creams are exactly the same product with different labels.</li>
    <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it. We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of hand and skin creams and this one really works, and works quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Appears to be perfect for dry cracked hands.  I plan to purchase more of this for her once her bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> There was a very little effect on my dry palm, the hardness is still there making me uncomfortable reaching out for greetings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 or 5 years now.  I have severely dry skin on my hands due to my OCD-like behavior of washing my hands several times a day.  I use lotions most of the year, but when a northeastern winter begins, the skin on my hands start to crack and actually bleed!  It looks like like lil friggin rivers of blood on my knuckles... and it hurts like hell.  But anyway, if I apply this product just 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 or 3 days in a row, the cracks are all cured!  I&#x27;ve never been to a dermatologist, but if it wasn&#x27;t for this product, I would definitely need to go.  This is not a regular lotion.. it actually works!  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> A very effective product</li>
    <li> I LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CREAM. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN AND HAD REALLY DRY SKIN. IT HAS CLEARED UP MY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;EVERYTHING ELSE WORKED FOR THE DAY BUT ALWAYS CAME RIGHT BACK.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WITH DRY ROUGH HANDS OR LEGS.</li>
    <li> My hands were very cracked and bleeding. No other lotions worked, so I ordered this. As the package says, I used it 1 1/2 days (3x) and saw immediate results. It&#x27;s fantastic!!</li>
    <li> The best hand cream I have found in 30 years.  I work with lime plasters which really dry out skin.  This stuff is non-greasy and has no smell which makes it perfect for me.  Heals as well as softens.</li>
    <li> OK but not lasting results</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, works great</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  I not only use it on my hands but on my head, face, arms, etc...&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this stuff in dry conditions where skin cracking occurs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was worth the $12 or if I was just expecting more from the product.  I am a nurse and wash my hands constantly while at work.  I put the lotion on and then gloves before I go to sleep. When I awoke, my hands were barely moisturized.  If I use this when I haven&#x27;t worked, it works well.  I went back to using Aveeno petroleum type lotion after I have worked to fully moisturize my hands.</li>
    <li> I have suffered the burning and itching caused by Shingles for many years. Many lotions have high levels of alchohol that increase the burning sensation. Miracle Hand Repair uses aloe as a cooling and healing ingredient. I have received a great amount of relief from these symptoms since I started using this product last year. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good product,pure Aloe would work as well,haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really tell how well it works..</li>
    <li> I used this cream for 6 months.  It moisturizes your hands nice without leaving an oiled feeling.  I tried to cure my eczema with it but it never happened.</li>
    <li> Best ever....Miracle of Aloe Miracle Hand Repair - 8oz QTY: I bought several and it is the greatest product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Ever since we moved to the southwest my skin underwent a drastic change because of the dryness here. However this product takes care of  dryness almost instantly. I recommend it to anyone  and especially if you also wash dishes a lot it restores your hands in a very very short time. I have three tubes of it on hand regularly and the small size for my purse. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for your hands, keeps your soft.  Works great to keep hands from drying out.  I use this because I work in the garden and sewing it really does keep your hands soft.</li>
    <li> If I use this every day it prevents those annoying and painful cracks from forming at the tips of my thumbs.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is my 3rd tube.</li>
    <li> worked well to heal cracks and mild eczema</li>
    <li> My husband turned me on to this hand cream.  It&#x27;s very good, especially in the dead of Winter when our hands are so dry.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> best hand cream ever... the only one I have found that works, here in Colorado where skin dries out and cracks... now not only are my hands soft and smooth, but my nails have grown strong like never before...</li>
    <li> I do Visual merchandising for a living and my hands get extremely dry from handling all the clothing. This is the only lotion I have found that will keep my hands moisturized. I would highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for six years and I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I love the stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased originally to help my daughter with cracks and redness on her knuckles from damage caused by frequent hand washing with anti-bacterial soaps at school, I have found Miracle of Aloe Miracle Hand Repair Cream works for other issues too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother&#x27;s dog developed a yeast infection on his skin, which led him to bite at himself.  His belly was particularly raw, but when we started using this product on it (in conjunction with a blow up collar so he couldn&#x27;t bite at it... and a gluten free diet), it healed beautifully in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use it after I wash my face at night as a replacement to my regular night time moisturizing cream, my face is soft and hydrated in the morning.  No stickiness or greasiness, just softer and younger feeling.  I use only about a dime size amount for my face and neck, and work it in slowly, starting around my eyes and moving outward and then down my neck.  Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses this cream on the tips of his fingers to ease cracking that seems to be constant.  When he uses this product twice a day, every day, the cracking disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is heavy, but it takes very little to cover a good sized area.  Wherever you use it you will notice improved hydration retention in the skin, as well as softer, smoother texture.  There is a slight odor to the cream, but it&#x27;s pleasant and not perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 60% Aloe, it heals naturally.  I don&#x27;t always go for natural products, but this one truly works extremely well, and is fairly priced considering you need very little of this rich cream to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream to heal and/or improve the quality of their skin.  Those having issues with dry, rough, chapped, cracked skin on any part of their body will most appreciate the quick relief offered by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I have also tried the [[ASIN:B003BWBRLA Miracle of Aloe Miracle Foot Repair Cream 8 Oz As Seen On TV Guarantees to Repair Dry, Cracked Feet &amp; Heels!

    <li> Very nice lotion.  It takes care of the cracks and does not leave your hands greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it</li>
    <li> my work dries my hands horribly, so thought I would give this a try after having such success with Miracle Foot lotion. It&#x27;s a huge bottle that will last forever, but I put one tiny squeeze at the end of my fingertips and rub it into the cracks and rough skin when it appears...and in a couple of days all is much better, if not totally repaired. Finally, I don&#x27;t have to try another new product!  :)</li>
    <li> This works wonders on dry hands.  Not greasy but seems to form a protective coating on your skin.  Keeps your hands feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant and light fragrance.</li>
    <li> nice lotion, perfect for dry split hands!</li>
    <li> My husband is finally having a winter where the dryness of his hands has not been a factor.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted. ...thanks</li>
    <li> This is such great hand cream...it is a nice consistency and really works well.  I like it so much, I buy it as gifts.</li>
    <li> A very good product. Not as concentrated as the small tube which works much better and quicker to heal rough skin.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. Especially if you handle quite a bit of paper on a daily basis. Not to mention washing dishes everyday. My hands get very dry and sometimes crack. This hand cream is awesome.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Thank you so much for the fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion on the market and I have tried a number of good hand lotions. I have to wash my hands throughout the day at work and when I am home I do not use gloves to do housework; so, my hands take a beaten and become very dry. Using it 2 or 3 times a day quickly resolves the dryness and prevents cracking. A little bit goes a long way, so apply sparingly. Initially it feels a bit greasy and you may question whether it will adequately absorb, but within a minute or two it fully absorbs. Not the best smelling hand lotion, but you aren&#x27;t using it as perfume and the smell quickly dissipates.  Very hard to find in stores, so I would order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Work very well I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> I love this product. I purchased a second one as well, It really does a good job on my dry hands.</li>
    <li> Great if you&#x27;re having problems with irritated or thin skin on your hands. They have a different version for feet that&#x27;s good too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff my shop worn hands. I do lapidary work and my hands take a beating, occasionally hitting grinding wheels and whatnot. This stuff really helps with the healing.</li>
    <li> All of the Miracle of Aloe products that I have tried are beyond amazing. This hand cream is lovely &amp; very moisturizing. I use it every night before bed and that is  all I need to keep my hands soft &amp; supple. I am a frequent hand washer during the day and this cream keeps them soft still and only using it once nightly.</li>
