      <li>What&#x27;s not to love about Kirk&#x27;s castile soap.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>

      <li>Love this soap.</li>
      <li>Great soap; lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>ago - glad to find it.</li>
      <li>skin! :)</li>
      <li>Since they don&#x27;t sell this soap in the stores close to me, it was great to discover it on Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Love this soap....</li>
      <li>I would buy it again if I need more.</li>
      <li>I started using it because my great grandmother had-she used it as shampoo as well-and have found it to be superior to most commercial soaps.</li>
      <li>It is safe for the body, hair and face.  </li>
      <li>Mild, cleans well, has a nice light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is touted as being very mild and nourishing for the skin, but in fact feels like battery acid after about three or four usages.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong soap and pulls a lot of oil out of the skin.</li>
      <li>I make my own liquid soap by melting a chopped up bar of soap in 5 cups of boiling hot water.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Helps a lot,  got smart and ordered the&lt;br /&gt;12 pack!!!</li>
      <li>Silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I wash my face twice, once with this great soap, then I use my eye makeup remover, then a second wash.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
      <li>Fantastic soap.</li>
      <li>Smells pretty good, but i still prefer the unscented version which, by the way, works pretty well during hunting season and doesn&#x27;t seem to tip off deer like scented soaps.</li>
      <li>The fresh scent is not irritating and rinses well even after the lovely suds :)</li>
      <li>Rinses clean.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel clean and does not leave a film.  </li>
      <li>Mellow sudsy as heck and can use to shampoo for sensitive skin light nice scent</li>
      <li>it leave&#x27;s your skin squeaky clean</li>
      <li>your skin will squeak its so clean...</li>
      <li>I tell everybody about how clean and moisturizing it is</li>
      <li>It is made out of coconut oil - which has many positive attributes.</li>
      <li>Soft soap that rinses off so nicely.</li>
      <li>and I have tried them all, including the high end soap free bars of this world!  </li>
      <li>The regular Coco Castile Bar Soap is very lightly scented so there is no need to buy the Fragrance Free version of it.</li>
      <li>It is far better.</li>
      <li>Best all around soap made, you get clean, hard or soft water!</li>
      <li>My favorite soap - it makes lots of bubbles and is basically a natural product.</li>
      <li>For certain it is better than normal or scented soaps.</li>
      <li>Consequently, it lasts a fair bit longer for me than the other bar soaps I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>I do use Aveeno moisturiser though so perhaps the combination is just right for me.  </li>
      <li>It has no bad chemicals in it, just the original natural formula.</li>
      <li>At my local grocery stores, a 3-pack of this soap can go for $4.50, so buying in quantity online is much more economical.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to go as organic and healthy as possible and this fits right in with that mindset.</li>
      <li>In this case, makes skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
      <li>gentle and no residue!</li>
      <li>Most commercial soap leaves me itchy, but this one does not.</li>
      <li>Had to get used to the scent at first but now accustomed to this coco soap, I dig it.</li>
      <li>Recommended to me many years ago by a dermatologist, I just wish they sold Kirk&#x27;s in the local grocery store!</li>
      <li>I bought Kiss my face (also only three ingredients), but found that the scent and the feel wasn&#x27;t as appealing as Kirk&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It has a natural smelling clean scent</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use these to wash my hair, my body and to wash my clothes (grate and add to equal parts borax + washing / baking soda)! I like that they are not laden with strange, chemical ingredients. Had to get used to the scent at first but now accustomed to this coco soap, I dig it.</li>
    <li> Great item, very hard to find.</li>
    <li> already wrote a review</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have used in years.  Makes you feel clean and does not leave a film.  A great product</li>
    <li> It is hard to get excited about soap, but I like it. I would buy it again if I need more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a strong soap and pulls a lot of oil out of the skin. I love it, but not for everyone, can be hard on sensitive places. I also use it in my travel bag as it eliminates my need for shampoo.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome. I have very sensitive skin and find that this does not break me out in hives. Also, it works great to clean oils off your body; I use it almost exclusively now for face wash as well as body wash, it makes your face feel very clean and oil free. If you work in an office, like I do, and have to wear collared shirts, scrubbing your neck with this soap in the morning cuts down on dirty shirt collars and saves dry-cleaning money. It works better for this purpose than any other soap I have ever tried. I am kind of neurotic about dirty collars, I previously would wipe my neck with rubbing alcohol before putting shirts on, I don&#x27;t need to with this soap.  Smells pretty good, but i still prefer the unscented version which, by the way, works pretty well during hunting season and doesn&#x27;t seem to tip off deer like scented soaps.</li>
    <li> it leave&#x27;s your skin squeaky clean</li>
    <li> your skin will squeak its so clean...</li>
    <li> We have used this soap for years. It works well with Nebraska&#x27;s hard water.</li>
    <li> This is a mild, skin-friendly soap, which rinses well, and leaves no harsh feeling after washing with it.  It was reasonably priced, so I bought it in quantity after trying it initially.</li>
    <li> I really like the unscented soap. Perfect for backpacking and spillage from a liquid.</li>
    <li> Love this soap....no itchy residue or perfumes. Rinses clean.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years for skin problem I have and it works.</li>
    <li> This is the third and last time I try this soap.  The first time it was awesome, smelled great and didn&#x27;t burn my skin. The second time I bought the fragrance free and it burned my face and body.  So, I thought I had bought the wrong one and tried again.  It also burns.  This is not the same soap that I bought from Soapgonebuy.com  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Best all around soap made, you get clean, hard or soft water!</li>
    <li> Used this as an ingredient in homemade laundry detergent.  Some of the best pricing on here and it works great.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for homemade cleaning slupplies. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give these 5 stars except the bars do not last very long relative to other bars of soap.  I still use it... noticed my skin drying out with other soap.</li>
    <li> Lathers in hard water so less soap is used to get the desired soap effect. Most commercial soap leaves me itchy, but this one does not. It has a natural smelling clean scent so I don&#x27;t smell like cotton candy or some other odd perfumey smell when done. I started using it because my great grandmother had-she used it as shampoo as well-and have found it to be superior to most commercial soaps.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this soap has been great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Product is just as described.  Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great soap, works for dirty greasy hands or soft areas both.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t make him itch.</li>
    <li> Soft soap that rinses off so nicely. It is made out of coconut oil - which has many positive attributes. In this case, makes skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap! Very nourishing. My skin feels so soft.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive good quality soap is hard to find...this is it!</li>
    <li> This soap is old fashioned but makes the most suds of any bar soap I&#x27;ve ever used -- even in hard water. Decent price and the bar last just as long as other brands. No stinky perfumes.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Kirk&#x27;s castile soap.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and so tried this soap. It works well, but I have to avoid my face or it&#x27;s left stinging. I was surprised by that.  Also, the bars seem to disappear twice as fast as commercial soap i&#x27;m used to.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Great soap; lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend you &amp;#34;harden or age&amp;#34; the soap if you want to last longer by removing the bars entirely from the package before storing.takes about 2 weeks to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was using only home made soaps and then tried your castile soap. It is the best and leaves my skin super clean.. Love it!!! T</li>
    <li> Love this soap! I make my own liquid soap by melting a chopped up bar of soap in 5 cups of boiling hot water. I make body wash and hand soap with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap ever. I have used it for years. Everyone asks me what I use on my skin and I tell them nothing but this. It removes makeup very well and is mild and wonderful! I wash my face twice, once with this great soap, then I use my eye makeup remover, then a second wash. My skin looks great. You should try it.</li>
    <li> We buy this soap over and over again.  It cleans thoroughly, does not have a scent, washes well, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t dissolve in the soap dish.  We use it in the kitchen, and it really cuts through any grease or oil on our hands.</li>
    <li> For people with sensitive skin or acne problems.  Why leave a bunch of additives, perfume... on your skin.  Recommended to me many years ago by a dermatologist, I just wish they sold Kirk&#x27;s in the local grocery store!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use.  It cleans well, provides a great lather and you smell fresh.  Excellent when washing your hair; provides a high gloss.</li>
    <li> Mild, cleans well, has a nice light fragrance.  Would recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking it had no fragrance. Must have read it wrong. I looked at dozens that day and thought I got the non scented one. I hate the smell. It is very very strong. Bought to make laundry detergent. I will get 3 batches out of it. So I suppose I&#x27;m in a long term relationship with this soap. It does a great job cleaning though so I will forgive the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; maybe I&#x27;ll grow to like it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic soap. I tell everybody about how clean and moisturizing it is and I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this castile soap for some years when suddenly my grocery stopped carrying it.  I bought Kiss my face (also only three ingredients), but found that the scent and the feel wasn&#x27;t as appealing as Kirk&#x27;s.  I use Kirk&#x27;s as a bath soap, face soap, and a shampoo.  In my opinion, the best soap.</li>
    <li> Lots of lather. Good smell. Silky smooth. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap a couple of months ago at my local grocery store, and I&#x27;ve stuck with it ever since. It&#x27;s a bit larger than your average bar of soap. Consequently, it lasts a fair bit longer for me than the other bar soaps I&#x27;ve used before. As someone who has sensitive, dry skin - especially now in the winter season - I can safely say that this stuff has not dried out my skin in the least, unlike some of the regular soaps I&#x27;ve tried. It has a very nice scent as well. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years and LOVE it. It has no bad chemicals in it, just the original natural formula. But what a lather it makes! Using it is a treat. I gave some to a friend and she complained about the &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; smell, but that&#x27;s what I want! I hate chemical smells.</li>
    <li> Perfect soap for someone with allergies like my son. The fresh scent is not irritating and rinses well even after the lovely suds :)</li>
    <li> Just like my Grandmother used 50 yrs. ago - glad to find it.</li>
    <li> Love this soap; gentle but wonderful lather.  Since they don&#x27;t sell this soap in the stores close to me, it was great to discover it on Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Good price for my fave soap.</li>
    <li> One of few soaps I can use that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. Highly recommend to anyone who has issues with perfume soaps</li>
    <li> I had used it off and on over the years but now I have eczema and use it exclusively and seldom have flare ups. For certain it is better than normal or scented soaps.</li>
    <li> I like this soap because it lathers really well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  On the downside, all that lather can also lead to a little more soap scum in the shower, so you may need to rinse down the walls a bit more.  At my local grocery stores, a 3-pack of this soap can go for $4.50, so buying in quantity online is much more economical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dry itchy skin,  this soap&lt;br /&gt;Helps a lot,  got smart and ordered the&lt;br /&gt;12 pack!!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap and its vegan!!!</li>
    <li> We have been using this soap since childhood.  While we remain 100% satisfied with the product, we do note that the formula seems to have changed within the last couple of years, which is a disappointment.  We wish it was still availaber at drugstores and supermarkets, so we wouldn&#x27;tt have to mail order bath soap.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it head to toe, it&#x27;s a good substitute for dr.bonners .</li>
    <li> gentle and no residue!</li>
    <li> Best for hard-water use. Always lathers up. Plus, this soap cleans stains on clothes and other surfaces.</li>
    <li> This soap works well for hard water, and produced a lot of lather. It cleans well. I have used it for years. Dr.Z</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst soap I have ever used.  It is touted as being very mild and nourishing for the skin, but in fact feels like battery acid after about three or four usages.  I began to develop a rash all over my body and began to itch constantly.  I attempted to return my purchase but missed the return deadline by 2 days.  I will be throwing this soap into the trash, as I would not wish it on my worst enemy.  I will also continue to use the Olivella brand olive oil soap as my regular soap from now on.  It is far better.</li>
    <li> this is a very good natural castille soap. I beleve in it cuz its the only thing that helped my skin in a big way.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It even moisturizes unlike the conventional soaps. I even wash my hair with it too.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME! Gentle and NON-DRYING unlike some other &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; soaps. This leaves my skin moisturized and soft. It lathers GREAT! I&#x27;m trying to go as organic and healthy as possible and this fits right in with that mindset. I love it and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> THE best soap for my face EVER and I have tried them all, including the high end soap free bars of this world!  I hate wash off and cream cleansers, just too fiddly for me so have been washing with soap for about 2 years now.  I have quite dry facial skin which can look like paper with bad soap and no moisturiser but I can actually use this and not feel like my skin is thirsty afterwards plus my skin looks clearer than it ever has... I do use Aveeno moisturiser though so perhaps the combination is just right for me.  The other thing I have found is that it works great on my hair... if I use too often I will get kind of a build up (perhaps of the coconut oil?) and ironically it will then get very dry and hard to get a brush through but it seems to give my hair body and stops my fly aways ... because of the build up though I use it after my normal shampoo (I swear by Suave - yes, a really cheap shampoo but absolutely brilliant!) maybe every 2-3 days.  I can&#x27;t imagine using any other soap now and it is cheap as chips down at Wally World.. although I purchased my first batch through Amazon - certainly more expensive but you can&#x27;t always find it at Walmart.  My only complaint really would be that it does tend to disintegrate quickly but it&#x27;s so cheap it&#x27;s not a biggie.  PS: It was actually my hubby who introduced me to this soap, he won&#x27;t use any other either and he generally doesn&#x27;t care too much about stuff like this!</li>
    <li> love this soap makes my hands feel great</li>
    <li> the best soap on the market</li>
    <li> SEEMS TO BE DOING THE JOB</li>
    <li> I have been using Kirk&#x27;s for years.  It is safe for the body, hair and face.  It has a fresh scent and it lathers until the last little bit.</li>
    <li> Great product. I initially bought this product because I wanted to go all natural and I didn&#x27;t want any animal products. I am very happy with the scent and I even use this to wash my hair!</li>
    <li> Good period! Mellow sudsy as heck and can use to shampoo for sensitive skin light nice scent</li>
    <li> Works great for hand made liquid soap. However I started making it from scratch.</li>
    <li> Remember this when I was a kid. Great cleaning and non-drying but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used Kirk&#x27;s soap for quite a while and it was nice to find it on Amazon because it can be difficult to find in the stores where we live.&lt;br /&gt;For those who have not tried it, this soap has a fresh clean scent and lathers quite well even in hard water.</li>
    <li> Great dope. Does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap - it makes lots of bubbles and is basically a natural product.</li>
    <li> The regular Coco Castile Bar Soap is very lightly scented so there is no need to buy the Fragrance Free version of it. Plus the regular Coco Castile Bar Soap lasts almost a week per bar if one has hard water. It is also much less scented than regular Ivory Soap and the regular Coco Castile Bar Soap is just as mild.</li>
    <li> Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap is soothing to the skin, and is perfect if you find most soaps drying.  I&#x27;ve been using Dove, but will now only use Kirk&#x27;s Castile.  The product is as described, and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Received it earlier than projected and I am very satisfied.</li>
