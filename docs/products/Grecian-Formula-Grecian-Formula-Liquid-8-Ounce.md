      <li>...........I am 51 and gray hair fairly gone in 48 hours..........</li>
      <li>good price</li>
      <li>Improving the product information and providing a safer alternative seems to me to be a good move for Amazon.</li>
      <li>good stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would be good if Amazon would add the no lead product to its inventory and provide information on the lead up front in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied of the result using  Grecian Formula</li>
      <li>great product love it</li>
      <li>Best product for natural looking hair.</li>
      <li>Works fine if you keep using it!</li>
      <li>It does smell like most hair products do but is gone after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this stuff.</li>
      <li>an outstanding value......40% discount from retail.</li>
      <li>This stuff works better with shorter hair.  </li>
      <li>I love Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>my husband love it because is not greasy</li>
      <li>love Amazon.</li>
      <li>Covers most of the gray if I use about three palm-fulls once a day.  </li>
      <li>Now I spritz once a week to maintain the beautiful and natural look.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s strong points</li>
      <li>A fine product for my husband.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is best to get a haircut before you start because if your hair lis longer you use much more of the product in the first few weeks.</li>
      <li>After getting out of the shower, I would towel/air dry my hair, and then apply the Grecian Formula, making sure to &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; every hair, and rubbing it in for good measure.</li>
      <li>Removes gray while maintaining original hair color.</li>
      <li>Great fot Grey, just stay at it.</li>
      <li>This is the original stuff and works gradually.</li>
      <li>This stuff works, but actually the cream and foam are good too.</li>
      <li>Does everything it said it would, and actually softens my hair like a good conditioner too.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t follow the directions as written on bottle, you are not likely to get good results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After one week of not shampooing and applying product everyday, I really did notice an impressive change in hair color.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t cover all the gray so it looks very natural.</li>
      <li>The thing I like most is it looks completely natural, and I&#x27;m actually happy it leaves a little bit of gray.  </li>
      <li>2nd day, a nice difference and again, used 4 times.......</li>
      <li>I rinse my hair daily with warm water (no shampoo) because I can&#x27;t stand feeling like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair.</li>
      <li>I exercise and do all the right things, but my hair betrays my efforts.</li>
      <li>I guess I was shampooing it right out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Now I know why it didn&#x27;t work the first time, because it&#x27;s really working this time!!</li>
      <li>But you have to be very, very diligent using it for the first month.</li>
      <li>When I first started using it,  it took about two weeks to get my hair to where I wanted it.</li>
      <li>The trick is that you must not shower your head often during the first 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Then I decided to follow the directions EXACTLY</li>
      <li>First time I tried it I swore it did not work.  </li>
      <li>Tolerable for the results, just don&#x27;t go on a hot date just after using it.</li>
      <li>I received the product I found out for the first time about the lead and the fact that it cannot be used for beards presumably because of the lead ingestion possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell when I first apply it ...</li>
      <li>the first day, used 4 times first day......</li>
      <li>This stuff does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
      <li>Do not use any hairgels, hairspray or shampoo with conditioner for the first month or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>The smell is not too good for the first few hours after application.</li>
      <li>(ie I&#x27;m more gray some weeks than others, with the most gray showing when I get a hair cut and the least when it is the longest.)  </li>
      <li>To actually see the color come back into your hair is just amazing.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.  </li>
      <li>A very &amp;#34;sulphery&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>Results are more THAN expected</li>
      <li>I was very satisfy thank you Daniel.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind too much greasy build up can also impede the effectiveness of the product</li>
      <li>better than coloring no mess at all takes only a minute</li>
      <li>A quick 10 second wash, rinse and be done.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>so this keeps things a little more even or uniform rather than in spots.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for forty years and it keeps me from looking as old as I really am.</li>
      <li>Normally I am Santa.</li>
      <li>I would apply the product at night and sleep on a towel, and every morning I would shampoo my hair as normal.  </li>
      <li>During the first month wash your hair with a very mild (baby type) shampoo no more than once a week</li>
      <li>Therefore, I ended up right back with Grecian Formula.</li>
      <li>Less hair makes it easy.</li>
      <li>First, you have to apply it daily for about a month.  </li>
      <li>My wife doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I think it&#x27;s only noticeable when I first put it on.  </li>
      <li>Also as your hair grows, unless you are willing to touch it up continuously you have a, for me, a white line of hair.</li>
      <li>The alternate product with no lead has bismuth citrate as the active ingredient and is available for purchase certainly from Canadian</li>
      <li>I then continued for one more week, and actually thought my hair might be too noticeably dark.  </li>
      <li>it says it clearly on the box.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I really like the product, the gradual change (which took at least a month, so don&#x27;t give up), and the fact that it avoids the unnatural shades of most hair dying products.  </li>
      <li>I still maintain a touch of gray to look natural.</li>
      <li>And so far, no one has mentioned anything.  </li>
      <li>but this is by far cheaper.</li>
      <li>No mess or fuss.</li>
      <li>No other hair products should be used during this time; no conditioner, no oils, no gel / hairspray / mousse, etc.  </li>
      <li>This stuff does work, highly recommended as long as you don&#x27;t mind the smell, kinda like chemicals.</li>
      <li>It darkens only the gray hair, leaving the rest of my hair natural.</li>
      <li>but once you start seeing the natural color of your hair coming back</li>
      <li>The smell IS somewhat offensive, but not terribly so, and I found that the smell died down as the hair dried.  </li>
      <li>It does stink a little when you first put it on but the odor diminishes as it dries.</li>
      <li>If your hair becomes really greasy due to not shampooing daily, go ahead and wash it with a mild baby shampoo but don&#x27;t scrub hard.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, just massage in a little every few days or so.</li>
      <li>This stuff stinks for sure!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually cheaper in the long run than regular hair dye...and nowhere near all the fuss.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But first, I cut my hair a little shorter than normal so that not washing my hair would be less of an issue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product works very well.  First, you have to apply it daily for about a month.  During this time you should wash your hair no more than once a week.  No other hair products should be used during this time; no conditioner, no oils, no gel / hairspray / mousse, etc.  If you don&#x27;t follow the directions as written on bottle, you are not likely to get good results.  I have tried lots of different items including anti-gray pills, vitamins, dyes, oils.  This product beats them all.  Youthair works in a similar fashion.  Both Grecian formula and Youthair have an offensive smell, but you get used to it after a while.  I would rather put up with the smell instead of the gray hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product once before and it worked both times. It is a gradual change but once you start seeing the natural color of your hair coming back your just going it freak out. Once your gray your gray... To actually see the color come back into your hair is just amazing. As for the smell it&#x27;s definitely not one of it&#x27;s strong points but if you can get past that then your not gray anymore. You decide.</li>
    <li> good stuff, my hair transplant dr recommended it</li>
    <li> Good product! Easy to use, just massage in a little every few days or so. No mess or fuss. Not like messy dyes which take time and have a lot of cleanup and.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> works but takes time, didn&#x27;t do anything  the fist 2 weeks after the 3rd week started to work, looks very natural, blended in with my natural hair color and the smell not so bad.</li>
    <li> wife uses it to keep the white down and has been now for about 10 years. .Ha it works so . . . . .</li>
    <li> Works fine if you keep using it!</li>
    <li> Be careful this product contains lead and may cause allergic reaction or lead poisoning.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon declines to return the unuzed botlles. I am not happy customer</li>
    <li> my husband love it because is not greasy</li>
    <li> I have used Grecian Formula for  quite some time, as other hair coloring products do not work for my sensitive scalp; with this product there is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I found Grecian the easiest hair coloring to use. Normally I am Santa. As an ancient one I am treated as such. However my personality and thinking is not ancient. So once in awhile I like to be treated as a younger person, let us say a person in his 60s LOL.  The process is gradual. For me results began to appear in seven days. I had tried the 5 minutes stuff and that too works however it is a dramatic drastic overnight change for family and friends. Also as your hair grows, unless you are willing to touch it up continuously you have a, for me, a white line of hair. With Grecian I just continue to apply it no white line. Even though there are no major studies I could find regarding the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; in the product I always take precautions and wash my hands after each application.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for forty years and it keeps me from looking as old as I really am. Just use it a couple of times a week after shampooing and drying my hair.</li>
    <li> better than coloring no mess at all takes only a minute but you must use every day for best results</li>
    <li> I have ben buying this product from the grocery store for several years but this is by far cheaper. When I first started using it,  it took about two weeks to get my hair to where I wanted it. Now I use it once or twice a week to maintain the look I want. I love that it doesn&#x27;t cover all the gray so it looks very natural. It does stink a little when you first put it on but the odor diminishes as it dries. Tolerable for the results, just don&#x27;t go on a hot date just after using it.</li>
    <li> Same as store bought but cheaper.</li>
    <li> Best product for natural looking hair. Removes gray while maintaining original hair color.</li>
    <li> I used to Grecian Formular about 10years to expect change my hair coulor white to black.&lt;br /&gt;Result is almost reacht to my expectation.</li>
    <li> Only have a little gray at 65 but it is spotty so this keeps things a little more even or uniform rather than in spots.</li>
    <li> First time I tried it I swore it did not work.  Years later I tried again, and again it appeared not to work after 4 weeks of using.  Then I decided to follow the directions EXACTLY and it worked.  The trick is that you must not shower your head often during the first 3 weeks.  If you cannot do without a daily hair wash, this product will not work for you.</li>
    <li> packaged well.  Looks like it works, very slowly (or gradually).  People don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work, highly recommended as long as you don&#x27;t mind the smell, kinda like chemicals. Not too bad for me, I think you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Does everything it said it would, and actually softens my hair like a good conditioner too. I don&#x27;t like the smell when I first apply it ... but that&#x27;s a small price to pay imo for the benefits.</li>
    <li> I am a female who uses this once a week, and I have for years. It darkens only the gray hair, leaving the rest of my hair natural. Nobody can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No mores hair dyes for me; hair dyes that turn my entire head one unnatural shade of color. No gloves. No bonnets. No waiting, timing and washing out the access. I simply spritz Grecian on my hair and then scruff it in with my fingers, moistening all the hair. I never worry about \\&quot;roots\\&quot; showing through between dye jobs. I initially began by using Grecian Formula once/twice a day until the desired effects were reached.  It took less than two weeks. Now I spritz once a week to maintain the beautiful and natural look. Only a small amount of formula is needed so I get several months out of one 8 oz bottle. It&#x27;s actually cheaper in the long run than regular hair dye...and nowhere near all the fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, do yourself a favor. Dump the gloves, timers and bonnets. Pick up a bottle of Grecian and give yourself a spritz instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Grecian Formula for about five years and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. It gives me a natural hair color look without the glaring artificial hair color look. I still maintain a touch of gray to look natural. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Husband has been using this daily. It has helped a little but not very much.</li>
    <li> This is the original stuff and works gradually. The smell is not too good for the first few hours after application.</li>
    <li> A fine product for my husband.  Been using it over 30 years.</li>
    <li> My husband has been very happy with the gradual process.  No one at works has noticed he is doing it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but actually the cream and foam are good too. I think the foam works a little faster.</li>
    <li> does the trick. good price</li>
    <li> Well, the stuff works. I love Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Covers most of the gray if I use about three palm-fulls once a day.  My wife doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I think it&#x27;s only noticeable when I first put it on.  The thing I like most is it looks completely natural, and I&#x27;m actually happy it leaves a little bit of gray.  The worst thing is it&#x27;s hard to control the amount of gray, and it seems to vary in effectiveness over time.  (ie I&#x27;m more gray some weeks than others, with the most gray showing when I get a hair cut and the least when it is the longest.)  Overall, I really like the product, the gradual change (which took at least a month, so don&#x27;t give up), and the fact that it avoids the unnatural shades of most hair dying products.  The only other drawback is an itchy scalp, but I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is better than the other type of products to color your hair, but the smell is very, very bad. I literally smelled, at least to myself, bad entire day, each day I use it. I was self-conscious wondering if people that got close to me could smell it as well and would wonder what it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would almost rate this two stars, but it works, so I&#x27;m bumping it up to four, but the smell is very bad -  not sure if I mentioned it or not!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied of the result using  Grecian Formula</li>
    <li> The product may work but it contains lead and has been banned in Canada and Europe. The alternate product with no lead has bismuth citrate as the active ingredient and is available for purchase certainly from Canadian sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be good if Amazon would add the no lead product to its inventory and provide information on the lead up front in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product I found out for the first time about the lead and the fact that it cannot be used for beards presumably because of the lead ingestion possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the safer version from a Canadian source and am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon. I buy tons of stuff!  Improving the product information and providing a safer alternative seems to me to be a good move for Amazon.</li>
    <li> HELPS FRIEND WITH KEEPING HIS HAIR FROM TURNING COMPLETELY WHITE.  BEEN USING FOR YEARS.</li>
    <li> great product love it ..would definitely recommend to others</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s standard Grecian formula, and it&#x27;s holding back the Gray.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.....</li>
    <li> Results are more THAN expected great I WİLL  Use it  for a long time I also advise to people who HAVE White hair</li>
    <li> CAUTION:  Contains lead!  I can not believe it is not in any online description.  it says it clearly on the box.  You are supposed to put lead on your head and not shampoo for a week.  I am returning this poison.  This should be illegal.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfy thank you Daniel.</li>
    <li> Fantastic BUT purchase a small spray bottle...........I am 51 and gray hair fairly gone in 48 hours..........the first day, used 4 times first day......2nd day, a nice difference and again, used 4 times.......3rd day, I was shocked........impressive.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used initially w/out a spray bottle and took forever..........w/ Spray Bottle, incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, the sprayer will stick but use water........</li>
    <li> Read the product description and instructions.  This stuff does exactly what it claims to do.  Some people don&#x27;t like the smell.  It does smell like most hair products do but is gone after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do follow the instructions.  Place enough of this on fully dry hair so that the hair is fully wet.  Do this every day until the color is what you want.  A few drops don&#x27;t work, hair must be wetted fully with this product.  Then after you have the color you like apply it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best to get a haircut before you start because if your hair lis longer you use much more of the product in the first few weeks. This stuff works better with shorter hair.  On the other hand this product will not work with VERY short hair because it needs a few weeks to work, or should I say it only works on the hair that is a few weeks old so if you cut your hair every few weeks this product will never have time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hair is very long, you&#x27;ll be buying this stuff by the caseload and it will not have time to work if you use clippers every couple weeks.  Or if you don&#x27;t like the smell of it and can&#x27;t wait the few hours for it is dissipate.  For everyone else it works as stated.</li>
    <li> Great fot Grey, just stay at it.</li>
    <li> an outstanding value......40% discount from retail.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, just follow the directions on thee bottle. I could see the difference after 1 week. Big improvement after 2 weeks, and after 3 weeks the grey is almost gone. My only suggestion is to get your hair cut before you start. Less hair makes it easy.</li>
    <li> I started going gray about 15 years ago, and ten years ago I wanted to fight back.  I bought this product and used it for about two weeks.  After seeing no change at all, I quit this product and quit worrying about gray hair.  Then, recently, I&#x27;ve had this person annoyingly refer to my &amp;#34;white hair&amp;#34; a little too often. I exercise and do all the right things, but my hair betrays my efforts. So, I started looking at my options. I didn&#x27;t want anyone to know what I was doing, so the &amp;#34;gray today, brown tomorrow&amp;#34; was just not an option for me.  Therefore, I ended up right back with Grecian Formula. This time I tried to figure out if I had been doing something wrong, and I certainly had been. I would apply the product at night and sleep on a towel, and every morning I would shampoo my hair as normal.  I guess I was shampooing it right out of my hair.  With this knowledge, I proceeded anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I would shower in the morning, only &amp;#34;water washing&amp;#34; my hair, but thoroughly. But first, I cut my hair a little shorter than normal so that not washing my hair would be less of an issue. After getting out of the shower, I would towel/air dry my hair, and then apply the Grecian Formula, making sure to &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; every hair, and rubbing it in for good measure. Then I would comb my hair. The smell IS somewhat offensive, but not terribly so, and I found that the smell died down as the hair dried.  Coupled with a cologne, and it was never an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week of not shampooing and applying product everyday, I really did notice an impressive change in hair color. I shampoo&#x27;d my hair after one week just because that was all I could take; I had to wash it. I then continued for one more week, and actually thought my hair might be too noticeably dark.  I immediately stopped using it, because I just don&#x27;t want anyone to know what I am doing. And so far, no one has mentioned anything.  At this point, I will probably use it 1-2 times per week just to maintain the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt it works! IF you follow the directions and use it religiously every day for at least a month. In 3 1/2  weeks my hair has gradually gone from &amp;#34;snow white&amp;#34; to dirty dark blonde / light brown and keeps getting darker every day! The smell takes some getting used to. This stuff stinks for sure! A very &amp;#34;sulphery&amp;#34; smell. It contains lead acetate which can be very dangerous and deadly if ingested even in tiny amounts! I wear disposable vinyl gloves when I apply it so it&#x27;s not on my hands and potentially transferred to foods etc.  During the first month wash your hair with a very mild (baby type) shampoo no more than once a week or it won&#x27;t work. Do not use any hairgels, hairspray or shampoo with conditioner for the first month or it won&#x27;t work. I rinse my hair daily with warm water (no shampoo) because I can&#x27;t stand feeling like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair. If your hair becomes really greasy due to not shampooing daily, go ahead and wash it with a mild baby shampoo but don&#x27;t scrub hard. A quick 10 second wash, rinse and be done. Keep in mind too much greasy build up can also impede the effectiveness of the product so you may need to shampoo occasionally but understand that every time you shampoo, it will slow the process. Again, the product works no doubt! But you have to be very, very diligent using it for the first month.I say this because I tryed using this once before years ago with no results whatsoever. My failure was shampooing and using styling hairgel everyday. Likewise I did not use it religiously everyday because of the bad smell. Now I know why it didn&#x27;t work the first time, because it&#x27;s really working this time!!</li>
