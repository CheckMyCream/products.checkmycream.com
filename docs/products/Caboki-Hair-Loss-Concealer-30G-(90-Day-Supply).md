      <li>I used minoxidil 5% for more than a year and it worked</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not staring at the &amp;#34;problematic area&amp;#34; on the top of his head for hours</li>
      <li>I can kiss the top of his head or run my fingers &amp;#34;through&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with some hair loss over a period of about 5 years, and had been using brown eye shadow in the front to make myself feel better.</li>
      <li>It matches my hair color very well and I am happy.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been told by many people that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m balding at all.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>The price is better than at their website.  </li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m more than happy&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>Thank you for making me feel better.</li>
      <li>Now for a better price~~~</li>
      <li>I think it works better with longer hair- because it has more hair fiber to hold onto.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, and gives the illusion of hair-</li>
      <li>Awesome I was a little bit concerned before I got it</li>
      <li>and they could see a huge difference, and they agree you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
      <li>I just got a sample, and have used it twice, both in front and on the crown of my head and am totally amazed and happy with the results.</li>
      <li>heck it was free</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>this is not the original formula they changed it to a cheap pepper looking fiber i will never buy this again</li>
      <li>but therr is a significant difference</li>
      <li>it wipes right off with ur finger tips soon as u apply it!</li>
      <li>So a friend had a sample of Caboki which I tried and it worked like a charm; it looked like I had a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>After 2 wks use, no one has noticed, &#x27;tho self confidence has tremendously increased.</li>
      <li>Make it a point to have 1 extra tube handy at all times.</li>
      <li>I received the free sample from the main website, and I thought...</li>
      <li>EXACTLY</li>
      <li>Plus, you are no longer able to see through how much is left in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I had to say it worked great for me till last fall when they changed the container from what is displayed to the one with slim shaft and rough application surface.</li>
      <li>Really works quite well.  </li>
      <li>Very practical.</li>
      <li>I now have switched to use Cuvva, which having been working very well for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the inventor.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this to everyone dealing with hair loss- and have spread the word!</li>
      <li>Very easy application, less than 5 mins.</li>
      <li>I hope they go back to their original formula.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care how long it lasts; one day at a time is far better than the thinning look to me.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to pat your hair down to once you apply and no need to apply too much.</li>
      <li>It works completely as described and makes a very noticeable difference</li>
      <li>of course all my friends new</li>
      <li>The powder blows off with wind vs. the old one that would still stay on.</li>
      <li>his hair and I don&#x27;t really get anything on me, maybe the occasional dust specks.</li>
      <li>However, it contains the same content and it&#x27;s been a month testing the new shaped bottle</li>
      <li>I have thin hair and my vertex can be seen easily.</li>

<li> However, it contains the same content and it&#x27;s been a month testing the new shaped bottle</li>
<li> I have thin hair and my vertex can be seen easily.</li>
<li> The only thing I have to do is after I put it on, I spray everything with hair spray and it stays all day long.  </li>
<li> /&gt;this does not has a long lasting effect.</li>
<li> I was given an unused  sample and did some research on the web, this product contains Silica When inhaled, silica dust can cause silicosis, cancer and increases the risk of Tuberculosis, good luck :-(</li>
<li> With little of it I hide it and it looks all natural.</li>
<li> It covers up really well and the only thing I may have trouble with from time to time is spreading the product evenly and the little fallouts it causes.</li>
<li> It used to take only a couple of minutes for me to conceal a bald area but now more than 5 to 10 minutes, leaving a lot of waste in clumps that I have to dust off, and dirty shirt and bathroom surroundings.</li>
<li> The new design is hard to apply.  </li>
<li> Purchased the product from Amazon to see if I get the same product or not, as I purchased from Caboki web store previously.</li>
<li> I have a black mans hair and you wouldn&#x27;t ever know that I had big bald areas.</li>
<li> The 25 g bottle is not completely full and does not last the 75 days as Cabooki claims...I have a small thinning on the back of my head and the bottle will last about two weeks..</li>
<li> Only draw back is it&#x27;s a little messy.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t hold on in wet conditions.</li>
<li> I complained to Amazon, then left email to Caboki, never received any feedback.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how it works on people with less hair.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
<li> , I usually wear a hat, but sometimes when I can&#x27;t and have to wear a suit that is when I use it.  </li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t look weird when I&#x27;m standing next to him while he&#x27;s sitting.</li>
<li> But all in all, I usually am done in &amp;#60;3 minutes.</li>
<li> Nothing negative.</li>
<li> /&gt;too expensive for the little bit that is put in the bottle.</li>
<li> It was at a very slow rate but there was a noticeable difference.</li>
<li> Seriously!  </li>
<li> It was very bad product and when you put on your hair it will start fall as you put black powder on your hair.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t look fake or stupid.</li>
<li> very unhappy..</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not what it was shown on videos. it is powder and it just changes the skin color which hides it from the distance,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have color and you apply to your visible skin through hairs then you may not need this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this does not has a long lasting effect. once applied you should not touch or wash your hairs...</li>
    <li> Awesome I was a little bit concerned before I got it but now I&#x27;m more than happy&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it. Thanks to the inventor. I have thin hair and my vertex can be seen easily. With little of it I hide it and it looks all natural.</li>
    <li> It was very bad product and when you put on your hair it will start fall as you put black powder on your hair. Also, anyone can see that you use a material on your hair. So, I don&#x27;t recommend it as hair product for any one.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He says he&#x27;ll get it again. It works completely as described and makes a very noticeable difference but it doesn&#x27;t look fake or stupid. He is taller than I am so I&#x27;m not staring at the &amp;#34;problematic area&amp;#34; on the top of his head for hours but it doesn&#x27;t look weird when I&#x27;m standing next to him while he&#x27;s sitting. I can kiss the top of his head or run my fingers &amp;#34;through&amp;#34; his hair and I don&#x27;t really get anything on me, maybe the occasional dust specks.</li>
    <li> Works great. No need to spend 13K on a transplant when I can take 5 minutes to conceal. Always have an umbrella handy if there is threat of rain.</li>
    <li> this is not the original formula they changed it to a cheap pepper looking fiber i will never buy this again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I was blown away by its capability. I have a black mans hair and you wouldn&#x27;t ever know that I had big bald areas. Only thing is that I need to apply it daily and it may cause problems on your pillows. Also, where-ever you apply it (say in the bathroom), you may need to clean-up. But all in all, I usually am done in &amp;#60;3 minutes.</li>
    <li> I used Caboki for 3 years and I had to say it worked great for me till last fall when they changed the container from what is displayed to the one with slim shaft and rough application surface. Ever since then I have not had a good experience.  The new design is hard to apply.  The powder clumps on the surface of the hair rather than evenly spreading through the hair. It used to take only a couple of minutes for me to conceal a bald area but now more than 5 to 10 minutes, leaving a lot of waste in clumps that I have to dust off, and dirty shirt and bathroom surroundings. Plus, you are no longer able to see through how much is left in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I return and reordered a couple of times but all received the same type of design. I complained to Amazon, then left email to Caboki, never received any feedback.  I now have switched to use Cuvva, which having been working very well for me.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my bald spots at the side near my forehead. It covers up really well and the only thing I may have trouble with from time to time is spreading the product evenly and the little fallouts it causes.</li>
    <li> Purchased the product from Amazon to see if I get the same product or not, as I purchased from Caboki web store previously. As always package delivered on time and the container has come in a different shape (thinner and taller) than the one I purchased from Caboki store. However, it contains the same content and it&#x27;s been a month testing the new shaped bottle container.&lt;br /&gt;Caboki as always did the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff saved me!  Seriously!  As a female in her 20s- caboki saved my self-esteem.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, and gives the illusion of hair- of course all my friends new I was using it because I told them- and they could see a huge difference, and they agree you can&#x27;t tell. I think it works better with longer hair- because it has more hair fiber to hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to everyone dealing with hair loss- and have spread the word!</li>
    <li> The 25 g bottle is not completely full and does not last the 75 days as Cabooki claims...I have a small thinning on the back of my head and the bottle will last about two weeks.. very unhappy..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too expensive for the little bit that is put in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I loved Caboki before but now with the &amp;#34;new packaging&amp;#34; they changed the formula. They claim their product is the same but therr is a significant difference and it is also causing itching on the scalp.  The powder blows off with wind vs. the old one that would still stay on. I hope they go back to their original formula.</li>
    <li> I received the free sample from the main website, and I thought... heck it was free so I would give it a try.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, and nothing worked.  This doesn&#x27;t grow your hair but it makes it appears darker and thicker.  I&#x27;ve been told by many people that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m balding at all.  Keep in mind I have a VERY noticeable bald spot on the back of my head with a FEW strands of hair.  It&#x27;s about 2 1/2 inches around.  Also i use it in the front of my hair, as there is an almost semi circle that I cover up with this as well.  The only thing I have to do is after I put it on, I spray everything with hair spray and it stays all day long.  You can even touch it with your hands and nothing comes off.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I usually wear a hat, but sometimes when I can&#x27;t and have to wear a suit that is when I use it.  This way it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with some hair loss over a period of about 5 years, and had been using brown eye shadow in the front to make myself feel better. I just got a sample, and have used it twice, both in front and on the crown of my head and am totally amazed and happy with the results. I don&#x27;t care how long it lasts; one day at a time is far better than the thinning look to me. It matches my hair color very well and I am happy. There&#x27;s a place for thinning, but it&#x27;s not on my head!!! Thank you for making me feel better. Now for a better price~~~</li>
    <li> Bull s***, do NOT by it guys, you are beautiful without this s***.</li>
    <li> Really works quite well.  The price is better than at their website.  Just make sure to pat your hair down to once you apply and no need to apply too much.</li>
    <li> conseals if you are only thinning. I don&#x27;t know how it works on people with less hair.</li>
    <li> this product is a LIE! or either it only work for white men. it wipes right off with ur finger tips soon as u apply it!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Nothing negative. Very practical. Very easy application, less than 5 mins. After 2 wks use, no one has noticed, &#x27;tho self confidence has tremendously increased. Make it a point to have 1 extra tube handy at all times.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold on in wet conditions. Otherwise, this is good.</li>
    <li> WORKS LIKE MAGIC!&lt;br /&gt;CONCEPT EXACTLY LIKE MAKE-UP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been gradually losing hair since I was 23 or so. It was at a very slow rate but there was a noticeable difference. I should genetically bald by my mid 30s. I used minoxidil 5% for more than a year and it worked but it has come to the point where I couldn&#x27;t stand the itchiness. So a friend had a sample of Caboki which I tried and it worked like a charm; it looked like I had a full head of hair. I was amazed. This is perfect for men who are in the beginning stages of balding and who are saving for a more permanent solution.</li>
    <li> I was given an unused  sample and did some research on the web, this product contains Silica When inhaled, silica dust can cause silicosis, cancer and increases the risk of Tuberculosis, good luck :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  Only draw back is it&#x27;s a little messy.</li>
