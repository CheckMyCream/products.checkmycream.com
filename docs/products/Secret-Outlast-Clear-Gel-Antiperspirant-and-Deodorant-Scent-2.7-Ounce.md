<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t think this would dry as well as a solid but it does! I received this as a BzzAgent and I have to say I would have never tried it otherwise! I love that you really can&#x27;t see it after it dries. I am really self-conscious about that. It has great odor protection with a nice clean scent. This product lasts all day as well. I am a busy, busy Mom, so, I need it to go as long as I do during the day!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for the first time today and pleasantly pleased. I usually apply my deodorant after I put my shirt on to avoid getting white marks on my shirt, but this morning I applied it before I put my shirt on and was happy to see there were no white marks on my shirt! The scent smells great and it has lasted all day plus kept me dry. I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Really Does Outlast other Deodorants! I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks and dries fast and now I have finally found it! I got a sample from BzzAgent in the Completely Clean scent and it really smells great! I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out!</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant! It smells nice but not overpowering and keeps me nice and dry. I received a sample on Bzzagent to try it out and tell everyone what I thought. Im impressed. I normally go for the expensive clinical strength stuff but no more! I will be purchasing this from now on :)</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant available.  I&#x27;ve used it for some time now and it&#x27;s the only brand for me.  First, I love that it is gel and not stick.  The sticks always hurt me because they pull my skin so the gel is wonderful. Second, there are no white marks to worry about and no folding your shirt to protect against it either.  Third, the protection is great.  I stay fresh smelling and dry all day without any worries otherwise. Lastly, the deodorant comes in a collection of smells that I find very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample from BzzAgent to review the product however I have been using this product and only Secret Outlast for quite awhile now.</li>
    <li> Received this deoderant as a BzzAgent free trial to provide feedback.  Not usually a fan of gel but really like the Outlast.  And I LOVE the fresh scent - not too much either.  I just wish it was a little cheaper.  However, I love the product so will be glad to purchase in the future with coupons or when on sale.</li>
    <li> I love it, no more white steaks, woot!</li>
    <li> Being a busy mom of 4 boys I&#x27;m always on the go.  I&#x27;ve always had issues with underarm sweat especially in stressful situations(which tends to be often these days)...  Trying to get through the grocery store while my 2 year old is having a tantrum and throwing things, rushing to get my 7 year old to basketball practice or games, trying to nurse my newborn and homeschool my 4 year old...  I no longer have to worry about sweat stains or if my deodorant will fail me.  I was sent a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Before trying this I would swear all day intill I would have sweat patching under my armpit. Using this product was life changing now I don&#x27;t have the embarrassing sweat patches and I don&#x27;t sweat as much throughout the day I just love it....</li>
    <li> I received a promotional bottleof Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel  and coupons to pass out to my friends, and  after trying this I would not use anything else. It leaves no white marks on my clothing, and has no sticky nor slippery feeling. It works for 48 hours and I think it is simply the best.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free from Secret.&lt;br /&gt;Being female and having had issues for years with the deodorants&lt;br /&gt;on the market for women not working, I was skeptical of this&lt;br /&gt;products results. I had even resulted in using a men&#x27;s brand as&lt;br /&gt;out of all I&#x27;d tried, it proved most effective. After showering&lt;br /&gt;I applied Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. At first&lt;br /&gt;it felt a little wet but quickly dried. By the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that indeed I had no white marks on&lt;br /&gt;my shirt and even more important, I was odor free. No more&lt;br /&gt;smelling a bit manly for this women! I&#x27;m definitely sold&lt;br /&gt;on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding the right deodorant because I have thyroid problems which causes you to sweat more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free through Bzzagent and it is a great! I  love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks and makes me feel fresh all day long.  Secret worked very well, it dried very fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> I normally use solid deodorant but I&#x27;m a bzzagent and i got picked for this campaign to give a report on how well a product is. Secret clear gel deodorant smells wonderful and it definitely has the protection. I just don&#x27;t like the feeling of it still being wet under my arm.if your looking for the long protection this is definitely the one to purchase.  I want to thank secret for sending me this item. I #GOTITFREE from secret.</li>
    <li> I have tried clear deodorant in the past and it made my armpits feel wet for a long time and I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was working very well. The new Secret clear outlast 48 hour protection not only has the benefits of no deodorant marks on my clothes but it also protects me all day!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast clear gel is the best deodorant that I have ever used ,it keeps you dry, it dries fast is never sticky and does not leave white marks I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so picky when it comes to deodorant. I was very excited to be given the chance to test Clear Gel Secret Outlast Completely clean as part of a per-motion for the brand!! I was so surprised when I found out the actual &amp;#34;secret!&amp;#34; It has a clear odor and never leaves any white stuff or stains. I&#x27;m sick of the white stuff all over my clothes! I am thrilled to have tried this out because now i&#x27;m switching from Dove to Secret and you should too!! #SecretFan #GotItFree #FreeProductFromBZZAGENT</li>
    <li> First time using the clear gel, Used less and smells good, no powder stains.2 thumbs up got it free from bzz agent</li>
    <li> Ok for a gel, but I&#x27;m used to solids. When I first used it, it went on wet and uncomfortable. It dried quickly, and was great fighting odor during my workout.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I was received  this product by BzzAgent  for free. I love it. It is dry in seconds and eliminated that whole white streak issue. I would tell you to try it out. It is really great!</li>
    <li> Received this as a promotion. I don&#x27;t normally do the gel but am very impressed so far. Still smells fresh at the end of a long day and really happy with this deodorant!</li>
    <li> Wow!  What a difference!  I used to have to reapply my deodorant after I got home from work, before my kids and I went on a walk or played outside....not anymore!  It is still working the next day even!  The ONLY one that doesn&#x27;t leave me with white marks on my clothes either.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love the fast-drying formula of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. I am so impressed with the completely clear odor and wetness protection.  It also does not leave you sopping wet after you put it on. I am now living without any fear of white marks :) It dries even faster than I expected.  Love this deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Love Secret Outlast Completely Clean. I received the secret outlast for free from BZZAGENT #GotItFreefromSecret  . I love how fast it dries and  how clear it is.I don&#x27;t get white flacks under my arms and it smells great. Ive been using it for almost a week and still am very pleased with the way it has been working for me during my workouts and everyday life.I normaly wear dark tank tops when working out and ive also noticed that I have no more white edges around the tank under my arm from previous ones. Thanks for making a fresh smelling  and fast drying  deodernat6 that actually works for me!!</li>
    <li> First off, let me say, I received a free sample of this product.    Definitely does not last 48 hours.  Odor protection did not even last 8 hours for me.  Also when you apply product you have to hold your arms up because the gel goes on wet and does not dry immediately.  If you put on a shirt right after the Secret gel then your shirt will be wet.  While there are other Secret products I really like this is not one of them. :(</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from BzzAgent.  I have used it before and will continue to.  I love that it leaves no white marks and it really does protect.  There was no need to re-apply throughout the day and I used it for the first time on an exceptionally stressful day at work.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry and is super easy to use.  Definitely will recommend this!</li>
    <li> It DOES work for 48 hours, no lie about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant to use it at first, because I usually use a solid, because I hate drying time, and stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came out of its container in a gel like form, and I was nervous, but it dried VERY quickly. It says apply 2-3 clicks, I&#x27;m not sure I would use 3, a lot comes out in each click once you get it going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent product!</li>
    <li> I normally use aerosol cause stick deodorant never gives me the protection I need and leaves me smelling. After trying this product I am in love with it!! It goes and clear and doesn&#x27;t leave  you feeling wet and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks.  It provided the all day odor protection I needed.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Goes on clear and smells great! I have been using Secret for years and this is by far the best. Just swipe and go. Dry time is quick and I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my shirts.....finally.</li>
    <li> #GotItFree&lt;br /&gt;My Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel showed up just in time... for me to have my baby! I received it on Monday, tried it Tuesday morning and then I went into labor! I have used Secret Solid stick deodorant for many years, but I really believe that this deodorant will be the reason I switch! It really held up under the pressure, and I was very happy with how long it lasted!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and takes just 1 click.  It dries super fast, and left no white marks on the black shirt I was wearing!&lt;br /&gt;I know this deodorant can hold up to extreme circumstances, so I am more than confident it will be a great choice for every day as well!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Great deodorant for runners!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also no white marks on the dark clothes and it keeps me dry and odor free for a long time!</li>
    <li> I received this  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear free to try and I love it. It goes on smooth and dries super fast, and leaves no white marks. Kept me fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free product from BzzAgent but let me tell you....it is amazing!!  I used it for the first time after I had shaved my armpits and it was like a soothing cooling gel.  It felt so nice and it smells absolutely AMAZING!!  This is my new go to Antiperspirant.  I LOVE IT!!  Everyone should try it!!  AMAZEBALLS!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast from the company.  I was very skeptical that it would actually work for 48 hours like it claims but was pleasantly surprised that it worked even when I exercised.  It is also nice to have the clear gel so you don&#x27;t get white marks all over your clothes.  The only problem I have is it seems like you have to wait for it to dry because it feels wet when you first put it on.</li>
    <li> Best clear gel deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. Complete 48 hour protection without leaving you feeling sticky. I received my sample as a promotional test and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Great product. I got this product from bzzagent (#GotItFree). This product works. I tried it today while walking under the blazing sun. I felt protected, I smelled good :) I like the fact the product is truly mess free and the gel is absorbed pretty quick so you avoid feeling wet. For the price- it is a great value- combine it with a coupon and you got yourself a great product.</li>
    <li> I received a free full sized product for participating in a BzzCampaign.  I usually stick with the regular powder-type antiperspirant, since it&#x27;s cheaper and seems to work okay for me.  However, in trying the clear gel, I&#x27;ve decided I really like it as well.  This product dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the slimy feel like the powder does.  It smells great, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product advertises up to 48 hours of protection, so I decided to put it to the test.  It did work for me for almost that long.  After about 48 hours, the fresh scent started to wear away and let some odor through, but my underarms were still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a lot of black undershirts, so I get the obnoxious white marks that never go away, even with a good washing.  It&#x27;s nice to know with something like this I can wear my black shirts and not have to worry about ruining my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that some people had a difficult time getting it to dry.  It worked just fine for me, but I should note that I live in a pretty dry climate.</li>
    <li> The Secret Outlast Completely Clean &amp; Clear Gel has a very nice scent, love that it leaves No white marks &amp; lasts a long time.. But it takes more than seconds to dry &amp; feels sticky for about 30 min.</li>
    <li> 95% of my wardrobe is the color black, with white marks. I received this as a promotion and I did not have high hopes. I honestly thought that I was only able to wear soft solid formulas because of the protection that I require, I sweat fairly excessively.... The only deodorant I have ever been satisfied with, before this Secret Outlast Clear Gel, was Secret Clinical Strength. The Clinical formula is fabulous, but it will leave white marks on just about everything. .... I will have to say that this Secret Outlast does the job with odor and wetness protection! I am very pleased with the scent and how long it last. The only con is that it does burn for about a second when applying right after shaving.</li>
    <li> I received my full size Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant as part of a promotional campaign to give my feedback on the product after I have out it to my personal test. The Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is awesome! It smells fresh and clean, keeps me dry even after exercising, and dries fast. I wear a lot of black clothing for work, so not having to worry about any deodorant smudges is a great thing. Try it!!</li>
    <li> I got my Secret free from Bzzagent.com.  I actually liked it.  It didn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothing and it had a really fresh scent.  I didn&#x27;t like how the deodorant didn&#x27;t come up thru all the little holes, but that is ok...I would get it again.</li>
    <li> #gotitfree from bzzagent to try out. I really like the quick drying clear gel. I had never tried gel deoderant before, but found it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t stain my clothes. I can go all day and smell fresh as I did when I put it on. I really like the lack of scent as I have sensitive skin. This did not give me a rash as other deoderants have. #clearlybetter</li>
    <li> I receive my Secret Outlast Completely Clean  Clear Gel Antiperspirant from BzzAgent  which is a program that let&#x27;s you test products for free. Love it. Even though it is a gel and goes on wet it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t leave the white marks on my black uniforms. You know the ones you don&#x27;t find until your out in public. I work a 12 hour shift and felt dry all through the shift and still had enough protection to spend 30 minutes on the treadmill after work. I like the scent, not too overpowering. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it. I am a fan of Bzzagent.com. I got Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free. Thanks Bzzagent.com gave me a chance to try this great product. I have been using it for almost two weeks now. I love the scent of it because i don&#x27;t like strong smell stuff. Also, it does not leave white mark when I use it for my under arm. This product really lasts the whole day for me that I do not have to re-putting again under my arm. I would defiantly would recommend to my friends to try the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> I received this through the bzzagent campaign and was excited to try it, but I immediately noticed that the scent was just too strong.  I have a 8 month old baby so I tried not to wear anything too perfume-y since his nose is really sensitive and sneezes a lot if I wear anything too strong.  Sure enough, he kept sneezing when I was holding him while using this deodorant.  I also didn&#x27;t like how sticky it was.  Once dried, I could feel my armpit being sticky ...  :(</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve never been a fan of secret but after trying this one I&#x27;m sold. This formula is great it glides clear and dries quickly.  It kept me dry and smelling good all day without staining my clothes.   I&#x27;m a BZzAgent and I got this item free to test and give my honest opinion.  #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I tried out Secret Outlast and loved it. I felt like it covered better than solid deodorants and no more white marks! I also felt like it kept me from perspiring, even when exercising or outdoors and I smelled fresh throughout the day. I replaced my other deodorant with the Secret Outlast after being able to try the product free. The scent is very pleasant and is subtle.</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this deodorant. At first I was a little skeptical about trying a gel b/c I didn&#x27;t think it would provide as much protection as a solid, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only did this deodorant NOT leave white marks on clothing, but it also kept me dry throughout the day.  I didn&#x27;t have to worry about embarrassing sweat stains.  The double bonus is the fact that I really enjoyed the nice scent of this deodorant.  This is actually the first gel deodorant that I will be purchasing a second time around! I received it as part of a promotion and am glad I participated.</li>
    <li> I have been a strong believer in clinical deodorants for quite sometime.  When I received this offer to try secret clear gel for free I was a little apprehensive.  The first day I tried it I was pleasantly surprised. I felt odor free all day and it worked just as great.  I didn&#x27;t have any white marks which was sometimes a problem with my other deodorant. I felt dry all day. I would definitely continue to use this in the future!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean scent for free to try courtesy of Secret and BzzAgent.com , which does not really smell like anything, but it blocks bad odor well for 48 hours. I am a mom who works from home and I am constantly on my feet, running up and down stairs all day, and running errands. Often don&#x27;t have time to freshen up before I head out. With this deodorant I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweating or odor. It&#x27;s available in clear gel, invisible solid, and smooth solid. I received the clear gel which goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue after it dries which some clear gels will leave gunk behind. I hate feeling like I gunk on my pits The skin under my arms feels soft and moisturized. Also I want to improve the appearance of the skin under my arms. I am hoping after a month from of using this product I will see some improvement of my skin. Yes deodorant needs to diminish wetness and odor, but some products cause damage to the skin. If my skin darkens or becomes uneven I won&#x27;t use the product anymore. It comes in a few scents; Protecting powder, sport fresh, unscented, and completely clean , which I had received. I don&#x27;t feel like it has a scent to it, so I am curious to what unscented smells like. The back label states that turning the bottom 2-3 clicks to apply the product as needed. I find that one click works just as well as 2 and 3 clicks is too much products. I also only have to apply the product once a day. Removing the product during a shower is pretty easy as well. A lot of other clear gel brands leave a residue and build up as well as block moisture making it hard to remove.  I would at this point recommend this product .</li>
    <li> This works great! It provided the best protection that I have used thus far. It performs just as the label indicates. Not all deodorants and antiperspirant aren&#x27;t able to back up their claims because of the lack of their products performance. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a full 5 star rate is because of the aluminum that is among the ingredients used. It has been said that it may be a cause for breast cancer in women. I will still use the product because it works very well, but not as much... just as the same with any other deodorant/antiperspirant that contains aluminum. I have a deodorant that does not contain it and will alternate its usage and which will depend on my activity level and need. Hopefully in the near future, Secret will be able to create a formula that works just as well without aluminum...as most companies are actively removing ingredients that their customers are not in favor of.&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent and have received this product for frees as a promotion for the brand.</li>
    <li> I had never tried a gel before this secret outlast but I found I love it.  it has a great smell to it that you notice through the day.  I don&#x27;t have odor or wetness.  the gel dries fast and I don&#x27;t have to wait to put on clothes.  no white marks either.  so in my book my old deodorant is a thing of the past and secret is now replacing it.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d this as a free sample from BzzAgent.  Glad I got it since it introduced me to the product!  While the gel is a little stickier than what I prefer, it seems to dry fairly fast.  It definitely works.  I&#x27;m usually the first one to sweat in a stress situation and, I have to say, this product definitely protected.  The scent is a little weak but some people prefer that.  Overall, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this deodorant.  It felt great, smelled great, and did its job all day.  It also didnt leave marks on my clothes which is always an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I have to say I am loving this product.  The fresh and clean scent is awesome.  I have tried it with many different outfit colors and a am still to see any white marks or residue.  The formula is fantastic my husband even uses it every now and then.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to feel fresh and clean all day long.</li>
    <li> Buzzagent sent me this to try for free. I normally by Secret and avoid Dove (Dove causes my arm pits to itch so I walk around looking like I am imitating a monkey because I am scratching my pits) I typically use a solid and get frustrated with putting on Tank tops and Cami&#x27;s and look down to see white marks on the side. The idea of a gel that goes on clear was appealing. The first thing I noticed was the scent, it was pleasant and not overwhelming and strong. It was very irritating to have to click it so many times in order to bring it to the top. By the time you got it up if felt like you had used half the container. Its been rather warm lately and the deodorant held up for me. It did seem to take much longer to dry so I would get out of the shower and put it on then dry off and walk around looking for clothes allowing it time to dry. It does not seem to last nearly as long as a solid. I put deodorant on at night before bed and in the morning after my shower. I have a huge fear of smelling bad lol! I dont think I will be switching over anytime soon due to it not lasting quit as long.</li>
    <li> i really like this....it smells great....it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on my shirt....and it works....it lasts all day!!!!  Thank you :)</li>
    <li> i got this deodorant  in a kit from BzzAgent was very excited to try this. I was kind of worried because of trying something new. the deodorant did work and smelled fresh. Though the thing i was not excited about it was putting this deodorant is the wet feel under my arms.No problem! most of my  wardrobe is dark colors so I have to be careful to avoid the white marks of my antiperspirant and deodorants. Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel left no white lines on my clothing, while also providing perfect odor protection. Thumbs up for protection i will continue to use this until this is gone and i will continue to tell my all about this.</li>
    <li> I normally hate gel deodorants but after receiving Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free to try I&#x27;m hooked. It dries within seconds and the scent is great and last all day!!!</li>
    <li> This is great if you are used to using a gel deodorant. It does give great odor protection and leave no white residue on clothes. I just can&#x27;t get past the wet stick feeling that all gels give me. I was hoping this would be different, but it wasn&#x27;t. I got it to try as part of BzzAgent, so I was optimistic about it and hoping I could give it a great review, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I got this Secret Outlast for free via Bzzagent and I am torn on this product.  The pros for me - I love the scent and you definitely don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks, but the cons are it makes me feel slimy, not dry and even at one click at a time this doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as a solid.  Wish I could have the best of both worlds!</li>
    <li> I really love this product! First of all, white marks was a huge problem in my cloth and in my car. With this deodorant never again. Then, a bad smell at the end of the night problem... with this deodorant never again!!!!! I try this product because the brand send it to me as a promotion and I really love it    I just love this deodorant :D</li>
    <li> The packaging is easy to open and the deodorant dispenses well. The smell is a little strong though and doesn&#x27;t smell very feminine. It would be nice to have a little fragrance, either flowery or perfume like. The deodorant does feel a little wet when it goes on and I don&#x27;t think it dries as quickly as I expected. It took about 45 seconds before I felt that I could put on my shirt and not transfer any deodorant to the fabric. It was great that there weren&#x27;t any white marks on my clothes when I took them off at the end of the day. Also, it did keep me very dry and I think that the protection lasted all day. I do still like  my other Secret with the baby powder fragrance. I received a sample as part of a promotion from the brand. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast as a part of a promotion from the brand and these are my honest opinions on the product. It really really works! totally glides on smooth, feels great and also leaves no whites marks! This product can be found anywhere and it&#x27;s cost is worth it because you want to buy a product that truly works!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a clear gel deodorant probably since the early 2000s, while attending formal dances, because they simply didn&#x27;t live up to their promises. I felt sticky and uncomfortable when I applied other gel deodorants, and often noticeably sweat through. With Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, this is not the case! So far, I am very happily surprised with how much I like this product. The first thing I noticed was the great scent the deodorant has. It did take a little while to dry on my skin, but since then, I&#x27;ve been totally dry and feeling fresh. I haven&#x27;t felt that sticky feeling that I used to hate about other gels. There aren&#x27;t any marks on my clothing. I&#x27;m glad to have the chance to try this product as a free promotion from Secret and will definitely consider buying in future.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I stopped using clear gel deodorant years ago, but decided to give Secret Outlast a try.  The gel dries quickly and is not sticky.  I do enjoy the scent that is pleasant without being overwhelming and too strong.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this deodorant (Secret Outlast Clear Gel) for FREE for being a BzzAgent. I found it to be effective in keeping underarm odor at bay. However, I didn&#x27;t really care for the wet feeling I got on my underarms after applying it. It&#x27;s really cold, too! I didn&#x27;t notice any white marks on my clothes from it, so that&#x27;s a plus. Not sure I&#x27;d switch from my solids to use it.</li>
    <li> I got this free from BzzAgent and am pretty impressed.  I usually don&#x27;t wear gel because it feels wet and slimy all day.  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear drys pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling gross.  I work out 4 days a week and this stuff definitely stands up to heavy sweating and does not leave any white marks on my clothes.  I would suggest not using after shaving because it does have some kind of alcohol in it that helps with the fast drying.  Overall I&#x27;m going to start wearing this instead of the paste that clumps under the arm.</li>
    <li> The Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel definitely keeps you dry all day long, but its scent is a bit much. I felt like every time I moved my arms I was overcome by a perfume cloud that announced to the world that I was indeed wearing deodorant. If scent doesn&#x27;t bother you, then you&#x27;ll enjoy how it keeps you dry and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this as a sample thanks to BzzAgent. All opinions are mine.)</li>
    <li> I had been using Old Spice deodorant all Summer because I&#x27;m pregnant and had been sweating profusely.  Unfortunately, I could not find anything that was strong enough to handle my sweat so I was forced to use my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; deodorant, mush to his dismay.  That is until I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent!  This has kept me completely dry and free of odor!!!  Not to mention my black shirts haven&#x27;t been ruined by white marks.  I have renewed confidence in knowing that I&#x27;m fresh and dry all day even though my body is hard at work making a tiny one and I sweat like crazy!  Thanks Secret!</li>
    <li> I received a stick of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free so that I could try it out and share my opinions. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I am impressed by its&#x27; odor and wetness control. There was a bit of a learning curve for me, figuring out how much product to dispense and apply (at first I used way too much and my armpits were squishy for a while), but now I realize I can use just a small amount, and it dries quickly. I like that there is no chance of white marks on my clothes because it goes on clear and dries clear. I even gave it the 48-hour test, to see if it held up to its&#x27; claims of &amp;#34;48-hour protection&amp;#34; and was amazed that it did! 48 hours later and I had no odor and no dampness at all!  I normally use the basic Secret Powder Fresh stick, but I will definitely be using Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel in the future.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Complete for free through Bzzagent. I have been using it for the past couple of weeks and must say I am very pleased with the quality. I have used Secret deodorants in the past but usually they are scented, usually fruity. This has a very fresh, clean scent. It keeps me dry better than the others I have used before.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me by Bzzagent to review. My deodorant usually stops working about half way through the day.  This can be embarrassing!  I tried this deodorant and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It REALLY works.  I usually shower every day, but once in awhile, I skip a day.  It really does last for two days and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  It dries VERY fast and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes. I wear a lot of black and this is really important to me.  I&#x27;ll be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> Goodbye white streaks on my dark clothes!  I had always used white deo until I was given a free sample of Secret Clear Gel... and while I was worried about \\&quot;drying\\&quot; I was beyond impressed with how quickly it absorbed and drying was not an issue.  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is now my go to deo and a no brainer when wearing dark clothes!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is a great item to have when it&#x27;s time to work out! It goes on clear &amp; dries quickly which is great if you&#x27;re like me, rushing to the gym after work! No messy white marks on your clothes, great protection that lasts beyond your workout! Best of all, I was able to #TryItFree being a #BzzAgent. Thanks @BzzAgent &amp; @Secret!!!</li>
    <li> I tried a gel deoderant a long time ago and swore off them because of how long it took to dry. When I got this one to try for free I was surprised how quickly it dried. It does a great job of keeping me dry as well. Only thing I would change is the fragrance. It is a little strong.</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent member and I received the secret outlast clean to try for free. I was happy and excited in the beginning because I thought it would be great to change my deodorant. However, after I got the Secret Outlast I was more than less enthusiastic about it. I liked that it went on clear but it was very strong in smell. It smelled more like alcohol. I was very almost &amp;#34;knocked out&amp;#34; by the smelled. It was upset because I became irritated by the vapor even though, I used just a little of it. I had to give the secret Outlast away because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it. I think it is one of the worst Secret products that I have ever encountered. I don&#x27;t recommend this product because of the smell.</li>
    <li> after heavy workout still feel fresh, sweat free , really amazing results , love this product</li>
    <li> Got my free Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel from Bzz Agent. My daughter spotted it immediately and wanted to stake claim to it. While I told her she was more than welcomed to share use with me, it wasn&#x27;t to leave my bathroom. She went on to tell me that a friend of hers uses Secret Outlast in the gel form and has used hers as well. She continued as a spokesperson by telling me that gel form is much better than the solid form that I always use and that never ending white marks on our clothes would be a thing of the past. That right there was enough to convince me. Just as promised, it went on completely clean and was fast drying. It wasn&#x27;t all sticky and wet like the gels of the past. As far as actual protection throughout the day, it worked as well as other products that I have used. The biggest perk for me was that there was no white residue and wasn&#x27;t sticky and wet. It&#x27;s a product that I would definitely purchase in the future if the price was comparable to what I currently use.</li>
    <li> Along the way I have tried all types of deodorants and anti-antiperspirants. I received a BzzKit that contained a full-sized Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel to try for free and give my honest opinion. I have used the Secret Outlast gel since receiving it in hopes of it changing my mind about gel&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I have no pesky white marks on my clothes, but for me it was a process to get the gel to dry. When putting it on I had to wait before putting on my shirt.  I did not like the way the gel felt when it was still wet, it made me feel very sticky. I also only used 2 clicks. The scent was a clean fragrance until I started working out. Once I started to sweat, it produced a weird funk that made me want to wash off immediately. Needless to say, I never made it through 48 hours of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will not be purchasing this product for myself, but who knows, others may love it and it may work great with their body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel!  I received a free sample from BzzAgent to review.  The product goes on smoothly, dries in an instant, keeps me dry and odor free, and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothes.  What more could you want in a deodorant?  I even did some experimenting by rubbing the deodorant directly on different types of black fabric.  Never saw a streak!  I will say that this product doesn&#x27;t truly provide 48 hours of protection for me, but I don&#x27;t need it to.  Just two quick swipes after my morning shower and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this deodorant. I&#x27;m always skeptical of claims like \\&quot;48 hour odor protection\\&quot; since I tend to sweat a lot living in Florida. Although I haven&#x27;t attempted to test that claim by going without deodorant for 48 hours, I haven&#x27;t needed to reapply the deodorant at the end of the day as I usually must do with other deodorants. In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that I haven&#x27;t been sweating a lot from my armpits at all! That&#x27;s a huge win!    While the gel is pretty wet upon application, it dries fairly quickly. Even if it&#x27;s still a little wet when you put a shirt on, there&#x27;s at least no need to worry about white marks or any kind of deodorant stain.    I also really like the Completely Clean scent. I hate nothing more than deodorants that smell like baby powder, and for that reason I tend to buy deodorants with no scent. I would definitely buy this deodorant in the Completely Clean scent though.    **I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and BzzAgent, but all opinions are my own and I definitely plan on purchasing this in the near future</li>
    <li> I have used Secret products before, but not this particular one. I recently received this item due to a promotion from the brand requesting that I review and give my honest opinion. I&#x27;ve never had great luck with deodorant not showing on dark colored shirts by the end of the day before until trying this.  Invisible Solid NO MORE! I&#x27;m sticking with this completely clean clear gel from here on out. I am happy to say that this truly is completely clean with no marks and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my work shirts and yoga attire being streaked with deodorant anymore.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent to try for free and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the outlast gel for a few weeks.  I will say it definitely is great for no white marks.  It is one of the few deodorants that did not leave streaks all over my clothing as I was putting it on or throughout the day/night.  The scent was refreshing.  You could catch a whiff if you moved the right way.  For the most part I didn&#x27;t have problems with odor when I wore it.  But I noticed if I got really warm or was perspiring my underarms felt wet and you could tell is was masking the odor.  So while I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;, there was an undertone of something that made me feel like I needed to reapply.  My only other issue with it is it went on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.  As in I felt like I had to hold my arms out and wait for it to dry.  Even after it &amp;#34; dried&amp;#34; my underarms felt &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; for a while.  So although I never had white marks or had major odor issues, my underarms always felt moist which is just unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Great smell and non sticky gel. Had a long lasting result I was able to try this product for free by being a bzzagent but this wI&#x27;ll be a product that I continue to buy and use in the future</li>
    <li> I was given a sample to try out for BzzAgent and I love how the clear gel keeps me dry all day long. I am very impress with this product. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs all day long lasting drying protection.</li>
    <li> After recieving this product as a promotional product from Secret I can honestly say this deoderant is fabulouse. I have tried other clear gels before without success. Goes on clear and dries quite quickly. Great fragrance not over powering and it lasts no need to reapply before date nighr even after a very busy day of running after four kids!</li>
    <li> Goes on clear for sure. Good for normal underarm wetness but not ppl that sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> great product!! keeps feeling clean and fresh for extended time. dry feeling not a wet feeling. no strong fragrance to smell on your body later. would recommend to everyone. i&#x27;m thankful that i got the chance to try this product from Bzz agent for free. because now i found another deodarant option. i also lliked that i put it on after I shaved and manytimes the gel irritated my skin and this one doesn&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> The 48 hour protection that this claims, didn&#x27;t really work for me. There are no white marks produced, but there aren&#x27;t with any gel deodorants. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the wetness protection either, I did perspire while wearing this. This is a fine deodorant but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s anything special. It was nice to try as part of a promotion from this brand and to know that I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have a teenage daughter she tried the Secret Outlast Gel &amp; she wants me to start buying this brand instead of our current brand. She loves the soft scent &amp; there is no white marks left behind no icky feeling it dries in seconds &amp; she like the fact that with a couple of swipes it lasts longer. I&#x27;m proud to say I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand &amp; my daughter is very happy with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I received a full-size sample to try and I was definitely skeptical of another gel deodorant!  Let me tell you, it smells great and works fantastically with very little product.  It is not like other gel deodorants.  It dries quickly and lasts all day long.  You never get that sticky under arm feeling that you get with other gel deodorants!  I never ever experience white marks which make that a huge bonus! Secret Outlast has definitely won me over!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Secret Deodorant. In fact, I had a different version of their gel deodorant when I received it free from BzzAgent to test and review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of Outlast in the past, opting for the clinical strength of Secret or Dove deodorant at times that I&#x27;ve been under a lot of stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel deodorant was slightly different from the secret gel I was using when this arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this daily since it arrived and have noticed a few things: 1. I am dryer longer than I have been with past deodorants, 2. it does dry a little faster than other gel deodorants, though not quite as fast as they advertise, and 3. it left absolutely no marks on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m such a fan that I went and bought it again and now have one in reserve for when this stuff runs out. This is great stuff.</li>
    <li> I received this is a promotion in the mail I thought I&#x27;d give it a try I usually use the clear salad this clear gel was awesome I was afraid it would be feeling there is no stickiness know what feeling its dry and it keeps you fresh literally for 48 hours. I gave this a try and worked out went for a hike and some house work all in a few days with out refreshing and still smelt fresh! For that this will be my new go to!!!</li>
    <li> It really works for the 48hours even down here in the south.  I highly recommend this item.  I did get it for free to try it out through BZZagent.  I think it would be worth the money all around</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel free from Bzzagent and I must say this is so fast the first deodorant that does not leave white marks on my dark clothes. I like the scent which is not too sweet and the gel keep me dry all day. The only thing is that you have to use quite a bit for the oder protection to last all day. But since this gel dries fast, it is not a problem for me. I will recommend this!</li>
    <li> Got this item in a Bzzkit from Bzzagent and I have to say that I am loving this clear gel. Protects just as good as the solid Outlast and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue left behind.</li>
    <li> I received SecretOutlast as a promotion for the product. I am suppose to rate it and tell if I liked it. I started using it 4 days ago. I do like it so far. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. It definitely does the job it is designed to do.  It does have a strong scent. It is a pleasant scent but too much for a deodorant.  It smells like a nice body spray. I wish the scent wasn&#x27;t so overwhelming.  I would purchase this deodorant but couldn&#x27;t wear any body spray .</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Deodorant for free through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was honestly skeptical about the clear gel because I have used it in the past and have never liked it. It always feels super wet and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my free deodorant, I opened it up and was at first sniff, very pleasantly surprised by the scent. It is a very clean, fresh scent. My husband even liked it and has since complimented me on my smell, haha! He said it smells like a bathroom someone just took a shower in- soapy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy with how fast it dries, too. Within 30 seconds of putting it on, I no longer felt any wetness. It leaves no white residue since it&#x27;s clear, so nothing getting on my clothes (which happens to me ALL the TIME).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all- I am really happy with this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really love the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.  I love that I do not have any white marks on my clothes.  I love the amazingly fresh scent that lasts all day long.  I love the texture, does not feel sticky or leave a residue.  And it dries fast so I do not have to wait for it. #GotItFreefromSecret</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a clear gel, but got it and figured wth. I used it for the first time time when I had to take 4 children to an indoor Halloween Carnival. That is always a packed event and very hot n stuffy. It worked! I wasn&#x27;t stinky and soaked looking. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I just received this to try as a promotion from Secret and BzzAgent. I gotta say, I havent used gels in a while because they feel icky, I LOVE this, I love the feeling, the strength, the time it last as well as the smell!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is part of a campaign I am doing for free from Secret. I purchased Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel about two months ago for the first time.  I hate roll on deodorants and was hesitant in my purchase afraid the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel was going to be wet and sticky.  I wanted a deodorant that would not leave any white marks on my clothing and there were no other choices at the time.  At first the gel took some getting used to, but it really does dry extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;I have had good and bad luck with the Secret brand in the past, but this is definitely one of their better products.  The protection does last all day, it really does dry quick and not sticky, and unscented suits me perfectly.  I am allergic to many scented products, and even some that claim they are unscented but the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel does not bother me in the least. Secret products are always priced competitively or even slightly cheaper than other brands so this is an economical product as well.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of clear gels. But let me tell you, THIS ACTUALLY WORKS.  I received it for free as a promotion, so I figured I would give it a try.  I tested it through a day of work, an hour at the gym, and an afternoon playing with my 3 year old - not only did I stay bone dry, but there were no nasty marks on any of my clothes.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this to try, and overall I like it. I like the smell and the fact that it leaves no white marks! I&#x27;ve gone to the gym a few times since using it and it&#x27;s held up fine after working out, too.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the product and I&#x27;ve noticed that I still smell decent even after all day use and only using a small amount.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars for 2 reasons, 1.  This products uses aluminum which has shown in medical studies to increase risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.  I prefer organic products across the board. 2.  When you apply it, it feels very cold against the skin.  This deodorant would be best used in hot summer months because of its cooling effect. (Whether intentional or not).  Overall though does what it claims.  I also like the the bottle is see-through so you can see how much product is left before it needs replacing.</li>
    <li> I like this item.  I&#x27;ve had bad experience with gels before as they leave you feeling sticky and yuck (like you want to take a shower right away after applying it) but the Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t do that. I felt dry for most of the day. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to say for 48 hours but I didn&#x27;t reapply during the day like I normally do.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from secret to try it out. It worked much better than I expected. I usually avoid the gels due to the sticky feeling I have all day, but this was a little different. What better time to test antiperspirant out than during a busy day at work. I admit I first it did feel a little sticky, but then after drying completely that feeling was gone. I worked all day and felt clean and fresh even when I got home. I did see a few white smudges on my dress, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent free product promotion, I am smelling pretty sweet after trying out this deodorant. On the first day of use, I put it to the test but hiking through a corn maze with a group of scouts. It worked great and I was feeling and smelling after hours in the sun. Day two brought me playing for hours outside with my kids and then a marathon vacuuming session back home. I didn&#x27;t smell as sweet by the end, but it worked better than my usual product! Bottom line...I&#x27;ll happily switch over. The product works well and I don&#x27;t have to remember to check my shirt and rub out white marks from my old product. Word of warning...the dial is rather sensitive so it is easy to turn it a bit too much and get more product than you bargained for.</li>
    <li> I loved the Secret outlast clear gel.#clearlybetter I got to try for free thanks #secret I loved how fast it dried and worked great all day definitely would recommend:)</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying, I am not a fan of gel deodorant ! I hate that cold “clamy” feeling after applying it. The Secret Outlast Deodorant was sent to me from Bzzgent to try. I must say that I have changed my tune. I only applied a little bit because I don’t require that much underarm protection and it dried fairly quickly. It smelled great and I didn’t have to worry about that white streak being left on my shirt because I applied it at night and woke up fresh ! I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Great Deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this deodorant. I only wear Secret or Degree. Secret gives me the protection and odor control I need and also keeps white off my clothes. I love this particular deodorant because it made my underarms feel soft. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like gel deodorant, but this one is great! It smells wonderful, and is working better than my invisible solid ever did!! I was lucky enough to try this product for free as a promotion, but I will definitely buy this product in the future!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant to try. It was ok. The wetness protection was there but the odor protection wasn&#x27;t . After only a few hours, I could smell body odor. I use other secret products and they work better for me. This product dried pretty fast for a gel, went on easily, and smelled pretty good. I believe that different products work differently with different body chemistry so this might work great on others. Sadly, I will not be purchasing any .</li>
    <li> I tried out Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant recently from Bzzagent and overall it has been working pretty well. I tend to wear black a lot so I was impressed by the fact that there were no white marks on my clothes anymore. Before I used solid based deodorant and now I feel that some of the stains on my shirt won&#x27;t wash off anymore. So this is a great alternative. I tested it out by putting the gel on a black dress as you can see in the picture below. It did show moisture on the dress since I placed the gel directly on it but that is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for order protection, I give it 4 stars. It works well but it didn&#x27;t last 48 hours. However, do keep in mind that I have been packing to move cross country so with that put into consideration, it worked well. I excited to be taking this deodorant with me on my 3000 mile road trip next week!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as a free product to try from the brand. It definitely lasts, smells good, and prevents white marks. However, I feel it is a little too wet and sticky for my preference. I don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to dry.</li>
    <li> I have used Secret Clinical Strength for years with great success.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands with no success.  I was given Secret Outlast to try by the company and I&#x27;ve found a new wonderful antiperspirant. I didn&#x27;t believe the 48 hour claim, but I did go 48 hours with no problems.  The gel isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it dries very quickly.  Another review stated they were sticky all day, which I can&#x27;t imagine to be true.  The price is amazing for the protection that is offered.</li>
    <li> I love that this keeps me dry and it&#x27;s not sticky. I even put it on after getting dressed, no white marks!</li>
    <li> First off - I received a full size deodorant through BzzAgent to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I have always been a solid deodorant user.  But I am also always open to change for something better.  Once this is dry I think it is great.  It&#x27;s the drying time that is the problem.  It goes on cold and wet which is not the greatest feeling, especially as we are moving into cooler weather (maybe it would feel &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; in the summer).  I have been using it for a few weeks now, thinking I just had to get used to it being &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;.  If it really did dry in seconds as claimed that would be fine, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I am conscious of giving it time to dry, changing my dressing habits to put my shirt on last.  Even then I am usually not waiting long enough (as in I can still feel cool and wet) but I have to keep going.  I actually timed it and after 2.5 minutes I could still feel a little cool and sticky (and I am only using 2 clicks per pit and rubbing it in well with the applicator so I do not think I am over applying it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it is dry it is great at protection and the scent is light and clean.  And I have not seen one trace of a white mark on any clothing so that is great!  For anyone that is used to using a gel deodorant this one is great.  But if you have been a solid user it might be a tough switch.</li>
    <li> Bzzagent asked me if I would try Secret Outlast Complete Clean Sent Woman&#x27;s Clean gel. The word gel made me think cold and wet and a sticky all day feel. I Love Secret so lets give this new one a try, its free.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT and my thoughts have changed completely. It smells great, so fresh and clean. Not over powering at all. I am always dressing in a hurry as I have a toddler and small child. I don&#x27;t have time to wait for an antiperspirant to dry, i need to pull my shirt on an go. I am so happy to no longer worry about white marks on my shirt. I can pull on my top as it is drying and feel confident that it will dry clear.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to start buying this as my first choice antiperspirant, a number one choice for moms will little time to dress. No need to wait for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bzzagent for letting me try this for free amd pass on the word to others how much I love it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Bzzagent.  I have seen this product at my local store but I was skeptical that it would work. I have been using it for several weeks and I have switched deoderants. Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, does what it says. I love the protection it provides all day long. But what really sold me is that I can wear my tops/dresses and not worry about seeing white streaks left by my solid deoderant.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try out this antiperspirant/deodorant, and this is really a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lives up to its name in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;1. It dries very quickly. I see some reviewers saying that it takes a long time to dry, but I think it could be that they applied too much product. A little goes a long way, I only put on a little bit and it dries fast and last a long time (winter).&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks. I have proved this to be true by putting on a white shirt right after applying it. It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks, and doesn&#x27;t turn my white shirt yellowish.&lt;br /&gt;3. It helps me stay sweat free. This could be different for everyone, but I don&#x27;t really sweat that much to begin with, and I find myself fresh and dry throughout the day while wearing this product.&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t make my itch. Ok, now this is a weird reason to put in here, but seriously, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds of antiperspirant and 95% of them make my armpits itch!!!!! I think it could be my sensitive skin, but for a while I was uncomfortable wearing any antiperspirant because I would feel itchy. This one? It does NOT make me itch at all, and for this reason alone, I&#x27;d become a loyal user of this product. I&#x27;d recommend this to you if you have had similar experience as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so is this product perfect? Close. In my opinion, it really needs to tone down on the scent. This is a personal opinion, maybe some people really enjoy a lasting fresh scent, but to me it really smells way too strong. I find it sort of too overwhelming especially when I wear perfume, sometimes this conflicts with the perfume I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d continue to use this product and I&#x27;d for sure recommend this, but I personally would try out a different scent next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received product from Bzzagent. The review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant  as part of a promotion from Bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;for trying this product and writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Secret brand for years.  I used to use the stick, but I would end up with white lines on my clothes.  I switched to the clear gel a few years ago, and would not go back to anything else.  Secret has lots of different scents for the antiperspirant and some are really subtle, while some are just too strong to deal with.  I don&#x27;t use perfume or body mist.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Outlast two days ago, and (i really don&#x27;t go without for 48 hours) I did go 48 hours in between using.  The second day, I was as dry as the first.  I probably won&#x27;t make a habit of going without over 24 hours without using deodorant/ antiperspirant, I was dry and felt very confident that there was no odor.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was surprised by the gel. I thought I would hate it, I have always been a solid girl, but this was amazing. I liked how quickly the gel dried. Plus it really lasted. I felt fresh all day. Bonus that there was no residue on my clothing</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great deodorant. It is easy to apply, has a pleasant non overpowering smell, and dries quickly. I did not find that it kept me dry 24 hours, but it did keep me dry for most of the day.    DISCLOSURE: I was given this product as a sample to review</li>
    <li> I received this free as a promotional deal from Secret brand (bzzagent). I was a little reluctant to try the clear gel because in the past when I used clear gels they have caused me to have a rash and broken skin in my underarm area but this doesn&#x27;t do that at all. It has a great scent and works better than the Dove I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of years. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is legit! I work 12-hr shifts as a nurse on an extremely heavy floor and this product keeps me dry and smelling super fresh! When I received my free product in the mail from Secret as part of their promotion I was apprehensive because I haven&#x27;t had good experience with the longevity of clear gels in the past. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! I have a very sensitive nose so the smell of a products is very important to me and the scent of this products is very feminine and fresh, but not overpowering. I also had absolutely NO white marks on my navy scrubs, which is definitely a first. This product definitely works better than the solid I was using before and I WONT be going back! If you are a hard worker this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first.  It didn&#x27;t seem like a product I would like.  But It has worked really well for me.</li>
    <li> This was the first time that I have tried gel, and I LOVE it.  This is by far one of the best deodorants.</li>
    <li> Great product! Did not find it sticky. Was able to try it for free from the buzzagent promotion!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good. Absorbs fast and leave no trace, anywhere!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  It didn&#x27;t leave streaks on my clothes which i don&#x27;t care for.  I didn&#x27;t feel sweaty after a long day at work so it provided the protection that you expect from a product like this.  I really like the secret brand and after using this product I will continue to use this brand.  I did have to wipe off the excess on the bottle after I used it so it wouldn&#x27;t get messy.  It worked the way a deoderant should work and that is important.  I did receive this item as a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean scent in the mail free as part of a trial. I must say that it is living up to its no white marks and 48 hour odor protection. I had my reservations because most deodorants have some sort of claim about being the best and I have tried most of them. I definitely recommend that this product be given a chance. To top it off the clean scent is not over powering but also powerful enough for you to notice.</li>
    <li> I would fully recommend this product. It smells great and goes on easily without leaving stains! It will keep you feeling fresh all day</li>
    <li> I was given a sample to try and I was sceptical for sure. I&#x27;ve always hated gel deodorant because of the wet sticky feeling it leaves. Well I can tell you that whatever Seceret did with this formula is a true winner! It dries right away, smells awesome, and keeps me dry and white Mark free. I really do love it, and will make this my new deodorant of choice!</li>
    <li> I found lots of good things about Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel which I got for free from BzzAgent. And I found a few that I do not like so much.&lt;br /&gt;1) I am not used to the gel type deodorant. Once I got used to waiting for it to dry, I liked it better. But I have to say that the gel does take a little while to dry. You can&#x27;t be in a big hurry to get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;2) It did not keep me completely dry all the time. There was a day at work when I overdressed a bit in a long sleeve shirt and blazer, and even with the blazer off, I was sweating and this did not keep me totally dry. But, thankfully, I did not smell anything.&lt;br /&gt;3) It does not leave white marks. It really is completely clear. This is very good because I don&#x27;t like worrying about white marks when putting on a shirt in the morning, or worse finding them after I put the shirt on and am at work.&lt;br /&gt;4) I don&#x27;t really like clicking the stuff up every time. Many times it seems to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; back down and I have to click way more than 2 or 3 times. Once I thought it was broken but it turned out I was just compressing the gel inside it and finally it did start coming up again. But it is not really full at all when you first get it. There is about 2/3 left once I have compressed all the gel. I am not sure that this makes it a good value as it seems to be a lot of wasted space.&lt;br /&gt;5) Scent is good. I like the completely clean scent a lot. It could be a little lighter but overall, it&#x27;s a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;6) The big issue I have with it is that it contains aluminum and I try to avoid products with aluminum that are applied to the body. After I finish it up, I will most likely go back to Deodorant only and skip the antiperspirants with aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product if you want to stay dry and not sweat (much).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m leaving this review after receiving this as a free sample for being a BzzAgent. Honestly, I&#x27;m usually a Degree girl but I wanted to try something new and the opportunity presented itself. So here&#x27;s what I thought...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore Secret Outlast for around 38 of the 48 hour protection it offers. And it lasted! I still felt dry and I was odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no white marks found after using this product. And my armpits felt fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I didn&#x27;t feel the need to swipe it on over and over.</li>
    <li> I received secret clear gel outlast in completely clean scent from bzzagent to try for free.I really like the product it does work for 48 hours if there&#x27;s an unscented version I will buy again and again. Not a fan of this scent it is too strong. I am really sensitive to smells but my husband even noticed it and said I should wash it off.</li>
    <li> Got it free to try and review and I kind of feel bad giving it 4 stars, so I&#x27;ll start with why I deducted...I don&#x27;t like the way the gel feels when being applied- it is cold and my underarms feel wet for a few minutes and it does have a bit of a burn if you just shaved.  Now on to the good remarks, the scent is pleasant, although a little strong initially, it dissipates quickly though. I can&#x27;t attest to the 48 hours since I wasn&#x27;t doing a lot of high energy, stress (things that make you sweat) activities within a 48 hour frame of wearing and it is very chilly outside.  I did wear this during a 5K and there was no smell or sweat so that&#x27;s a plus for sure. i would recommend this, especially if you like/prefer gels!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is really a step back.  While, as advertised, it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, that&#x27;s about the only positive about this product.  For the record I did receive this as part of a BzzAgent campaign but had I purchased this I would have returned it to the store for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The size of the product is misleading.  I had to turn the knob on the bottom a ton to get the product up to the top - at least a quarter of an inch but probably more like one half.  That&#x27;s a lot of wasted space and while the product label does display the amount of product I doubt most people read that and go off the size of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The scent is very overpowering.  I have switched deodorants in the past and find there is an adjustment period of a few days where I find the scent to be strong because I am not used to it but I have used this product for over two weeks and still find it gives me a headache.  I don&#x27;t want to stink but I also don&#x27;t want others to be able to smell my deodorant and if it&#x27;s this strong to me I&#x27;m sure others can smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*When applying the product it is very cold and slimy and makes me feel clammy until it dries which takes way too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The formula must contain a lot of alcohol in it because it has seriously dried my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Move along in the deodorant aisle and find something else.  There are tons of better products both within the Secret line and made by other manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret, go back to the drawing board.  This one is a dud.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Xtend is a great deodorant. It dries quickly, no messy wetness like with other gel deodorants. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes - huge plus! And it keeps me dry and fresh. I live in sticky, hot, and humid Florida and it works great here. I received a sample of this deodorant as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a BzzAgent kit.  I usually use solid deodorant.  I have used the clear gels in the past and they never dried  and they never provided the odor protection I was expecting.  I applied this and even stood in front of a fan with my arms up to help the drying process along.  15 minutes later it was still sticky feeling.  3 hours later I am still feeling damp yucky feeling.  So far I smell wonderful.  I think I&#x27;m just going to stick with my regular invisible solid.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it leaves no streaks on my clothing either.  I suppose this could be good for somebody who has an extra 10 minutes everyday to waste standing in front of a fan with your arms up to dry your deodorant this is the product for you.  Smells great and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Love this! The odor protection is amazing. It dries quickly, I Don&#x27;t have a problem with sweating anymore and the best part is...no white marks anymore! Thank you bzzagent for my free sample. Will be switching!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as part of a primotion and after my first use i was all ready to say it&#x27;s nothing special &amp; i dislike the wet feeling. After using for a week i decided the wet feeling isn&#x27;t bad because it dries quickly. A big plus about a clear gel deodorant is that i can try clothes on and not leave deodorant all over my shirt when i take it off and try on another shirt! I&#x27;m not sure if this deodorant provides better protection than my previous white clear deodorant though.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast deodorant from BzzAgent to try.  It does do what it says - no white streaks - but tends to be a little sticky and takes a little longer to dry than I would prefer.  But is a great go-to, dependable deodorant when I need to be sure there are NO white streaks on my clothing!  Has a pleasant the smell is and is rather &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; upon application.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast lives up to MOST of it&#x27;s claims. It is a fast-drying formula... dries on my underarms in less than 5 seconds and it slides on nice and smooth. There are certainly no white marks. But what about odor protection you wonder? It does not do what it promises. It advertises 48 hour odor protection but I get about 10-12 hours from it before I notice the \\&quot;odor protection\\&quot; is no more. This is a typical length of time for deodorant with normal activity so I&#x27;m not grossly disappointed. I do think the advertising should be adjusted. I can&#x27;t imagine 48 hours since I can barely get 1/2 a day from it. Overall, it&#x27;s a good option. I did get this product for free from the company to test and honestly review.</li>
    <li> I would say I love this deodorant a lot. I used to use the Degree for men cool sport and thought I loved that one.  I thought that the men&#x27;s one was stronger than the womens and lasted longer.  What I realized was that at the end of the day it would wear off and I would feel like the smell just wasn&#x27;t there anymore, and honestly what women wants that.  I picked up the Secret outlast completely clean in a hawaiian scent over the summer time and I fell in love with it.  Not only the smell, but how long it lasted. I put a few swipes on in the morning and seriously lasted well into the next day. AMAZING!! It does feel a little wet when you first apply it but if you put it on while you have a bra or just a tank top then it gives it time to dry and you don&#x27;t get that wet feeling on your clothes.  This is my new go to deodorant, I love and would reccomend it to friends and family for sure. I will tell you that I did receive another Secret Clear gel for free and in return I review the products.</li>
    <li> Product work great, no white mark. fast drying, great for desert hot weather. better then the solid stick of the brand. worth the try. Leaving your arms smell fresh all day. work better than other product I have try in past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receiver this deodorant as a bzzagent kit. To try out the product and give word of mouth of this product. So far i have positive reaction to the product. I going buy more to stock up.  I give this product A+ sweat proof!</li>
    <li> I was nervous about trying a gel, as in the past they have always left me feeling wet and slimy.  I am very impressed by Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel Antiperspirant!  It was wet for a moment, but dried smooth and clean.  I wore it on a day where I knew I would be active a lot and I was kept dry and odor free.  There were no white marks on my black spots bra or tank top!  Way to go Secret!</li>
    <li> Review for Secret, not seller.    Secret works for a limited amount of time. I found it not working after a few hours. I don&#x27;t like the gel consistency because I feel like it makes clothes wet if you put something on right away after using the deodorant. I prefer something different.</li>
    <li> I began using deodorant at 13 and Secret Original Solid is what I started with and have used ever since.  On occasion I have tried other deodorants, always hated gels and roll-ons. So when I joined BzzAgent and the first campaign I got selected for was this product I was a bit skeptical.  However upon opening my package and then opening the deodorant I immediately fell in love with the scent - it was so fresh and crisp and clean and normally I hate scented deodorants.  I took my shower and almost couldn&#x27;t wait to apply it. Other gels or roll-ons I tried in the past had me walking around like a bird with broken wings holding my arms in the air until the deodorant dried.  But not with this new Secret Outlast it was drying while I was still applying!!! And when they say NON WHITE MARKS THEY MEAN IT, I was so confident in this that I put on my deodarant and immediately put on my black satin gown for a black tie that wedding and voila nothing!!! Needless to say I have found my new one and only deodorant for the next 20 years!! And I even got coupons for when I run out and to share with family and friends :)</li>
    <li> I felt like this deodorant worked okay, but it didn&#x27;t last the entire day.  Be prepared to reapply half-way through the day if you&#x27;d like to stay dry!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product thanks to BzzAgent as part of a promotion through the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So OK, I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first about clear gel. I&#x27;ve tried gel deodorants in the past (a long time ago) and was never a big fan of them. I felt like they didn&#x27;t offer enough protection, maybe partially because I couldn&#x27;t see how much I had on? Sounds silly, but hey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I gave this product the full shot. I was sure to apply to a freshly shaven and clean armpit (&amp;#60;--- that work still sounds icky even though it wasn&#x27;t, lol). I was pleasantly surprised by the scent but I noticed that it took a TON of cranks to get the initial product release...by the time I saw any gel, it seemed like 1/4 to 1/3 of the entire container was gone! That doesn&#x27;t score any points with this $$$-saving Sally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the application, I was quite underwhelmed. I&#x27;m not a particularly patient person, but if I have to wait almost two full minutes for my deodorant to dry, we have a problem...MY SHIRT WAS WET after I put it on! I waited over a minute and its not like I slathered on layers of this stuff; I followed the directions perfectly by applying the minimum of two clicks per armpit and I waited at least a full minute to put my shirt on. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for odor protection, I tried to give it the full test...48 hours, right? Um, wrong. Writing this review now, it has been almost 6hrs (SIX) since my last application; right armpit smells pretty...left armpit, not-so-much. WHY??? I followed the directions on the container that claims 48hr protection and here I sit, slightly icky on my left without having done any manual labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product...I won&#x27;t be purchasing it in the future.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I had the chance to try this! Secret Outlast Clear Gel is my new go to deodorant! It went on smoothly, and dried within seconds! It also left no white marks, so none ever got on my clothes, even my black ones! I also loved the clean refreshing scent it came in.  I hardly sweat all day, and never had to reapply my deodorant. I also liked that I could trust this deodorant, and not having to worry about sweating or smelling all day!</li>
    <li> Honesty is key....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used gel deodorants in the past and I have always hated them.  And I mean hated!  Never dried, felt sticky and wet all day and worried about who can see my wet pits.  Blah!  So I switched to solid stick deodorant and never looked back.  Then along came Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I was given this product for free as part of a promotion from the brand and I would like to say THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a while now and have noticed a few things. Keeps me dry all day and all night no matter what my activity level may be (not doing a thing to exercising to chasing kids to shopping etc.), I can do an armpit sniff at the end of the day and smell nothing.  Which in my opinion is great!  I don&#x27;t stink nor do I smell like a bag full of potpourri.  Just clean.  I wake up smelling clean.  After sleeping all night, sweating or not, I wake up with a clean smelling pit from the application applied in the morning of the day before.  I can put it on first and not have to worry about changing outfits a million times (all girls do) before leaving the house only to find white marks on my clothes after I leave.  I also never have to worry about being &amp;#34;that girl&amp;#34; who leaves marks on clothes while trying them on in a store.  Embarrassing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I have noticed it isn&#x27;t an insta dry like the solid stick is.  But, if you put it on out of the shower, by the time you figure out what you are going to wear, you will have forgotten you already put it on!  Also, some people have said it burns on freshly shaven pits.  Well if you read the information of the product, it clearly states not to use on broken skin (razor burn).  So that is why it would hurt or burn.  Duh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... Clear Gel deodorant has come a long way over the years and have listened to the complaints we have all had about it and, in my opinion, fixed it!  It does what a deodorant should do, not leaving you worry about your armpits and lets you enjoy your day worry free!about your armpits and lets you enjoy your day worry free!</li>
    <li> I also tried this product through BzzAgent for over a week and am a little disappointed.  I&#x27;m normally a Secret Invisible Solid user, so I was excited to try something a little different.  I disliked the smell of the product - it seems to be very alcohol-based.  I did enjoy the fairly quick drying formula, it did not last a full 48 hours on me and I did get damp while wearing it during high sweat activities like hiking and carrying boxes while moving.  although i had no previous trouble with white streaks, I did like that this product certainly has no chance to do so as a truly invisible gel.</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from BzzAgent and was nervous at first. I have a hard time finding a good deodorant that works and does not leave any residue on my clothes. I decided to try the ultimate black t-shirt test. I was amazed, no white residue anywhere. Solid winner in my book. I am a busy person always on the go so I need a deodorant that can last all day long, this one does. After a solid week of using this I am convinced and went out and bought two more so I would always have one available. I would recommend this deodorant to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have never tried a clear gel before (don&#x27;t know why)...but was excited to get it free as part of an online survey campaign. It was no better time to receive it because I had to attend 2 black tie events over the course of the month that would leave me wearing a black gown-yikes!! I was hoping to NOT accessorize with dreaded white marks from my current &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; stick. I could not have been happier after testing my new product. Not only did the Secret Completely clear gel dry super quick, but the were no lingering marks on my gown and I was left feeling fresh and smelling clean....even after dancing all night! A MUST have for women everywhere. We have enough to worry about-white marks should not be one of them!</li>
    <li> Stays on all day! I prefer this over all the other leading brands. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it works great! I received it for free from bzzagent :)</li>
    <li> WOW. I always thought a gel would feel cold and slimy and provide less protection but boy was I wrong! This stuff does the job! It lasts all day! It doesn&#x27;t leave behind a clumpy mess or stain your clothes or leave residue behind. I received a sample as a Bzzagent and love it!</li>
    <li> I received Secret&#x27;s Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a trial from Bzzagent.com. It is the first clear gel deodorant I have used that does not leave my underarms feeling sticky after I apply it. It goes on cool, has a nice (not overwhelming) fresh scent and keeps me dry for 48 hours likes it claims. I have two small children and morning are very hectic. There have been days when it&#x27;s I&#x27;ve run out of the house forgetting to put on deodorant but the deodorant from the day before still provides me enough coverage to make it through the day.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant free from buzz agent to try, and I have to say it&#x27;s great, the wet feeling of it going on took a little getting used to but it goes away very quickly. I stay very busy and active at work all day and this deodorant has kept me dry and sweat free all day long. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier at the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave the gross white marks on my scrub top that I alwYs seem to end up with when I use the solid deodorants. I would definitely recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am a BZZ Agent representitive and was luck enough to be able to try a sample...LOVE this new product. Goes on smooth and dries very fast. Would reccomend to anyone!</li>
    <li> First, I think it is important to know that I got to try this product for free for being a BzzAgent. That being said, I take Amazon reviews very seriously and would never give high praise to a product if I did not believe in it. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel is a very good product. I  was curious to try it because of the claim that it lasts 48 hours. It lives up to the claims for everyday activities that do not cause a lot of sweating. The clean scent is not overpowering and does a good job of maintaining its strength, one click of the gel goes a long way. I am a runner which is where I was able to give it its biggest test. It held up better then most products I have tried but could still detect a slight odor after 2 hours of intense sweating. The antiperspirant also lives up to the claims of leaving no white marks. I do not feel, however, that it dries in seconds, it seemed to take a few minutes. My personal preference is solid antiperspirants, but if you like gels and want something that lasts a long time, then I think this is worth a try.</li>
    <li> No more white marks on my clothes, this dries nicely and I don&#x27;t fear sweat marks or marks of white on my clothing. I only give this 4 stars as I think it is a bit of a stretch that it would last 48 hours without giving up its odor protection, I think 24-36 is most likely more accurate.</li>
    <li> Works great. It does not leave any white marks on my clothes. It does not make my underarm sweaty, and gives a nice smell throughout the day. my underarm feels smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> When I #GotItFree from #BzzAgent, a full sized product, I was a bit apprehensive because I had tried clear gels before. I don&#x27;t believe it was Secret brand, however, when you first wake up in the morning all warm from your covers, putting this cold, wet, gel under your armpits was terrible. Especially when it wouldn&#x27;t dry and then even with your clothes, it felt wet for hours. :-P  But I decided to give it a go. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant, smells fresh like you just showered, but this fresh scent lasts all day. It&#x27;s just the right amount of scent that won&#x27;t overpower your perfume. It dries quickly which I appreciated very much. But the very best thing of all is that it won&#x27;t leave messy white marks on your clothing! I have had some deodorants that did and even after washing my shirts, noticed that there was a stain in the armpits and it wasn&#x27;t from sweat, it was from the deodorant that I was using! Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant Is one that you will be glad that you tried. Give it a try and you will see that it&#x27;s not your typical gel deodorant or antiperspirant. It is simply the best. It has convinced me and I for one am glad that I gave it try. I even found my husband using it the other day!</li>
    <li> Secret outlast is great. Love how dry it feels. Lasts supper long even if you&#x27;re working out or in stressful situations . It goes Clear so no white marks. Only drawback is that it seems hard to come off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> As with any deodorant, testing for 48 made me nervous. I received this from BzzAgent to review. Now, I didn&#x27;t work out, but with my day to day activities, I was surprised that I still smelled fresh after 48hours! Way to go Secret! I loved that it was a clear gel as well. That means no white mess on your clothes.</li>
    <li> It does take somewhat longer for it to dry, but it hasn&#x27;t left any white marks on my clothes so far...and I have to wear black to work! Good job, secret!</li>
    <li> I usually use prescription brand solid deodorants so I was shocked when I tried Secret. It kept me dry and didn&#x27;t wear off. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> I just started using this deodorant and I must say I am absolutely impressed!! I don&#x27;t need anything,  but 1 click and 2 swipes just as advertised.  I where mostly dark clothing and I have yet to see any white marks.  For a gel, it dries super fast. I have not had to touch up my deodorant throughout the day, this product has 48 hours of order protection and I believe it!! Completely worth the money. I highly recommend this product. I received Secret Outlast courtesy of Secret for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I received this for free from Secret and I was going to give it to my sister because I&#x27;m NOT a fan of gel deodorant but I ran out of my usual stuff and had to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M GLAD I DID!!! Yes, it&#x27;s a little annoying to have to air dry my pits after putting it on but this is the best product I have used! I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about sweating or getting white spots on my clothes. :)</li>
    <li> I got this free to try through bzzagent  It&#x27;s okay,  I liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t get on my clothes and I didn&#x27;t have deodorant marks  However it doesn&#x27;t last, the scent is not very good and it is wet and sticky feeling</li>
    <li> I normally am not a gel deodorant person. I can&#x27;t stand the cold, wet feeling. So when I received the Secret Outlast gel as a promotion to try out I was a little hesitant. I still can&#x27;t stand the cold, wet feeling as it goes on. But literally within a few seconds it is totally dry. It leaves no white streaks on my clothes. And I live in Florida where it is always hot, hot, hot!! And even with the hot humid weather this product lasts all throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a girl that glistens; I sweat. So I am really particular about what types of deodorant I will use. My deodorant/antiperspirant has got to provide some strong protection from body odor and sweat. Since I&#x27;m already self-conscious about being sweaty, I don&#x27;t want to cope with white marks on my clothes. However, I have tried some gel deodorants that take so long to dry that you start the day feeling a little wet, which is exactly what I&#x27;m trying to avoid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent to review and, from my experience, this is a great option for an every day deodorant/antiperspirant. For me, it didn&#x27;t provide the same protection from odor and wetness that I would expect from a clinical strength antiperspirant, but the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel got the job done for my every day level of activity. The Secret Gel is an affordable option that you could use every day and then you could use something stronger on a particularly hot day or if you were going to be exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really adore using a gel option for deodorant and the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried. It really is completely clear; your clothing is completely safe! I think the best part of the Secret Gel is how quickly it dries. Most mornings, I don&#x27;t have time to walk around and wait for my deodorant to dry, however, I don&#x27;t want to put on my clothes while my armpits still feel wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Secret Gel has a really subtle scent, which I love. So many deodorants make you smell like baby powder all day OR the scent interacts with your body chemistry over the course of the day in a way that can become pretty unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is an excellent option for an every day deodorant/antiperspirant. If you are someone who doesn&#x27;t sweat a lot, this could even be a great choice for hot Summer days.</li>
    <li> I have always used spray deodorant but after trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel, I have switched.  Not only does it not leave any white marks but drys amazingly fast.  I felt protected throughout the entire day and am so pleased with Secret&#x27;s new product and would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Received this item as a promotion from the company to try. I absolutely love it. I have never like the gel deodorant but this dries quickly and leaves no sticky residue or white marks. I stay dry all day and the scent is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I was recently given the opportunity to test Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Anitperspirant for free and I LOVED it! In the past few years I had switch to more natual deodorant choices, namely ones with aluminum in the product, but let me be the first to tell you they do not compare to an antiperspiants. I never felt fully \\&quot;fresh and smelling good\\&quot; so I was looking forward to testing out this product to see what differences I noticted. FIrst the clear gel is wonderful, no more white marks on your clothes! That is so annoying! Second, this stuff WORKS great, it left me feeling dry, fresh and smelling so great all day! I really liked the light scent. This is a product I would recommend to friends and family with no hesistaiton.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast for free for the purpose of my review.  Opinions are 100% my own.  That being said-I HATED clear gel deoderants! I hadn&#x27;t used one in probably 30 years.  They always felt wet and icky and gross.  I used the Secret Outlast I received for the last 2 1/2 weeks and I have to say I am a convert!! I wear black for work and ALWAYS have to spray the armpits of my shirts when I wash them-NO MORE!! This doesn&#x27;t feel gooey and wet-it dries quickly.  Where I didn&#x27;t feel gel antiperspirant gave as much protection-I find that I smell as great at 11pm as I did at 8am.  Another interesting detail is that I have less dark spots under my arms and also find I have less redness and irritation from shaving.  This product was a WIN WIN WIN for me. Great protection, better looking armpits (if there is such a thing) AND I save time because I don&#x27;t have to turn my work shirts inside out and spray them when I do laundry!!  AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> A good back up to keep in your purse or diaper bag. 48 hours of protection? I don&#x27;t think it was anymore effective than the invisible solid that I typically use... I will be sucking with the invisible solid as I prefer the scent and the zero dry time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m typically an invisible solid user.  Who needs to wait while sticky cold gel drys?  I got this deodorant free through a BzzAgent campaign, and was really surprised at how quickly it dries, and BONUS! - no white smudges on my clothes!!  I think I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> Got to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel through a bzzagent campaign, and I must say, I really lucked out!!!  This deodorant is truly better than any I&#x27;ve ever used.  It dries quickly (think instantaneously) so you don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on your clothes!  This is something that I&#x27;ve always struggled with.  If you put deodorant on first, then you roll your clothes through the deodorant resulting in those white streaks on your clothes.  This evaporates into your skin right away so you don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed by those white marks anymore!  It has a fresh clean scent to keep that fresh out of the shower feeling all day long, regardless of what kind of activity you&#x27;re doing.  I put it on before the gym, and after a solid workout, I still felt fresh and clean under my arms.  That truly speaks to the level of protection that you receive from Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally a solid girl but I got this through box campaign and it&#x27;s the best gel I&#x27;ve had it dries and keep me fresh and dry long</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret my whole life but I did receive this latest tube of outlast from a promotion(buzzagent.com).  I love this product, it is my usual brand but I tried this new scent.  It isn&#x27;t over powering but I felt fresh and dry. It really is excellent odor and wetness protection. I have tried other brands in the past and always go back to secret. The clear gel really is the cleanest and neatest I have used. I recommenced giving this a try!</li>
    <li> Secret outlast dones not leave  white lines on my tops and dresses. Yes it really works and also keeps me fresh and dry all day/night long. I received one for free for being a buzzAgent .</li>
    <li> Finally found something that does what it promises and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free deodorant and didn&#x27;t expect much. I have had issues with deodorants ever since my 4th baby was born. Nothing would last for odor control. So why would this be different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it felt very wet. But before I started fanning my pits it was already dry. Then I began my most stressful day. I had packed the deodorant so I could reapply. It wasn&#x27;t until I was on my way home that I realized I hadn&#x27;t used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had one &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; day yet. I&#x27;m sold</li>
    <li> I received this free as part of a Bzz campaign, but I&#x27;m sold!  This stuff is amazing!  You apply it once (it absorbs quickly and disappears- no white marks, etc, no slick feeling) and it lasts for 48 hours!  (It&#x27;s actually working for 72 hours for me.  Insanity!)  I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Secret Clear Gel is an awesome because it goes on dry and makes you feel that way all day.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast in the &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent free from BzzAgent in order to try it.  Over the years I have tried many many antiperspirant/deodorants.  My most recent one was Secret Clinical Strength in the Serene Citrus scent.  I really liked the scent of that one, and that it was an invisible solid that went on without leaving white marks.  I tried the Outlast and it is working just as well as the Clinical Strength, at a cheaper price.  I am not thrilled with the scent, but it goes on invisibly, dries quickly, and works all day.  I can&#x27;t attest to the claim of 48 hour protection, since I shower every day, but it definitely does the job for 24 hours.  I would buy this again, but try another scent.  There is nothing wrong with this scent, I just don&#x27;t like it as much as the Serene Citrus  I was using.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff with Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I received the secret outlast completely clear gel as a free gift from the BzzCampaign to try so I could do a review on it. In the past clear deodorants didn&#x27;t work for me so I was a little skeptical when my kit first arrived, much to my surprise it does truly work, I&#x27;ve used clinical formula deodorants for years now because nothing else seemed to work, that is until I got this to try out.  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing and it lasts all day at work , there are no worries that this won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m so glad that if I&#x27;m in a rush I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting on deodorant at the last minute before I go out the door and having those horrible white streaks on  my clothes.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical. I usually use stick deodorant. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, so I thought I would give Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel  a try.  I thought it would be gooey and gross. I found it worked best apply right after a shower and let it dry.  THe smell was great. It doesn&#x27;t show up on your clothes either!  It dried really quickly and I didn&#x27;t feel gooey all day.</li>
    <li> I gave this Secret Outlast Antiperspirant Gel to my 17 year old daughter.  She has trouble with finding antiperspirants that work well for her.  She has been using it for about a week and we are pleased so far.  This particular one works longer for her.  She performs on stage often and having something that keeps orders down is really important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this secret outlast for free thanks to clearlybetterchallenge.</li>
    <li> Since becoming pregnant, my body chemistry has changed a ton. I feel like I&#x27;m always sweating through my old deodorant that was previously working. I was actually kind of against using a gel formula at first, because it seems like it would be sticky and take forever to dry. Since trying Outlast, I&#x27;m actually really impressed because the gel actually dries really fast. I stay dry and fresh all day long, and this doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or leave behind any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> Summer is on its way and that means extra hot, humid weather here in East Texas.  One sure thing to wear on these days is a good deodorant.  I have always been a Secret wearer because of the fact that it works.  There is now a new member of the Secret family you need to try, and I know you will love how it works, Secret Outlast Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt; I knew this was going to be awesome when I saw it was a clear gel deodorant.  I hate white marks that are left on my clothes from a pasty solid deodorant.  With the new Outlast from Secret you don&#x27;t ever have to worry about the white marks on your body or clothes because it goes on clear.  No more embarrassing moments from the white stuff.Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant maintains 48 HR odor protection too, which keeps us women super dry.  Don&#x27;t let that summer sun keep you from enjoying the out doors, because when you wear Secret Outlast you can feel confident you are protected from bad body odors.</li>
    <li> This is the best clear gel I have ever used. It goes on clear and stays on clear. No white streaks at all on my black clothes. Also, it WORKS! I have such a problem finding a product that keeps me smelling fresh all day long. Secret Outlast Clear Gel is that product! I am hooked and I&#x27;m never going back to the other products I used before.&lt;br /&gt;**DISCLAIMER** The opinions expressed are my own. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant is the best product I have ever used. I sweat a lot and don&#x27;t buy white or light colored shirts because they always get ruined with yellow sweat stains. This deodorant has made me able to buy light colored clothing for the first time in my life. The 48 hour protection is accurate because I was able to go camping with friends, there was no smell, and I didn&#x27;t have buckets of sweat running from my armpits like I usually do. Secret Outlast Clear Gel goes on cool and dries under my arm in a couple of minutes. I love that there were no white marks on my clothes or residue on my armpits. It goes on clear and leaves me secure and confident that I will smell clean and won&#x27;t perspire a lot in intense or uncomfortable situations. Because it works so well, the deodorant lasted several weeks so the value is definitely worth the product. I only needed to turn the bottom dial once to get enough gel to use on each of my armpits, and I loved that the cap had a barrier on the inside to prevent any leaks or smears. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant is a reliable and effective product that keeps me free of bad odors and dry for hours on end, and I am grateful that my wardrobe can now expand. I am a member of One2One Network, and I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> I have been a secret deodorant user for years. I am a huge fan of the solid and never to fond of any type of gels. so when I received this as a free sample I was skeptical about it but after trying it I was pleasantly surprised. It went on cool and drys fast. No fuss no mess no streaks. It smells great and last throughout the day into the next. I highly recommend it to all. As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com but the opinion is all my own.</li>
    <li> Very happy with Secret Outlast Completely Clean.  I was a little skeptical because I have not used gels in the past but was very satisfied with the results.I got to try this product for free and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I definitely have had no problems with getting deodorant on my shirt, I usually use &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solids and still have problems but have not had one issue with this. I&#x27;m a firefighter so have definitely put this to the test. I worked a shift where we were very busy during the day and then that night had a fire that I spent 4-5 hrs getting dirty and sweaty, swinging an ax, and covered in water off an on all night- I got back to the station (pretty disgusting) and did a quick sniff test and had no issues- it worked like a charm.  I had put it on about 24hr before so I definitely put it to the test. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it feels a little, and I do mean little, sticky right when I put it on but that feeling goes away pretty quick, it almost feels like you have nothing on, but like I said this works great and I definitely will continue to use it. I recommend it to anyone, especially if you are active because it works great.</li>
    <li> I received a full size Secret Outlast from BuzzAgent.  Even though this was another gel product, I was pleasantly surprised because it wasn&#x27;t overly liquid and was as close as I have experienced to another Secret product I tested several years ago (a solid gel) that lasted all day long, even in the humid, Midwestern summers.  It was the perfect product to avoid white marks, wasn&#x27;t messy, and seemed to last all day.</li>
    <li> I got a free full size sample from bzzagent.com, and I had never tried a clear gel deodorant before. Weird huh,  I&#x27;m hooked, love it and toss out my old Dove white residue leaving solid!</li>
    <li> 5 stars for sure!! Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best! A worry free, long lasting clear gel goes on smooth and cool. Great for hot Louisiana days! I received a free full size sample to try from Bzzzagent.com and I definitely recommend it. Thanks Bzzagent!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try for free through BzzAgent. I have tried the Secret brand before (with mixed results), but I have never previously heard of this product. I was excited to try a gel since I usually use the invisible solid products due to the lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened this product, I immediately liked the scent. It&#x27;s a fresh, clean, light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower with a perfume type scent. This is really important to me because my son has allergies which act up when he&#x27;s exposed to a strong scent. I&#x27;ve been using this antiperspirant for a few weeks, and he&#x27;s never had a negative reaction to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to turn the bottom dial once or twice to get the right amount of get to use. It dries almost immediately after application. I have extremely sensitive skin and this product have never once caused any irritation, even after shaving!! There has also been no evidence of pesky white streaks, even when pulling on a black shirt directly after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with Secret Outlast has been one of a kind! It has kept wetness &amp; odors at bay all day through a busy work day &amp; even into a gym session that evening. I would definitely recommend this product! Although this tube was free, I plan on adding it to my regular shopping list in the future!</li>
    <li> meh.  goes on smooth and clear. nice fragrance.  but it doesn&#x27;t stop my odor.  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel Completely Clean scent from BzzAgent. I have been pretty happy with it. It absolutely keeps me dry and smelling fresh through the entire day (not true with some other deodorants I have tried). The scent is very nice, not overpowering but there enough to make you feel like you smell clean. My husband keeps telling me I smell really nice and asking if I got new perfume. My only complaint is that sometimes it dispenses unevenly from the container, one click and be almost no product or a whole bunch can come out, but it isn’t really much of an issue for a deodorant that works and doesn’t leave any marks on your clothes.</li>
    <li> One of the best deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever wore. Powerful but not overpowering. Scent has just enough of fragrance to balance out this product. Sometimes the  original Secret deodorant would be too strong and it would break me out, but this product is definitely works for me. It will be my replacement to all other deodorant!     I  received the product for free to test as part of a BzzCampaign through my panel from BzzAgent. I must say that my experience with Outlast Completely Clean Gel proved to me that it provides me with the protection it needs to last throughout the day &amp; night without much to worry about.</li>
    <li> I recently  received  Secret Outlast Completely Clean  clear gel to try for free from BzzAgent.  I have used many different  deodorants during the years and was a little skeptical when I saw 48 hours wetness and odor protection and no white marks, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was possible but I learned fairly quickly that it is possible and Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel does what it says. I found there was no need to reapply this deodorant  by the end of the day, one swipe under each arm in the morning and it gave me a protection like no other for 48 hours. It did not matter if I spent my day running errands, relaxing at home or even putting in a hard work out this stuff works. One of my favorite things about this was that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about odor the Secret Outlast Completely Clean  clear  gel  nice fresh scent has you covered. With this deodorant  there is no need to worry about white marks because they just aren&#x27;t there, no more wasted time changing your shirt has you run out the door. I highly recommend  this deodorant it does what it says and it does it well.</li>
    <li> I have used Secret&#x27;s beautifully scented white solid brand for years but when I got the chance to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel for free in a free sample from Secret as a Bzz Agent (#GotItFree), I decided to give it a whirl though I usually don&#x27;t like clear gels since it was my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so pleasantly surprised! The scent is so divine I feel like a goddess. That is one of Secret brand&#x27;s strong points. It dried so fast, I couldn&#x27;t feel any sticky residue and it left no white spots on clothes like deodorants can be prone to do. It&#x27;s funny but people keep asking me what perfume I am wearing so they can get some and all I can do is blush and say that I am not wearing perform and it is the delicious scent of my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel they are smelling! We get a laugh out of it but the ladies always want to know more so they can try it. Another benefit is that it has you covered with 48 hours of protection which is a great thing in today;s busy lifestyles. Gotta love it.It is #ClearlyBetter than the rest.</li>
    <li> Being a long time Secret (and Outlast) user I was glad to try it out from BzzAgent for free, but I was totally skeptical about using a gel.  I love invisible solids and that&#x27;s really the reason for 4/5 stars.  I just still have a bit of a problem putting something wet on myself to stay dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I do love myself some Secret Outlast.  It does go and go.  I waited and waited to post a review because I wanted to give it a fair shake.  And you win me, this Clear Gel is pretty dang good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested it through DAILY use since getting it for free.  I&#x27;ve used it through everyday work, crazy days at work, gym sessions, lazy weekends at home, and the ultimate test - THANKSGIVING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a deodorant, clear gel even, can get me through grocery shopping, hours of cooking over a hot cooktop and in front of a hot oven, and last through hours of drinks/food/family/friends for the big meal, then it&#x27;s alright by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Update 2/5/16 ---&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got another sample from BzzAgent - again the clear gel.  This period got me through Christmas, an Ugly Sweater Party, wild days at work covering for people who were sick and feeling stressed out, my own sick day off work, and the onset of parks and rec volleyball.  I still stand behind my preference for an invisible solid instead of a clear gel, but I also stand behind the staying power of the Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The working stays working, BUT, it washes off easily.  I&#x27;ve had some deodrants that work well but then you have to scrub them off your pits causing chaffing and just ouchies on your skin.  But not Secret Outlast Xtend.</li>
    <li> When I was asked by bzzagent to try out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant I&#x27;m not going to lie,  I was very skeptical for a few reasons!  1. I don&#x27;t like the feeling of my armpits being sticky all day long. 2. It&#x27;s a gel deodorant, so how would it hold up to the sweat? 3. What would it smell like? So when the package arrived I immediately opened the box and tried it on. The first thing I noticed was that it is very fast absorbing,  it doesn&#x27;t make your armpits sticky. It goes on cool and then within a minute or so ot starts absorbing,  which is noce because then you don&#x27;t have to fan your armpits dry, which can be awkward at times! I thought it held up to sweat pretty well,  I work out on my lunch break and I can work up a pretty good sweat, so it&#x27;s noce knowing that I don&#x27;t have to reapply my deodorant after. It has a very clean, laundry-like smell, which I am a super fan of, because one day I forgot to wear perfume, but all throughout the day I could smell something similar to a very nice smelling perfume, when I got and took my shirt off to change for dinner I realized that it was my deodorant that had a pleasant smell.  All in all the product is good it definitely does what it says it will do! The only reason I am giving it a 4 out of 5 is because I wish it were a more natural product. Some of the ingredients are a little questionable,  but likewise I would refer friends and family to this product for sure!</li>
    <li> I received a free Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant to try through a Bzz Campaign. Usually I am not a gel fan as it takes awhile to dry and I don&#x27;t like getting wet marks on my clothes if I don&#x27;t wait long enough. Because of this, I almost always use clear solids. Secret Outlast also makes this deodorant in a clear solid and I would recommend that product before this one. Since I don&#x27;t use gels often I can&#x27;t really say if it dries faster than other gels. I&#x27;m a girl that sweats more than others, so when purchasing a deodorant, antiperspirant is high on the list for a deciding factor.  This deodorant lasts about as long as any other I&#x27;ve used, but the smell is great so I I&#x27;m not overly self-conscious if I do sweat.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean as a sample from BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.  I do believe it&#x27;s providing 48 hour protection, and haven&#x27;t experienced the weird fragrance side effect some deodorants can leave.  I like how this goes on easily (2 clicks is plenty) and dries quickly.  I got this as a sample, but will very likely purchase this again when I need more.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to try out  through BzzAgent. I was a bit nervous to give it a try, with having a few bad experiences in the past with gel deodorant. Here are my pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;-The deodorant does indeed do a great job with keeping you fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;-Has a pleasant aroma.&lt;br /&gt;-The price is pretty good (however there is less product than it looks like, the tube itself only is about half full)&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;-I have to keep my arms up and shake around a while to get the gel to dry, otherwise my armpits feel all slimy and gross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I buy this deodorant? Yes, if I had a coupon.</li>
    <li> I got to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free on a bzz agent campaign. I tried it out as soon as it arrived. It has a wonderful fresh scent that reacctivates as your body temperature changes. It goes on clear so leaves no white residue or marks on your clothes. So this is a must have for sleeveless! Outlast is long last but only lasts about 24 hours for me but all in all this is a great deodorant</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try through Bzzagent - and honestly wasn&#x27;t too stoked on it before I opened it.  I hadn&#x27;t tried any Secret brand products since high school and wasn&#x27;t impressed with them then.  Recently I&#x27;ve been back and forth between Dove invisible solid and a ridiculously overpriced \\&quot;natural\\&quot; fancy pants brand from a fancy pants store.    To start, this is a clear gel.  First instinct - ew. Slimy, moist. It comes in a clear applicator with a dial up bottom, so a click or two squeezes the gel up through holes on the top for application.  While I am a college graduate, I actually couldn&#x27;t get mine to open for 3 weeks!  Once I involved hubby and he finale the applicator, it was ready to try.    Upon opening, it smells like...a bath and body store at the mall - in a good way.  Definitely scented but smelled nice, clean, not too perfumy, just very fresh and floral.  I clicked it up and prepared to feel slimy.  But I didnt!  It dried within maybe 15 seconds to a non-tacky feel. In fact, if it wasn&#x27;t for that scent, I wouldn&#x27;t have known I had it on!    First day on was cool and rainy, so I layered tank top, sweater, raincoat, scarf.  Humid outside but I stayed super dry even with the layers.  It seemed to be drier as the day went on, in fact.    I&#x27;ve worn it a number of times since.  I wouldn&#x27;t head to a formal gala without reapplying, but I Def woke the next morning feeling like I was fine to go about a regular second day without being a stink monster or feeling gross.  Honestly I am shocked a gel works this well.  I didn&#x27;t want to like it hahaha.  Will definitely keep this around for stress sweat days like a big work presentation.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent to try out.  This will now be my go to deodorant.  In the past I haven&#x27;t really cared for gel deodorants because I feel they leave me feeling damp and sticky, but not this one.  I have been very happy with no white marks on my clothes and feel like it works and holds up well over the course of a day.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try Secret Outlast clear gel as part of a Secret campaign through BzzAgent. I love that this is a clear gel. It leaves no marks on my clothes and I wear a lot of black! I tried the lavender scent and it smells amazing. The scent is light and it really lasts throughout the day. I don’t feel like I need to reapply. I did start using this in winter so I am anxious to really try this out in the hot, summer months. If anything, it is so refreshing to not have to worry about white deodorant streaks on my clothing!</li>
    <li> I got this product for free as part of a Bzz Campaign from Bzz Agent. I tend to stick with one product when I find one that works, but, iIfigured, hey, it&#x27;s free, what do I have to lose? I was more than a bit skeptical that any product could actually keep you dry and odor free for 48 hours. I figured I would give it a real trial and took it with me on my recent trip to Florida. (There was a Walgreens across from our condo, so, I figured i could pick up some of my usual deodorant if it didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim) On the first day, we went to Flamingo Gardens (an outdoor animal sanctuary) and then to Sawgrass Mills Mall (the largest outlet mall on the East Coast). The second day, we went to Miami Seaquarium and the ZooMiami . It did a pretty good job of living up to it&#x27;s claim. I was completely dry and odor free on the first day (even though it was 86 degrees) and mostly dry on day 2 (we did A LOT of walking). So, I would probably give this an overall grade of B+/A-.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast for free as a BzzAgent. I&#x27;m not  used to gel deodorant, so it felt weird when I first put it on. After wearing it all day I was very happy with the product. I didn&#x27;t have any worries about bad bo.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I was more than a little skeptical when I received this free trial product from BzzAgent.  It had been years since I&#x27;d used a gel antiperspirant and I was not sure that I would want to change from my solid stick to a cold goo.  Much to my delight this deodorant is great!  It dries quickly and completely clear.  I even tested the claim that there would be no white marks by rubbing a black shirt under my arm after application.  No problems!  The best part?  Secret Outlast has worked incredibly well!  From daily errands to exercise, board room meetings, and hunting I&#x27;ve had no problem with wetness or odor!  I&#x27;m a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Move over solid stick, the clear gel is here to stay!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from BzzAgent as part of their promotion campaign. However my product review is no way influenced by that. I was pretty impressed with SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL. It is easy to apply, does not feel sticky and does not leave any stain marks on the skin/clothes</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to be able to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free via BzzAgent. I initially had my doubts due to the sticky wetness when it goes on. But within moments, the gel dries and you are protected all day long! The protection is the real deal!</li>
    <li> This deodorant dries quick and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. I have to change Outfits for different jobs during the day and I wear a lot of black. NOthing bums me like wrecking a shirt with white deodorant steaks just from sliding it on. The scent was pretty neutral, not at all over powering. Most days it kept me daisy fresh, though I didn&#x27;t test out the 48 hour thing. Deodorant application is a daily occurrence for me! I did receive this Product free to review.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent to try. I have tried many deodorants in the past and a lot of my tops and tees really got ruined because of sweat marks and white marks from deodorants and they didn&#x27;t make me feel confident when sweating. Not with the Secret Outlast clear gel. Especially with the colder weather I am wearing more layers and that&#x27;s when the sweating starts. But the Secret Outlast clear gel works much better than other deodorants. It goes on clear and smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stain you clothes. It has a pleasant scent that is not too overwhelming. It dries fast and really gives you a dry and fresh feeling. Not a sticky feeling like with other deodorants. It really keeps me dry all day long and protects me from sweat odors. I highly recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> Not for me. It was like applying cold goo under my arms and left me wet and sticky feeling. Did leave me smelling clean though. Got it free from BzzAgent.com to try and review.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Secret brand, but I was skeptical when I received the BzzAgent campaign to try this product for free.  When I tried the clear gel in the past, it was so goopy and sticky, I was not a fan.  So, I reluctantly opened this deodorant to start using it.  To my surprise, it was no longer the same nasty consistency.  It went on smooth and dried before I had the chance to do anything else.  I thought about saving the rest of the deodorant to use over the summer because I think it would be great for hot weather and tank tops, but I am going to use it this winter so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the dreaded deodorant marks on my sweaters.  I will just have to buy more this summer for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this deodorant really does Outlast!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Gel deodorant as party of my kit for a BzzAgent campaign. It&#x27;s been amazing! I have always used clear roll-on or gel deodorant because I cannot stand the thought of having white streaks or clumping that I&#x27;ve witnessed on others. This deodorant does what it claims--long lasting protection from sweat and odor and NO white streaks. I was up for over 24 hours and did some vigorous activity during that timeframe, but I never once felt wetness or experienced odor from my armpits. It has a light, pleasant scent and it dries quickly after application. I have found no reason to continue using this brand daily. I am a very satisfied customer. :)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant to try out and I was completely skeptical. I have hated gels in the past and I stalled trying this out for 2 weeks. Finally I tried it and wow was I surprised. The scent is light and not bothersome. I can actually wear it and then put on my perfume without feeling like I&#x27;ve got 2 scents going on.&lt;br /&gt;Then the gel feels great on my skin. It dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t even notice it was on anymore. It kept me dry as I ran around chasing my kids. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received it free from Bzz Agent.I like that it leaves me smelling fresh,and it has forty eight hour protection.I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave behind white marks.I&#x27;ve had other brands leave behind white marks,and they ruined my shirts.I like that i can workout,and feel confident that I don&#x27;t smell when I leave the gym.I love it,and it&#x27;s my new favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have found to help with odor protection!  I have tried every deodorant on the market it seems, and this is the only one that blocks all odor and sweating for me. I was not previously a clear gel user...I preferred invisible solids, but I was asked to try this product as part of a Bzz campaign with BzzAgent, and am I ever glad I did.  This product goes on easily, comfortably, with no mess, and has a great scent.  I have tested their 48-hr claim, even though I reapply on most days after a shower, and it does hold up.  There can be a brief, slight stinging sensation when applying after freshly shaving underarms...but goes away quickly.  This is now the only antiperspirant for me.  I highly recommend it...and have already converted some friends and family.  I have never gotten excited about a deodorant before or even written a review for one, but I couldn&#x27;t keep this a \\&quot;secret\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant for free as a campaign for BzzAgent, of which I am a happy and longtime member.  I recall trying gel antiperspirants in the past and really disliking them for their gross, wet feeling.  Anticipating something new and different, I set out to try and hopefully like, this Secret Outlast Antiperspirant.  Well, I seem to be in the minority based on all the great reviews for this product, but for me I really hated this!  Wet, gooey....yuck!  Oh, how I wanted to like this!  Showered, dried, hair and makeup, check.  Got dressed and as my usual way of applying deodorant, I picked up my tee shirt from the bottom and applied it from underneath my top.  Well this is why I don&#x27;t like clear gel.  My shirt got wet in the underarm area and after getting ready to go out I now needed to change my top.  And to make matters worse, when removing my top, the underarm of my top got on my bra which also became wet and I now needed to change both my top and bra.  Aargh is all I have left to say!</li>
    <li> By far the best deodorant I have ever used. I have had to use clinical strength in the past and always paid a lot for a small amount in a large package. Even with all that money spent I found it didn&#x27;t always work. After Secret sent me some Outlast to try out, I was amazed to find it worked so much better than the more expensive clinical brands. It have a very pleasant scent, went on evenly and easily leaving no marks of any kind. Lasted all day with no problems and gave me one less thing to worry about every day. The cost is very reasonable for the product and the results that you get with it. No need to reapply during the day, it has you covered.</li>
    <li> Dry instantly, leaving no remarks, and leaving you smell fresh all day long. #BzzAgent #GoItFree #SecretPromotion</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel did not meet my expectations at all.  It was very wet, which took some getting used to.  (I had been a faithful invisible solid user for many years, so I expected this initially).  It remained wet for longer than I would have expected.  It didn&#x27;t last 48 hours at all.  In fact, it really didn&#x27;t even last 24 hours.  My old antiperspirant lasted longer.  This surprised me a lot because the scent was so strong (too strong) that I expected even more from it.  If I hadn&#x27;t received this as a free sample from BzzAgent, I would&#x27;ve not actually purchased it myself.  I will still be sticking with my old invisible solid now.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. I received a sample and some coupons from BzzAgent to try. It smells great and leaves your clothes streak free!</li>
    <li> Im a Bzzagent and I am sent products to try out and review what I think about them. I was sent the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try out. First of all it is a clear gel so it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes with white marks. It has a clean, crisp scent that is not at all over powering as some may be. It definitely works for hours, I usually have to reapply throughout the day because I wouldn&#x27;t make it till the evening when I usually take my showers but ever since I started using this I can last all day. So I personally do like this product and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I think we&#x27;ve all had the same issue with deodorant before - outfits with streaks of white, even when you are promised it goes on clear and stays.  I was interested to try this and got the opportunity to with BzzAgent. I was interested in it being a gel vs. a solid - I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between the two, and hadn&#x27;t yet found that one worked for me better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was really pleasantly surprised by how well this gel works. They promise that it goes on clear, dries quick and smells good. And in my experience? It did all three! I live in a warm climate, so we still are in tank top season with the smells that can go with that - it is nice to find something that works great and keeps my darker clothes clean and streak free!  And I have to say, the scents that they have are really nice - not overpowering, but just fresh and clean. You don&#x27;t feel like you are a walking scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good, long lasting deodorant! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am Bzzagent and I receievd Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free. I tried Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel because I work on the shipping dock and then have to go to the sales floor to help customers. I work really hard and fast in the morning, but need to smell and look fresh when I help people face to face.Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel provided protection from wetness and odor all day, no matter how hard I worked or how long the day was. I am very pleased and will purchase in the future. It dried pretty fast and only left a little residue on my clothes. It&#x27;s kind of hard to shower off and I do wish it was unscented as I wear my own fragrance and don&#x27;t like the competition.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was feeling a bit apprehensive about a gel product.  Having used gels in the past, you always put them on and then you feel wet from the gel and have to stand around and let your arm pits dry out to take effect and not make your clothing wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One plus is that this is white-free and doesn&#x27;t leave tell-tale marks on the clothes that you wear.  When you do put the Secret Outlast gel on, it is surprisingly quick to dry!  I was impressed.  By the time I finished arm pit #2, the first was dry....when you put the cap back on the product, the other one is dry.  That was a major plus from my past experiences with gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Secret products as a whole do very well at keeping the wetness at bay and this product was no exception.  I had raked leaves and found myself feeling very dry under my arms (my head and back from sweating raking leaves, not so much, but the underarms were very nice and pleasantly dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an enjoyable product to use and I am glad that I had an opportunity to try it through the BzzAgent program.</li>
    <li> I love the cold wet feeling when I put it on fresh out of a hot shower. It dries so fast and smells amazing. I feel fresh and clean all day long. I even have people asking me what perfume I am wearing. They laugh when I tell them its my antiperspirant. I wasn&#x27;t sure about a gel antiperspirant, but I can honestly say I am a changed women now!!! Thank you BzzAgent and Secret for the opportunity to try out this amazing product!</li>
    <li> December snowflakes add up in Wisconsin, so the last thing we Wisconsinites need is white flakes from our deodorant adding to our stresses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is pH balanced to detect wetness and minimize odor-causing bacteria for long-lasting 48-hour odor protection, and I found that it works equally as well as the higher-priced clinical strength Secret deodorant that I currently use. Its water-based formula and fast-drying ingredients permeate sweat glands and evaporate in seconds so that we can pull on our sweaters as soon as we get out of the shower--before we start shivering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those little black dresses we slip into for holiday events? There are no concerns about removing deodorant trails with a lint roller, a wash cloth or some other method that never works. I tried to rub Secret Outlast off of my skin onto multiple fabrics because I doubted that it could live up to its claims of white mark protection, and it passed every test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My only caution is to avoid using this product if you have underarm razor burn; the alcohol content creates quite a sting that I am not accustomed to with my current Secret solid product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shopping, cleaning, wrapping, cooking and those tense moments with relatives...Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel will have you ready for anything the holidays--or life--throw your way! (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from Bzzagent.)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to try and really like it. It goes on smoothly and stays on. No more worrying about white stripes on my clothing. It also works all day, I use it everyday and don&#x27;t have to reapply. My daughter uses it on long run days and it gets her through her workouts and then some. I only gave it 4 stars because I would love to see more scent options. Otherwies, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free product as a promotion and found that it works great dries fast leaves not white marks and last all day.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent to try for free, I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I loved that it dries faster than a roll on but doesn&#x27;t leave the cakey mess of a solid. It worked great for me and didn&#x27;t mess up my clothes!</li>
    <li> I received  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free from Bzzagent.  I have been very impressed with  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.  Just one click and 2 swipes, and I am left smelling fresh and feeling dry all day long!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from bzzagent to try and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I was very skeptical when trying this deodorant since I had tried so many in the past and I never found one that I really liked.  I usually just bought whatever was on sale since they all felt the same to me.  This was the first time I had tried a gel deodorant so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  The first time you try this one it feels wet and gross but you get over it after a few uses.  I really love this deodorant, it leaves me fresh and dry all day long and also no white marks whatsoever.  I highly recommend this deodorant and will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Received this product as a sample through bzzagent. I like the long lasting capability even after a busy day and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks. Less excited about the amount of actual product which is much less than the container might indicate at first glance (it does show where the actual product goes to if you look for it) and the feel of the product when applying. However, it is a decent, long lasting deodorant for those with a busy lifestyle.</li>
    <li> Works well for the normal timeframe of 24 hours. 48 hours is a no go. I hate the feeling of gel deodorant because it&#x27;s too cold, but that passes quick enough. The scent is overpowering. I got comments from people about my new &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;. But again as far as odor protection goes in a reasonable time frame to not be showering, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i was given this product for free to review</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free from bzzagent. I was skeptical at first because I have never liked gel deodorants. Putting on something wet to keep me dry doesn&#x27;t make any sense. However this deodorant dries so quickly and really works to keep you dry and smelling good all day.</li>
    <li> I must say, Secret has astounded me with just how wonderful this product is!  I received a sample as a promo and it took all of my skepticism and just threw everything out the window!  It goes on and dries within a matter of seconds and STAYS on for hours and hours (even through workouts!).  It smells very pleasant, not too overbearing, just clean and fresh.  Oh, and about that whole clear thing?  It doesn&#x27;t show up one BIT on black clothing--I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but it&#x27;s true!!!  One more thing--you can also wear it after you&#x27;ve shaved and it doesn&#x27;t sting your underarms--this is important to me since my skin is so sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much Secret for letting me try your wonderful new product--I&#x27;ve gotten all of my work buddies, my close friends and female family members on board as well to the Secret Completely Clear Gel train!  A++!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a campaign from Bzzagent to try out. I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;m not really a big fan of the gel type deodorants. So anyway I tried it because I wanted to try something different, something may work better and smell better too. I am pleasantly surprised with how I stay dry all day!! The scent is also very good.</li>
    <li> I received my Secret Outlast Clear Gel complimentary from BzzAgent.  I was eager to try it out because I was in search of a deodorant that could keep up with my hectic lifestyle.  Changing my deodorant frequently was starting to get old. Before trying the Secret Outlast,  I was using a clinical strength of another brand.  It was effective enough but barely protected all day. Secret Outlast boasted 48 hour protection,  fast drying gel, and no white marks. Would I actually go an entire 48 hours to see if it works?  Not an entire 48 hours but at l least 24 hours with some overtime strength needed. I was shocked that after working a 16 hour shift and completing a 4 mile jog, I was almost as fresh as I was when I first stepped out the shower nearly 20 hours prior. Even after my jog, I was still dry and no wet marks whatsoever!  Impressive!  Every day thereafter has been the same. No matter how hard or hectic of a day I have, I can count on Secret Outlast to keep me fresh! My birthday was about a week ago and I had no worries about staying fresh or sweat marks while dancing the night away in a packed club. My new favorite for heavy duty protection,  even outlasting the other clinical strength brand!</li>
    <li> I got this product free as part of a BzzAgent Campaign.  I was excited, because I was looking into changing deoderants...again.  Nothing really seemed to to the job for me.  When I first received it, I was a little disappointed it was a gel.  Anytime before I used a gel, it just seemed to make me feel sticky and wet.  But, I was really surprised how quickly this dried (THEN I noticed, it said it was quick dry).  As for odor protection, I don&#x27;t feel like I can smell myself by noon.  I wouldn&#x27;t really say it holds up for 48 hours (for me, at least).  But, it does last longer than others.  Another thing I really like about this product is when I shower.  All the other deodorant seemed to leave a film under my arms.  It was completely waterproof, and hard to wash off that barrier.  I don&#x27;t have that waxiness with this.  I definitely plan on purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> I like that this avoids me getting those embarrassing white marks on my black tops and especially tank tops. It lasts a little while, but is not an all day odor protecting deodorant. I find it is needed for reapplication at the end of my work day. I need it to last till I get home. Re-Application is needed for that. If it is a short day then I think you will be safe. As for antiperspirant it does the job. I don&#x27;t have a sweating issue as much. I received this for review from BzzAgent, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! I received a sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Secret and was extremely excited when it came in. It glides on smooth and dries in seconds. The scents are amazing, no need to wear perfume when you wear this. I use to have to apply deodorant more than once a day. But now I put it on once and I am golden. Plus having the confidence of not worrying about white marks when I wear dark clothes is just an added bonus. I have definitely found my new deodorant!</li>
    <li> I have used a few different types of deodorant throughout my life, gel (cold) long ago aerosol, roll-on (oh how messy those were ...anybody remember Tickle??!!!)  and of course solids of all types - regular, invisible solid - which for the most part is not so invisible !  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was selected for the BzzCampaign, I wasn&#x27;t so sure what to expect since this is a gel but I fugured what the heck - let&#x27;s give the Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel an honest shot.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks or so now, and I&#x27;m actually pretty how it performs. Great protection, without the white marks.  It smells super nice, too !  HINT...I hit mine with my hair dryer for a few seconds to take any chill away now that it&#x27;s getting super cold !  Hasn&#x27;t affected the performance a bit !</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for #free in a #promotion #sponsored by #BzzAgent. I normally use aerosol sprays so I was eager to try this. I loved the sleek design package as well as the gel and how the product is dispensed through the small holes. It applies very nice and smooth. I think its great that it is clear and not white and chalky, nor does it leave the nasty white residue on your clothes like other products do. What I did not really like about it was the scent. I have no clue what it is! I would much prefer this in say a soft petal or lavender scent.  Overall its a nice product. I will buy again in the future, just in a different more pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I had tried clear gel deoderants before, and hadn&#x27;t been thrilled with the sticky mess that they became.  I was pleasantly surprised to try this (thanks to BzzAgent) and find that clear gel deoderants and can not only work, but be comfortable and neat too!  I like that not only does this formula keep me dry, and un-stinky, but that it goes on smoothly, with no mess and no white flakes.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent in order to try it out.  I am very impressed with Secret Outlast. It goes on clear with no white marks on your clothes. It has a fresh, pleasant scent that is not too strong . It dries very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on clothing. After a full day of work and two hours at the gym, my husband commented on how good I smelled when I was using this product. I highly recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Great odor protection and nice fragrance.  I am usually very sensitive to deoderant products, but not this one.  Sold!  My new deoderant for sure</li>
    <li> NOT A FAN!  Positives:  Went on Clear  Left no marks    Negatives:  It feels gross going on and feels \\&quot;wet\\&quot; for a long time after application.  It claims 48 hour protection, but maybe \\&quot;worked\\&quot; for 12 hours.  Over powering scent.    I usually use the Secret soft solid and it works DRASTICALLY better than this clear gel.    On the bright side, I got this for free as part of a BzzAgent Campaign, so I didn&#x27;t waste any money.</li>
    <li> I was sent my Secret Outlast free to try.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it any better than what I had tried in the past. What a pleasant surprise. Truly no more white marks on my clothes and it holds up my workouts too. Recently, it kept me dry through cooking and hosting 20 for Thanksgiving dinner, even when my oven went on the fritz while my turkey was supposed to be cooking. That was the true test! Not a wet spot one. I&#x27;ll be purchasing my next one.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent.  I was mostly very satisfied with it.  It smelled good, kept me smelling good and was easy to wash off at the end of the day.  It also didn&#x27;t clog my razor up with gunk.  My complaint with it was the knob to express the product.  Sometimes I&#x27;d click it once and hardly any would come out, so I&#x27;d click it again and there would be way too much.  It just made me feel like I was wasting some or that it would get all over my clothes and leave wet marks or there would be weird spots on my clothes.  Neither of those happened.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from secret and being a BzzAgent. I am normally the solid type of person. When I received the secret deodorant I was skeptical about a gel working well.  When I used it for the first time it was cool to the touch and then the smell was real nice not overpowering. It didn&#x27;t mask body odor like most do. It actually worked like it was suppose to!. I would highly recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to use on the most stressful days or workout days.</li>
    <li> So happy to be a part of Bzzagent.com and get to try wonderful products for free! This deodorant SMELLS GREAT! Actually does work for 48 hours, and dries within 2-3 seconds. Lasts longer than the solid kind, and you can see when you are almost out.  Only con is that it stings a little after shaving.....not bad enough to keep me away though....I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean free to try as a promotion from the brand. At first I was skeptical as it promises 48 hours odor protection. I have to say for myself it held true not just 48 hours but 72 hours as I decided to push it and see. I also had my 12 year old daughter try it as I have not found a deodorant yet that works well for her. Not even the clinical strengths. This may not have gone 48 hours for her but it did hold out extremely well for over 24 hours for her. This held up for her even in a very nerve wracking stressful time of my brothers death and funeral. I would absolutely suggest this product to anyone that needs great odor protection. That is not even adding the bonus of being a clear deodorant, meaning no white marks on clothing. It also goes on comfortably, it does not have a sticky feel that a lot of gels have. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried a clear antiperspirant formula in years, mostly because my previous experience with them had been negative - stinging, gunky clear gel.  But thanks to BzzAgent and my free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel, I found out this kind of product has obviously evolved for the better. No more sting, no gunky feel. The best part for me is that I&#x27;m happy to be liberated from the white gunk streaks on my black clothes! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this antiperspirant.  There are several positives: it has a nice clean scent, provides odor protection and dries in seconds.  The part I struggle with is the initial cold gel feeling when I put it on.  It does dry quickly, but that does not mean that it&#x27;s uncomfortable for a bit.  It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks either, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I received this as a complimentary sample in order to review for BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took on this campaign in an attempt to find a clear deodorant. I haven&#x27;t used a clear deodorant in years. The memory of cold, slimy deodorant on my underarms that never completely dries has stuck with me all this time. I was skeptical, but Secret is my usual brand and I have been very happy with it. I&#x27;m glad that I finally bit the bullet. Clear deodorant has come a long way! Yes, it was a bit cold and wet when first applied, but it dries quickly. It&#x27;s nice to have the option of a clear deodorant again, especially in the summer when you show more skin. I also LOVE not having white marks on my shirts. I usually apply deodorant, and then get dressed after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I couldn&#x27;t have been more impressed and will definitely pick this up to have on days when I am wearing tank tops or need a clear deodorant.</li>
    <li> This product kept me dry all day and had a great scent. It definitely worked, but I don&#x27;t like gel Antiperspirants because they always make me feel sticky!  I will stick to using a clear solid instead. I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clean Gel Antiperspirant to try out and review from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I have ALWAYS struggled with finding the right deodorant for me.  I tried clinical stuff, I tried more expensive &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; stuff and I was never happy.  None of the &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; deodorants ever worked and even if they claimed to leave no white marks, they always did.  Since I started using Secret Outlast clear gel, I will never go back to anything else.  I love the gel, it feels refreshing (especially in the summer) and I NEVER have to worry about white marks.  I have always struggled with odor, especially as the day progressed and even more in hot summer months, but secret outlast gel, has significantly reduced the amount of odor and it the protections lasts much longer than what I used to use.  Does it protect me from when I awake in the morning at 4am until 9pm when I go to bed?  No, BUT it does last for most of the day.  If I were to come home from work, change and go back out, I would reapply just to reassure that I am protected, but it takes two seconds, and I do not mind.  I am so glad I got to try this product for free from bzzagent and now I will be a user for life!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is quickly becoming one of my new favorite products. It nevers leaves behind unsightly and embarassing white marks which is essential in the workplace! Plus it keeps me dry in even the hottest of Texas summers! #gotitfree #imabzzagent</li>
    <li> I received this as a free product through Bzzagent. I love Secret antipersperant. This keeps me from sweating on a walk on a hot humid day.  Give it a try. And it doesn&#x27;t show on your clothes!!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant. When I received it from Bzzagent to try out I was very skeptical. I used a gel deodorant many years ago and it felt gross. I have a preferred solid deodorant that I use and wasn&#x27;t sure about trying something new. It actually went on well although it was cool and a little wet but dried very quickly. It did not get all over my clothes and wasn&#x27;t sticky. It kept me fresh and dry all day. I am glad that I tried it and recommend that you do too!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!  It goes on nice and dries fast.  There are no white marks on my clothes. It has kept me smelling great all day long...even playing with working at a preschool.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bzzagent for helping me find my new favorite deodorant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear deodorant for over a month now. I was skeptical about using this product at first because it was a gel; however, I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I actually like it. Yes it is a bit chilly when you first apply it on your arms, especially in the cold winter months but that is my only real and insignificant complaint. I love the fact that I no longer have white marks left on my clothing which is a huge bonus. Also I no longer suffer from those pesky white clumps of deodorant stuck in the crevice of your underarms. I feel protected from older all the day without having to reapply. I highly suggest you try this deodorant as well because I believe that you will be pleasantly surprised as I was.</li>
    <li> Great for dark-colored Shirts - This gel is great for not creating the white yucky buildup on the insides of my shirts.  In the past I&#x27;ve had problems with that and have had to try hard to get it out in the laundry.  Secret Outlast Gel doesn&#x27;t discolor nor build up on my shirts.  The scent is great and the protection lasts a good 12-15 hours.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Secret Clinical Solid Antiperspirant , so when I got got the opportunity to try the Completely Clear gel free from BZZAGENT , I thought why not. I have to admit I &#x27;m not keen on gel  because they usually don&#x27;t dry quickly enough for me and I can&#x27;t stand that moist feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This one however dried nicely and did not have any color, (some gels also dry white) . On the plus side I didn&#x27;t sweat through and I&#x27;m glad that  I have this option from Secret . So I would say this gave personally gave me the protection of a clinical strength antiperspirant and the plus side is that it&#x27;s clear. I can&#x27;t ask for more..except I would love to try a different scent. This one masks odor but is really strong, I could smell it above my perfume. Perhaps a powder scent would be better and more mild.&lt;br /&gt;1 twist of the deodorant is enough for me , 2 pumps would definitely  be too much. It says it protects up to 48 hours, I haven&#x27;t test that length of time , personally,for me going that long without a shower would be dreadful.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars just because the scent is strong , but overall I&#x27;d use it again, I particularly like to wear it while working out. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got this as a Bzzagent campaign. I have found I like it rather well. Initially it is very strong smelling when you put it on. The scent is good it is just strong. Once it dries though it isn&#x27;t nearly as strong, and it does dry quickly. The protection is pretty good too. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling goopy like a lot of the gels I have tried did. I think the strong smell was the biggest downfall for me. Personally I would continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome sauce!  It dries so much faster than other gel deodorants, and it has a nice light clean scent that isn&#x27;t overly perfumed.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 3 weeks now, and it hasn&#x27;t left a single mark any item of clothing I&#x27;ve worn!  I did receive the product as part of a promotion from the brand - but I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like feeling wet, and this gel does just that. It worked great after the initial wet feeling. I think I will stick to my solid deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and was given this Antiperspirant to try. I found it went on easily and had no issues with it leaving marks on my clothes. No issues with sweat or smell at all! I like the gel versus the stick deodorant because it is far less messy! The down side to it is that it can be messy around the cap. I have found gel gets stuck on the outside of the cap when I take it off and on and then it dry and makes a clear crust which falls off sometimes. I have also found I run out of the gel faster, maybe I am applying to much? Ether way I really like this!</li>
    <li> BzzAgent provided me with the opportunity to try the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Antiperspirant.  After weeks of using the product, I am excited to tell you it works.  I am a teacher and spend all day in rooms with fluctuating temperatures, in the hot and humid state of Florida.  After work, I run long distance, in preparation for a marathon.  This antiperspirant has kept me fresh all day long, including through my runs.  It goes on smoothly (without being too runny), dries quickly, does not transfer to clothing (leaving embarrassing white streaks) and keeps my underarms dry all day long.  As a long time user of Degree&#x27;s clinical strength deodorant, I can honestly say this antiperspirant performs at the same level.</li>
    <li> Although I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant as a promotional item as part of my involvement with BzzAgent, I would not hesitate to purchase this deodorant again once this product runs out.  It is by far the best deodorant I have used. The scent is so fresh and clean that many (most) days I don&#x27;t add perfume, preferring instead to use this as my scent.  I have never had an incident where the deodorant didn&#x27;t cover my odor and sweat protection needs ... if anything, I felt like I sweat less during the NYC heatwave than normal, which was a great bonus.  It also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; if I use it right out of the shower or after shaving my armpits ... another added bonus.  Haven&#x27;t seen a white mark yet on ANY of my clothes, and don&#x27;t feel like it leaves my underarms wet or goopy feeling.  it goes on feeling dry already and dries immediately.  I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bounced around between deodorants over the last several years, testing different brands and products - from dove to lady mitchum to degree ... - but I think I&#x27;ve found a keeper.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel from Bzzagent to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this deodorant for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The smell - it is light and fresh but not too overpowering&lt;br /&gt;The staying power - it keeps you feeling fresh all day long&lt;br /&gt;Color - it is clear so you don&#x27;t have to worry about white streaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wetness - It feels pretty wet when you first put it on, but the feeling goes away really fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall would definitely recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent to try the product.  I have tried many antiperspirant/deodorants in the past. I am very happy and impressed with Secret Outlast. It works as well, if not better, than the clinical strength deodorants I have tried in the past. It goes on clear with no white staining on your clothes. It has a pleasant scent that is not too strong. It dries very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on clothing. The protection wonderful and the best I&#x27;ve tried in a long time. It keeps me dry and smelling wonderful all day long. I highly recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! I receives it as a free sample and just love it! The clear gel formula has never left marks on my clothing. I have also not sweat through my shirts at all, even when exercising! The scent is clean smelling, but I would likely choose a different scent than what was offered. Really, no complaints!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this antiperspirant.  And I think I&#x27;ve tried it all.  I&#x27;ve tried sprays, roll ons (remember those?), solids, and even other gels.  This is the best.  It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on skin or clothing, and I used to be the queen of the white marks.  It dries quick.  It dries in a matter of seconds.  I had the most stressful day of my life 3 days ago, and I still felt as fresh as when I put it on the day before.  Does it last 48 hours?  It absolutely does.  And it lasts through everything.  Stress, workouts, chasing kids and everyday life.  Truly the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve every tried.  I got introduced to it through a Bzz Campaign, so my first was free.  But now it&#x27;s on my Subscribe and Save list!</li>
    <li> l was initially skeptical because several deodorants have given me skin irritation and do not really work as well as advertised. This product is unusual because it is my first venture into the gel deodorants and it was worried that similar to some sprays the gel would cause irritation. But I am surprised, the deodorant is very gentle, does not irritate my skin at all and it really works. I stay dry the whole day after applying a thin layer to my skin each morning. No need to reapply halfway through the day. It has a pleasant scent, applies smoothly and easily. Then lasts gently all day long and leaves me confident that I will stay dry the whole day. I am very impressed and at this point really prefer the gel texture of Secret Outlast®  Clear Gel in active fresh. I love the scent, it protects me all day long and it goes on very easy without causing any irritation.

    <li> Excellent product!!! #gotitfree via #buzzagent.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  THE greatest thing is that there are no stains on my clothing.  How terrific is that?  My clothes get a bit on them?  No problem!  Secret outlast dries clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about white stains on my clothes!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Secret, but I mostly use the invisible solid. I received the Secret Outlast to review from BzzAgent. It has been a while since I&#x27;ve used a gel. I never really liked how it felt when I put it on, but this time, I didn&#x27;t mind. It dried quicker than I remember. The great thing about this gel deoderant is that it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue- because we all know how embarrasing that is! Secret Outlast did keep me dry, even when I worked long days. I never had to worry about it. It has a nice clean smell; however, the smell of the deoderant didn&#x27;t last. Of course I had to do the sniff test! And while I didn&#x27;t smell bad, I couldn&#x27;t smell the deoderant. Otherwise, I would keep this on hand for special occasions where I&#x27;m worried about getting white residue on my clothes.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical with gel deodorant being a loyal clear solid user, however I now love gel. No more residue on my clothes when I&#x27;m to impatient to wait till it dries properly or residue buildup underarm. It isn&#x27;t wet and slimy like I thought it would be just slightly wet for one second but it dries quickly. Lastly and of course most importantly yes this has awesome odor protection. I did receive this free from Bzz Agent and this opinion is 100% mine.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast as part of a Bzz Campaign.  I was hesitant; I am not a fan of goopy and my past experiences with gel deodorants has shown them to be goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out I still don&#x27;t really like gel.  It&#x27;s messy, and doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as they&#x27;d like you to believe.  If you slap it on running to a gym class, or putting on a nice white shirt, expect to either walk with your arms up or risk potentially wet spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - it works.  Really well.  I wear tech shirts at the Y and it is HOT there.  Typically my shirts smell no matter what I wear or wash them in.  After wearing one with this deodorant, it smells like Secret.  It washed out clean.  It wasn&#x27;t a freak occurrence; I&#x27;ve used this Secret now for a few weeks and my gym clothes and bag are much less gym-like.  This alone will make me keep using it.  Warning - if you leave it in your car on a cold New England night, it will be COLD putting it on.</li>
    <li> I received this as a product to review from BzzAgent and was skeptical about using it as I have tried a gel deodorant before.  I have been using this for about two weeks now and it does seem to work fairly well and the scent is not overpowering.  My biggest problem with it is the cold jolt and moist feeling when first applying.  I prefer my pits to be dry from application to bedtime.  It does seem to dry fairly quickly, but not immediately.  This performed as I expected as I am a current Secret user.  I just don&#x27;t like the feeling when applying.  If that doesn&#x27;t bother you than go for it.</li>
    <li> Secret outlast is a great deodorant. I love the way it feels, how long it lasts and the smell. Well worth it. I got it free to try it out and I love it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel and was a little disappointed when I found out it was a gel, I typically choose solid deodorant, even though I hate the white marks solid leaves behind.  I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this gell dried and I enjoyed the fresh scent all day and dry feeling all day!  No more white marks!!</li>
    <li> I got this deoderant from bzzagent, #gotitfree.&lt;br /&gt;I like this deodorant a lot. it lasts all day unlike the dry kind. doesn&#x27;t irritate my arm pits like dry kind either! has great scents also!. I personally not into gel at all.</li>
    <li> Totally loving the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel! I received it complimentary for review through the BzzAgent program and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My biggest issue with deodorant is getting white streaks on my clothes and with this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about that! The clear gel makes my life hassle-free in terms of worry about getting deodorant on my clothes. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant through BzzAgent.  Normally I hate gel deodorants!  They are always sticky and tacky feeling.  This deodorant completely changed my mind!  I loved it!  It smelled nice but not overwhelmingly.  It dried completely and did not feel sticky at all.  It lasted very well.  Better than other stuff I have used.  It did not irritate my sensitive armpits at all.  No marks on my clothes.  Even though I got it free I plan on buying it myself and am happy I got to try it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Always refreshing to find a ouproduct that actually works. I was using one of those clinical strength products. They never held up for more than a few hours and made me itch. This deodorant  is great!</li>
    <li> I am a Buzz agent and I received a sample of this product to test. I am giving you my honest opinion, I absouluteyl love this product! I love how fresh and clean it is, great clean scent and goes on wet buy dries quickly. Best part no white stains to my shirt or bouse. My daughters ( all three) love it too. so nice not to worry about stains, but it really does help keep you dry and smelling fresh all day, even during a workout ( which all my girls do!) I must say I will continue to buy htis product, as it provide protection from all the thing we want, odor and weatness.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent free of charge to try it out. I like this deodorant very much and will continue using it. It has a very pleasant smell, goes on nicely, lasts all day and better yet no white stains on my darker clothing. It dries fairly quickly after applying and does not rub on my clothes. I would highly recommend the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I definitely give it arms up.</li>
    <li> I am not the kind of girl that uses gel deodorant. I sweat like a man, and since gel goes on wet, why would I want to start my day out wet?! When I received this campaign from BzzAgent, I was extremely skeptical. I&#x27;ve NEVER liked any kind of gel deodorant or roll on in the past. When it starts wet, it stays wet on me and I don&#x27;t like that. I mean, who would?! However, in trying  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, it does go on wet like any gel deodorant, however, it dries QUICKLY and it works great and ALL DAY LONG! As an added bonus for someone who always has white spots because I&#x27;ve only used white solids, there&#x27;s NO WHITE SPOTS because it&#x27;s a gel!! I have officially changed what I use for deodorant thanks to BzzAgent!!  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel ALL THE WAY!!</li>
    <li> Received one of these as part of a bzz campaign for bzzagent.  I love, love, love this deodorant!  It&#x27;s my new go-to everyday part of the routine goody...In fact, it&#x27;s so good that my daughter nipped it when she went back to college so I had to go buy another.  It goes on really smooth, it&#x27;s not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks: No white marks when you apply and no white marks later, like some other &amp;#34;invisibles&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used (after they dried they would flake..ick).  And I even tested it to see if it would last a second day without reapplying and I can honestly say that it did and it still smelled pleasant, too.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel deodorants - they are often too gooey, take too long to dry, and just feel really gross to me.  So I&#x27;ll admit I was extremely wary of trying it out when I heard from BzzAgent and got a free sample.  But I decided I&#x27;d give it a try, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back.  This stuff is amazing!    First of all, when they call it Completely Clean Clear Gel they are right.  There are no marks anywhere and the gel goes on smoothly.  Most impressively, it takes very little time to dry so I don&#x27;t have to sit around waiting before I get dressed.    There is also no scent, which I think most people would like.  I sometimes enjoy having a scent with my deodorant, but I have no problem with this one being unscented.    It also seems to do a really good job of wetness protection.  I use it for normal workdays as well as for workouts, and it does just as well as any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.    Overall, I LOVE this product and can&#x27;t wait to use it again!  Thanks Secret and BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Completely Clean clear get antiperspirant and deodorant for free from the manufacturer to try and review.    I have to say that Secret works as advertised -- it goes on clear and kept a fresh scent for an entire day.    That being said, I was disappointed with the ingredients of the product. The main ingredient is Aluminum Zirconium, which has possible links to breast cancer, and applying it (along with the myriad of other chemicals contained in this product) to the place where your lymph nodes sit only makes it worse. I learned this after my mom&#x27;s oncologist had her stop using deodorants containing aluminum after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I&#x27;m surprised big companies haven&#x27;t started making safer products.    Anyway, I did try the product out for a few days but stopped using it immediately after finding out about the possible dangers of using aluminum containing deodorants. I don&#x27;t know, breast cancer just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the risk to me.</li>
    <li> There is no Secret why I love Secret.  Secret knows the scent of a woman oh so well. As woman I always think I smell especially after any strenuous activity and riding public transportation. With secret it isn&#x27;t the case for I am reassured each time I get off the train that I am not drenched in sweat from the ride. I also like after leave the gym I am still fresh scented and though yes I am sweating my arms do  not  enhance the current body&#x27;s sweat smell.  By participating in this Bzz campaign I am reassured that Secret is the one product that thinks of every thought in a women&#x27;s head regarding scent and feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition who has the time to worry about streaks, we don&#x27;t anymore. There is always  something going on and the last thing you need to see when being out is a large white streak on your clothes.  I like that even if I happen to get some on my clothes and it has happened there is no indication on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree #clearlybetter</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like a gel deodorant. I have always been a solid deodorant kind of person. But since I was able to try it free through a brand promotion, I decided to give it a go. I was skeptical, but I have been pretty impressed with this. The gel dries pretty quickly. It does its job. I never even had to apply it the next day, so the 48 hour guarantee seems legitimate to me. Although I would love to test it out again in the summer months when I sweat more. The only complaints I have are that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the solids do. It&#x27;s also near impossible to get the perfect amount out. It&#x27;s usually either too much or not enough.</li>
    <li> I received The secret outlast completely clean scent clear Gel antiperspirant to try from Bzzkit campaign.  I was somewhat skeptical as at first glance it did not give you much gel through the holes to use and it required at least 2 turns of the pump to get enough out for one arm.&lt;br /&gt;It did feel very wet going on but it amazingly dried very fast and had a really nice clean oder.  Not overwhelmingly flowery or like you are trying to cover up a bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;I work outside and inside a elementary school and i was really surprised how fresh I was at the end of the day.  even when I was stressed and in a cafeteria with over 100 kids during an assembly no one could see me sweat :)&lt;br /&gt;I was discouraged it used so much deodorant and over the course of a month it seemed to where down very very fast.  However in the last week I thought I would give the 48 hour  protection a try.....while at home and running errands of course ;)&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly it worked pretty well 9 though I don&#x27;t think I would ever go 48 hours without putting deodorant on unless I was taking another road trip with the family.&lt;br /&gt;All and all it is a surprisingly good product that i would recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. With all the choices of deodorant that is available in the drugstore shelves luring me in with their bright packaging and out-of-the-world claims. However, I really haven&#x27;t found one that has everything that I am looking for. Sure, some deodorants promise wetness protection and prevent unpleasant odors, but unfortunately many leave that dreaded white mark residue on really nice clothing! But I think my wait is over, I finally found the one that works for me with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. When I first tried it I was definitely shocked because I did not experience any unpleasant odors and I stayed dry all day long. I am totally amazed by this product, it seems really nice and it dries really fast after application even though it has a gel consistency. Day after day it hasn&#x27;t failed me and I am totally hooked!</li>
    <li> I received this antiperspirant and deodorant from BzzAgent.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a new antiperspirant for a while, and I was excited to try this out. After using it for a few weeks, it just isn&#x27;t for me.  It does what it says, which is prevents odor for a long period of time and is invisible/clear.  But, it&#x27;s really wet (and cold) when you first put it on, and the scent just isn&#x27;t a fit for me. Others might like it better, so I hesitate to completely write it off for everyone.  It takes a while to dry, and I&#x27;m usually trying to put on my antiperspirant as I run out the door. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this in the future, but I&#x27;m a big fan of the Secret brand, so I&#x27;ll be sure to try out some of their other products.</li>
    <li> I actually got to try this out for free as part of a promotion, and it worked amazingly! Didn&#x27;t need to lay it on thick, kept me smelling fresh and feeling dry with no white streaks. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received a sample to try from BzzAgent.com. I was expecting a cold, wet, sticky gel that took forever to dry. I was completely wrong.  It dries very quickly and keeps me dry all day. I workout at the end of the day and I still feel like it is working.  The smell is great and not overpowering at all.  I found a new antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I was completely impressed with this product.  When I was invited to the BZZ Campaign (where I received the product for free). I was a little hesitant because of my past experience with gel deodorants.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick it dried after application.  I hadn&#x27;t tried a gel deodorant in quite sometime because of the slimy feeling it left.  This deodorant did NOT leave that slimy, wet feeling.  I use this after my mid day gym workouts and I feel great and fresh for the rest of the day!</li>
    <li> #GotItFree from BzzAgent Replaced my current deodorant with this. Unbeatable dryness and no ta cky white smudges. Great clear coverage and scent.</li>
    <li> This deodorant never could be easier as you get 48 hour odor and wetness protection.  It smells really good with a nice clean smell.  There is absolutely no white marks to worry about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try a clear gel because, well...clear, but because my armpits are very sensitive, I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend money on it. So when BzzAgent invited me to the Secret campaign, I jumped at the chance at getting a free stick of a brand I already use. Even at the risk of rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for a full week and then off and on here and there. I didn&#x27;t have any rash flare ups, which is great. This product kept me dry and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any marks on my clothing the first few times, but I wanted to really put it to the test before I blogged about it. So I grabbed my darkest tank top, turned the gel stick three times and applied it. I waited until it dried and then put on the tank top. I wore it for an hour, pulled the tank top off and voila, below is the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even invisible gel does leave behind white on pure black (but none on dark gray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for absolute clean on black, keep looking!</li>
    <li> I received my deodorant as a BzzAgent product to try and review and it was a slam dunk!  Great Deodorant! Keeps you smelling fresh rather than like deodorant and goes on clear .. I never have the \\&quot;Oh Crap, I got it on my shirt now I have to change\\&quot; incidents!</li>
    <li> Received a free sample from BzzzAgent. Works well. Goes on clear and dries clear. My only complaint is that it stings some when applied right after shaving.</li>
    <li> I wanted to know if Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel would work better than my clinical strength deodorant.  I wore Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel on vacation in Puerto Vallarta and it was extremely hot outside.  I didn&#x27;t want white marks on my clothes either and the gel seemed to work perfectly.  It dries fast and it works just as good as my other clinical strength deodorant. The only thing I did not like was that the product slightly burned when applying it.  #BuzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel Deodorant complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes. I did like the clean scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s odor protection lasts long, at least for me it did not. It did go on smoothly and dried quickly. Definitely a great deodorant for a night out paired with your little black dress. Definitely not the deodorant to work out in. - Lynn (bzz agent lynnm09)</li>
    <li> I got this item for free from BzzAgent in order to try it out.  I have to say it worked wonders on keeping me dry and odorless.  However, I can&#x27;t give it a rating above 3 stars because of how sticky I felt all day after using it.  The gel is extremely sticky when I put it on, and even though it keeps me from perspiring and smelling like sweat I feel like my underarms are stuck together all day long.  I really think the product works well, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it for me to purchase when it makes me uncomfortably sticky.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I was given a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The gel felt weird going on, and it didn&#x27;t seem to give proper coverage. Then, it only worked for a few hours, and only if I wasn&#x27;t doing something strenuous. Definitely didn&#x27;t work for 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free for being a member of BzzAgent com. In the winter I usually shower every other day due to dry skin and I&#x27;m impressed to find this deodorant really does keep me sweat and odor free for over 48 hours. I apply a thin layer to each armpit after I shower and it dries in about 30 seconds. I&#x27;ve been using it over a month and have not seen any white marks left on my clothing. I definitely recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzAgent as part of a promotion from the brand.  That being said, I hadn&#x27;t used clear gel in a long time.  I remember that it didn&#x27;t always work for me before.  I was very skeptical.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I can say it works great!  It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, which is good.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this!</li>
    <li> This is better than their solid deodorant, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, great wetness protection and smells good, however it doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours!! I will probably go back to the secret clinical strength.&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free from BzzAgent for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> *I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel through BzzAgent and have been asked to share my unbiased and honest opinion.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deoderant is a must in order to avoid embarrasing, smelly situations. What do you do when your white solid is, well, the pits? (pun intended.) Solids leave clumps, dont apply well, and leave horrid white stains on clothes. This is nearly as embarrasing as what can happen if you dont use deodorant at all!  What is a lady to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is a Secret.....Secret Outlast Completley Clear Gel.  It has a nice but not overpowering scent. It will blend nicely with your own pH, scent, or blend in with yoir fragrance of choice. This gel goes on smooth. It does take a little bit more time to dry than solids, as can be expected with a gel.  This product did not leave behind any residue on my clothes, a big plus. For average daily activities, one application worked well. For more vigerous activity, I recommend bringing this along for reapplication. This product works well for most, myaelf included. Ladies who need a stronger product may need to reapply more often or use a more clinical strength formula.</li>
    <li> Secret outlast is working much better than any other deodorant and i have tried them all.  I did receive the clean clear gel secret as a free promotion however I am going to purchase more in the future  I told them I am surprised because normally I do not like a gel however with the no white spot guarantee it has been a wonderful product. Fantastic, I dont even worry about the white spots because it is true, there are not any!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent in order to try it out. I have tried many antiperspirant/deodorants in the past, they usually leave stains on my cloths.  If ive had a stressful day it doesnt protect me. I am very impressed with Secret Outlast. It works as well, if not better, than any other deodorants ive tried in the pass.  It goes on clear with no white staining of your clothes. It has a pleasant sporty scent that is not too strong. It dries very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on clothing. The protection is wonderful - it keeps me dry and smelling good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received my Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to review.  This works well and helps you feeling clean and smelling fresh all day! Check it out for yourself!</li>
    <li> I was pretty sceptical of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. I have never really liked gel deodorant. I was very pleasantly surprised. It didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin. It really does keep me dry without embarrassing white marks.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel gives me 48-hour odor protection with no white marks. It is so great that I will never have to use Secret Clinical again, plus I will save money. I am so tickled! The Completely Clean scent smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be given an opportunity to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel free through BzzAgent and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a shot.  I&#x27;m typically not a gel user as I grew up in Ohio and it is just too cold to put it on in our long winters that we experience, but getting stuck in my old ways, even after I moved to the south I still used the bar deodorant out of habit.  After giving this a shot, I realized that I liked the way this deodorant kept me clean and fresh longer than what I typically used, which was the Dove brand.  I should have known that Secret would exceed my expectations.  They are a trusted brand and have never let us women down.  When I write women down, I realized that it could be towards men as well as my husband has been using it as well and hasn&#x27;t had any negative things to say.  In fact, it even keeps him dry all day long and he&#x27;s always outside during work and play.  Thats when you know you have a good product :)</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a free sample of this from Bzzagent. I really like the scent of this deodorant. It offers great odor protection and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of white residue on skin or clothes. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t feel like it ever gets dry. I feel sticky after first putting it on, and then every time I sweat or get warm I feel wet and sticky again. It&#x27;s a good go to product for black dress days but I don&#x27;t like it for everyday when I want to feel dry. I will stick to my invisible solid.</li>
    <li> It works very well, long lasting, smelled good and certainly does not show on bra/clothing/underarms, but after a week of use I was having some sort of reaction as my underarms were continually itchy. I assume there is something in the gel formulation causing it, due to this I have switched back to my normal deodorant. *I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.*</li>
    <li> This product is long-lasting and didn&#x27;t leave those annoying marks on my clothes.  Not only did this antiperspirant last throughtout the workday, but it kept me dry and feeling fresh throughout my workout as well.  This product is at a price-point where you may think that this is a cheap product, however, there is nothing cheap about the quality of this product.  It goes on smooth and has a great feminine, clean, fresh scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell over-powering to the point where everyone around you can smell the aroma of your armpits.  Instead, it leaves you feeling dry and fresh without that overpowering smell.  #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Usually don&#x27;t get gel deodorants, but loved this one.  Dried quick and leaves none of those nasty white marks!!  So happy I got to try it for free will definitely be buying in the future,</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever did the chicken dance after putting on deodorant just wishing that your armpits would hurry and dry so you could put on your shirt, you know how important it is to find a deodorant that has a fast drying time and doesn&#x27;t rub off any residue on your shirt.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fast Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel dries and dries clear.  No more arm flapping during my morning routine before pulling on my shirt.</li>
    <li> This is the best, I am a runner and this keeps my clothes clean and I stay totally dry</li>
    <li> I usually use another brand but I was given the opportunity to try this Secret Outlast as part of a Bzz Campaign. I have to say I really like the fresh scent of the the Completely Clean scent. It is a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t complete with any perfume I may wear. The product works well and I find the area I apply it isn&#x27;t as dry as when I use other brands. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to try from the company Bzzagent.  I was very pleased with the protection it provided.  It says that it lasts 48 hours, and I only found it to work for 12, but it still worked a lot better than other brands in terms of wetness protection.  I had to apply it and then let it dry for about 5-10 minutes before putting my shirt on, which is a pain during my morning routine, but it&#x27;s been worth it.  For the few months before I got to try it, I was switching brands every few weeks because I was having such a hard time staying dry.  This has, by far, worked a lot better in my opinion.  I still have some problems if I get really hot or stressed, but it&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I really like the scent, as well.  I actually bought a bunch when they went on sale, so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out :)</li>
    <li> I have always been a Secret user.  The Invisible Solid stick is my go-to: full-size, travel-size - vanilla or coconut scented.  I&#x27;ve always felt that Secret has a formula that doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate your skin.  They don&#x27;t have over-powering scents.  I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free during a promotion and found they&#x27;ve stuck with that winning formula.  Whether I was baking in a hot kitchen, working out at the gym or stressing over a deadline, Secret&#x27;s Clear Gel didn&#x27;t fail me! They stayed true to what I&#x27;ve come to expect from them.  There is one aspect that prevented me from giving Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel a full 5 stars - and that is due to its ability to travel without making a mess.  I had it in my travel bag for the car trip this Thanksgiving holiday.  When I needed to apply it, I found that the container had been \\&quot;squeezed\\&quot; so that a lot of excess gel was on the top of the applicator - much more than I needed to use.  On the way home, I backed down the dial, so that there was extra head space under the applicator, which did help a bit.  If I was traveling via air, I would not use Secret Clear Gel, as I normally carry on my bag, and Secret Gel would be part of my liquid allotment, while the solid is not.  Overall, I was extremely satisfied with Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel - it kept me dry and still smelling great, even after a long sweat-filled workout!</li>
    <li> First, I like the scent of this antiperspirant.  It is a light smell.  It just smells clean.  That is how I want it to smell.  I do not want it to overpower my perfume.  I was unsure of the gel when I was started using this product.  I haven&#x27;t used a gel in about ten years or more.  Obviously, it is wet when it goes on.  However, it dries quick.  I put it on as soon as I wake up in the morning.  By the time that my makeup is done, it is totally dry.  I work eight hours a day.  I have never had to reapply.  It keeps my dry all day too.  I received the Secret Outlast as a campaign from BzzAgent.  It was free but I wanted to review it so that others may see how it performed for me.  These are my own opinions.</li>
    <li> Secret is a brand that everyone knows. I was happy to get reacquainted with it in a bzzagent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;I opened up the gel deodorant and clicked up... I applied and it was super cold, I used too much and it was so goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few hours, there was the scent. It was all I could smell. I mean All. I. Could. Smell.  It was super strong and the completely clean was sort of manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps for athletes or someone working outdoors, this might be a good option, but for this stay at home mom, it wasn&#x27;t. I will not be purchasing this type of deodorant.</li>
    <li> I was sent this free to review.  I have used it several times and think that it does all that it claims to do.  I can feel that it keeps me drier longer than other brands and it doesn&#x27;t stain or leave white marks on your dark colored shirts.  The only draw back I have with this product it that it is very wet and gooey/sticky when you first put it on.  This does go away after a few seconds so I don&#x27;t really find this to de a deal breaker.  I will for sure be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical after the first few day of using this product. I worried I wasn&#x27;t getting enough protection. I got used to the gel (I was a stick girl before) so it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. It doesn&#x27;t work for 48 hours for me, so I apply daily now, and it works better than other brands of stick that I had used daily, so that is a plus. I also don&#x27;t have wetness, which really makes me happy because I feel cleaner. I received mine free from BzzAgent to test out.</li>
    <li> I got my free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant from BzzAgent and took it with my on my vacation to New Orleans to see if it would really work in all that heat and humidity and it did! It kept me dry AND there were no white marks on the few black tops I did wear! Once my sample is gone I&#x27;d like to try one of the other scents. Secret Outlast is great if you&#x27;re heading off to someplace hot or that&#x27;s just the way it is for you year round. Also if sports are your thing then give this a try! We had a few days were it was close to 90 degrees and we walked all over the place. I had to keep wiping off my face but at the end of the day I was still pretty dry and using the product I didn&#x27;t worry about odor. I will write that initially, you have to get used to how the product feels when you first start using it because it might seem more liquid than what you might be used to but it does dry very quickly and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If I&#x27;d liked that particular scent just a bit more it would have been four and a half stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bounced between other forms of Secret, Dove, and Suave and tried Tom&#x27;s hoping to go the more natural product route. I hated Tom&#x27;s and I liked the others but never LOVED any of them. I avoided Secret Outlast even with coupons because of the price point, but no more! I have fallen in love with this deodorant! With other clear gel deodorants I find I have to turn it for each arm and that it doesn&#x27;t last long. With Outlast it really is one twist and I&#x27;m good. And ladies, those &amp;#34;check myself&amp;#34; moments that we&#x27;ve all had before we lift our arms - no more. I live in the hot desert so a good deodorant is a must and this one has made my list! Thanks BzzAgent for giving me a chance to try Secret Outlast!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first. I have used gel type deodorant in the past and could never really get past the cold, wet feeling under my arms early in the morning and have since been a stick type of gal, but honestly do not like the white residue it leaves on my clothes. When I received an offer to do this mission on BzzzAgent, I thought what the heck and gave it a shot. I was impressed! The wet feeling goes away quickly after applied and smells great! The best part...no unsightly white marks on my clothes! All in all, this product does it&#x27;s job wonderfully and I think we will make the switch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different kinds of deodorant, being the sweatball that I am, and I dislike a lot of \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scents.  I used Secret solid for a while, but the white marks were really starting to get to me.  The gel is awesome: it dries quickly (it does take a little getting used to if you don&#x27;t already use a gel), doesn&#x27;t have a horribly strong floral scent, and leaves few to no marks!  I got a sample from BzzAgent, but I&#x27;ve also purchased plenty of this in stores (including on Amazon).</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a Bzz Campaign. My go-to deodorant has always been the invisible solid -- only I can never find any that is truly &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;. Nothing&#x27;s worse than being at work all day only to discover that you&#x27;ve been walking around with deodorant stains on your shirt. I needed something I can put on quick, and trust that it won&#x27;t stain my clothes. I don&#x27;t want to have to check to make sure a couple of hours later that my deodorant stayed where it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great! It takes one swipe, dries really quickly, and NEVER leaves white residue. That&#x27;s definitely my favorite part about it -- and the scent is very nice too. It&#x27;s super clean smelling, and not overpowering at all. I can still smell it at the end of the day, and I&#x27;ve had no issues at all with needing to re-apply midway through the day. It lasts from the early morning until bed time. I will be purchasing this product in the future!</li>
    <li> I workout a lot and I sweat... a lot! Add to that, the fact that I live in Florida and it gets hot. So that means more sweating! And sometimes my old white stick deodorant just didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job. I had given up and came to terms with random white marks on my clothing thinking that was normal. Well that used to be the case until I tried Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. Finding the right deodorant can be time consuming and I had given up until I received a free sample of this gel from BzzAgent. It goes on smooth, dries quickly, smells great, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing! Could I ask for anything else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a fitness chick, I needed something that could hold up during my workouts. Now, I never leave home without my gym bag and my new favorite must-have: Secret Outlast. It fights through even my toughest sweat sessions, leaving me smelling fresh and no embarrassing white stuff on my shirts. Now I only have to concentrate on knocking out the weights and not whether the girl next to me can smell me...</li>
    <li> Got this from BzzAgent and it definitely lives up to it&#x27;s claims! I gave up gels and roll-on years ago because they went on so wet I&#x27;d end up flapping like a chicken waiting for them to dry - so I was pretty skeptical about Secret Outlast Clear Gel. Well, it does feel wet at first but dries very quickly (thank you!) and it kept me drier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I even was so bold as to give it the 48hr test on a Friday and Saturday - and I was dry and fresh almost until dinner Saturday night! So even though I still don&#x27;t like the feeling of application, it dries fast and totally works. Plus I don&#x27;t get white marks on my clothes anymore - yay!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not totally sold on using gel, I am in love with the Secret brand. Recently, I participated in the BzzAgent Campaign and received a free sample. It&#x27;s free so why not give it a test run, right?? I did notice that I received excellent protection (as I always do from the Secret brand); however, I just don&#x27;t like the gel feeling. I prefer the solid. I don&#x27;t typically sweat a lot but certain fabrics (like nylon) can cause odor to happen. A lot of my cute fall/winter cardigans for work are made of nylon and they make my underarms smell if I don&#x27;t make sure I hold my arms out from my body for a good portion of the day. I don&#x27;t have to do that with Secret Outlast!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing deodorant I have ever used. It really lasts all day even when you go to the gym you don&#x27;t have to worry about sweating. It still keeps you smelling fresh. Try it and you will never go back to your old deodorant!</li>
    <li> I was a die hard invisible solid fan! However, I was invited to try this through BzzAgent campaign. I adore the new Secret outlast completely clean clear gel!&lt;br /&gt;It protects me in my busiest hardest working and running around days! This is my new go - to deodorant !</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly convenient and yeah, the no white stuff is a total bonus too! I received a sample and started using it right away. Living in Phoenix, like I do, the entire population is exposed to extreme weather conditions, and with the minor exception of a little bit of sweat 8-10 hours after I put Secret on, I rarely have any perspiration stains. Oh, and the fact that there&#x27;s no filmy or flaky white stuff is a HUGE bonus!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is absolutely fantastic. I got it for free to try from BzzAgent and it definitely works great. I can put it on with or without clothes, and haven&#x27;t had one streak or white spot anywhere. It has lasts all day, which is perfect for running on the go. No stickiness from the gel either.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Product delivers as promised. Thumbs Up from me.I received the product as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I have never had a gel antiperspirant that i could put on one minute followed by my shirt and not have white marks!! Love it!! The scent is subtle but strong enought to last all day. i will be adding this to my grocery list for personal hygiene products!</li>
    <li> I normally wear the Secret brand anyways, so I already knew I would like this campaign.  I didn&#x27;t know I would love it though. I get to test products for free from BzzAgent and believe you me...I am brutally honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Secret Deodorant in its solid white form for as long as I can remember.  We are talking...since I was a teenager, and though beauty products regimens have come and gone, the Secret brand has stayed the same.  I tried a different brand of deodorant this summer that was &amp;#34;more natural&amp;#34; and I found out the hard way that I naturally stink.  The cheating on Secret lasted 1 month.  On to my review for Secret Outlast....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually did try the gel form that Secret put out before in the past and didn&#x27;t like it.  It took to long to dry and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as its sister solid form.  After showering and shaving (this is part of the test), I put the Secret Outlast on the left pit and the Secret solid on right.  Now normally in the past, the gel form still felt wet, even after a couple of minutes and you couldn&#x27;t immediately dress.  At least the top portion of your body.  This wasn&#x27;t the case this time.  The left pit dried immediately and there was no stinging that you sometimes feel when the deodorant is wet and you had just shaved.  Nice.  Now on to a black turtleneck.  I put the sweater on slowly as to not mess up my hair, but I wanted to see if white marks were left.  There was a tiny bit, but from the right side!  It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it was still visible. The marks came off easily with a damp cloth so no change of wardrobe this time around but I am curious of how much I actually rubbed off my right pit?  Ugh..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day was busy and I honestly forgot about the campaign until I was getting ready to go out after work.  My deodorants were both still working hard and I honestly felt my left pit was fresher than the right. huh...  I had Secret Outlast with me and refreshed both arms, waited a few seconds and was good to go the rest of the evening.  When you can wear the same clothing after a busy day and not be embarrassed to raise your hand that evening in front of others, then you know you TRUST your deodorant and trust is key when it comes to body odor.  The next day, I slathered on my Secret Outlast on both pits before my morning working out and was extremely happy.  I sweated (slightly), but I didn&#x27;t stink.  Happy, slightly sweaty lady here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the gel form since the initial run and plan to switch when it runs out (I will keep my solid as back-up.)  I am glad that Secret has made a way the Gel form works and the cost (for now) is comparative to the other Secret deodorant forms.  As I said before, I have left this brand...maybe twice in the last 30 years and have always come back.  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel will convince me to stay for good.</li>
    <li> I have been blown away by the effectiveness of this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Deodorant. I received it for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I have to say, I usually think deodorant is pretty much the same across the board, but in this case I realized I was wrong. This product glides on smoothly and then dries rapidly to a non-sticky finish. It never has left a powdery white residue on any of my clothes, which I appreciate. I like how it smells. It&#x27;s not a baby powdery scent like so many deodorants, but rather a fresh, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the scent of my lotion or perfume. My favorite thing about it, though, is how long it keeps me odor-free. While I&#x27;ve never put the 48-hour odor protection claim to the test, I can attest that I still feel and smell fresh a full 24 hours after applying. I love this!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel was great.  It provided a lot of odor protection.  It was easy to apply.  When you click up the product, I learned quickly that I really didn’t need a lot and that one click was plenty.  I was skeptical with their claim that it dries in seconds but it really does!  I have tried other gels and they have left my shirt wet.  Not this!  It always felt great too as it was cool to the skin when you applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as coverage, one application really does last all day and I never really needed to reapply it.  So far, it hasn’t left any white marks on my clothes and the typical deodorant build-up on your clothes (even with washing) does not apply to this deodorant. If it saves my clothes, that makes it even more cost-effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didn’t like was travelling with it.  Moving it around in a bag made the product gunk up at the top on the cap.  That can make for a little bit of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I loved the deodorant and would recommend it.  I did receive this product free through BzzAgent as a promotion from Secret.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of deodorants, this one has worked the best.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes and I wear a lot of dark colors.  It keeps the odor at bay, whereas before my previous ones wouldn&#x27;t.  I chase around a toddler all day and spend lots of time outside.  90% of the time it kept the wetness away, there were times when I was really hot the wetness came through.  But I&#x27;m also 6 months pregnant so hormones aren&#x27;t helping with that and live in southern Texas.  I will be continuing to use this deodorant and getting rid of all my clinical strength ones.  Secret Outlast has worked better than those.</li>
    <li> Well, it does the job.  It isn&#x27;t a superior product, in my mind, but neither is it terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free from BzzAgent to try and review.  I was not paid for this review, nor were there any inducements to provide a favorable review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the positives.  It does work as an antiperspirant.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; the Dove product I was using prior to try this.  They both are effective in wetness protection and odor control for between 18-30 hours, depending on my day.  As promised, it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing.  But then, my regular product didn&#x27;t either, despite not being promoted for that.  It dries completely within 15 seconds.  You can see how much product is left in the tube, so there&#x27;s no surprises in running low.  It was kinda satisfying measuring out one &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; of product per underarm, which covered the job nicely.  The impression of precision was pleasing.  (I know, maybe I&#x27;m a little weird.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives.  The scent was too powdery for my liking, and strong enough to interfere with my perfume.  The wet/sticky feeling on application was unpleasant, even though it did dry quickly.  I prefer the creamier consistency of other formulas to the gel, for that reason, and also because the gel seemed to leave the skin on my underarms dry... not in the sense of only an absence of sweat, but of powdery dry, parched skin.</li>
    <li> I got this free to test from BzzAgent. Works really great. Goes on clear, dries quickly and does not leave any white residue. Still smelling great after working out at the gym! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I received the Active Fresh scent and it smells great! It goes on clear and quickly absorbs. There&#x27;s no left over wetness that forces me to walk around with my arms in the air. So far it&#x27;s been working great to keep myself dry and in the Texas heat that&#x27;s pretty important. The clicking system works really well and it comes out quickly Overall, I would say it&#x27;s a pretty good deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.</li>
    <li> Always have to wait for it to dry off for 5-10 minutes at least before putting dark clothes on or I&#x27;ll end up having to deal with the white stain before I go to work</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive this product for free and to try it out. I was not a lover of clear deodorants in the past but Secret Outlast clear gel has made me a believer! It stopped the sweat in its track and smelled fresh. I would recommend this to any woman! (Or man) :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant.  I used it before doing my workout today and it worked out great!  The smell of it alone is amazing.  It goes on clear and dries clear so no ugly white marks on my sports bra!  I&#x27;ll definitely stick with it! #HappyCamper</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast free from BzzAgent and Secret. Smells amazing, fresh and clean! Lasted all day and no white marks!!</li>
    <li> Got m y free sample from bzzagent works so good love this product secret outlast clear gel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many deodorants in the past, and usually prefer to use the solid kind instead of the Gel formulas. However, the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel has completely changed my preferences! Normally, I find that the gel formulas are too wet, and take too long to dry. This product was perfect! It smelled great, was quick and easy to use and was amazingly effective! I applied the deodorant once in the morning before leaving my house and was set for the whole day of errands running around the city! It leaves no white marks, or wet marks and is completely dry in seconds! The product is definitely better than other deodorants I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!  I remember using gel deodorants in my teens with little success.  They offered no protection and felt weird.  I am so glad I got this sample for free from Secret.  I still have trouble finding deodorants that work sine I live in a  humid part of the country and Summers and stress leave me in desperate need of a deodorant/antiperspirant that works!  This one made it through my morning workout with no worries and  didn&#x27;t feel slimy or leave white marks on my clothes.  I like the clean, but not overpowering scent.  I think I will buy more when my current deodorant runs out and give this one a shot for a while.  Why haven&#x27;t I tried this sooner?!</li>
    <li> I am trying this deodorant for free thanks you Secret. I love this deodorant. It smells great and lasts all day long for me. There is not white residue on my clothes or my under arms. The white residue is embarrassing. The gel feels great going on my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
    <li> First off, thanks to BzzAgent and Secret for letting me try out this product for free! I have never been a fan of gel deodorant for a few reasons; 1) my underarms are a bit sensitive and 2) I sweat quite a bit during the spring/summer months. I have never been able to find a product that works well enough for my needs. I&#x27;m pretty active at work, so I need something that can keep up with my constant moving around. I&#x27;ve tried MANY different kinds of deodorants: gel, spray, solid, powder, crystal sticks, clinical strength, etc. All of them have had an end result of still feeling moist, and within an hour or so, my shirt is soaked through and it is quite embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the Secret Outlast Gel. I shaved my underarms the night before to avoid any irritation. I showered, washed my underarms and dried them thoroughly. After a few clicks of the wheel, the gel was starting to come out of the applicator. The smell was okay, but not my favorite. It had a fresh clean kind of scent, but it was a little overpowering. I applied the deodorant and as expected with a gel, I got that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling in my pits. I waited a few minutes and thought maybe it would dry completely. Nope! I stood in front of a fan with the air directly blowing into my underarms. Still not there. My underarms were still wet from the gel about 10 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;After giving up on the drying, I decided to throw a shirt on and deal with the moist-ness. Then I began to feel a slight burning sensation, but not bad enough that I wanted to wash it off. Sort of felt like a mild sunburn, but no visible irritation. I left the deodorant on and went to work, hoping that the burning meant it would work better.&lt;br /&gt;My pits were wet all day and the sweat soaked through my shirt anyway.  I ended up using the deodorant for a few more days and luckily never got the burning sensation again, but I&#x27;m sad to say this deodorant didn&#x27;t help with perspiration. I probably won&#x27;t buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Compared to other deodorants that I&#x27;ve used, this one is by far the best working. I&#x27;m a first time mom and don&#x27;t always get to shower every day. With my previous deodorant, I&#x27;d always end up smelling on my non shower days. When I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear deodorant, free from BzzAgent, I was surprised that I still smelled clean on the days I didn&#x27;t get a chance to shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because after cranking up the gel, I was left with a fourth of an EMPTY container. VERY misleading to the eye initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am able to overlook that fact due to the wonders it does for me. NO white marks left on my clothes, it DRIES very quickly and SMELLS great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be making a switch to this deodorant from now on.</li>
    <li> Growing up, my mom sold Avon so we constantly had roll-on deodorant in our house and I h-a-t-e-d it.  I think I always associated any sort of clear deodorant with that.  So when I \\&quot;grew up\\&quot; and had to start buying my own, it was always a solid deodorant.    I was hesitant to try this because of those reservations from my youth, but I gave it a go.  Wow!  I love that I can put my deodorant on BEFORE putting on my shirt and there&#x27;s no fear of a white residue left behind!  In fact, I&#x27;ve found that now I put it on before drying my hair or applying some makeup and it dries in a minute or so, then I put my shirt on and it doesn&#x27;t leave behind a wet feeling.  It&#x27;s great.    By the end of the day, I still smell as fresh as I did in the morning.  I think I may be converting to clear gel now.  Thanks, BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to sample this brand!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try a new brand of deodorant but received this&#x27;s as part of a bzzagent campaign to try for free.  It did as promised.  Clean and dry for around 36 hours( as long as it was tested on me).  I will stick to my normal brand though because I did not like the scents offered.  Was good at Odor protection and dryness though.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret I was given the opportunity to try this deodorant for free through a BzzCampaign. I haven&#x27;t tried a gel deodorant in years due to that wet, slimy, sticky feeling you get on the under arms of your shirt because the stuff just never dries. I must say this deodorant does dry within a few minutes and does not leave white marks - tested this by putting my shirt on after apply.  The smell is nice and it did last a full 24 hours before I felt as though it was wearing off. The con for me personally is I have pretty sensitive skin and after 4 days this started to make my skin itch a bit.</li>
    <li> I recently received secret outlast as part of a promotion from the brand. I love it!!! I have a new favorite deodorant no white marks and I&#x27;m dry and no smells all day.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample because I am a Bzzagent. I had used gels in the past and just felt very uncomfortable. This gel however, has a wonderful scent and lasted during a camping trip I took this weekend. It&#x27;s lasting power is amazing!! I liked the fact it had a very fruity scent and didn&#x27;t smell like a typical deodorant. I will be buying this again!!</li>
    <li> Here to spread the buzz as a buzzagent. Not a fan of clear gels but very impressed with the coverage.  Love my free sample.</li>
    <li> I just got my free deodorant from Secret and buzagent and So so much I love this deodorant!! It goes on easy and dries super fast. And oh my it smells so so good. AND NO WHITE MARKS! 48 hour protection and it works for every single hour. I&#x27;ll never have to buy an expensive extra strength deodorant again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the original solid Secret for years. In the past I had tried gels, but have always switched back because it seemed like the gel took so long to dry on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from BzzAgent a couple of days ago and have been using it it since. The scent is good - my husband says it smells like gummy bears. The texture is nice and not too heavy. It seemed to dry almost instantly. There was tiny bit of a sting when I put it on right after shaving my underarms. It contains some alcohol which probably explains that because I don&#x27;t usual get that sting using the original solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put the original solid on after my shower and before I go to bed and again before getting dressed in the morning. I have been doing the same with the Outlast, but that may be overkill, as I don&#x27;t seem to need it in the morning like I do the original solid.  Also, as you would expect, there are no worries about getting white marks on your clothes with the clear gel, so that is a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product a B+ due to the slight sting and the higher price versus the original solid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Secret and BZZAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my small sample, the gel looked almost completely gone.. Maybe due to heat? IDK. But it smells good, compared to other deodorants I have tried, so that&#x27;s a good thing. I don&#x27;t normally use gel deodorants, I usually stick with a clear solid types. But I give this a 3 star due to the sample.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bounced from one style deodorant to the next from year to year.  Solids always left an immediately noticeable white mark, gels worked for me for awhile - but even they usually left some white,  rollons take forever to dry - but seemed to stay pretty clear (after a few months of using these my arms seem to break out in hives though), sprays are complicated to get on (I have to hold my breath because I simply cannot tolerate the fumes).  Then BzzAgent gave me an option to try the outlast campaign for free, I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Secret Outlast for about a week now with good results.  Goes on easy, dries quickly, the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and it seems to last throughout the day.  I wore a black tshirt yesterday and went for a 2 hour walk in Florida, no bad smells - no white rub off on my shirt. The best part, so far no hives!  The gel deodorants I used years ago still left a lot of white residue even though they were &amp;#34;goes on clear, leaves no white marks&amp;#34; and living in Florida I wear a lot of tank-tops.  I haven&#x27;t worn tanks w/ this one yet, but so far no noticeable residue on the insides of my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands right now, I&#x27;ll probably be buying a full tube once my complementary tube is gone.  We&#x27;ll see if my hives come back w/ more use or not.</li>
    <li> Received this product thanks to a bzz campaign from Bzz agent.  As a family we are normally dove deodorant users.  Well that changes now.. Gave this product to my 13 yr old daughter that was competing in horse shows all weekend in 106 degree heat index.  She loves this product. No white residue and although she was really sweaty no stinky odor... Thank you..</li>
    <li> I got to try this deodorant free from Secret, and was super excited to get the chance to do so. I have tried nearly every deodorant out there, and this is one of the best. Normally i go with an invisible solid, they seem to last longer and dont leave residue behind like most clear gels or roll ons ive tried. However, when i was given the chance to try this gel, i gave it a shot. The gel goes on smooth and a little goes a long way. The scent is refreshing and not overpowering, and the gel is thick enough to not run or drip when applying but not too thick that it would leave any residue behind. I was surprised at how fast it dried, and i was able to put my top on right away without fear of it leaving any marks or wetness. There was no stickiness or greasy residue either, which i have encountered with other gel formulas. The scent was pleasant, i hope they offer other variations and scents in the future. Overall i was very pleased with the product! My one suggestion to people buying it would be to not turn the dial too far, you dont need very much, and it will last much longer if you use just what you need, plus it dries faster that way too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy about this deodorant as it did not agree with me but I gave the rest to my friend and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I tried the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel Deodorant through a product campaign with bzzagent. Unfortunately, I am not very fond of it. There is a very discernible chemical smell I noticed very early on, as soon as I removed the safety seal. The gel, is very wet and gooey and hard to tolerate leaving on until it dries. It also has a very aluminum content, and I typically do not choose that. Although the product works alright, I do not anticipate using it again as the ickiness outweighs the dryness...</li>
    <li> I am super impressed on the way this deodorant works. I haven&#x27;t used as gel in a while now because a lot of them are just to sticky for me weather they work or not. I opened the lid up and you can smell the fresh scent even through the plastic sticker. Thats important to me because I like to know what it smells like before I buy something like this. The dial was easy to turn and I got a even amount of gel all through the top of the applicator . Which is great because you want even coverage when using a deodorant . I used 3 swipes on each arm pit, proceeded to put me shirt on and wait. Not only did this deodorant keep me smelling fresh, and feeling clean. There was no white marks on my shirt. Which is another plus cause i wear a lot of darker shirts so with other deodorants you tend to get those white chalky lines that everyone knows when you put it on. So through out the day I always have a full schedule with the house and kids and just the stress in general on top of being hot. So , this seems to be perfect for me, No odor, no sweat marks, no white residue, no sticky feeling . All that you get is clean fresh protection that last for 48 hours. I have been so impressed with this deodorant that my kids are going away and I bought my oldest daughter one so she can be protected during her vacation and not have to worry about re applying her deodorant during the day. I was able to #getitfree from #bzzagent #secretoutlast @secretdeodorant @bzzagent #epic48</li>
    <li> In my line of work, I sweat a lot.  To put things in perspective, I am required to wear 100% polyester long sleeved shirts and 100% polyester pants year round - indoors and outdoors.  I average anywhere between 6 miles and 10 miles a day walking/running at work in above mentioned polyester uniforms.  I have always had the problem of finding the right deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t leave me smelling funky throughout the day and also to keep me dry.  I used to use Arid and Degree but those started failing me.  I switched to men&#x27;s deodorant which worked for a while (really liked the Old Spice and Axe brands) but they started failing as well.  On a whim and under the perception that &amp;#34;well, I&#x27;ll try this to see if it works&amp;#34; I lucked up and found a deodorant that has not only upheld what it says on the container but has also made me feel great in the way that I don&#x27;t stink and my pits are dry throughout my shift at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received an invitation from BzzAgent to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel I jumped on the chance to join the campaign so that I could spread word about how awesome this stuff is.  The sample they sent me was the same kind I had used previously - the &amp;#34;completely  clean&amp;#34; and it has been put to good use.  Words can&#x27;t rightly describe how enthusiastic I am over this product and/or brand.  You can believe that it does what it says on the container.... Outlast!  Put it on once in the morning and not have to worry about sweaty pits or smelling funky the rest of your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone, but I would advise that if you want to purchase it cheaper, don&#x27;t purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Secret but my opinions are all my own. Secret Outlast goes on clear there are no white marks. I didn&#x27;t even have to worry when wearing black no streaks or marks which was really nice. It gave great protection even during my workouts I stayed dry! I love the scent too.</li>
    <li> Thanks secret deodorant for sending me this product to try for free! It works! Last longer than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great that it goes on clear. Poor odor and sweat protection. I got a sample free from secret to try and I&#x27;m glad I got to try before buying because I would have been upset with spending money on this product. After everyday activity (nothing strenuous) I had BO and I sweat like crazy.</li>
    <li> I did receive this as a free sample from BzzAgent. This does not affect my review at all. As a busy mom I am constantly running around all day. That mixed with the fact that I live in the middle of the Mojave Desert in California can make for some not great smells coming from me...yuck! With my old deodorant I would find myself applying it multiple times a day just to make sure I never smelled bad. With Secret Outlast Clear Gel I only have to apply once in the morning and I am good to go all day. Even in this + 100 degree summer weather. I love the fact that it is clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about lifting up my arms when I am wearing tank tops or getting those dreaded white marks on my shirts. I am all for the simple things in life!</li>
    <li> I suppose relative to other people,  I can be described as a “heavy applier” of deodorant, especially the gel kind. For many years, my regular brand of deodorant was Mitchum in the gel kind, but I always used 2 clicks per armpit and that was a lot of product. After having my son, however, the Mitchum seemed less effective in keeping me fresh and dry. Perhaps my “Ph balance” changed. So I switched to Dove in a solid, but lately have been thinking about trying something else. I found myself having to reapply midday, and always before a workout. Even so, I didn’t always feel so fresh by bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clear from Secret as part of a brand promotion, I was happy to try it out but I wasn’t expecting a huge difference in my normal routine. Was I surprised! The first time I used it was just a normal workday, but it was hot out so I wanted to wear a sleeveless blouse. I applied 2 clicks of the Secret Outlast under each arm and let the gel completely dry before putting on my shirt. It did seem to take a little while to dry, but I was used to the solid (and dealing with white marks) so this wasn’t a big deal for me. Secret Outlast Completely Clear kept me dry and smelling nice all day long – no hint of odor even by the end of the day. This was better than my regular solid deodorant, since I did not have to reapply, but I hadn’t done anything strenuous during the day to really test out the potency. The next test day, another regular workday, I used only one click per underarm, which dried quite a bit faster than two clicks. Still, at the end of the day I was nice and fresh! I was starting to really like this new product. I used it again on a weekend, on a day where I was hosting a barbeque at my house. It was very hot out, and during the day I was outside grilling, steaming clams on a hot stove, chasing the kids with water balloons, and ending the night with a fire in the fire pit. I couldn’t’ believe after allthat activity that I literally did not have a hint of odor at the end of the day. Secret Outlast Completely Clear even managed to keep on doing its thing after I got thrown in the pool and completely soaked! I’m sold on switching to this product and ditching my old solid. The major factors for me were: never having to worry about white marks on my clothes, not having to reapply deodorant throughout the day, and never having any hint of odor at the end of the day. I’ve even found that I wake up smelling fresher – rest assured that this product really lasts for 24+ hours! I haven’t tried going a full 48 without a fresh application, but I can tell you that if I happened to forget applying this in the morning one day, I wouldn’t have to make an emergency trip to the drug store or fear stinking up my office. I have confidence that Secret Outlast Completely Clear would get me through the full 48 with no issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I didn’t give Secret Outlast Completely Clear a full five stars was because the scent, while pleasant, was a just a bit too strong for me. But that is just personal preference, not a problem with the product. Also, I have very sensitive skin and I noticed that if I used Secret Outlast Completely Clear immediately after showering and shaving, I did experience some stinging and slight irritation. Again, I acknowledge that I have really sensitive skin, so many people probably would not have this issue. For me, I just waited 20 minutes or so after my shower to apply the product, and avoided the sting. I will be switching from my regular brand to this product – but I will try to find another scent option by Secret. Even if all the Secret scents are as strong as the Completely Clear, I will just live with it. It’s worth it to feel fully confident in my moisture and odor protection, while also banishing white marks!</li>
    <li> I got to try the secret outlast sample yesterday for free from buzzagent, and at first I was really liking it. I&#x27;m not one for gels, since they are messier and normally they don&#x27;t seem to last too long. I was excited at the prospect of not having white marks on all my shirts. The smell was pleasant, strong, but not over powering. I was all set to give this thing 5 stars. Then later that night, I was about to do some grocery shopping with my hubs, I glanced in the mirror and saw big yellow marks on my brand new (blue) shirt (i had just gotten in a day before for my birthday) I was livid. I took the shirt off and inspected it. Every single spot that got touched by the deodorant was off colored. Hubs was in a hurry, so I changed put on my normal deodorant and ran out the door. When we got back I hand washed the shirt, scrubbing out each yellow spot. The ONLY reason this is getting  1 star is because MOST of it washed out. There is still some bleached spots, but aren&#x27;t hugely noticeable unless you&#x27;re looking for them.  I will NOT be buying this, or recommending this to anyone. No white marks sure, but it will discolor and stain clothes. I&#x27;ll take the white marks.</li>
    <li> I got a sample version of this deodorant free thanks to Secret through BzzAgent. I want to give my honest opinion so here it goes. Initially I loved the idea of having a no &amp;#34;white marks&amp;#34; deodorant. I love wearing tank tops in the summer but hate the white marks my supposedly invisible solids still give me. The first time I put it on, it smelled really good. I did 2 clicks since I sweat a lot. I put it under my arm but noticed that it took a while (at least 30 seconds) for it to dry. Luckily I didn&#x27;t have a shirt on yet or my shirt would have been wet. Once it dried I put my shirt on and noticed no white marks. Throughout the day, it seemed to keep my dry but the odor protection just wasn&#x27;t there. After about 4 hours, I started noticing that the scent was going away and I was smelling my armpit instead. YUCK. The positives are it&#x27;s no white marks and that it keeps you dry. The negatives are its lack of long odor protection and the non-fast drying when you first put it on. Maybe it would work for others who don&#x27;t sweat as much as me.</li>
    <li> All in all a good product. Smells great and lasts for the day. I&#x27;m used to a clinical strength deodorant/antiperspirant that lasts a full 24 to even 36 or more hours. My body seemed to get used to this and it didn&#x27;t work as effectively weeks 3-4 for me. Was happy to test this free thanks to BzzAgent and all of the thoughts and opinions are 100% my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells great! Lasts for 18-24 hours. Smell free hot days and workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive. Not as strong or long lasting as other brands or clinical strengths.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try from BzzAgent. WOW! What a difference it made! I&#x27;ve never before tried a deodorant that felt so refreshing! I throw mine in the freezer a few mins before a shower, to make it extra cool on these hot, sticky summer days. It dries quickly, leaves no gunky residue AND last through even the most trying of my busy mom moments! The best part? I can wear black again! No more white stains, no more fear of wearing tank tops! I am a new lifetime fan of Secret Outlast and I DARE you to try it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I  had received this product for free for reviewing purposes thanks to bzzagent and secret. I love my secret outlast clear gel. It outlasts those hard workouts, those extremely hot and sweaty days, and even those lazy days. There is no white marks on your black clothes and none of those nasty deodorant balls that always seem to collect in your armpits. Although I don&#x27;t advise not showering for 48 hours, it would probably last you that long! great for camping when you cant shower :) It also dries very quickly. And when you are sweating, it keeps your armpits dry, no more nasty pit stains!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was given this deodorant for free as a bzz agent and to give my opinion on it. I have been using  secret outlast for almost two weeks and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I did my normal exercise routine and still felt and smelled fresh. I always wanted to do the black dress test(don&#x27;t laugh) but I did it and no white marks at all. If you need a great deodorant that will last up to 48 hours I highly suggest Secret Outlast.</li>
    <li> Yowza! Im beating the heat with Secret&#x27;s new Outlast clear gel. It goes on clear and smooth and stays that way all day long. Ive not only noticed it lasting longer, but Im also sweating less. Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent for giving me a chance to review such a stellar product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like gel, I&#x27;m a solid type of girl. But I got in on the BzzAgent deal and decided I&#x27;d give it a try. The first day I tried it out was a big deal, I figured go big or go home right? I put it on right before heading to the gym! I had a class immediately following my gym time, so I was really crossing my fingers it would hold up and I wouldn&#x27;t be nasty for class. It did! My underarms smelled just as good as when I put it on! ...Okay maybe not as good, but was def. still perfumy and not sweaty smelling. I&#x27;ve used it every day since and looking forward to purchasing a full size! Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m really thinking of leaving behind my solid!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant free from bzzagent. I have been trying this deodorant everyday for the past couple weeks and I still really like it. I don&#x27;t know if it lasts 48 hours since I do shower everyday lol. However, after a long day of being in and out of the humid Georgia  weather and then going straight to bed, I don&#x27;t wake up with an odor like I have with my other deodorants. It does have an overpowering smell to it that does last all day  but I haven&#x27;t been noticing it as much like I did when I first started wearing it. I do like the smell a lot. It glides on smooth, dries fast and you don&#x27;t need a lot. I like how a little comes out each time you turn the dial so too much won&#x27;t be used.</li>
    <li> Thank you Bzz Agent for letting me try the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel deordarant. It&#x27;s a gel deordarant that&#x27;s definitly not sticky like gel products, it&#x27;s like water. You put it on and it&#x27;s not sticky at all and lasts for two days on without reapplication. My regular deordarant I apply twice a day, and I get the ball effect under my arms. This is definitly a keeper.</li>
    <li> Works all day with a clean scent</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample by being a BzzAgent and I’m so glad that I did.  I decided to try this the morning I picked out my favorite black t-shirt to wear.  I normally have to be very careful when putting it on so that no deodorant stains get on my shirt, we all know how much we hate that but with Secret Outlast Clear Gel I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that, so the day was off to a good start.  It was  a busy day at work, with two surprise meetings and still smelled fresh by my 3:00 Starbucks break but the real test would come later.  So, it was time for 6:00 pm Zumba class, I was kind of skeptical because on a super busy day ending with Zumba I would normally go with a clinical strength deodorant but to my surprise and hour later class was over and I was still feeling confident, Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant had not failed me.  I am definitely sold, much lighter feel than the clinical kinds, didn&#x27;t leave me with that thick coating feeling and it&#x27;s clear.  I would say you at least have to try it, if nothing else your black clothes will thank you!  :)</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant for a few reasons. I love that it&#x27;s clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about white powder on my black shirts. I also like that it dries in minutes and keeps me fresh AND dry all day long. I live in Florida so that is a big bonus for me.  The only negative thing is, I wish they had more of a scent selection.  I did receive a small sample for free to review for BZZagent.</li>
    <li> I recieved a complimentary sample from BzzAgent and I really like the scent of this deodorant and There are no white marks that you have to worry about. Full 48 hour protection isn&#x27;t so, more like 24 hour protection which is still great to me. You should definitely try this product out! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It smells so great.  And its so refreshing.  I have a lawn mowing business so I tend to get really hot and sweaty while doing my job.  I put this stuff on before I went out to do a lawn...First off let me start by saying, this gel isnt like other gels.  With other gels I got that sticky, heavy, wet feeling...not with this.  It drys to a smooth finish.  Also with most gels, I tended to get sticky under the arms after I sweat...again, not with this one, it kept me feeling cool and dry.  It really makes me feel clean.  Most anti-persporat I wear, tends to get that nasty smell, you know what I mean, when it mixes with sweat,  Again, not this one, it keeps its clean fresh smell after wards.  I did recive this product free from bzzagent, and I can not thank them enough.  I&#x27;ll never use anther deo.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample for free from Secret to try and I absolutely love it. My skin is very sensitive and I also have allergies to stromg overpowering scents and this deodorant didn&#x27;t cause any underarm breakouts or allergic reactions. I love that it lasts for 48 hours and doesn&#x27;t leave those pesky white marks. I definitely recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received my free sample of this product from Secret and I&#x27;m loving it! Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is different from other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling like other gel deodorants. The best part is no white marks! I can get dressed and get going right away. I put it to the test at the gym as soon as I got it. The deodorant outlasted my tough work unlike other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried in the past. After my sample ran out I went out a bought a full sized product. I definitely won&#x27;t be keeping this Secret to myself!</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m an invisible solid kinda girl.  I don&#x27;t like the gooey feel under my arms. The protection is fair at best. It definitely doesn&#x27;t last the advertised 48 hours. I&#x27;m glad I #gotasample from BzzAgent, to try it for free</li>
    <li> i love the secret outlast. keeps me dry and fresh smelling all day long. i got a sample from bzzagent to try for free. my daughters even love it.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of secret outlast in order to share my unbiased opinion product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com. the different scents are all really good but my favorite was the completely clean. it really does last for 48 hours i tried it out under harsh summer conditions with 86 degree days chasing children playing baseball and hiking. WITH THREE KIDS THEY CAN KEEP YOU MOVING AND WORKING UP A SWEAT!  It stood up to the test. it is stronger than any deodorant I have ever tried and it really does go on clear. i am completely satisfied and would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product!! This goes on and dries so quick. It leaves no white marks on clothes. Best part,  at the end of the day it&#x27;s still working!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and I received a Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try for free and then give my reviews. I had never used Gel type Deodorant before. I always for some reason bought Solids. But then I found out that some solids get dried  and becomes caked very quickly in their container and then they just come loose and fall off.So,I was pretty excited when I got accepted for this campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a feeling that I might like this product because I knew that it won&#x27;t have the drying out issue with it. First when I opened it I had to smell it and see what it smells like. I loved its fresh smell which was  kind of like a little sportsy but definitely it is not overpoweringly perfume like. I get headaches when I put on a strong perfume or any one else that is wearing a strong perfume around me.This one didn&#x27;t give me any headaches and in fact I enjoy its smell a lot and I  using it everyday in the Morning after shower is my favorite thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in the Library of my School and in that small library at a time there are over 30 bodies and it starts getting very stuffy and warm in there. I normally start sweating and mostly in my underarms but Secret Outlast does what it says and keeps me fresh  whole day long and even after coming home I still feel fresh and clean. I would definitely recommend this product to people who are reading the reviews and to the people that I know.I personally will definitely buy this product.</li>
    <li> I got this secret outlast for free to review from BuzzAgent, I was excited because secret usually is top notch for your anti  persipirant, so I got my in completely clean scent which isn&#x27;t too overpowering. Thats the only star they get. Here is why, I give it one star, you have to turn click so many times for the deodarant to stick out! Once it&#x27;s at the top, their is only half a bottle of deodarant left! That&#x27;s a rip off! The amount that is stated on the bottle is 2.7 oz, that&#x27;s a lie. Half of it is filled with space. If I had to pay for,this I would return it immediately, then when you glide it on, it&#x27;s very cold and slimy and you have to wait a minute or two to dry otherwise it leaves a wet spot, them after first use, the holes it clogged make a big mess for the deodorant. If it can have better engineered bottle like their solid deodarant the.n I would recommend, but sorry I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> I tend to jump from deodorant to deodorant, trying to find one that works well. From solids that leave a white mark on your clothes, to clear gel sticks that give a sticky residue, to odor protection that does not last all day, I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a favorite. I am in Florida, so finding a deodorant that can last all day in high temperatures is essential. When the BzzAgent Campaign offered a free sample, I thought I&#x27;d give yet another deodorant a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Completely Clean certainly has a long lasting odor protection. I find that at the end of the day, other deodorants have reached the end of their efficacy, especially if I have to work late. Trying this new deodorant keeps me fresh much longer into the night. I found it dried quickly after application, so I need not be concerned about deodorant getting on my clothes as I dressed. No white residue was apparent, very important when wearing darker colors. The one thing that was inconsistent was the number of &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; it took for the deodorant to come to the top. At times, one click was all that was needed. At others, 3-5 clicks were necessary. Occasionally, a single click resulted in more deodorant than needed coming out. Despite a somewhat inconsistent application, Secret Outlast is overall an excellent product that I will undoubtedly be using again.</li>
    <li> This has probably been my regular brand for many years and will be my go to for many more years. The smell is fresh and I never have to question whether or not I&#x27;ve put any on. I&#x27;ve never had to worry about it staining my clothes.</li>
    <li> works great! leaves you feling dry without getting white al over your clothes</li>
    <li> I will be the first to admit....I was skeptical.  Gel deodorant in my experience, has been slimy and messy.  I&#x27;ve not used one that I really enjoyed the smell.  Secret Outlast Clear Gel wasn&#x27;t slimy or messy.  I liked the scent! I wouldn&#x27;t say that it lasts 48 hours, but that may be because I&#x27;m a \\&quot;plus size\\&quot; woman.  It did last the whole day, which is not something I&#x27;ve experienced before. I look forward to trying other secret clear gel products!  I did receive this product as part of a promotion for the brand.</li>
    <li> First I would like to say that I hate being cold and putting cold things against my skin! Trying this during the winter, they gel was really cold and has made me hesitant to apply the gel deodorant. That being said, after a day or two straight of wearing it (new mom- showers aren&#x27;t always a priority!) I did smell the deodorant. I haven&#x27;t given this product a good sweat, and I am anxious to try this during the summer or at least when it warms up so I can really give this a go!  Disclaimer: I am a BzzAgent and tried this as part of a Buzz campaign.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast free as a promotional item from the Brand. I have to say, I truly liked this product. It definitely lives up to its name and provides ultimate coverage. I am active in a lot of sports activities and this is the must have deodorant for me. I recently travelled for 2 days, stuck from airport to car to airport with no shower available. You would never even know it. It goes on smooth, no marks. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have not used a different deodorant for the past 10 years. I have been a Mitchum girl, well a Girl using a Boys deodorant. I got Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear to try as a BzzAgent Campaign and I was amazed!!! I have switched from Mitchum to Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear, this is my new best friend!!!</li>
    <li> This came for me as part of a bzzagent free kit to try and report. I&#x27;ve got to say im not a big fan of gels. They always seem to wear off too fast. This one was not like that! It worked great and lasted all day. No marks on my shirt or anything.Smells great too!!</li>
    <li> Goes on clear, long lasting smell protection.  Got it free to try thru bzzagent.  Love the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel deoderant.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean scent from Bzzagent to try out.  I must say I am impressed. I work a physically demanding job, and while I don&#x27;t sweat as much in cooler weather, I still do perspire a lot. I require a lot of protection and Secret Outlast gel did just that.  I am impressed at how quick it dried and left no evidence on my shirts. It controls the amount of sweat and I don&#x27;t have to worry about body odor since I work with people. I also love that it is guaranteed to protect you for 48 hours. Ever had one of those crazy days where you forgot to brush your teeth and even put on deodorant? Secret Outlast has got you covered! This is great stuff and when I run out, I will most certainly be buying more.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try because I am a BzzAgent. I have been completely brand loyal to a different deodorant for years. This kind was better in every way. The clear gel goes on and dries pretty much instantly. It never left any white smudges on clothes which is very important here in Texas, because we wear a lot of short sleeves. It had much superior wetness protection compared to my regular brand. It lasted longer as well. I never had to reapply it late in the day. The scent is light and refreshing without smelling like powder or too flowery. There are two reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars: first it took me 3-4 clicks for good coverage and so it didn&#x27;t last quite as long as I am used to. Secondly, after using it daily for several weeks, (because I really loved it!) my skin started to get itchy. Now I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and every other brand I&#x27;ve ever tried, other than my usual kind, has also irritated me, usually the same day I try them. So while I won&#x27;t be using it daily, I will be buying it to use on occasions when I dress up and want to be positive of better protection without white marks on my clothes.</li>
    <li> UPDATED (11Feb16): Since my last review (see below), I&#x27;ve been using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel exclusively.  I&#x27;ve become accustomed to not having to worry about any exertional stinkiness, and I enjoy the general lack of swampiness of my underarm area.  Secret was looking for opinions on the latest addition to the Outlast family - Outlast Xtend - I jumped at the chance.  I did a thorough vetting of the new formulation, and can solemnly attest to the fact that it can handle squelching the stink for at LEAST 48 hours. Just so you know I&#x27;m a real human who doesn&#x27;t love everything everyone throws my way, I don&#x27;t love the scent (completely clean) - it&#x27;s a little too sweet smelling, almost cloyingly so.  But, it&#x27;s only really apparently during application and immediately after.  Once the product melts into your skin and dries, the scent isn&#x27;t strong enough to deter me from the awesome protection.  I browsed the Secret site and saw that they have other scents available in the Outlast brand, so I may switch over to a different scent. Overall, Secret Outlast Xtend delivers on the promise of keeping you dry and stink-free for at least 48 hours (unless you&#x27;re running a marathon or a fever - but those are special circumstances). I got my stick for free from Secret, through a BzzAgent BzzCampaign. #GotItFree #ThanksBzzAgent  My experience with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel has been one of complete satisfaction.  I had been using one of those &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; crystal (salt-based) deodorants, so I was used to being odor-free, but the sogginess that crept up after a long, taxing day was unwelcome, to say the least!  For full disclosure, I received my Secret Outlast as a free sample as a part of a brand promotion.  When I made the switch to Secret Outlast, I was skeptical.  I didn&#x27;t think that it would be possible for a deodorant gel to dry quickly enough for my busy mornings, or for it to really deliver on the promise to keep me odor free for 48 hours.The first morning, I applied it and, before I could un-ball-up my shirt (I&#x27;m not good about folding my laundry), the gel was dry.  It wasn&#x27;t tacky or sticky.  I loved it... but the proof would lie in my after-work opinion.  Cut to 12 hours later, I took a minute for a quick check:  Still dry, still smelling like whatever this scent is... it&#x27;s really a blend of all non-noxious scents.  Linen? Sea breeze? Kitten toes? I was mightily impressed!  So, I decided to double down (no... not that KFC monstrosity), and I let it ride.  I decided to test the 48-hour claim, and chose to eschew reapplication the next day.  I fully expected to be shunned by my coworkers, but there were no ill effects.  In fact, I checked a few times throughout the day, and there was nothing!  No smell, no sogginess!  The 48-hour claim is TRUE!  Since I am not a product-testing robot, I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;let it ride&amp;#34; for a third day, because I appreciate cleanliness.  Plus, there were never any promises about 72 hours of protection... although, it wouldn&#x27;t be a terrible idea for Secret&#x27;s next product.  If you manage to go 72 hours without a shower, you&#x27;ll NEED the protection! &amp;#60;pinches nostrils&amp;#62;  Honestly, the only reason that I&#x27;m rating Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel 4 out of 5 stars (despite its AMAZING ability to keep me dry and smelling like a million bucks) is that it&#x27;s chock-full of nasty chemicals that are on EWG&#x27;s list of &amp;#34;chemicals that will kill you&amp;#34;. &amp;#60;not really the name of the list&amp;#62;  While it is incredibly effective and works like a charm, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if all of those chemicals absorbing into my axilla (armpit), right near my lymph nodes, is a good idea, saftey-wise.  So, what I&#x27;m saying is that this product works, probably better than any other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve used &#x27;em all), but you should keep the potential downsides (aluminum&#x27;s link to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) in mind while you&#x27;re running marathons or dealing with absurdist, completely useless coworkers.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant as part of a BzzAgent campaign to try. This gel has a very subtle scent and when worn leaves absolutely no marks. I tried this with numerous dark shirts and never once had to try to get deodorant off. The gel goes on smoothly and dries fast. Although I wasn&#x27;t completely dry with this gel, I did not have to worry about any type of smell...it worked perfect for that. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel Gave me great protection from smell and wetness. I have severe issues with body odder and sweating a lot. I was able to apply once in AM and then not need a second application while at work throughout the day. Keeps up with my stressful career as a nurse, running around. I enjoyed the smell and how it lasted throughout the day to stay fresh. This deodorant did not stain my shirt which I love, it was clean and easy to apply. the only part I did not enjoy was the wetness initially when applying before it drys. I received this Product to try  for free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I have switched from using my usual Mitchum deodorant to the Secret Outlast because I received a sample of this product as part of a promotion for the brand.  Overall, I think it works very well.  I am very active, work out a lot, and am always on the run.  Being clean and not smelling bad is important to me.  I like that this is a gel as I don&#x27;t like the crumminess of solids.  I also like that it is dispensed with a dial.  I have many times used the solid gels and if I leave them in my gym bag in the car during a hot day the entire thing melts and makes a huge mess in my gym bag.  I wouldn&#x27;t have that problem with this because you get to choose how much is dispensed.  This also goes on clear and dries clear so I don&#x27;t have any embarrassing marks on my clothing.  The reason this is rated 4 stars is not because of its effectiveness and utility as a deodorant, but because I really don&#x27;t find the scent the most appealing.  I have the completely clean scent and I am just personally not into the smell.  I don&#x27;t think it smells bad necessarily as it is tolerable and doesn&#x27;t make me want to vomit or anything but it has this strange metallic scent to it that I just don&#x27;t like.  I&#x27;d like it to smell more fresh or even have no scent at all, without the weird metallic undertones.</li>
    <li> I was a little leary of this deodorant because I usually am not a fan of gels, but the first couple of times I used this I was impressed. I actually received the product as a sample through BzzAgent, but I&#x27;m giving my honest opinion. At first there was no sticky feeling, odor and wetness controlled very well...a good product. After about a month of daily use though, something changed. I&#x27;m very active, working out every day, and I work in an office that is extremely hot because of a wonky thermostat. Secret Outlast, just couldn&#x27;t keep up. I also started to have problems with itchiness in my underarm area which quickly had me switching back to my old stand by. Yes, there were no wet marks on my clothes from the product itself, but I was left sweaty and some days a little stinky too. No Bueno!</li>
    <li> My first impression of the new Secret outlast deodorant was that it was a clear gel. I like that, because I absolutely hate getting white marks on my clothing. The gel formula was strong and long lasting. I noticed it lasted long into the evening when I come home and walk my dog around 8pm. The scent is ok. It&#x27;s not overpowering or stinky. Has a unisex scent. Great for the gym or physical activities like biking or running on the treadmill. I will purchase again. Being a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean has a great scent coupled with extraordinary protection!! I have been a fan of the Secret deodorant line for years now and have tried almost every different type of deodorant they have, but have always went back to my favorite Secret stick. After reviewing this (Courtesy of BZZAgent) I think Secret has finally converted me to a new type of product. In the past I was always worried about the strength of my deodorant and the smell of it post workout but Secret Outlast Completely Clean passed the test. Yes, Like all gel deodorants its cold when applying and If you apply too much you could be left feeling nasty but as with all things I think it just takes some getting used to, to figure out how much you should apply.</li>
    <li> I was already a Secret fan...they have some of the best scents, and I&#x27;ve found their solids very reliable. I&#x27;m always interested in the bigger, better deal, though, and was very interested when I was offered the latest incarnation via BzzAgent, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s new? It&#x27;s a clear gel, water-based, that dries super fast. The water-based formula allows the active ingredients to soak into sweat glands more efficiently. TMI? Perhaps. It&#x27;s also designed to continually work to detect and contain odor. Also, 48 hour odor protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Translation: It smells really good, it keeps up even when you&#x27;re sweating your worst, and it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, even during the aforementioned increased sweating. That was my experience, anyway, and I put it through workout sweat. My teenager gave it a try as well, and now she won&#x27;t give it back, saying that it feels better than her old solid. The scent is a basic fresh scent, not flowery or overly sweet, so it&#x27;s a great match with your other body scents. As far as 48-hour protection, I can attest that it totally did 24 hours perfectly, and still held a lovely scent when I got in the shower. Again, probably TMI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product from BzzAgent as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Love using secret outlast. I was able to #tryitfree by being a #bzzagent. I really like the cool, fresh feeling after applying this deodorant. It leaves me with all day protection in a fast-paced work environment.</li>
    <li> I received Secrect outlast from Secret to try out their product.  Thanks for allowing me to trying this amazing product.  I love this deodrant.  I love the scent and how it feels so clean and fresh for a very long time.  I also like that there is no white residue.  I stay fresh all day and i like that I dont feel wet or sticky either.  When I get dressed I dont have to worry about getting that annoying white lines on my shirts.  If I do catch some the the gel on my shirt it dries clear and quickly..  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I also would buy this product for myself in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this particular Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent deodorant from BzzAgent, but I have used it in the past as well. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothes when I use this! That is a huge one for me. The scent is pleasant and non-offensive and it doesn&#x27;t take any longer to dry than other deodorants out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it can last up to 48 hours, I always shower and reapply within 24 hours so I can speak of this claim to be true or not, however it does last a good 24 hours with no problems! I highly recommend this for anyone who worries about white spots on their clothes and for a protective deodorant!</li>
    <li> Normally, I am not a fan of clear gel deodorants, they tend to take longer to dry and are a gooey mess to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was chosen to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel as a BzzAgent and was very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applied easily, dried quickly and protected me throughout the day having a mild fresh scent - best of all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO WHITE MARKS!!  Great product!  I will definitely be purchasing it in the future!</li>
    <li> i got this product from buzz agent I was very excited about it ,i really like this product because of gel , and the scent (lavender that’s awesome)&lt;br /&gt;keep me fresh all day long. will recommend this to my friends too</li>
    <li> Secret has been my go-to deodorant for years now and I would not have it any other way!....This deodorant is best by far! Clear Gel Is my go-to! Leaves me feeling and smelling clean and staying fresh smelling all day! I love the fact that it fast dries as well instead of having to wait and worry about it going on your clothes! There is no worry there! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I Received This Product From Secret In Exchange For My Honest Review!**</li>
    <li> With just 2 clicks I&#x27;m protected for 48 hours and this weather were having is proving it. Temperatures in the 90s and 100% humidity would give any deodorant a run for its money and the Secret Outlast Completely Clean is ready for the challenge. I never worry about smelling anything other than good with this deodorant on. And the smell is so fresh and nice, a perfect deodorant that does it&#x27;s job every time. I&#x27;m trying this product free from Secret but I&#x27;ll be buying it over and over again forever, and that&#x27;s no secret.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I got to try this 100% risk free! I have always been a fan of secret products but this one by far is my favorite. The clear gel does not run off onto my clothes, it smells great and keeps me dry all day long. Living in FL means that I&#x27;m always hot and sticky and the last thing I want to worry about is my deodorant not holding up. I am definitely happy that secret outlast keeps me dry and fresh all day and into the night!</li>
    <li> Since i started using this deodorant I&#x27;ve felt more fresh in between showers than with any other deodorant i have tried!&lt;br /&gt;I got a promotional size to try &amp; have already got it on my shopping list for next weeks shopping trip.&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues with other brands/types not working give this a try you will be happy you did!&lt;br /&gt;The last 3 types I have tried did not work on me. ( hormones i guess) Don&#x27;t know why but they didn&#x27;t. Right after a shower i felt like i needed another shower but not with the outlast gel from secret.</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager I used secret because it&#x27;s the only brand my mom ever used (even to the day!). Of coursei wanted to be like her so I had to use it too. Back then it was only there soild available. It broke me out so bad! I remember being on fire for a week. BzzAgent sent me a free sample of this to review for an honest opinion. I was so scared. My sensitive skin has only became more sensitive over the years. I tested it small areas first to see if there was any irritation. There was not. So I tried it hire I would normally apply it and ya know, it never did break me out and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now! It last all day, and I have a lot of night sweats, and even in the morning I&#x27;m dry! I&#x27;m so happy that this is something I can use. I wear a lot of tanks in the summer and black and brown are my signature colors, I like that in worry free and don&#x27;t have residue showing! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I have always loved Secret products.  When I was given the opportunity to try out Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier.  The product truly does go on clearn and does not leave any marks on your clothes (which is a huge plus in my book)!  It goes on smooth, has a great smell, and leaves you fresh all throughout the day.  I can definitely see myself using this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product through bzz agent. after trying it, I can honestly say I won&#x27;t be switching over from my clinical strength anytime soon. I&#x27;m not a profuse sweater but do live in LA and when temperatures get up into the 90&#x27;s I need a deodorant to stop the sweating that has odor protection (i&#x27;m human after all).  This deodorant is ok in terms of application and dries clear, however it doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration as well as I&#x27;d like and I&#x27;m not really crazy about gel as it&#x27;s a little sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry right away. On the plus side, the gel doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes and I wear a LOT of black. Overall, it&#x27;s good to have but not going to be my summer go to. Maybe in the fall i&#x27;ll revisit.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works wonders in all sorts of conditions. I am now a believer and have switched to Secret outlast clear as my go to  deoderant. Love the scents also so fresh. I got the product free to try from One2One.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant for a BzzAgent campaign but the opinion of the product is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel gives an incredible strength and length of last fighting BO. My deodorants in the past have not been doing the job when I am active and I feel like I continuously stink. I love that this gel lasts all day without a problem or reapplication. The only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is the texture, it&#x27;s worth the lasting product but it&#x27;s just a weird feeling to apply this gel at first. I am quite happy with this product and absolutely recommend it to anyone in need of a better protection!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample bottle of this deodorant/antiperspirant from BzzAgent courtesy of Secret, and I was definitely surprised at a few things.  The gel goes a very long way and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky once I&#x27;ve applied it and put my arms down.  It doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly though.  The smell is pleasant and strong enough to smell all day, however I found it to be a migraine trigger for me.  I did still sweat a small amount, but that was a big improvement from the sweating I&#x27;m used to with the Degree for Women invisible solid I normally use.  I&#x27;ve definitely learned that Degree is out!  I also wouldn&#x27;t say it works for 48-hours(could be my body individually).  The amount of white streaking I&#x27;ve seen is definitely minimal!  I think a key to that is making sure we aren&#x27;t over applying the gel.  I noticed that my underarms felt almost silky after use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is a great deodorant to try and/or start with if you find gel acceptable.  It has it&#x27;s obvious wet coolness to contend and due to that I may or may not continue with gel.  I will definitely be looking into the other scents for myself, and possibly a version of Secret without aluminum.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I received this deodorant to try as a Bzzagent. In the past, I never liked using gel deodorants because they always felt so wet, cold and sticky during the application process. When I first used Secret Outlast Completely Clean gel deodorant, I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of application and the rapid drying time. By the time I put the cap back on the deodorant and put it away, my armpits were completely dry. Additionally, this deodorant is completely clear and has a nice, fresh scent. I had no white residue when I put my shirt or dress on.  I love this aspect of the deodorant as my previous deodorant always left a chute residue on dark clothes. Before trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean, I was using a clinical strength deodorant. I didn&#x27;t think there was any way the Secret Outlast could keep me as dry as the clinical steength deodorant, but I was wrong. I used Secret Outlast for a full week in 90-100 degree heat and stayed completely dry. I then switched back to my clinical strength deodorant for a week in a little bit cooler weather and noticed some degree of wetness every day. From now on, I will be using the Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant every day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells so refreshing, and I only have to apply it once a day! What I really love about it? It dries instantly, so I can throw on my clothes and go! No mess no streaks! This is my new deodorant! The best part about trying this product? I got it for free thanks to bzzagent.com!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to try this as a promotion thanks to Secret. I have been using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for over a week now.  I generally use invisible solids, not gels, so it was a little weird at first.  It was a little sticky when I first put it on, so I decided to let it dry before I finished getting dressed.  Once it dried, the stickiness was gone.  The scent was nice &amp; clean, nothing overpowering or overwhelming.  I&#x27;m not a fan of super fragrant deodorant, so I liked the subtle scent.  There is no white residue, so you don&#x27;t look like you are wearing deodorant - there is nothing worse than wearing something sleeveless and getting that white stuff on your shirt under the arm holes, or having caked on deodorant visible on your skin.  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel works great.  While it may not hold up through a 2.5 mile power walk work out, it does make it through my day.  I live in Florida, and I am in &amp; out of the office &amp; take my dogs on several walks a day, and I have been pleasantly surprised at how well Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel performs.  I have been a fan of the Secret brand of deodorant before, but now I&#x27;m definitely sold on it.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free via BzzAgent. Honestly, I was little scared trying Secret Outlast® Clear Gel. I decide to try it for the first time a few weeks ago. I had two outdoor weddings to do that day. Pretty risky move but I am glad I did. The gel dried up pretty quick and didnt leave any white maks on my black shirt. By the end of the day I still smelled great under my armpits and thats a huge plus for me!  A few days before I ran out of my sample Secret Outlast® Clear Gel, for some reason, by the end of the day I had to re-apply because I was not smeling so great. Not sure why but it didnt stop me from using it again until I completely finished it.  Honestly, it works very well and I was not dissapointed but I am not sure if I would purchase this product again because I have been using the same deodorant for so many years but I am still open to try new ones that come my way.</li>
    <li> I received a sample for testing purposes of this particular deodorant and was quite pleased with how well it worked. The gel like substances dries quickly leaving you feeling clean and refreshed all day. The smell is amazing as well.</li>
    <li> As a sweaty underarm sufferer, I was excited to try out the 24 hr Secret Outlast Deodorant from the BzzCampaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled great before putting it on.  It lasted for the entire day!  Normally I re apply twice in a day so that I don&#x27;t have the wetness and stink.  This worked fantastic under normal everyday conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to work out wearing it so I can vouch for that condition. I also wish it came in a solid but the gel may be what makes it work.  I know in the winter I am going to cringe when I put it on.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Deodorant. I got this product for free to review but my reviews are my own. I am naturally a sweaty person, and during the summer I usually have to wash under my arms and re-apply twice a day. I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore thanks this product. It goes on clear, it dries fast, and it lasts throughout the day. I&#x27;ve worn it to the beach and waterpark without needing to reapply. Also it has no overpowering scent, you just smell fresh and clean. Keep up the good work Secret.</li>
    <li> i had so many expectation on this deodorant. first the name secret outlast clear gel deodorant 48hr odor protection did not stand up to its name, yes it is CLEAR, so that part it is ok, and it smells great but not for long, the odor protection??? where is it, seriously i am not a stinky girl, i do normal chores and work at home, this did not help anything i think it made it worse, i will not use this deodorant it did not help anything.  the clear gel it is not enough if the nice scent does not last. this product was given to me for free to review it, my review it is base on my experience using the product, i am true to being honest.</li>
    <li> I loved this deodorant i was very worried about it being a gel deodorant but it proved me wrong it works great and smells amazing i am very picky about the kinds of deodorant i use because lets face it no one wants to be smelly but it worked amazing it was hott the days i used it and i was very active wedding one day (which i was in) and landscaping with my husband the next.. i am very thankful for getting it from bzzagent for free to sample and review  #MomHack #Sercertoutlastcleargel #loveit#gotitforfree #epic48</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from bzzagent and I was so glad that I did. This works great. I feel dry the whole day and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothing.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! It&#x27;s especially great when wearing dark garments because you don&#x27;t end up with those unsightly streaks on your tops. It&#x27;s my staple in the summer when wearing sleeveless tops and dresses because it doesn&#x27;t clump up under my arm...Yay! I have purchased this product before, but recently I received it for FREE as part of a promotion from the brand which was even better! You should definitely try this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant through BzzAgent, courtesy of Secret. After using it for a little over a week while on a summer family trip, I will say that this deodorant did okay, but definitely wouldn&#x27;t last 48 hours for me. I loved the smell of this deodorant and that it left absolutely no white marks behind. I also loved that, as a gel, it wasn&#x27;t at all sticky. While a good portion of the time I was using this deodorant, It lasted all day, or at least most of the day, on some of the more active days, I found that I needed to reapply before the day was over because it wasn&#x27;t helping to control the odor and perspiration as well. While this deodorant may suffice on my less active days, It definitely doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick quite as well when I&#x27;m on the move. As a side note, I have always had a bit of a difficult time finding deodorants that control my odor and perspiration while I&#x27;m active.</li>
    <li> This product is long lasting FOR REAL. lol I was given the opportunity to test it for free. I was quite hoary with it. Even after showering I could still smell the deodorant. I loved it.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent to try for free.  I have used Secret off and on for many years now, I was excited to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  I have used it for two weeks now and Secret did not dissapoint,  I love it!  I like the formula it dries fast, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on clothes.  It last all day with heavy duty activies throughout the day. i like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong heay scent. I&#x27;ve used other brands but I always find myself returning to Secret because by far it last longer than other brands.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive towards using a gel deodorant, having had a bad experience using a gel in the past. I am glad that I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant! I stayed dry and odor free for the entire day. I normally use expensive clinical deodorants, which don&#x27;t even keep me dry for the day. I have had a hard time finding a good deodorant for myself. I have finally found something that works for me!! I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes, that is actually one of my favorite things about this product! I am trying the product for free thanks to Secret!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample, thanks to BzzAgent, and I love it!!  I was really amazed out how long it lasted and how well it worked.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different deodorants before but this one is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try several weeks ago, and I doubted that I would like it. I&#x27;ve used so many different brands and types of deodorant. I sweat a lot, and I get stinky fast, so I usually don&#x27;t reuse the same deodorant after a while. This is the first time where I will officially declare this as my permanent deodorant. The gel dries immediately, which is usually a problem for me with gel. It also gives me strong protection from sweat and smell all day! Usually, I need to reapply if I don&#x27;t want to stink by the end of the day. I would definitely recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> I received a Free sample of the secret outlast completely clean deodorant to try in return for my feedback on the product,thanks to secret outlast and Bzzagent. I was skeptical at first as all the other deodorants I have tried,i have had to reapply several times a day and I would have that icky white residue left behind.I got a surprise when I applied this deodorant,I only had to apply it once and it lasted all day,also there was no white icky residue left behind. LOVEEEE this product,and I deffinately recommend it to others :)</li>
    <li> I live in Florida where the heat is horrendous so I need something that works. When I was offered to try the Secret Outlast Gel through BzzAgent for free I jumped at the opportunity. Secret has been a trusted name for as long as I can remember. I (in my 35 years)  just never thought to buy the gel formula, I have always been a stick kind of girl. Well its a keeper!! The long lasting formula keeps me dry while chasing my 3 kids through the heat and humidity. #Epic48 #longlasting #Gotitfree</li>
    <li> I really like Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent it had an amazing smell I like that every time I moved my arms I could smell it and that I lasted a long time it was fast drying and didn&#x27;t leave my skin felling gross.</li>
    <li> I have issues with deodorant when I wear sleeveless tops. Before trying this deodorant, none of them did the trick. I put some on, let it dry and then get dressed. I remain odor free all day and don&#x27;t have to worry about deodorant marks.I usually buy the secret clinical protection but was kind of turned off by the powdery feeling of the soft solid. This Outlast clear gel works just as well, if not better than the clinical protection and has that nice smooth gel feel that doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind in your shirt. I think I&#x27;ll end up buying this kind from now on. *I received the product as part of a promotion from BZZAGENT, this is my own opinion.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently received a free sample of the secret outlast gel. I have tried other gels in the past and found them leaving my pits feeling slimy. I was pleasantly surprised when this dried nearly instantly. It kept me smelling great all day. Even after swimming in the pool!</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying I have been a faithful dry stick user forever. I hate roll ons and gels as I feel they don&#x27;t last. Well was i proven wrong. Secret Outlast Clear Gel is seriously amazing. Not only does it not leave white marks all over your clothes, but you smell AMAZING throughout the ENTIRE day. Seriously, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try and review this product for free via BZZAgent.</li>
    <li> Love it. It smells great, works well and leaves no sticky residue or white marks. The only downside is its pricey. But still worth it. I did get this sample to try the product for free thanks to Secret.  but it&#x27;s still the only deodorant I buy usually. Example, used it today and was outside mowing, trimming trees and car maintenance yet could only tell from the sweat drenched and red face not the team locker room smell :)</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel to try as a part of the BzzAgent campaign.  It delivered with great protection.  It was long lasting and worked well. It didn&#x27;t leave any white marks.  My only complaint is that I would prefer a solid over a gel.  The gel was fast drying so it wasn&#x27;t too bad!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my favorite things about this deodorant:&lt;br /&gt;Smell: the completely clean scent is so fresh - it isn&#x27;t overpowering like some deodorants I&#x27;ve tried just nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: I&#x27;ve tried many different gel deodorants in my day... and they all left my under arms feeling wet and sticky! This one however, is incredible! It literally dried within probably 5 seconds or less. It isn&#x27;t sticky feeling at all, I almost feel as though I have on a regular stick deodorant, but without seeing any whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duration: Well, I haven&#x27;t had it on too long, but I can just tell that this deodorant is gonna last. I was just so excited to review it I have only had it on for probably 10 minutes haha. But if in fact, it doesn&#x27;t last (and it&#x27;s summertime in Florida...) I will be sure to update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample of this product to try from BzzAgent and Secret*</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this deodorant so far.  I like trying out new things and his fit the bill.  The deodorant stayed on really nicely after gliding it on.  I liked the scent and ease of use.  I got this product free to try from Secret!</li>
    <li> So today I wore my new @secretoutlast it was 97 degrees out I was in full uniform (army we wear our sleeves down) and high humidity. I came home and much to my surprise I sniffed my arm pits and much to my surprise they smelled exactly the same as when I applied it. I am such a freak about worrying if I smell this was amazing.  Definitely my new go to @secretdeodorant even though I received it free from @bzz agent #lifehack</li>
    <li> I was offered to try this product free through Bzzagent and asked to offer my honest opinion. Well, Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant offers great all day protection. From the moment I used the product, to the end of the day, it kept me dry and refreshed. The product went on smooth and dried quickly.  The floral scent lasted thought the day and offered just the right amount of fragrance. From sitting at home to take a long walk,  Secret Outlast was with me every step of the way.  I would never have thought to use this brand of deodorant, however, would continue to use the product and recommend to any woman.</li>
    <li> I loved this little sample! Its so cute and it fits perfectly in my purse or center console in my car. I tried it and it kept me dry all day and didn&#x27;t make a mess on my clothes or leave a sticky film. I have always been a Secret user but now I think I&#x27;ve found a new love! I definitely recommend it to others. It&#x27;s a clear gel that is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it feeling dry or itchy after using. It&#x27;s great. I did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions expressed in this post are my own unbiased opinion and my only compensation was this product.</li>
    <li> I was selected to try this for free thanks to Bzz Agent. I was not completely impressed with this product. When I first received it, I smelled it and thought it was a different smell. Not bad just different. My kids however said it made me smell funny. The first few times I used it, it worked pretty good. There were no white marks which is always a bonus, especially when wearing dark clothes. I wore it to the zoo on a really hot day and it didn&#x27;t seem to stand up as well as my old deodorant. I felt like after really sweating that I was starting to smell a little. Maybe it was just because it was so hot but I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about odor when I am out. I have continued to use this product  and it does work great when I am not really sweating.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try a free sample of this from a  BzzCampaign on bzzagent.com. I&#x27;m not super loyal to any deodorant brand, but normally I do like Secret and I almost always use solids. Yeah the white marks are annoying but I HATE the wet feeling under my arms of a gel, the long dry time and the fact that usually gels do not work for me. Well in comes Secret Outlast in the Completely Clean Scent ! This is a gel deodorant that goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t streak your clothes. Even though it is a gel and it does take a second to dry, it&#x27;s the quickest drying gel formula I have ever used. Best of all it leaves your under arms with a smooth dry feeling. Not to mention the scent is great! Very fresh and feminine. I would buy this again just for the scent, something I think Secret is top notch at. This kept me dry and stink free for an all day festival in 80+ degree heat. Not to mention stressful workdays. I would definitely buy this deodorant again. Try it out, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is definitely the real deal! I have stayed dry all day on one of the hottest days of the year to date! And no white marks on my clothes at all! Definitely will be purchasing again soon!</li>
    <li> I got this free for review from BzzAgent! This is a great, effective product. For a long lasting fresh, dry arm all day, this is perfect!! The clear gel makes it great with any attire. Forget about this white marks!!! This is my new regular favorite.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free for being a bzzagent. The smell was clean and fresh, but I must say I&#x27;m not really liking the gel. I normally use invisible solids so this was a change for me. The product feels to wet and sticky when first applied. It goes away but I don&#x27;t like that feeling. I will say the product did work well, I used it while on vacation using our family cottage with no air conditioning and it was humid. This product is decent I just don&#x27;t like the gel to much but it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m typically not a fan of clear gels, but Secret sent me a free trial-sized product through BzzAgent, so figured I would give this one a whirl .  This was definitely the best clear gel I&#x27;ve tried, but I still can&#x27;t get over the initial sticky feeling, which this product still had.  It did, however, dry very quickly and was totally invisible.  The scent was also one of my favorites, especially as I could smell it occasionally throughout the day as I wore it.  At the end of the day I smelled clean and was still enjoying the scent of it.  The next morning, however, I didn&#x27;t smell quite as fresh and needed to reapply.  Although I think this is a decent, great-smelling product, it didn&#x27;t hold up to its 48 hour claim.</li>
    <li> got this product as a free sample from bzzagent.com smells good but not a fan of gel, it feels cold and gooey. Last for awhile but not as long as a solid</li>
    <li> The  Secret Outlast® Clear Gel deodorant feels light and cooling, dries instantly with no white residue, and has a clean,  smell. It goes on completely clear, dries immediately (as in, less than a second), and most important, didn&#x27;t leave white streaks on my black dress when I got dressed in the morning. The spray kept me dry and stink-free through a stressful workday and a workout which I can appreciate. I can not confirm if it lasts a full 48 hours but after a long day and night schlepping through the city it holds up really well and that&#x27;s all I can ask for. Being a BzzAgent has it&#x27;s perks and this is definately one of them!</li>
    <li> I #GotItFree for a #BzzAgent campaign and was excited to try it. I&#x27;ve ruined a shirt or two with my stick deodorant and love that the gel is clear and leaves no residue. The first time I put it on it was 82 degrees in my house and the deodorant took FOREVER to dry. Today I put it on (77 in my apt) and it dried super quickly. I like the smell, the scent stays all day, and it covers your own body odor.</li>
    <li> I loved that it feels super refreshing as soon as you put it on. The smell its very nice and it stays smelling good the whole day. It didn&#x27;t leave white marks and it protected me from sweat. I loved it so much that now I&#x27;m gonna change from the brand that I used to use, to Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant. I really recommend using it, you won&#x27;t change it for nothing!!!</li>
    <li> Got to try this for free thanks to secret and bzzzagent....love it no more white marks on clothes or bras long lasting smell all day goes on a little cold but dries very quickly....best of all no more white marks</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant it doesn&#x27;t leave the white mess all over my clothes and it leaves me nice and refreshed</li>
    <li> Smells great- this is probably the only women&#x27;s deodorant where i&#x27;ve felt strongly enough about the scent to comment on it. Also, it works well and lasts all day. 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> I have always been scared to try any gel deodorant until I received a free sample of this thanks to Secret, and I was so surprised. The smell is amazing but is not as strong when it is on your skin. I love how it does not leave any white residue! The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t last long. I had to reapply a couple times. I did like how it felt thin and not caked on. I would re-purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast clear gel is the best! It is the ONLY thing I use. No other deodorant can compare. It has a container that is comfortable to hold as well as use. There is a turn-style knob on the bottom that is turned to bring up the gel. It goes on clear and smooth and dries that way as well. The scent is clean and refreshing. It keeps me dry all day long!!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel really does apply and dry clear. I have tried many other deodorants that say they are clear but this one really lives up to its name. It keeps me dry all day and smells great! The only thing keeping it from 5 stars for me is I don&#x27;t like the gel before it dries. It takes about 30 seconds but is a bit slimy when applying. I definitely recommend trying this out if you are looking for a deodorant to apply without leaving the annoying white marks! Thank you Secret for letting me try this product for free from bzzagent!</li>
    <li> Although I was already using this deodorant, I was given the opportunity by Secret to try this for free &amp; I love it!  This scent is just what the name implies, clean.  Other scents like the Brazil rainforest &amp; the ooh-la-la lavender are amazing!  This clear gel option in their deodorants work exceptionally well. Even through those summer days keeps you dry and smelling fresh all day.  I wouldn&#x27;t say 48 hrs, but definitely for a day&#x27;s with of work and running after a toddler.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel deoderant via BzzAgent to try for free. It truly holds up to everything it states it will. From the 48 hour odor protection, the fast drying that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, and the best part no white marks! Love! Love! Love! I highly recommend this deoderant if you are looking to find one that really does everything that it claims too!</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying that I was able to try this product for FREE from bzzagent.com and chose to write a review to tell you how amazing it really is! I am a full time stay at home mother of 2 boys who are ages 5 and 3. I also live in the great Sunshine State Florida which we all knows tends to get a little warm (today is almost 110). needless to say I have been through several brands of deodorants because im always having some kind of issue. either it leaves these crusty white marks on my shirts which is really difficult to remove or it doesn&#x27;t do what deodorant is suppose to do which is keep u smelling fresh even when you are sweating. I was a little skeptical at trying this because of how many times ive been let down and how many times ive had to through shirts away or get embarrassed in public due to the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that comes with chasing 2 boys around the park on a hot summer day! Anyways I have been using Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for almost 3 weeks now and have thoroughly tested it out!! Does it help fight sweat on those hot summer days that I spend 8 hours of my day outside, YES!!!  Does it leave those annoying and funky white marks on my shirts that leaves me feeling even more disgusting, NO!!! It does what is suppose to do!!! It fights the sweat and helps make u feel clean and fresh even on those days that we know we aint the freshest we can be! Not only have I thrown out the 8 different brands of deodorant that I use to use but I have also become very brand loyal to Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel! it truly works and if u want to really test it out, come on down to Florida (which I think has to be the closest point to the sun) and try it out for yourself! youll be happy you did!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent I was able to try a sample of this product for free. I am usually a solid stick person, but this product exceeded my expectations! It truly does outlast whatever you&#x27;re doing throughout the day. We&#x27;ve recently had a heat wave, and it sucks when you have to reapply deodorant throughout the day to keep up. I did NOT have to do that with this at all. It kept me dry and smelling good all day and all night. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I feel like the initial twist to get the gel up isn&#x27;t enough, and I found myself doing two swipes on each side.</li>
    <li> I am trying the product for free thanks to Secret and bzzagent, I really enjoy the scent, and how well it dries (almost immediately!) There are no marks on any of my clothes and it does a great job at absorbing wetness and odor. I will say it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Secret says, maybe a good 12 hours; after a good work out the deodorant just stopped working altogether, I was a little disappointing, it still does a great job for daily use though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Completely Clean Secret Outlast since the day it arrived from BzzAgent about 3 weeks ago.  It went with me on our trip to California and Arizona and I&#x27;ve been using it at home (PA).  It survived the humidity of beachy California pretty well and I didn&#x27;t have any white marks on my clothing.  Arizona in July is hot....very, very hot, like over 100 degrees.  Although we were inside for most of our visit I had no worries about being smelly when I went outside.  Then when we came home from our trip we had my dad&#x27;s birthday party outside on the hottest day of the year so far.  It was high 90&#x27;s and high humidity and although the rest of me was pretty sweaty my underarms were dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product does what it advertises I do have a few complaints.  The first being the scent; it&#x27;s a little too perfumey for my taste, but that is my personal preference.  I kept catching myself getting a whiff of it and going &amp;#34;What is that smell?&amp;#34; before realizing it was me.  It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell, just stronger than I prefer.  I usually buy the unscented or milder scented deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue I had was when I put it on after my shower.  The label warns not to put it on broken skin and I didn&#x27;t think I broke the skin when I was shaving my underarms in the shower but BOY did it burn when I put it on afterwards.  I&#x27;ve never had that issue with my invisible solid and I think I&#x27;ll stick with that.</li>
    <li> I had received this product as part of a campaign from Bzzagent, upon trying this deodorant I would use the powder stick from secret, but after trying the gel I must say I&#x27;m switching as of yesterday!! Product gives great odor protection, goes on smooth and smells great! Love this product and will tell everyone I know to try it because to that good!!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I absolutely love this product! Not only do I like the scent but so does my husband! I have to hide it from him! Not only that but the protection lasts all day. Perfect for camping, hiking, or any leisure outdoor activity that usually breaks a sweat!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try my free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent. It promised a quick drying time, no white marks, and 48 hour odor protection. I had used a gel deodorant in the past and didn&#x27;t like it, so I was curious to see if the newer styles had improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It left no white marks on my clothes as promised, but most deodorants these days don&#x27;t either. It also did dry on my skin much faster than I was anticipating. When I had used gels before, they felt moist for several minutes after applying, but this Secret Outlast was dry within just a few seconds. Others have commented on the scent of this deodorant being overpowering, but I found it rather pleasant. It seemed to be about the same sort of scent I would choose for myself when shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It definitely did not last for 48 hours. If I was having a very inactive day at home (i.e. watching TV, light errands around town, etc), the odor protection would last all day, but not into the next. However, if I was active and working hard (gardening, fishing, exercising, etc), the odor protection lasted no longer than 12 hours at the most. I perspire pretty heavily sometimes, so for someone that doesn&#x27;t, this deodorant may be a better choice. But for me, having to reapply halfway through a busy day doesn&#x27;t equal convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Good for not leaving white marks and drying faster than other gels I have tried, but doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near 48 hours for me.</li>
    <li> Thanks to #BzzAgent, I was able to try Secret Outlast - Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant for free. I typically buy the solid deodorant, so I was looking forward to seeing how the clear gel compared. I was worried that I would have to wait too long to put my top on after, or if my top was already on, I was worried that I would get it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; immediately. I was THRILLED to see that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about either problem! A little goes a long way is something I learned, so be wary when you are clicking the dial to get more out! I smelled fresh all day, even after a busy day in the sun - I went hiking with my dogs, ran some errands, did some yard work, and ended my day by a fire.. when I went to bed, I still felt fresh, and dry. Great product, I am glad I had the chance to try it out. Personally, it would not work for 48 hr coverage for me, but for a full 24 hrs, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to reapply which is great for summer time.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample of Secret Outlast through a promotion with Secret and #BzzAgent. I have used many different types of deodorant/antiperspirant throughout the years, and as a very heavy sweater, I have not been happy with many products. If it works for the sweat, it leaves white residue on clothing and that&#x27;s not something I tolerate... it goes directly into the garbage. My sample arrived just before a very busy weekend, and it was incredibly hot outside! I showered Friday night and applied the deodorant after my shower. I sweat a lot at night, but was still shower fresh in the morning. I went to work (nurse at nursing home) and worked 8 hours with an inside temperature of 83 degrees and a lot of running around doing more physical work than normal because we were short-staffed. I then went home,  did a quick wipe down and went to my cousin&#x27;s wedding, all without reapplying the product. At the end of the night, I was still dry and my underarms were still free from body odor.  I was impressed.  The longest I&#x27;ve gone between applications is about 30 hours,  but it was still working by that time. I cannot say for sure it lasts 48 hours, but it just might! I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but it is certainly not unpleasant,  just something I wouldn&#x27;t personally choose, and I&#x27;m sure given Secret&#x27;s other products,  there would be more than one scent to choose from in the store. I have now used this product for about 2 weeks and am still pleased. I will certainly be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free thanks to secret and bzzagent. I love it! It goes on clear is long lasting. And the best part about it is it smells great!</li>
    <li> Finally a clear gel that actually works!!! I have to use clinical strength deodorant because I sweat a lot when I get hot or nervous. Most deodorants leave me with wetness and sometimes odor. Clinical strength solids are the only deodorants that I&#x27;ve found to work well, but I get white streaks on any dark clothing. I was very skeptical about trying a clear gel because I have never had one that worked in the past, but thank you Secret for letting me try Secret Outlast for free! No sweating, no odor, no white streaks on my clothing! I can smell it working and the scent is fabulous! I will definitely be purchasing.</li>
    <li> I suffer from over sweating and have been using Secret Clinical for quite a few years now. I received the Secret Outlast gel from BzzAgent and Secret to try for free. I used it for a few days here in the hot humid summer we&#x27;ve been having instead of my usual Clinical deodorant from Secret. I liked the smell of the Outlast gel, but it didn&#x27;t solve my issue of over sweating as much as the Clinical does. A few hours after applying the Outlast gel, I raised my arms to get a sense of whether it was working and I smelled musky. It seems like a product I might be able to use in the winter months where I don&#x27;t sweat quite as much, but it just won&#x27;t do for me in the summer.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast clear gel which I received for free as a promotional item has worked really well for me. I love how smooth and easy it goes on without any stickiness or residue. There is no clumping like with a solid deodorant and it dries in just seconds. The smell is also really great - it&#x27;s clean and refreshing and could be used alone as a perfume smell or easily be covered with your own perfume. I highly recommend this deodorant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for free thanks to Secret. With that out of the way, let&#x27;s talk about my feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually got a free sample of the Active Fresh scent of the Outlast gel, but must say I prefer this one. Completely Clean smells pleasant and isn&#x27;t nearly as overpowering, which I think I like. I also prefer the smaller slots in the sample size to the full product, but I&#x27;m fairly certain Completely Clean would use the same hole size in the larger package. This is a bit of a bummer simply because the slots are so large that I feel as though I am wasting product, but more coverage equals better protection, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind gel deodorants like some people, and this one dries quickly without any white marks on clothes. Score! It promises 48 hour protection, but you can bet that&#x27;s going to be a stretch on hot and humid days like yesterday. After 12 hours, I am just starting to become a little less-than-fresh. I would apply more every day if I didn&#x27;t have a chance to shower, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like the scent and gel and don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations, so this product is good enough for me at its current price!</li>
    <li> Yes it is the best one I had try, love that it last longer that any other one and love that won&#x27;t stain my t-shirts, my four stars are because it do not last 48 hrs, anyways I don&#x27;t think it exists a protection that last that long yet. Really worth it, will be on my shopping list from now on, thanks Secret and bzzagent to let me try it for free.</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample of this deodorant for free. I usually use a different brand of deodorant and I usually don&#x27;t use the gel. But I figured I would give it a try in the sample that I had only lasted me about two daysso after I would initially put it on the first thing I noticed was that I felt totally protected and totally covered. After about two hours my armpits felt dry. But I felt like I needed to reapply I didn&#x27;t feel like it was keeping down the odor like it should. My job is one where I&#x27;m in the heat constantly so I need an product that can give me the outer coverage that I need. To me I didn&#x27;t feel like this is honestly a 24 hour deodorant. All in all in all it&#x27;s probably not a product that I would purchase.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of the Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent. Thanks to SECRET for the FREE ample. It works. I used it while we were camping in upper 80 degree weather. I&#x27;ve never liked gel deodorant but it does actually dry pretty quickly so it doesn&#x27;t transfer to your clothes. The big thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it contains aluminium as many deodorants do. I&#x27;d like to see some of the bigger companies carrying more about the ingredients that go into their products.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get a free sample of deodorant from secret they make the best! I love secret deodorant and I am used to the embarrassing white lines that it leaves on me as a black woman.  Either I don&#x27;t have enough on and I sweat or I have too much on and it looks like there is a pound of flour floating up there.  This one is on the right track but not there yet.  After a while it starts to cake up and i have white creases.  Would i recommend it yes,  but it is not completely clear. Lovely smell ! I was not paid for this review it was made on my own I got the sample for free from  Secret and buzzagent.</li>
    <li> This deodorant was provided to me as a sample to review and I took it on RAGBRAI, a 500-mile bike ride over seven days. It was the perfect companion. I felt dry and fresh and I LOVED the smell upon applying. This is a good deodorant for the summer because it feels cool upon applying, too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I frequently jump back and forth between deodorants. I find myself constantly reapplying deodorant throughout the day. And it seems within a week or two any effectiveness the deodorant had shown would be gone.&lt;br /&gt;But thanks to Secret, I got to try the Secret Outlast Clear Gel totally free! I was eager to test the claims of 48 hour odor and wetness protection. After I applying I noticed the gel went on and dried clear almost instantly. Yay! Goodbye white marks! I lasted all day without feeling the need to reapply (I honestly think I smelled amazing!).&lt;br /&gt;I have used other deodorants in the past labeled clinical formula that didn&#x27;t work this well!</li>
    <li> I got this sample product as part of a Bzz campaign, but this review is coming from my own mind. The product is amazingly the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used! I love how it keeps me smelling fresh all day long even out in the hundred degree weather we&#x27;ve been having so often lately. It prevents sweat buildup from under my armpits and does not leave a wet stain on my shirts after I put it on and get dressed. Definitely a great purchase to pick up from mass retail stores.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I got to try this as a free promotional product, and while I was a little skeptical about it at first, ( I typically don&#x27;t like gel deodorant) I tried it for a day and instantly fell in love with it!!! It actually works VERY well, and I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply at all during the day!!  I wore a black shirt, and even though it was like 90 degrees out i had no stains!! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I put my Secret Outlast Clear Gel to the test by scrubbing down walls today. When my two-year-old niece came over afterward, she gave me a hug and said, &amp;#34;Ooo, I yike yo pafoom!&amp;#34; (Toddler translation: &amp;#34;Oo, I like your perfume!&amp;#34;) I started to tell her I wasn&#x27;t wearing any, but then I realized she had smelled my antiperspirant/deodorant—meaning I was still fresh and dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the thought of a squishy gel under my arms didn’t appeal to me, but my preconceived notions flew out the window once I actually tried it. Not only does the gel evaporate (or whatever it does) quickly, it actually feels pretty refreshing going on. I’m definitely going to pick up some more after my sample is finished. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I tried this product for free, thanks to Secret and BzzAgent. **</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a promotion from BzzAgent (check them out if you want to get in on the fun! www.bzzagent.com). I am always very skeptical of gel deodorant - usually gooey, cold and never dries. This product was a little better than the typical ones out there, but I gave it three starts because I just don&#x27;t really like clear gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note: The gel stayed clear - as in I didn&#x27;t have any white marks on the black shirt I wore. That was a plus. However, I wore it with a shirt that had sleeves and even though I waited to put on my shirt (so the gel would dry), my underarms got sticky and I had sweat marks on my shirt. I wasn&#x27;t doing vigorous activity either. I was at work, sitting at my desk, and the office is cold - so I definitely wasn&#x27;t sweating. I also tried it with a sleeveless shirt, and for that, it was worth it. I still felt a little sticky later in the day but it was still worth it because you couldn&#x27;t see anything! I tried the completely clean scent, which I loved. Fresh, scented, but not &amp;#34;over flowery&amp;#34; or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re going sleeveless/strapless, this is your product. Otherwise, you might want to stick to an invisible solid.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product. I have used gel deodrant  in the past and it was a horrible experience. The gel would be cold and sticky. It would make my clothes sticky and nasty. This is nothing like that. It is totally amazing. It smells terrific even here in the southern heat. It doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky or ruin my clothes. I am totally in love.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast clear gel through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and it really works all day! I have a very physically demanding job and I also hit the gym after work- it gets ne through my day and doesnt leave marks on my clothing. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free via BzzAgent .  i used to use the solid stick before i tried the gel and it would only last a few hours.. i applied my gel sample and its still good going on 7 hours im so happy with my new gel stick i dont think ill be switching back to solid at all</li>
    <li> I am trying a free sample of this from #buzzagent through the #epic48 change and #gotitforfree challange. I like it so far and it seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this gel from BzzAgent. It really doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on your shirts and lasts all day!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I still prefer a solid vs. a gel.</li>
    <li> New item to try ‪#‎MomHack‬ Secret Outlast Clear Gel 48 hour protection!!! Usually I use another brand, but when I got this in the mail I was shocked at how awesome it is!! In the summer we all sweat more because of the heat, so of course we need a little more protection. Not only does it smell very good there is no white residue. You can put on any top you want and not have to worry about those white streaks other deodorants leave even if you wait as few minutes to let it dry a little. It is nice and cool feeling when you put it on and keeps your underarms cooler which helps in the summer and will definitely keep you feeling fresh all year round. Extra bonus it lasts for 48 hours!!! So when your out and about you will have no worries about whether your deodorant is still working no need to reapply throughout the day. ‪#‎GotItFree‬ from BzzAgent thanks to Secret</li>
    <li> I got this free from BzzAgent to try and review and I really love it it has a great smell and it really keeps u dry all day leaves no residue I switched my deodorant to secret outlast Iam very pleased with it:)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically like gel deodorant because I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling, however this dried really quickly which I liked. Something I didn&#x27;t like, was the smell &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34;. It was overwhelming and just not pleasant. I&#x27;ve always loved the Secret brand and its actually the only deodorant I will use. I received this as a promotion from the brand, so I think I will buy it in a different scent and try it out!</li>
    <li> Having tried this deodorant is a savior for me. I received a free sample to try and I love it! I apply it before I get dressed and let it dry for a few minutes before putting on my top or dress. This is the only product that offers me full day protection when I wear a sleeveless top. I also no longer need to worry about white marks. This is my new go to for deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to try out for free thanks to Secret :) This deodorant lives up to its name and last me up to 48 hours. The &amp;quot;completely clean&amp;quot; scent smells amazing and since its a clear gel I&#x27;m not left with any yucky white residue on my clothes. I live in FL and the weather here has been 100+ degrees&#x27;s lately so the fact that I can us this and it keeps me dry and fresh all day is a big accomplishment. Make this aluminum-free and I&#x27;m sold. Well done Secret!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Bzzagent to test out and am so glad I did!  I am a regular Mitchum user and was super surprised at how well the Secret held up.  It kept me dry and had a light refreshing scent.  I am usually not a huge fan of gel and this gel was great!  I didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks and I knew I would be well protected.  I only wish the sample was regular size!  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from bzzagent and I love it! I have hyperhidrosis and have to get injections of botox in my underarms to prevent excessive sweating. I am due for more injections so my regular deodorant is not cutting it. I didn&#x27;t want to try it at first because I always hated the sticky feeling of gel but this does not leave that feeling. And it works better than anything I have tried yet (which has been almost everything on the market). I will be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> After years of avoiding gel deodorants I was surprised by how much I liked this Outlast clear gel. I&#x27;m a solids kinda girl because I dread the cold wet feeling of gel deodorant. I dislike having to wait around for it to dry or even worse to have to flap my arms around like I&#x27;m doing the chicken dance. Thankfully I did not have to do this with this clear gel. It dried quickly and went on clear. Which is a huge plus for the summer months when I wear tanks and sleeveless dresses. I have been using this deodorant for a week now and have noticed that I stay drier longer and that at the end of a busy work day I still have a nice fresh scent. I would recommend this Outlast clear gel for those looking for a clear deodorant that has great sweat protection and a nice light fresh scent. I am trying this product free thanks to BzzAgent and Secret.</li>
    <li> Just tried secret outlast through a buzz agent campaign. Must say I was pleasantly surprised. It was unplesant the very first time I put it on, it&#x27;s odd rubbing jel into your arm pit. But once you know to expect that feeling when you put it on its not bad. The scent is pleasant, but strong. I would not recomned this for anyone who wears perfume or has an adverson to strong smells. The packaging is nice. The bottom clicks when turned which makes it easier to control when it comes out. It does it&#x27;s job to keep you clean, fresh, and dry. It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your clothes, and has a plesant scent. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast through Bzzagent.  I was skeptical it would give me 48 hour protection, so I decided to put it to the test.  I went camping over the weekend and applied the deodorant at the start of the trip.  At the end of the weekend, I was still smelling fresh.  It endured being active outdoors and hours of swimming.  I usually shower and apply deodorant daily, but if it works well for 48 hours, it clearly offers great protection for day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gel deodorant and goes on clear.  I typically use stick deodorant and have never had an issue with white marks, but others may find this feature important.  I found that I went through this deodorant quicker than my regular stick, which is the reason for my 4 star instead of 5 star review.</li>
    <li> I was luckily chosen by BzzAgent to try this product and give my honest opinion.  I&#x27;m usually a creature of habit and have used the same deodorant for as long as I can remember.  My first impression, was :), just taking the top off it smells amazing!  I was also pleasantly surprised and how refreshing the gel felt during application and then disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, smelling good and going on smooth are great in  their own right, the best part is the extended protection I get without worry.  It has not let me down once, and I&#x27;ve spent more time outdoors in the heat and humidity than inside this summer.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast deodorant from Bzzagent about a week or so ago and have been wearing it instead of my usual deodorant. It works really well. When you first put it on the smell is a little overpowering, but it simmers down quickly and smells quite nice. I love how I can wear my black work shirts and not have to get the white residue out of the pit areas. With the Secret Outlast iis clear so there&#x27;s no white residue to leave behind. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about the product is that it feels really wet when you first put it on, but thankfully it dries pretty quickly. It lasted through all my running, weight lifting, yoga, pitaiyo, and line dancing. All in all I day it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and wish I was able to have gotten more at this low low price</li>
    <li> Love using this. Kept me dry and fresh all day</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited when my BzzKit came for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Campaign. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different deodorants over the years and after much trial and error, I&#x27;ve finally become an avid user of the Secret Brand. I was a bit skeptical of the gel, I mean who has time to let the gel dry anyway and what a mess it usually is, but I was still ready to give this Clean and Clear gel a try. My first thought when I opened the lid, was how great the product smelled! No real secret* (pun intended!) that most of the Secret Brand Deodorants smell amazing and this particular stick, didn&#x27;t fall short. It was time to apply my new Secret Outlast Clear Gel... the product went on smooth and was dry within about a minute. No mess! I was pleasantly surprised. Often a big turnoff with gel deodorants is the simple fact that they don&#x27;t dry quickly enough. This is messy and as a woman, I just don&#x27;t have the extra time for this when getting ready in the mornings. Another great perk? I didn&#x27;t have to deal with any white streaks or flaking like I usually get from my solid stick deodorant. Several hours after application, I noticed that there was little to no perspiration and my underarms still smelt great. Overall, I thought the product was a good one. Not only did I get long lasting protection, but the deodorant was easy to use, quick drying with no mess and all the while still smelt great. No real secret here, just amazing underarm protection!</li>
    <li> I got this from buzzagent.I really enjoyed trying secret outlast,  Im a clear solid user because I tend to over use with clear gel. It works really well it keep me fresh smelling and dry during a day a water park with 90plus degree weather. I could smell the funk from other people that were not wearing good deodrant.  I also tried it out at disney, It worked wonders there as well. I love that it does not mark the clothing when you put on. Only dislike is that its a gel, I wish there was like a one click and you would know that it would be enough. It smells great!</li>
    <li> I have used Secret on and off for years, I am somewhat picky in my deodorant scents so I&#x27;m always looking for new ones. Of course I want one that gives me good protection from wetness and odor and no white marks, so I feel like I&#x27;m constantly trying new products as companies change their formulas and scents. I did her to try this product for free thanks to Secret and BzzAgent, so just wanted to throw that out there, but Secret&#x27;s new Outlast is great! No white marks, good odor and wetness protection. Now, does it really last 48 hours? I doubt it, but it gets me through a whole day and I still smell great, even when working outside all day! Plus the scents are great and its a clear gel so no white marks! A great product, good costs, good scents!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from BuzzAgent to try. I have been using the same deodorant for 10+ years. I have tried the gel type before but I always felt like they left my armpits sticky and feeling gross. So I was anticipating the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant would do the same. The first thing I noticed was the scent it was strong but not overpowering. When I applied it I noticed how easily it went on and within a couple seconds it was dry and to my surprise not sticky at all. I can&#x27;t even tell I have anything on. The protection is great as well and I do not have to reapply throughout the day. Great product and definitely will be switching my brand.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Secret fan, but haven&#x27;t tried any brand&#x27;s gel since I was a teenager. I remember it being sticky and making me feel sweaty before I even left the house! Ever since then, I hadn&#x27;t considered giving gel another chance. I stuck with what I know and what had been working for me for years (I love the scents Secret has!)... When I saw a BzzAgent campaign that would allow me to try a sample of secret outlast gel, I figured I have nothing to lose. When I went to use it for the first time, I wanted to really put it to the test. That day, I was doing brunch with my friends then going to a baseball game, which started at 1 PM and was plenty hot. My first thought when I put on the gel deoderant was.. It&#x27;s already dry! And guess what... my under arms stayed that way ALL DAY! I was wearing a tank top so I was happy to see that the gel doesn&#x27;t leave any of the clumps you often get with a solid. I would absolutely recommend giving gel another shot, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the invisible solid formula from Secret and didn&#x27;t really have great expectations for this gel formula.  After trying it for a couple of weeks, I was pleasantly surprised.  It worked much better than I expected &amp; had a very nice scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  The scent lasted quite a while too.  We&#x27;ve had an extremely hot summer and I wasn&#x27;t that excited about trying a new deodorant in case it didn&#x27;t hold up well.  On me personally in the extreme heat, it didn&#x27;t last as long as my invisible solid but it did make it through most of my work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula claims to be quick drying, but I found it did not dry that quickly.  Maybe compared to other gel formulas it dries fast?  Not having experience with other gel formulas I can&#x27;t really say.  That is the one thing I did not like about this product.  I also noticed if I put my shirt on right away it would make the fabric wet and took a while to dry once it got on there.  That was extremely uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are pros &amp; cons to both formulas, however I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching to the gel formula &amp; I&#x27;ll stick with my Secret invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample of this to review as a campaign from BzzAgent.com.  This review consists of my own thoughts &amp; experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> Having hyperdrosis I am always looking for the best deodorant to keep me dry!! Thanks to buzz agent.com I received my secrets outlast clear gel for free..I haven&#x27;t tried any gel deodorant before because I tought that gel will keep me more wet, but for my surprise this Deodorant dries fast !! I like it!! Because my constantly underarm sweat I used once a day instead of 24 Hrs protection!! Overall good!!! Past my sweaty Test !!</li>
    <li> I got this in my bzzagent kit and never thought it would really work. I have never been a fan of gel deodorant. I was pleasantly surprised. This stuff is amazing! And it lasts all day long! No goopy gunk. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It has been a long time since I have tried using a clear gel deodorant.  I was a little hesitant considering the last time I used one, i was a preteen.  Since being offered to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel deodorant for free from Bzzagent, I decided to go for it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the scent, as it was initially a little overpowering.  I used it for two weeks straight, and although it is advertised to offer 48 hours protection, it really only lasted about 24 hours.  It&#x27;s fairly expensive and I don&#x27;t feel as though with the amount given, is really worth it.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t care for Outlast.  I&#x27;ve tried gel deodorants before and didn&#x27;t like them. I thought this product would change my mind or be something remarkable. That wasn&#x27;t the case though because I still sweated and just didn&#x27;t like the feel of the gel. I will stick with a solid deodorant. The scent of the deodorant was nice though. I did receive this product courteous of Secret and BzzAgent for free to review.</li>
    <li> I decided to try out this deodorant as part of a BzzAgent campaign where Secret would send me a free sample size deodorant. I have not used Secret for many years (over 10yrs) so I figured why not give it another chance to see if anything has changed.&lt;br /&gt;I had stopped using Secret brand deodorants for 2 main reasons - 1. white residue and 2. lack of protection against wetness and odor. I went through trying many different brands and after getting married I decided that men&#x27;s deoderant was the bes choice for me. For the past 5 years I have been using Gillette&#x27;s gel deodorants. They have been effective in maintaining me dry, free of sweaty odors and streak-free. The one downfall about this is that I smell like &amp;#34;man.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t really know if others notice but I sure do! I decided to try a Secret&#x27;s Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for 4 weeks to see how well it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 weeks of trying he product I&#x27;m happy to report my complete satisfaction!&lt;br /&gt;1. No white marks!&lt;br /&gt;2. Dries fast&lt;br /&gt;3. It really does last all day ( can&#x27;t tell you if it lasts 48hrs because Im the person that feels the need to shoer daily)&lt;br /&gt;4. No bad odors&lt;br /&gt;5. Love the Completly Clean scent, smells so fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone that sweats excessively and maybe you&#x27;ve even considered a prescribed deodorant, I strongly recommend that you try this deodorant! It protects us women that sweat like a man, but provides a light scent to remind us of our feminity.</li>
    <li> It is official I am in love with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant…the switch has happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I received my free sample from the campaign at BuzzAgent I was very skeptical at first… about using a gel deodorant as I had used gel deodorants in the past and they always left me wet and sticky for a long period of time… a very icky feeling… or left a gross residue on my clothing from it soaking in to my shirt.  But…Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel dries super fast compared to any other gel deodorant I have tried! I was completely amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoyed the smell of the deodorant and how strong it is…total bonus in my opinion.  Two clicks are all it took to leave me feeling clean and fresh all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds up to its name and Outlasted my toughest extreme heat and humidity test.  My husband and I took our nephews to the Adventure and Water Park and it was smoldering hot from the get go…I mean sticky uncomfortable heat where even sitting you are oozing sweat and it is just dripping from your face… no movement required!  It was pure bliss when I discovered that even ten hours later and about a hundred water and roller-coaster rides later…even though my body was dripping in sweat…I was still in Armpit Perfume Heaven… my armpits had stayed fairly dry throughout the day… and they still smelled clean and fresh…Amazing!!!  If I had been using my normal deodorant I would have had to reapply several time throughout the day...or smell like a skunk in heat!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I stated at the beginning of this review I received this free product sample as part of a BzzAgent Campaign, but this review is my honest opinion of the product!  I would highly recommend this product to a friend or family member and I have purchased this product and will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent. It definitely lived up to it&#x27;s clear gel name, it goes on completely clear and never came off on my clothes. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with it as an antiperspirant. By the end of the day, not only was I sweaty, but frankly a little stinky too. I ended up switching back to my old deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love this product and helps with my over abundance of sweating. It helps keep me dry all day. Thanks to Secret and the BZZ Agent Campaign I got a free sample to try and I love it.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product for being a bzzagent. I live in the midwest, where summers are almost unbearable at times, so this campaign was timed perfectly for me.  I tested it on a couple of different occasions.  I don&#x27;t normally use a gel deodorant, and I must admit when I first heard about the product I got flashbacks to Junior High gym class and gooey armpits.  But it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve tried one so I gave Secret Outlast Completely Clean clear gel a shot.  It&#x27;s marketed as giving 48 hours of protection.  I work as a manager in a retail store, so I usually am doing a lot of running around and a lot of working with the public, so it&#x27;s important to me that my deodorant smells good and protects me through the day.  I put it on and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn&#x27;t a gooey mess, and also didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my work clothes.  I noticed the scent throughout the day, so that was a comforting feeling that the product was working.  I didn&#x27;t have to refresh midway through the day as I often had to after lunch with my other product.  I also noticed a difference as I interacted throughout the day, I wasn&#x27;t worried that a customer or a coworker was smelling a less than pleasant scent from me.  My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of the product.  Maybe if I had gotten another variety of it I would have liked it a little better, as it was a scent I wouldn&#x27;t pick on my own and more noticeable to me.  All in all if someone is looking for a new gel deodorant, I&#x27;d recommend this one, but make sure it&#x27;s a scent you are going to enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have always used Secret deodorant and always liked the different kinds Secret produced. I got the chance to sample for free the Outlast Clear Gel because I am  BzzAgent. Secret provided the samples to BzzAgent and I was one of those selected  to sample it. The first thing that struck me was the scent, which I love. I put it to the test  the first Monday after receiving it. First thing after dressing, a load of laundry started, next preparing breakfast for my family, Get them all up, dressed and at the breakfast table. A full time job some days just to get this done. Feed and let the dogs out then put that load of laundry in the dryer. Load kids in the car and off to school. Drop kids off then head to the grocery store. Purchase what I need for preparing dinner. Finally back home with the twins. Put them back in bed, maybe they will sleep a little longer. Clean the house and do more laundry. Take the dogs and twins for a brisk walk before time to pick kids up from school. Am I making any sense about Secret Outlast Gel? I hope I am showing the life of a wife, mother and homemaker and the importance of a deodorant that works! I don&#x27;t go to the gym, I don&#x27;t do yoga or aerobics but I get a pretty good workout and so does my deodorant so it is important to have one that will work to keep me dry and smelling fresh. Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the deodorant for me. It does OUTLAST like no other deodorant I have ever used and I intend on keeping it in my house. Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent I have finally found the deodorant for my lifestyle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the magic deodorant that keeps me dry even when it&#x27;s 100 degrees and I&#x27;m exercising...but under all normal circumstances, this is fantastic! Secret Outlast absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that annoying white residue all over my clothes.  It keeps me dry and smelling great during my normal activities.</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free thanks to BzzAgent and Secret, I absolutely loved this. I am a horrid sweater and nothing was working until I got to try this. Secret Outlast seriously saved me from pubic humiliation!!</li>
    <li> Got a FREE sample of the Secret Outlast thanks to BzzAgent. I have been using it for the past weeks ,and i just love the complete protection and the no white stain om my shirts . I use lots of dark shirt, its important that they dont get stain. Recommended</li>
    <li> Awesome deodorant. I like how it goes on smoothly and the scent is great. Is long lasting don&#x27;t leave any residue in the clothes. I recommend this product for tge whole family.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant that last 48 hours. Outlast during the 90 degree summer days plus humidity. It leaves no white residue on my shirts and is completely clear. I recieved a sample thanks to secret.</li>
    <li> Family loved Secret Outlast. Got a chance to review this product for Bzzagent and highly recommend it. I found no streaks on my colthing and the sent was great. Well worth the money for this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most effective deodorants I&#x27;ve used, so why not five stars? The product is rather pricey, however the biggest drawback is 2 out of three containers are only half filled, secondly the product doesn&#x27;t last long-in that I don&#x27;t get very many uses before the container is empty-even when the container is completely full. So I have weigh the effectiveness against the price and cost per use.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this since I don&#x27;t use gel type deodorant. It surprised me that it dried quickly and kept me sweat free all day in this Texas summer heat. I will buy again when I need it.</li>
    <li> #BzzAgent kit recrived to try out and review this product thanks to Secret. Love how it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing and it lasts longer than other brands. It keeps you dry without drying out and clumping. Highly recommend to try out as it works great!!</li>
    <li> I live in the Pacific Northwest, where we normally have beautifully tame summers with just a few &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; days. This free sample from Secret via BzzAgent couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time! I haven&#x27;t had to have any worry that this Secret Outlast wouldn&#x27;t keep my underarms dry and smelling wonderful. Yes, I&#x27;ve checked! No marks have been left on my dark colored tank tops! No more putting deodorant on during middle of the day. I&#x27;m doing the switch &amp; I am sticking with Secret Outlast from here on out. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant to try from BzzAgent.com. I&#x27;ve always loves the Secret brands of deodorant, so I was excited when I got to try the Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I put it on and it was a little cold at first but dried quickly, the deodorant had a great scent which I loved. I went outside and got all sweaty and it was still working great. I sweat a lot at night and still woke up feeling fresh. It leaves no white marks behind!</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant! It is easy to put on, dries very quickly and is not sticky.  I had initially some trouble getting it to come out of the container but after a few attempts it finally started coming out like it was supposed to.  The smell is pleasant enough although it has a hint of &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34; (body odor) which could just be the way I&#x27;m interpreting the smell.  I would like a different scent, possibly more citrus or even unscented.  I do like that it is completely clear and after ruining so many black shirts due to my solid antiperspirant, I will make the change to clear gel! I am a BzzAgent reviewing the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of my BzzKit for being a BzzAgent. This deodorant is fantastic! I have very sensitive skin, and this worked great for me, not even a small reaction. The scent is clean and slightly floral, but pleasant. And you get this amazingly refreshing sensation on your skin as the gel dries. Plus it keeps you fresh all day long! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample -- I&#x27;ve avoided gels for years because they used to be so heavy and took forever to dry.  Not this one -- I put it on, got dressed seconds later, and had zero white marks.  Even when wearing a black cotton top!  This got me through a water park/theme park combo weekend in 90 degree heat.  It seriously lasted and lasted and lasted.  I&#x27;m a gel convert!</li>
    <li> LOVE that I can use a Gel and not get white marks on my clothes - even if I&#x27;m wearing black! I was impressed with how the gel dried without leaving a sticky and tacky feeling. This is one thing that I&#x27;ve always hated about most gels, but this product dried like a solid stick - but went on with the ease of a gel.The wetness and odor protection (the smell is a little on the sweet side - I personally like a powdered scent better) are enough to Outlast a hot and humid New England day and even wake up the next morning still smelling sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I would switch from my normal product, mostly because of scent, but this a great product for hot summer days when you know you are not going to have time to shower going from day to night activities. I received a sample of this product for free from BzzAgent and I&#x27;m really glad that I got a chance to try it!</li>
    <li> I have twins and had yet to find a deodorant that kept me dry and fresh until I came across Secret Outlast ClearGel. Now I won&#x27;t use another! I did receive the product as part of a promotion from the brand but that did not influence my opinion.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this through BzzAgent and I was very impressed with it.  It really does work great at keeping you dry and odor free. I sweat a lot so it is very impressive that it kept me dry all day.  It dried pretty quickly and I didn&#x27;t get any white marks on my clothes.  I am going to be using this from now on since it has so far been the best deodorant that I have found to help with the sweating problem.</li>
    <li> I have been trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for the last couple weeks! I am impressed that the deodorant actually goes on clear and stays clear! I have yet to find any marks on my clothes!! I also believe I still smell good after a full day of activity and working outside! I would give this deodorant a five star rating if Secret didn&#x27;t use Aluminum, which has been proven to not be good for your body! I&#x27;m going to finish using this trial size product given to me free from Secret and BzzAgent! It doesn&#x27;t take much either (one click) and enough gel comes out to do one armpit. It drys quick and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it!! #gotitfree #freesecret</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast certainly does OUTLAST. When I was selected for this BzzAgent campaign I was so excited because I need extra protection, and a deodorant that lasts.  So I was happy to be testing Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent!!!  It was the perfect product for busy conferences in NYC last week with this summer heat.  It worked so well I didn&#x27;t have to be self-conscious. #epic48 #bzzagent #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from the retailer because I am a BzzAgent. I don&#x27;t usually use gel deodorant because it feels sticky, so I was a bit hesitant to try it. It does stay wet for about a minute or so after putting it on, but it&#x27;s really not too bad. It smells great and unlike others, the smell doesn&#x27;t change or get weird as the day goes on. It really did give me a full day worth of protection, and that&#x27;s not something I can say about the other stuff I was using before.</li>
    <li> I got Secret Outlast Completely Clean to test courtesy of Secret. And while I love the Secret brand, here&#x27;s my honest opinion: this one is just okay. While I didn&#x27;t experience any white marks which is great, I didn&#x27;t think it really stood up to my sweat and odor all day, never mind 48 hours. Maybe I&#x27;m just extra sweaty or something, but this formula isn&#x27;t for me. I love secret&#x27;s soft solids though!</li>
    <li> This really works wonders ! I got my free sample from bzzagent to try it out and I love it.  Once I opened it , it had a great smell to it . Then I put it on it dried so quickly and didn&#x27;t leave any stains on my shirt . Went ahead did my mommy duties and kept my underarm nice and smelling fresh . It really did last long .</li>
    <li> I am usually skeptical it Gel deodorants as they tend to me sticky.  The Secret Outlast Gel was a little sticky, however it did dry somewhat quickly.  Once the gel dries you are left with no white residue and a pleasant smell.  It promises that it is a 48 hour protection, but I like to put deodorant on every day so I am not really certain as to its long term abilities.  For the right price I would continue to purchase and use this.  I was given this product from BzzAgent for free.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret, I was able to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free.  I was skeptical at first, because I typically use a solid and not a gel, but after trying the Clear Gel for a couple of weeks, I was pleasantly surprised  I had to get used to the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling of the gel when you first put it on, but that went away after a couple of minutes.  I loved that I didn&#x27;t have any white marks on my clothes, which is something that happens with my solid deodorants.  I also felt totally protected for the entire day when using the Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  I&#x27;m not sure that I would be comfortable going 48 hours on it, but definitely comfortable for 24 hour protection.  I would definitely consider buying this deodorant and using it instead of my normal solid deodorant.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not normally used Gel Deodorant, so I was interested to see what I though of this product vs. the Secret solid that I am used to.  I did not find the Secret Outlast Gel Deodorant to be fast drying as promised. It left my underarms feeling damp. My underarms did not feel as fresh as they do when using a Secret solid deodorant.  I cannot attest to the 48 hour longevity of the product, as I used the product on a hot, humid summer day and needed to take a shower about 12 hours after application of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this product in the future, but I do love the Secret brand, and will stick with my Secret invisible solid for now!</li>
    <li> Love this product. The only thing I have against it is that it contains aluminum. Other than that, i have not stunk or sweat profusely using this product.</li>
    <li> There is only one thing that I liked about Secret Outlast and that was the smell. Other than that I was disappointed. After I shaved and applied the deodorant it burned. It didnt last long at all. Just cleaning house and sweating it couldnt compare to my normal deodorant. I used it up fast because I had to keep reapplying it. I guess the other positive in all this is that it is clear and doesnt leave white marks on shirts. I got this product free through Bzz Agent and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast clear gel for free as part of a BzzAgent review team. I normally use the Secret Clinical strength so I was worried this would not do the trick, but to my surprise it worked SO good! Not only did it keep me dry, but it was not wet or sticky at all. The clinical also leaves a residue that builds up on my razor &amp; the Outlast did not have any residue at all! I have already  purchased the Outlast in place of my regular Clinical strength!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample through BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m glad I did. While drying rapidly, the gel goes on smooth and clear. There is no stain or gloppy residue. I really like how the &amp;#34;completely fresh&amp;#34; scent works with my body. It doesn&#x27;t end up smelling funky or raunchy like some deodorants scents do. Most notably, is that it takes me through sweat sessions at the gym. ...It&#x27;s pretty nice being able to go to the next machine without getting nasty whiffs of my pits, as I had previously been doing. This deodorant is now my top choice! #epic48, #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a bzz kit for bzz agent. I assumed that it would be like every other deodorant I have tried, smells nice but only does the job half way. Boy was I wrong. First time I put it on I honestly did not like the feel but that lasted for about 20 seconds. After that I realized it was not sticky at all. It kept me dry like no other deodorant ever has and also didn&#x27;t wear off quickly. It smells nice and I had no white residue. I highly recommend this product. I wrote this review as bzz agent kaybrac</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! It lasts all day long even on the hottest days! I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying it! Thanks to bzzagent and Secret for sending me a free sample to try out and review!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product through bzzagent.com. This deodorant is pretty good. It has a great scent that stays with you through the day. I like the clear gel so no white marks can be seen. I don&#x27;t think there is a deodorant that helps you not sweat in Texas humidity this year!</li>
    <li> I was not sure how much I would like this deodorant, since I had tried other clear gels in the past and they usually left my underarms feeling damp or slippery. But this deodorant did not, and exceeded all my expectations. It actually did last 48 hours as it claims, and dries very quickly when applying it. I am very satisfied with this deodorant, and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally a doce deodorant user and have been for years do to allergies. I took advantage of the chance to tree it for free from Secret. I workout daily and do all the things that come with being a busy mom to two kids. I love that I don&#x27;t end up with white streaks on my shirt if a preschooler bumps into me while applying and that even when I wake up at 2am I still smell fine while caring for the baby. The smell is great, I don&#x27;t always want to smell like baby powder.</li>
    <li> I was given an opportunity through Bzzagent to try this gel deodorant for free. I was a bit skeptical at first because I have never been a fan of gel deodorants. However, after using it for a few weeks now I am pretty happy with the performance of this product. I tend to sweat a lot in the summer heat and this deodorant keeps me sweat free for several hours. I love the scent too. It has a light refreshing scent that you can smell hours after applying it. But the best part is that because it is a clear gel it leaves absolutely no residue on my clothes! Normally when I&#x27;ve used gels in the past they take awhile to dry. This particular deodorant dries quickly and leaves your armpits and clothes dry.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and I would purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> It works.  You have to let it dry completely and in the meantime it feels weird but it works so that&#x27;s cool.  I received a small sample for free to try and I think I&#x27;ll purchase some more when it runs out.  I need one click for each arm and it lasts for 2 (or three...) days even in the heat and humidity of the South.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free from BzzAgent to review and test. I was excited to try out this new and improved deodorant that promised wetness and odor protection. Hhowever, all it left me with was wet armpits. I am normally a dry spray/invisible solid girl because they work, but I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give this new product a try. Nope nope nope nope. Wet armpits are uncomfortable, cold, and well, wet! No one wants wet armpits, and I had nearly zero odor control. Maybe this stuff works for someone out there, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for me. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent I was able to try this product for free. This product has now become one of my regulars. I put it to test when I recently went car shopping in 98 degrees Georgia heat. Though I was exhausted afterwards my underarms were still dry and fresh. I&#x27;ve had other deodorants crap out on me in the middle of the day but with this one I don&#x27;t think I will be having that problem. Another plus...no white marks! So I can wear my cute tanks without ruining them.</li>
    <li> I was completely surprised when I got a chance to try this out for free from Bzz Agent .. I normally dread the wet cold gel deodorant and they normally do not last more then a few hours . Secret Outlast was a breath of freshness all through out my busy day of working going home and doing 40 minutes of cardio and still felt and smelt fresh and clean. The best part no white marks on my black tank tops and my daughter loves it too. I love it so much that I already purchased some and intend to do so .</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed trying out this deodorant. The smell was great nothing too overpowering. It&#x27;s also clear so no white or visible residue. I would definitely switch over from my previous secret deodorant to outlast</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product through Bzzagent. There were some parts of the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant that I liked and other parts that I did not care for. I can say that I enjoyed the smell and this deodorant truly does eliminate the white mark issue that is so common with other products. I would continue to use this deodorant just for that reason if it wasn&#x27;t for the other not so healthy property- aluminum. As for the parts I didn&#x27;t like as much, I felt as though a lot of product was necessary to actually provide the wetness protection for an extended period of time. On top of this, I found that overall, the sample provided ran out quite quickly, suggesting that again, more product was necessary. Overall, I found this deodorant to be decent but I will most likely not be repurchasing for health reasons.</li>
    <li> I have been given this product for free thanks to Secret via Bzzagent.  I have used this deodorant for the first time when I got it to give it a try. I was a little bit disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t cover like it says,for active activities and to use at my job it doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t get enough coverage during the whole day. Then I decided to use it when it&#x27;s indoor activities to see if it works for me like that and it did. It makes you feel fresh and the scent is smooth and not that strong. I would say it needs just a little improvement for more active persons who sweat alot otherwise I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from bzzagent to try as a sample. I was very impressed by how it performs. It dries fast and leaves no residue on your clothes. It last long even in sweaty conditions. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel FREE thanks to Secret and BzzAgent. I was definitely impressed with how well it kept me dry even on the hottest days and it definitely prevented any unwanted odor for a long time. Also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave behind any visible residue so no fear of wearing black and getting streaks on my shirts.</li>
    <li> I found that Secrets Outlast stands buy it&#x27;s name completely.I live in Florida so for those that don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s usually hot,humid,or muggy.Outlast worked so well it kept me dry and fresh smelling through the worst of weather that was sent my way.So Yes Secret Outlast is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I Love the secret outlast completely clean. I received it free from Bzzagent.com and It really does last all day. It&#x27;s really good for those hot humid days when you get a little stinky from sweating so much just one swipe and no more smell plus it&#x27;s nice and dry. I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry. I really love that it is a clear gel as well.</li>
    <li> This deoderant is amazing It smells great and lasts all day long. Even on my worst days of sweating it stayed strong and without the presence of white marks on my clothing! I love it</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel from Secret as part of a promotion.  I can  honestly say I am very pleased with Secret outlast Clear Gel, and its 48 hours of protection.  As a new Mom, I have a million things to worry about, and I am so grateful that staying cool and dry in the balmy and hot summer is not one of them.  I also love not worrying about getting white streaks on my clothing.  I find I&#x27;m constantly running around now and I love not having to think about perspiration during the day.  I have to admit, I was a little nervous to try a new deodorant, as in the past, clinical strength has been the only way to keep me dry.  This far exceeded my expectations and works just as well as the more expensive clinical strength options.  Well done Secret.  You are my favorite new #MomHack for sure.</li>
    <li> I typically use a different brand of deoderant that I feel makes me sweat very little. I received a small trial size to review from secret of this deoderant however it was the scented one and found that firstly it smelled much better than the deoderant that I currently use. Second, that I do still sweat with it on a little. So while not 100% effective it still smells fresh and keeps you smelling fresh all day!</li>
    <li> I Aboustley love this deodorant is actually one of the only deodrants that stick to what they advertise!! It keeps you dry long and no white deodrant marks! Im usually not a fan of gel deodorants but this gel deodorant is the best it drys so quickly after putting it on! I got to try this product free from bzz agent and secret!!</li>
    <li> I received this free to review from Secret, however, all thoughts are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was leery of using a gel for my underarms.  I was worried it would stay wet and stinky, but thankfully I was completely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel quickly dried and actually felt kind of good going on as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stayed dry and had no lingering odors while wearing it.  I enjoyed it and will likely buy it again in the future (in fact, it&#x27;s in my cart here right now)</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant for free from bzzagent.com. This deodorant is great. This is gross, but as a new mom, I sometimes forget to put on deodorant, but this clear gel still works the next day even. I took one start away because I wish it dried a little faster. I live in a humid climate though, so maybe it&#x27;s not a fair expectation.</li>
    <li> Works good. Dries very fast. Great fragrance. And of course Secret brand always a great value. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product - no white marks, dries super fast, smells great, and does not bother my sensitive underarm skin after shaving.  Would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant from Secret through BzzAgent and just in time! My natural deodorant was not cutting it in this southern heat. Immediately the first time I applied it, the smell was so nice. It took a little getting used to as my other deodorant is not nearly as strong. I was also skeptical about it being a gel. I&#x27;ve used gels in the past and they take forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast works great and dries fast. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with excess sweat or body odor since I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think I will go back to my natural deodorant as it cools down. I can&#x27;t imagine what kind of chemicals are this to keep me from sweating but I&#x27;m a heavy sweater so I needed something to keep me from stinking halfway through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks BzzAgent and Secret!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I have found the best deo out there!!! For someone who wears a lot of black shirts this is fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free as a promotion from the company and BzzAgent. I work in a hot and humid climate and this Deoderant held up to those condition and still made me feel fresh and clean at the end of a 10 hour work day! I definitely would recommend this to any woman looking for a dependable and true deodorant!</li>
    <li> This deodorant actually does what it says it&#x27;s going to do! It goes on clear, stays clear and it keeps you feeling dry and stink free allllll day!!! It&#x27;s definitely hard to find one that works as it says its going to but i&#x27;m hooked! I&#x27;m so glad I received my free sample from Secret!!!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean free to try for my opinion... Thanks Secret! I have always used solid deodorant and never really thought about changing until I received this in the mail. I LOVE IT! I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave those irritating white marks on all my tops. I love the smell. It says that it lasts up to 48 hours and I believe it! I did not go 48 hours in between uses but it lasted the entire time I had it on each time. I work in a call center so I am not outside much during the week but we went out on the boat over the weekend and I never once felt like it was wearing off. It dries pretty quickly and again it smells amazing! I will definitely continue to use and recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I really, really love this product. I got a free sample from bzzagent.com and I am a forever buyer of this. Please ladies if you have a crazy lifestyle and do not want to worry about whether you can lift your arms without being insecure about the smell, BUY THIS. I have sensitive skin too, so finding a 48 hour deodorant that works and SMELLS good, total win! Thank god for this! :D</li>
    <li> Works to reduce sweat and odor. I received as a sample and am pretty happy with it. Took a star off for containing aluminum... I&#x27;m switching to more natural brands.</li>
    <li> What I would want to know before I purchase this product is that it&#x27;s a great product. I love the fact it keeps you dry and you outlast everyone. When I first put the Secret outlast on I thought it made my under arms feel a little wet. I would say within 30 seconds it was completely dry. Also it was completely clear. I was able to slide my scrubs top on and no white marks nothing transferred. I was so happy about this because I work in a hospital and I have to wear blue scrubs. There have been many times I have had to run out the door with white deodorant marks on my scrub top, well not anymore. I am very impressed with the 48-hour odor and wetness protection. I have used it while I have ran around work in the hospital for 8 hours shifts and I am still dry when I get home at the end of my day. I have also used it when I went to an all day outdoors summer rock concert and I outlasted everyone with dry underarms it was great. I love this product I recommend everyone try it and find your new love for dry underarms.Thanks secret for letting me try your product for free.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from BzzAgent to try out - and I loved it! I&#x27;ve used long lasting deodorants like the clinical strength and Certain-Dry and I&#x27;ve liked those products. I don&#x27;t have a sweating problem per say but I am active and spend a lot of time outdoors in the summer and the outlast works! I like that I can apply it in the morning and it goes to work. I usually don&#x27;t like gel but this dries really fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothes, also doesn&#x27;t stain. It&#x27;s good for special events like weddings too because you apply it once and you won&#x27;t ruin expensive dresses with stains. It is affordable and I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> So far I am liking this deodorant! I received it free from BzzAgent. Doesn&#x27;t leave any marks/white streaks on your clothes since it is a clear gel. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when applied either! It smells decent and seems to last awhile so far. Will update review after I&#x27;ve used it even longer.</li>
    <li> I recently got to try Secret Outlast 48- hour protection for free thanks for being a BzzAgent. I am the type of person to go between different deodorants and use them frequently throughout the day. Ladies, this product is amazing! I have mainly been using Secret Clinical Strength for the past couple of years. I love the scent and especially love the wetness control. One thing I did not care for was the white marks left behind on my clothing. This new deodorant does not leave any marks and is fast drying. It has the same great scent and lasted through my workout with dry arms and no white stains on my tank top. This will be my new go to product. Everything I already love from a brand I trust and now no white marks either. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that ladies. If you are thinking of trying a new deodorant, you will not be disappointed in the quality and long- lasting protection you will experience. If I could give this product 10 stars I would. Will be purchasing this soon and from now on.</li>
    <li> As full disclosure, I&#x27;m part of the BzzAgent campaign for Secret Outlast. This product is fantastic. I workout, sometimes twice a day, I stress at work, all things that can cause sweat, and that unpleasant odor that can occur. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Secret, but prior to this I used the clinical strength because nothing else worked. Well, this does. I&#x27;ve been using it for several days now and I&#x27;m completely impressed. It smells amazing, a very clean, fresh scent that&#x27;s reminiscent of just washed laundry. Not overpowering, or overly flowerly, just clean. It powers through my workouts with me, and handles the worst of the work stress I can throw at it. Best of all, it leaves NO marks on my tops. This is literally the only deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used that the claim was actually true. My next grocery trip will include a switch to this product.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this to try. I am not impressed. I dislike the scent, I prefer powder scent which I see they also have. But I do NOT like the way this works. I used it and the same day went for a walk, it was only mid 80&#x27;s and not humid. I would normally be fine in that, but with this on I had very sweaty pits! GROSS.</li>
    <li> When I got chosen to be part of this product trial by Secret for theirs Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant, I must admit, I was hesitant at first. I spent a lot of years trying to find the right deodorant for me as far as brand, texture, scent, and price point. Of course, always willing to try something new, I reluctantly tried this product and have to admit, was surprised by the results. Not only is this deodorant&#x27;s scent blow you away amazing, but the dryness it gives you is unbelievable! I actually kept going back to check and see if it was still there!! I have tried a lot of different deodorants in the past, and I think this is the quickest drying deodorant I have ever applied in my life. I really like this stuff. While I am used to a white deodorant, I found myself not minding that it was clear, but I did have a heck of a time getting it to apply. The stick was so small and there wasn&#x27;t that much product inside it, so I was only able to apply it a few times. I feel like it should be a bit easier to apply than it was, but this is hardly a large concern once it gets flowin&#x27;! As far as 48 hour protection is concerned, I did not find it lasted for 48 hours myself, more like 16-24, but again, it&#x27;s all relative to what you&#x27;re doing in your life. I really did like this deodorant and it is making me a convert by the scent alone!</li>
    <li> I recently moved to Georgia, and it is hot and humid here!  I am really happy that I got this free sample from BzzAgent before I moved.  I used it the first couple weeks down here and it was awesome!  I walk about 50 minutes each way from home and back and this deodorant holds up throughout the sweaty walk.  I feel good when I wear this deodorant and I am not afraid to walk into a room of people after walking outside for an hour.  Thank you to BzzAgent and Secret for the free sample!  I will definitely be buying it soon.</li>
    <li> I did receive this free to try but my opinion isn&#x27;t biased. It&#x27;s no shock that most women hate the gel deodorant for many reasons.. It&#x27;s sticky, messy, leaves wet marks on your shirt armpits etc. With this Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant it smells amazing, dries quicker than most (when using gel i always do the fanning of the armpit before dressing) but it didn&#x27;t take nearly as long as others,lasts a long time (I don&#x27;t think it will last a full 48) but still quite a while, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on but you still get the awesome affect and it protects from wetness pretty well. I did manage to break a sweat at working out but I fully expected that. All in all I was very satisfied with pleasantly surprised to see I actually liked a gel!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as a member of Bzzagent. My honest opinion is that this deodorant isn&#x27;t really much better than the next. It does go on clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on your black clothing. I did notice that something in it is almost corrosive to my clothing, more so than another deodorant. In all honesty I probably would continue my search for a good deodorant and not purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those girls who tries on half her closet every morning looking for that &amp;#34;perfect outfit&amp;#34;. I was tired of finding white marks all over my clothes (inside and out) from frequently trying on and taking off. When I was given the chance to try out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Deodorant free from BzzAgent I jumped at the chance and boy am I glad I did! If you&#x27;re tired of having to choose between having white marks all over your clothes or staying dry/smelling good then you need to give this a try! You get the best of both worlds and even better, it&#x27;s affordable! #epic48 #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Not reallt into gel deodorants. I got this for free to try out and I decided to give it a try... It worked ok with smell protection but it felt wet for a long time, I didnt like the fact that it took too long to dry out.</li>
    <li> I received a tester of Secret Outlast through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use solid stick deodorant, which works well to guard against both wetness and odor. In the past I have used gel deodorants and I wasn&#x27;t really a big fan.  They didn&#x27;t seem to last very long and they&#x27;d usually feel really goopy and gross if I didn&#x27;t get the right amount on.  However, that is definitely NOT true of this deodorant.  The scent of the gel is light, not overly perfumey but nice.  After application it feels dry and clean like you have nothing on at all.  Even on really hot days when I was outside hiking there were no wetness or odor issues.  (And no white marks left on my clothes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really surprised by how much I liked Secret&#x27;s Outlast gel deodorant because it is pretty different than what I usually use.</li>
    <li> I received a tester of this product for free via BzzAgent. I had used a type of Secret clear gel in the past and have since switched to a solid. I don&#x27;t really like the feeling that cold, wet, gel gives me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular one seemed like it took forever to dry and got on my t-shirts. It seemed to discolor the armpits of a few of my t-shirts. I had to walk around with my arms in the air for a few minutes before getting dressed to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really put it to the test the day I had my military range fire. I live in a hot, humid area so I figured I would see how long it really lasted. After about an hour out in the heat I felt like I needed to re-apply. The scent was long gone, and I didn&#x27;t feel like it was offering any protection. By lunchtime I had put my old deodorant back on. I wish I could say it passed the test... but it didn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
    <li> I tried secret outlast clear gel and was skeptical before I sampled it. However, I was so impressed! I had never tried a gel deodorant before, but I love how it glides on smoothly and simply. I also love that you don&#x27;t get any white deodorant marks or stains on your clothes! As for performance, it outlasted my expectations. I put it through the ringer by exercising and running errands with my kids without showering in between. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fresh I still felt after arriving home. I may become a deodorant convert now...thanks, bzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I was lucky to get to try the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel Antiperspirant for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign. When standing in front of all of the choices out there, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been drawn to this one on my own, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shied away from gel antiperspirants and deodorants in recent years because of mediocre experiences in the past. When I used them before, it would take FOREVER for it to dry so I could put on my clothes. So I would be walking around the bathroom with my arms in the air or even blowing in my armpits (there&#x27;s a picture for you) trying to get it dry so I could get dressed and be on with my day. The one think I have always liked about a clear gel is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue--something that cannot be said for many of the solids I have used in the past or currently use. And I can&#x27;t stand getting dressed in a new sharp outfit and almost ready to go out the door and then seeing chalky white marks on my black sweater. Infuriating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I tried the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel for the first time, I had some prejudices (both positive and negative) about gel antiperspirants. But I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it dried! I put it on and it seemed like it dried within seconds. I was able to get dressed right away. And when I did the &amp;#34;sweater check&amp;#34;, I was pleased to see that this one, like previous gels I had tried, left no residue on my clothes. When I got undressed at the end of the day, I also checked inside my clothes and saw that there was no residue there either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for a couple of weeks now. It works very well and I also realized that I really like the scent. I usually go for unscented simply because so many scented ones are way too strong. This one has a kind of nondescript &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent (they named it well) and it is very light: once it dries I haven&#x27;t really noticed it anymore. This is especially nice for days I want to wear a scented lotion or perfume--this way those don&#x27;t have to compete with my deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the only downside of a gel is that I just got back this week from traveling internationally and I didn&#x27;t take this one with me because I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t pass the &amp;#34;gel/liquid&amp;#34; check in my carry-on baggage (or that it would put me over the limit) and also I was concerned that all of the jostling of my suitcase could possibly leave me with a bunch of gel getting shook out into the cap and potentially creating a mess in my luggage. I just ended up bringing a small sample size of another deodorant for the trip to avoid possible issues. Since I didn&#x27;t test it, I don&#x27;t know if these concerns were founded or not, so I won&#x27;t rate it down for that. This is not a concern for most everyday use, and the rest of my experience was very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to see from Secret is for them to come out with a deodorant version (this is an antiperspirant containing aluminum). I am not a purist, I do use antiperspirant with nicer clothes I want to protect, but I do think it is much healthier to use a deodorant most days. If Secret had both products (antiperspirant version and a simple deodorant version), I would be very happy to be able to switch between the two.</li>
    <li> I received a Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel (that’s a mouthful!) deodorant to try for free from BzzAgent &amp; Secret. I’ve always been a solid deodorant kind of girl – I’ve tried a few gels once in a while in the past but have never been very satisfied. I realized recently though that my solid deodorant wasn’t working as well as I wanted it to – or rather, my husband told me it wasn’t. Embarrassing! Literally the day after I decided I needed to see what else was out there, I was offered the chance to try the Secret Outlast gel and I jumped at it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying for about a month, let me just say I smell GREAT! I am genuinely impressed with my Secret clear gel deodorant. It feels really funny going on if you’re not a regular gel-deodorant user, because it’s cool and wet, of course, but it dries really fast. The scent is light and really ‘clean’ smelling – but if you prefer, they have a few other scents as well that I think are more floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant claims to offer 48 hours of odor protection. I haven’t taken them up on that claim (yet…) but I have definitely gone 24 hours between application and my next shower and honestly, you wouldn’t be able to tell! I do feel protected, clean-smelling, and like I can go about any activity without feeling like I need to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a solid to gel convert now, definitely.</li>
    <li> As a member of BzzAgent, I was given a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I had never felt confident with even the most expensive deodorants or anitperspirants. Chronic sweating has plagued me since adolescence, and even prescription strength deodorants stopped the profuse sweating. With that constant sweating, embarrassment arose because of the pit stains or wet spots in my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, I no longer experience the wet armpits or the constant sweating. Even after doing a nerve-wrecking presentation that would have normally sent me into a sweating frenzy before, I had dry armpits and stayed cool and fresh. The clear gel is great for any shirt, as it leaves no embarrassing residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is a godsend for people with over-active sweat glands. The fresh scent adds to my confidence.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this deodorant that I received free from BzzAgent thanks to Secret. I received my product and immediately tried it the smell was fresh and clean it went on smooth and did not leave white marks. As the day went on I noticed the smell of the deodorant getting a little strong and over bearing but it was not getting rid of the b.o. my body was producing. I am a stay at home mom of two energetic on the go girls. I am always working on something around the house or DIY projects and was hoping I found a deodorant to keep up with me, unfortunately this deodorant did not. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from BzzAgent.  I was so thrilled with how wonderful it worked for me that I went out and purchased a full sized product within a few days.  Secret Outlast helps me stay confident all day long by keeping me feel fresh, clean, dry and smelling my best!  The fragrance is light, but pretty.  The protection from this deodorant is amazing!  I&#x27;m very happy that I got the chance to discover this product.  It will definitely make everything from doing simple chores to exercise so much easier.</li>
    <li> I received this as a part of a promotion from the brand. The smell is okay, but nothing great. It keeps me from sweating if any at all on my underarms. It lasts for quite awhile. The only problem for me is that it makes me very itchy most of the time. I also don&#x27;t care for how it feels on at first. So overall it&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t care for it myself. May work better for others with less sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that this deodorant when on clear and did not make any marks on my clothes, I tend to wear dark color clothing and run into that problem frequently. I found that the deodorant itself lasted a long time and I felt clean and not stinky on these 90 degree days we have been having here in Michigan. The only reason I did not give this product a 5 because it seemed to take longer than I would like to dry after my initial application but was great once it was on and dried up.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this from Bzzagent, and I will definitely be purchasing this in the future. I don&#x27;t really have an issue controlling wetness, so i cannot say if it is any better than another deodorant at that. However, it provides superior odor protection. I go through so many deodorants trying to find one that works, none work for more than a few hours. This lasted all through the day, all through the night, and even through a workout. Plus, no white marks! Even the clear solids leave white marks, this does not. It lasts all through the day, and the smell of the deodorant doesn&#x27;t fade either, which is a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product via Buzzagent wanting me to use and review this product. I have to say the best thing about this deodorant is you dont have to worry about white marks on dark clothing. The smell is not the best but maybe I&#x27;ll get use to it. Worst thing for me was the really wet feeling after appling it. I felt like i had to keep my arms raised to get it to dry. Over all not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I got this product from BzzAgent.  This smells really, really good. It also left no white marks on my shirts. I live in Florida and I sweat alot. I feel dry not wet using this and no little white ball clumps under my arms. Also I wore some yesterday before I got into the pool. I thought stupid now it will wash off. Nope. I could even smell the wonderful scent all day I was in the pool. So its waterproof! I also have super sensitive skin. I shaved close and used with no irritation or burning! However, when first putting it on it is sticky/tacky feeling. I didn&#x27;t care for that. So it lost one star for that. Even though its sticky at first the feeling goes away in minutes. I say TRY IT you won&#x27;t be sorry and for a non-fruity scent like I&#x27;m used to, you will LOVE this SCENT! I do I&#x27;m the weirdo smelling my good smelling arm pits.</li>
    <li> So we all know how HUMID it has been as of late, here in the great City of Bingaling. Well I got a sample of Secrets Outlast Clear gel from Secret and Bzzagent. Free just for me to give my opinion. I love how it controls the amount of perspiration, and also smells fresh... ALL DAY LONG. I was sent the Completely Clean scent. And it worked so well. I&#x27;m excited to buy more and try the other scents as well. I have a black swimsuit that I wore all day, contemplating getting into the pool. Never made it there, even with the kids coaxing me, but I still have a black bathing suit, UNSTAINED by the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest anyone who wants to stay fresh and is having relationship issues with the deodorant you are currently involved in, spend the money and check it out.#ItsSoWorthIt.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if u happen to work by someone who is having some odor issues this summer, but u don&#x27;t wanna be mean and tell them they be stinkin&#x27;.  Let them in on our Secret, by saying its a new product... Even buy them some and say it&#x27;s new and u just bought it and you may spend a few dollars and have a stank free summer.</li>
    <li> I received a free travel size sample of this product through BzzAgent.  I have used it twice so far, once while I was midly active and once for a very active 8 1/2 shift at work in 93 degree heat. It lasted! I immediately loved the &#x27;Completely Clean&#x27; scent and most importantly my pits did not feel sticky after application.  I will buy this product again (in its full size of course).</li>
    <li> I must say this stuff is really clear! Goes on nice and cool and dries immediately! Does not leave any white marks, flakes or rubs off on clothes! It smells soooooo fresh and amazing! With the busy hot summer, I do not find it lasting 48 hours, not even one full day.  But it faintly fades away still leaving a trace of its wonderful scent! Got it as part of a BuzzAgent Campaign free to try.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size of this deodorant, from a buzz kit... I got it for free. I already like the secret brand, but I am just not big on these gel deodorants. I felt like this was still wet, even 10 minutes after I put it on. It did its job, I just am not a fan  of the gooey feeling it leaves on my underarms.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried gel deodorants in years but when I was given the opportunity to try this for free via BzzAgent, I decided to give it a shot. I have used it for a few days now and so far, so good. The scent wouldn&#x27;t be the one that I was choose for myself, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference and in no way affects the performance of the product. I usually wear black or some dark color on a regular basis, so to see that this isn&#x27;t leaving any type of white marks I really impressive! I have been a faithful Dove deodorant user for years now, but I&#x27;m definitely considering switching! It&#x27;s going to be super hot and humid this week where I live, so if the Secret Outlast holds up--then it will make itself a permanent fixture in my life. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a change and looking to get rid of any type of white mark and if you sweat alot--this is the stuff for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Secret!  The Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is great for those long days where you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about your deodorant not working.  It lasts for 48 hours so I feel safe for those never ending work days or when I&#x27;m on the go.  I also love that it is clear and it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark shirts.  One less thing to worry about when I change my mind about what I want to wear after putting on deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this for free in my bzzzagent box. I have tried clear deodorants before and they have never worked for me! This stuff is a total game changer. I didn&#x27;t sweat all day, and never got stinky. I am constantly switching deodorants because i feel like my body becomes used to them and they lose their effectiveness. This also left NO WHITE MARKS! on my clothes. I wear a lot of black and i hate getting residue on my tops. I layered on other deodorants because they would wear off so quickly. I never had to layer or reapply this product. LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells really good and goes on clear.  I haven&#x27;t had any wetness under my arms thanks to this deodorant.  It is a clear gel that&#x27;s stays clear.  It has worked for hours for me even after working in the yard.  I know that you get complete dryness and clear results to help protect your clothes! #epic48 I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Secret and BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> Secret is my go to brand of deodorant, so when I received the opportunity from bzzagent and Secret to try the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free, I was over joyed. I wish my sample was bigger because I LOVE IT!! I wear A LOT of dark colors so I always have those &amp;#34;dreaded white marks&amp;#34; on my clothes, and this hasn&#x27;t done that once. I purposely tried to make it happen, and failed. My most #epic48 has been when I have been running errands in the summer heat, doing chores around the house, and the dreading task of tackling my hair all within a 24 hour period with no odor at all, I am also a bit overweight due to health reasons so I sweat a little easier now. This does as it says. I would definitely buy this and use it every day. Again my only complaint, I wish the sample they sent me was bigger, I miss it already!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Secret &amp; bzzagent. I Never thought about buying a Gel type deodorant always been a white solid person. For now on I will be buying secret outlast gel. Doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is awesome. I don&#x27;t usually like gel formulas, but I received this as a sample from BzzAgent and thought I should give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did because I will be buying this from now on as my daily deodorant. It dries pretty quickly and the clear gel doesn&#x27;t stain. The biggest benefit is the long lasting smell. For some reason my body becomes resistant to other deodorant scents after a few weeks of use. This means I end up putting on deodorant at least 4 times a day so that the scent is refreshed. I&#x27;m happy to say that this hasn&#x27;t happened with the Outlast Clear Gel. Still smelling great, all day, every day!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love that it is a clear gel, so no worring about it getting streaks of white on your shirt. And it last for 48 hours!  Love it! This is my new deodorant. Disclaimer....I got this product free for review, but this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast free as a promotion. I&#x27;m a BzzAgent. I have always used Dove Clinical for the past few years. I find that Secret doesn&#x27;t leave ANY residue, lasts MUCH longer, and is slightly cheaper. It doesn&#x27;t last the full 48 hours for me, but it does match up to, or beat, the 24 hours I get from clinical strength. Try it. You&#x27;ll definitely like it!!</li>
    <li> I got a small sample size to try for free from BzzAgent and I really liked the deodorant. Though, I don&#x27;t think I will be switching only because I find that it works just as good as the Secret Scent Expression deodorant that I normally use(actually its almost identical) but it doesn&#x27;t have as many scents to choose from. I love that it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on your armpits or clothes and it smells divine! It does go on wet, which may be weird for some, but it drys very quickly. Actually, I get dressed first then apply my deodorant and continue getting ready. I would say it is completely dry within a minute of application.</li>
    <li> I got Secret Outlast via a BzzAgent Campaign and was very excited to try something different! I was using Dove deodorant for quite sometime and felt that I needed a change, but wasn&#x27;t quite sure what I should try next. So getting this in the mail for free was the perfect opportunity! I was a little skeptical about using the gel at first, but to my surprise, it goes on great, dries quickly and definitely helps protect while smelling great! In the past, I felt that my deodorant needed some reapplying halfway through the day and i must say that I don&#x27;t feel that I need to reapply with this. It also doesnt leave white marks all over your clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!! I mean everyone&#x27;s body is different, but this works great on me!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, It smells really good and goes on clear.  I would recommend any woman who doesn&#x27;t want to constantly reapply there deodorant through out the day try this!</li>
    <li> This deodorant leaves absolutely no white marks on my shirt and if has a very light scent that smelled clean and fresh. The deodorant worked really well, with no reapplications through the day and I really recommend it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I got a sample of this for free</li>
    <li> Through Bzzagent, I had the opportunity to try the Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant.  I absolutely loved the scent.  It&#x27;s light and clean and I actually stopped using my regular perfume because I felt this was a nice scent on its own.  The clear gel definitely takes away the worry of getting a white mark on my top and I&#x27;m not doing the acrobatic maneuvers just to apply it.  I have not yet put to test the 48 hour longevity, but I do know I still have that fresh clean scent at the end of a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have never found a great deodorant product that would combat wetness effectively.  I have always been conscious of the colors or fabrics I would wear as inevitably, I would have a wet mark even though I don&#x27;t sweat profusely.  This product didn&#x27;t make it better or worse.</li>
    <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent and it is wonderful. Dried super quick, not a single white mark. I may have just been converted to gel deodorant #GotItFree</li>
    <li> So I got Secret Outlast clear gel for free to review in the mail today. I tried it after my workout and my detox bath. That was at 7pm AKDT. It is now 11:30pm AKDT and it&#x27;s still humid!!! I don&#x27;t like it. That is why I do not buy gel deodorants. It takes forever to dry, and even though it may be clear, it will in fact get on my clothes and that is unacceptable. Personally, I do not recommend it. The only pro is that it smells great, but that is not enough to change my mind. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> It is a fantastic deodorant.  It goes on clean and clear.  No stains on my clothing. It smells fresh and clean.  It lasted the whole weekend for me when I forgot to put some on on Sunday morning.  It really does &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; other brands.  The gel is a little wet feeling at first but that goes away really quickly.  This is a great Deodorant for the purse or diaper bag.  This is great for the busy moms out there.  I got to try this from receiving a free sample from BzzAgent.  I would most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is a refreshing way to keep you clean and clear of any sweat. The gel goes on smooth and dries quickly so you can be out the door and feeling protected even before your first stressful moment. Throughout the day, Secret Outlast Clear Gel keeps you free from showing your stress either in a stressful moment or in 90 degree Texas weather. I love this deodorant as it keeps me dry under my arms even though the rest of me is heating up! It works for me as I exercise the next day, keeping me dry and protected. It&#x27;s fresh scent is not overpowering either; it smells refreshing as you put it on, but absorbs into your skin so that you can wear another fragrance without the smells mixing. A must buy!</li>
    <li> I love,LOVE this deodorant. I am usually not a fan of gel deodorants bc of the squishy feel u get once u apply &amp; before it dries. This deodorant dried rather quickly. The scent is very pleasant &amp; fresh smelling, it is strong but not over bearing. It did not stain my black tank tops, nor did it leave the ashy skin look on my pits. I put the Secret Outlast to the test in hot, humid, muggy city summer weather &amp; it held up pretty nicely. I also used it on a beach day while being sweaty &amp; exposed to the sun all day &amp; it didnt give out As far as the 48 hour protection claim, umMmm, i didnt test that out, lol. I shower daily &amp; re-deodorize everytime i finish a shower.#gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> Great protection.wonderful smell.hasn&#x27;t been defeated yet!</li>
    <li> i have been using secret deodorant for years now. and i was really excited when i got a chance to try out the secret outlast clear gel deodorant from Bzzagent &amp; Secret.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really amazing. it lasts all day long, has a long wear protection against odor and wetness. i use it only once a day and it lasts the entire day, even up till the next day. one thing i really like about this deodorant is that its a clear gel, so it leaves NO white marks whatsoever. this is a must have for every women, i would definitely recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> I got this for free to try from a product testing site. This is a great deodorant that really last.  The smell is strong, which is good and bad, but it REALLY last.  48 hour protection is super convenient and it s great for anyone on the go.</li>
    <li> Secret is my favorite brand of deodorant/antiperspirant so when I had the opportunity to try the gel variety, I jumped all over it. Because the gel variety leaves no white marks behind, I tried really hard to like it, but unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t say for certain whether the odor protection lasts a full 48 hours since I shower daily, however, I can say that on a normal day, I felt protected. I do not like the wet feeling of the gel when applying and I&#x27;m not a fan of waiting for the gel to dry. When it comes to no white marks, the gel is awesome! As a brand in general, I do love Secret but I just do not like the gel. I am definitely an Invisible Solid kind of girl. The gel certainly does live up to the statement &amp;#34;Goes on clear, stays on clear&amp;#34; which was the one thing that I really did like. I received a sample of this product free thanks to Secret.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I do like that it goes on and dries fast but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s up to participate with the powder as far as odor protection.  I usually use the outlast powder and I can still smell it (no Bo smell) the next morning but with this gel I smelt kinda funky around 3 or 4.  I don&#x27;t really do much I&#x27;m a stay at home mom.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it I really am but I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing the gel. I did test this product for free from BzzAgent my opinion is totally my own</li>
    <li> I recieved this deodorant fro BzzAgent and I absolutely loved everything about it! I usually tend to buy solid deodorant but in the future  am sure I will be buying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. I did not get any white marks on any of my clothes when using this deodorant, it was very long lasting and I did not need to reapply at all during the day like I usually have to do with solid deodorant and it dried quickly. All in all I am very satisfied with this product and I will definitely be buying this product in the near future.</li>
    <li> This is my go to deodorant, especially during these long hot summer days. It holds true to its claim of preventing wetness and providing long lasting odor protection. I sweat quite easily and I love knowing that with this product, I can feel confident knowing that my body odor and wetness is under control. The scent of the deodorant is pleasant and not overwhelming. It does not leave white marks on my clothing and it does not irritate my sometimes sensitive skin. I can not recommend this product enough, thank you to Secret for letting me try this product for free!</li>
    <li> I have a 9-month-old baby, and since giving birth, nothing has been the same!&lt;br /&gt;Among other things, my body odor has been different. Once summer came, my old deodorant didn&#x27;t do the trick anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Just in time--I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel thanks to Secret and BzzAgent. I was happy it arrived before I could try the expensive pharmacy deodorant that my doctor wanted me to try!&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about the gel; I didn&#x27;t want to feel wet or gooey after applying, but it dries very quickly. The added bonus is not having to worry about white streaks. I seem to always be getting dressed in a hurry now that I&#x27;m a mom, and it&#x27;s nice to not have the white streaks to deal with!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so relieved, though, that I don&#x27;t have to feel self-conscious about my body odor. The heat index was 106 today! I feel like I sweat a little less now, and when I do, the only odor is a pleasant one. The gel has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t too soapy or flowery. It smells just like it feels-fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this free from Bzzagent. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve never lied gel deodorants because they are wet and no one wants wet underarms. I tried this anyway and it really does dry really quick. It doesn&#x27;t smell like much and that is good because you want it to prevent smells, which it also does great. It helps keep me dry and confident. The one thing I do not like is that it comes out really quick. I often have to apply it carefully and one click will cover both underarms. Other than that Iove it!</li>
    <li> I have always been put off by gel deodorants. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the wet feeling, or that the odor protection didn&#x27;t seem to last long at all. When I received the BzzCampaign invite, I was a little hesitant to accept but figured it was worth a shot. I am soooooo glad I accepted! I have been using this clear GEL deodorant for a few weeks (in Texas Summer heat) and I&#x27;m happy to report there has not been any uncomfortable wet feeling, no white marks on those cute sleeveless tops, &amp; it lasts all day!! I also appreciate the Completely Clean fresh scent. Thank you Secret &amp; BzzAgent for allowing me to try this for free, and I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I tried this trial package of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free as a BzzAgent about 3 times and it seemed to work really well. I liked the clean, light and fresh scent of the &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; scent and it kept my armpits smelling fresh all day and even into the next day. I also really like how comfortably it applies to my skin, no sliminess, just smooth and soft and instantly dry with no white marks. The only problem I had was I think it gave me an allergic reaction. I put it on one morning and went about doing my morning routine at home and I noticed my hands started itching and getting small hives on them. I rinsed off the deodorant right away and the itching seemed to go away quickly thereafter. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like that before to anything so it was definitely strange. I won&#x27;t be trying it again in case it would get worse the next time. But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m a rare case and otherwise it really worked well at keeping me feeling and smelling fresh, dry and clean for over a day.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from Bzzagent. Its not a good product at all. My armpits started wet because it&#x27;s a gel and they never dried (even when I let it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; by keeping my arms up for 5, 10 and 15 min) I sweat through every shirt I wore while using Secret Outlast. It didn&#x27;t get me any longer than 2 hours of protection. I would never reccomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am trying this product as part of BzzAgent and received the item for free. I generally use gel deodorant so I am liking this Secret Outlast gel, which is different than the regular Secret gel I generally use. I am moving this summer and I have found that the Outlast deodorant is able to hold up for a long amount of time of sweating and cooling down (over and over). The Clean Scent is pleasant and I have found no white stains on my clothing, which is always a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving this item 5 stars, because the 48 hour odor protection is not true. I have found it lasts about 1 day before I have to reapply.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a BzzAgent and I love it.  It gives me long lasting protection and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirts.</li>
    <li> I liked the way this deodorant felt when I put it on. It lasted all day when I wore it. I had no white marks left on my shirt and it looked like I never put any on. When I purchase this deodorant again I will check to see if it comes in any other scents. The only thing that I did not like about this product, I did not like the way it smelled. I am sensitive to different smells and would have liked to have a different scent. I would recommend that you try this brand of deodorant the next time that you go to purchase it, it works very well for a long day of sweating!</li>
    <li> Ok. So I&#x27;ve never been really particular about buying a particular brand of deodorant.  I just need it to work. However, this stuff surpasses all expectations! It truly lasts 48 hours.  I&#x27;ve gone a full day which included a work out in addition to 2 days sometimes and this stuff holds up very well. There&#x27;s no irritation or itchy/clamminess at anytime after its been applied.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The Secret Outlast Clear Gel is nice and cooling for the summer but dries clear right away. The scent is great and it not to overpowering. I did not think I would be a fan but I fell in love with this product and will purchase it when my free sample from Secret runs out.</li>
    <li> I had never been a gel deodorant user. I was given a free sample of Secret Outlast Gel by BzzAgent to review. While I am still not sold on giving up my spray, I really did feel comfortable using this gel. It went on clear and dried pretty quickly. It stood up to mowing in 90 degree weather and well, that&#x27;s the true test!  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This deodorant outlasted all others. I received it free from Bzzagent and thanks to Secret. I was really excited to try it. It really did last all day which is great because I work outside in the sun for hours at a time. The only thing I am not sure about is that I prefer more organic and recognizable ingredients. I will admit that when I&#x27;m out working there is nothing better. The scent is pretty nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks just like it claims.</li>
    <li> Initially i was very impressed with the secret outlast deodprant i recieved free to try from bzzagent. I had worked very hard in a high heat environment for 3 days and had no wetness or odor. However, after using it for a few weeks now, the inital impression has faded. Im guessi ng that it worked so well in the beginning beecause of the long lasting effect of my clinical deodorant that i have been using for years Lingering underneath. I not have nearly no odor protection and i feel as though i didnt put deodorant on at all. On the upside, still no white marks.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this for free from Secret and by being a member of BzzAgent.  Prior to trying the sample I had last tried a gel deodorant about 18 years ago and hated it.  This sample has completely changed my view.  Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant is simply fantastic.  It goes on clear, dries quickly, had a great scent, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothes, and keeps me dry all day long.  I am a stay at home mom who chases after toddlers all day and I don&#x27;t have any time to wait for deodorant to dry to get dressed.  I can get dressed, put this on, and it&#x27;s dry within minutes.  This is definitely worth trying out! Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> White marks....oh the dreaded white marks!!  They are every woman&#x27;s worst nightmare when getting dressed in a dress or dark colored shirt.  It is so embarrassing.  But I don&#x27;t have to deal with that nightmare anymore!  Secret Outlast Xtend Clear Gel Deodorant takes away that worry.  It goes on clear and stays clear.  And I have tried so many other deodorants, just to have to reapply it half way through my day, because the wetness was coming through or the odor protection was wearing off.  But with Secret Outlast, it worked for at least 24 hours without every having to reapply.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents that are available.  I have finally found a deodorant that works and I can trust. I was given a free sample via BzzAgent to try and this is my truthful opinion based on my experience only.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the free sample I received, that the 48 hour odor and wetness protection actually works! Here in Tennessee, the heat and humidity can be unbearable at times, causing you to be sweaty from just walking outside, but the Secret Outlast Clear Gel provides the protection needed even on the hottest days, without needing to reapply! It leaves smelling fresh and clean all day to power through even the hottest days!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant through BzzAgent and was not sure how I would feel about it when I realized it was a gel. But I gave it a fair shot and used the entire sample. The scent was nice and it literally lasted all day. I still prefer a clear solid to the gel, but other than that, I have nothing but good things to say about this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product out for free thanks to Secret! I felt super happy with the results. I am a busy mom of two wonderful children living in Southeast Texas. It&#x27;s the dead of summer and it gets terribly HOT and Secret was really there for me and kept me protected all day and night. I also never worried that anyone might see it because it went on clear and stayed clear. The scent was ok but I really prefer actual scents not just the standard deodorant scent. All around though, I love it and it&#x27;s a very efficient antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Got to try Secret Outlast from BzzAgent for free. I used Degree for years but decided to try Outlast since we were having so many 100 degrees days here in NC. I can say that I LOVE it and have made the switch. I used the whole sample BzzAgent sent me and have already purchased more. Keeps me dry and no white marks on my clothes!!!!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of Secret Outlast free as a BzzAgent... I am not a big fan of the wetness of the gel, it does seem to take a while to dry. It also comes out really fast when you twist it up. It does work well as a deodorant and smells great!! I also like that the gel doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark shirts.</li>
    <li> I love this gel deodorant! I have had a hard time finding a feminine deodorant that actually worked and did not end up smelling like cat food after using it for a day. The Florida heat is brutal, and finally finding something that gives me wetness and odor protection is pretty great. A big thanks to BzzAgent for the free sample to try out!</li>
    <li> Before using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, I had never tried a gel deodorant, because I was worried about it being too wet and feeling weird on my skin.  I am now in love with this gel.  I got it from BzzAgent for testing purposes, and I really like it.  It goes on well and dries fast.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on clothing.  I used it while hiking in the Rocky Mountains last week and never felt like I smelled or needed to reapply it.  I plan to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Got to try for free via bzzagent I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the product, not a lot of deodorants work for me, kept me smelling fresh all day long!!</li>
    <li> I received a free trial size from BzzAgent. I was only able to wear the product once due to the overwhelming scent. All I could smell all day was the strongly perfumed &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent. I had a headache from my own armpits. I believe the antiperspirant qualities of this product were acceptable, no better and no worse than my current antiperspirant/deodorant (Dry Idea). If you are sensitive to smell, I would steer clear of this product.</li>
    <li> I am not typically a Secret user, but received a sample from a promotion that the brand was running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a devotee of &amp;#34;the other brand&amp;#34; since I was sixteen years old.  Some twenty years later, I have become a changed woman.  I sweat.  I sweat lots.  And while my &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; always did the job, it left white stains on all of my bras and dark colored shirts. I accepted this and never thought that life could be different.  Until I tried Secret Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it last through my work both in and out of the home, chasing a four year old and husband (who in all reality can be worse than a four year old), but it continues to work throughout my gym time.  The best part for me is that it has an amazing clean scent that is only noticeable to me.  To say I am a convert is an understatement.  I have thrown a full stick of &amp;#34;the other brand&amp;#34; in the trash.  From here on out, I am a Secret woman!</li>
    <li> I received a bzz campaign for Secret Outlast clear gel, I  tried it for a week and I loved it. I&#x27;m going to make the switch, it smells so clean and fresh! #gotitfree #bzzcampaign</li>
    <li> I got this product from bzzagent to try out sample and give you a review about how I felt with this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;Secret has always been one of my favorite deodorants. I love that this clear deodorant dries fast and doesn&#x27;t stains shirts. Specially the white ones. No marks no nothing. Not waiting a long time for it to try. I smell good all day. I&#x27;m clean and dry. Fresh smell and lasts a day. I am constantly on the move with my children with this secret outlast clear deodorant I don&#x27;t worry about smelling bad. Check it out and give it a try. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks bzzagent and secret for this sample to try #gotitfree #bzzagent #secretoutlast</li>
    <li> WAY to hard to get product out of it!  If you have any issues with hand strength, buy something else.  Had to throw half of it away as I could not turn the dial any more.</li>
    <li> During this hot Cali summer, the Secret Outlast deodorant really helped me stay dry and fresh for a long time. After running around with my kids all summer, I wasn&#x27;t worried because I used my Secret Outlast deodorant. I ‪#‎GotItFree‬ from @BzzAgent but I will definitely be purchasing it again. My husband and sons wanted it because I kept bragging about how fresh and dry I was. I definitelly did what it said it would do, especially on the multiple 100+ degree days.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like gel and the feeling it leaves on my underarms feeling et so when I was given the chance through Bzzagent to try out Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free from the brand I was skeptic.  It my pleasant surprise it actually works.  You still have that first feeling of wetness when applying the gel but it dries very quickly.  I only needed to apply a little amount to get the coverage I needed.  It dried in less then a minute and did not feel like I was wearing anything.  As to the 48 hour protection I am a bit nervous going a full 48 hours without reapplying but I have gone about 30 without any concerns of body odor.  It is a little more expensive then I prefer to pay for deodorant but if it lasts 48 hours you would be using a lot less so it balances out.</li>
    <li> I have always despised gel deodorant. I felt like it kept my armpits feeling moist all day and I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was sweating or it was just my deodorant.  When Buzzfeed, sent this product, I thought it would be a complete waste of time. I braced myself for a nasty day of gooey armpits.  I did choose to wear black that day, so that I could at least experience the benefit of no white streaks (something I usually just carefully try to avoid with my solid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I was very pleasantly surprised by this gel. It never felt wet or oozy, even when I first put it on. It smells clean and amazing all day, without being over powering or extremely noticeable.  It left no stains, as expected. Plus, it worked so well! I am pregnant and I do home health in Texas. During the hottest August days, I was able to go into homes with no A/C and no worries about looking sweaty and unprofessional. I was acutely disappointed when I realized that I was out of this deodorant and either needed to switch back to my old brand or go to the store. Let&#x27;s just say, that I was buying a new Secret Outlast that very afternoon!</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I have used. NO white marks, lasts longer than any other brand, CLEARLY works better. I received it as a sample from Secret to try out. I have already made the switch.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! No sticky residue, nice subtle scent, and good packaging. I&#x27;m a fan for sure!!! Got it free from BzzAgent as a promo by Secret!!!</li>
    <li> Secret outlast has wetness protection and 48 hour odor protection. I have to say it does go on clear and was help with the odor. But I felt that I still had wet armpits after using it. Still like it though just not sure I would use it all the time. I did get this product free to review it.</li>
    <li> I received as a sample to provide my honest opinion. This deodorant is amazing. It goes on so smooth and dries fast. It does not have an overpowering smell and it does not feel sticky. And I have much more confidence that I will be able to go about my activities without fearing about body odor.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free as part of a BzzAgents campaign. I usually use the Secret brand invisible solid antiperspirant deodorant. So I trust them, and I know their products work. But I didn&#x27;t like the invisible gel. In the words of friend, who also tried it, it feels quite &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; going on, and it takes ages to dry once applied. God forbid you&#x27;re already hot, or in a humid bathroom whilst applying; it will never dry. I only used my sample a handful of times, because it&#x27;s so inconvenient to have to wait for it to dry  (which the packaging doesn&#x27;t suggest or indicate but I quickly figured out after marking up my clothes with dark spots, requiring me to change my clothes first-thing in the morning.) My advice: skip the slow-drying gel and stick to the invisible solid.) Two stars given because it did work well after it finally dried.</li>
    <li> I love secret outlast. It stays clear, doesn&#x27;t leave residue and stains in clothes, lasts all day, smells great, not too overpowering. #gotitfree #bzzagent #sample</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast thanks to Secret and BzzAgent for an HONEST review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I put this delicately? I sweat. A lot. And I smell. Pretty badly honestly. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of gel deodorants. They&#x27;re sticky, cold to apply (especially during the winter in ski country where I live), and usually don&#x27;t protect me near as well as my usual brand. I&#x27;ve found one deodorant, a solid with promises of not leaving white marks (not always true), that combats my horrible smelliness so I was very, very skeptical when I received Secret Outlast. A gel that&#x27;s supposed to protect me for 48 hours and designed with fast-drying ingredients to evaporate in seconds??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package and found I had received the &#x27;Completely Clean&#x27; scent. The scent is a little like rain in a flower garden. Definitely not a baby powder scent and a little odd but also oddly likable. I definitely had no problem wearing it! Applying it was simple - a quick up and down up and down, it went on smoothly with a dry feel ... but then immediately turned really wet. My pits were super slippery and I had to hold my arm up for a minute in fear of messing my shirt. Once I put my arm down it was standard gel ... sticky, slippery, and cold. Even after another minute or two I could still feel my pits sticking together when I moved. I&#x27;d say it probably took about 3-5 minutes for the really weird combination of tacky and slippery to dry and go away - and I did NOT use that much. The scent stayed even after drying, actually seeming to get more powerful as it dried. Again, nothing bad to say about the scent at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT once the deodorant dried and the tackiness went away I didn&#x27;t even notice I was wearing deodorant, let alone gel or solid. I found no white marks on my clothes. Even when I actively tried to leave white marks to test the product I got none! It left me protected all day with the scent hanging around lightly. However, I didn&#x27;t do any largely strenuous work so I&#x27;m not sure how this would do under the full force of my sweaty stench. I also applied daily (even with the promise of 48 hour protection) because I may be blonde but I am far from dumb enough to trust a claim like that with how smelly I can get on a hot or busy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was only half impressed. I liked the scent and I&#x27;m sure the other scents offered in this product would be just as nice to try ... but it&#x27;s a gel. It comes with all the ups and downs of a normal gel deodorant. If you love gel deodorants this is definitely one to try. If you&#x27;re looking to switch to a gel I say try this one. But if you&#x27;re like me, and not a huge fan of gels ... better just to stick with your solid deodorants.work so I&#x27;m not sure how this would do under the full force of my sweaty stench.

    <li> I was able to try this deodorant for free thanks to Secret through Bzz Agent and while I feel generally pretty positive about using it, it&#x27;s not the most amazing one I&#x27;ve ever tried. It does live up to its claims of being clean and does not leave white marks on your clothing, which is great. However, in terms of controlling odor and wetness its about average. I think this had a very powdery smell, and when I did begin to sweat I think the smell was actually a little overwhelming and unpleasant. I don&#x27;t sweat particularly heavily, but I don&#x27;t think that this kept me anywhere near as dry as the Secret Clinical Strength (which I&#x27;ve also tried). I think there are other deodorants that work equally well that I prefer the scent/feel of more, so I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this in the future. However, if you&#x27;re worried about white marks and need an everyday deodorant, this is still a nice option.</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought I would be writing a 5 star review of this deodorant. I&#x27;m a serial deodorant user, following one failure up with another, no product seemingly able to withstand the rigors of my life, chasing three young sons around, and running in my spare time. I liked the thought of a product that potentially could last two days. TWO DAYS! I didn&#x27;t think myself likely to wait that long to reapply, but I liked the promise.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product out in sample size, via a campaign from BzzAgent. This trial sample arrived during a trying week, the week that my mother-in-law passed away, and I am thankful to say that it worked very well at the outset, offering both perspiration and odor protection much longer than my typical deodorants. I felt comfortable giving hugs all day, organizing, running errands, and staying up late into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I went right out and bought a full size stick, in the same scent, as soon as my sample ran out. That is something that I never do, so it says something!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my experience with this second stick has not been as good. I don&#x27;t know if there was a difference between batches, or my body has become somehow adjusted to the product, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well for either odor or perspiration. I would say it is on par with most other sticks that I&#x27;ve tried, and no longer feels like a standout. I&#x27;m bummed. I really thought I had found a long-standing winner for my medicine cabinet, but I&#x27;m going to keep looking.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the 48-hour odor and wetness protection from one deodorant (made specificall for women)!  I feel confident when I wear the deodorant because I don&#x27;t have to do smell or wet checks :)  The only issue I have (and it is really small) is that when I roll the gel up to come out of the many holes, the gel is uneven because of the curved top and takes a little longer to dry than I would like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent, and I got the chance to try Secret Outlast Gel deodorant for FREE thanks to Secret! I&#x27;ll start off with this, I really thought before I tried it that it would just be gross! Well, I was wrong! It&#x27;s so easy and great to use.  When you first use it, the gel dries way faster than I expected. AND NO WHITE MARKS!!! And let me tell you, It really does last all day and night! I have fibromyalgia and endometriosis, so I have frequent hot flashes and night sweats that cause me to sweat throughout the day, and using secret outlast gel definitely helped me out so much. I didn&#x27;t sweat nearly as much as I usually do! I will surely recommend this deodorant to my family and friends and buy it in the future!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant so much. It is definitely my new favorite! I was having issues with smell after 12 hours, but with Secret Outlast, I am stink free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample in order to try this product to write a review. The thoughts are my own and not influenced by the free product.</li>
    <li> I tried many deodorants in the past, and I have to say that Secret Outlast Clear Gel that I got for free from Bzzagent works out great for me. It offers odor protection for long period of time, it gives me confident and freshness throught out the day. It does smells good and so just perfect. I been using the product for 3 weeks now and so far I&#x27;m loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to my family and friends. I</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant from Secret for being a BuzzAgent.  Let me tell you this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I went to a 3day convention with over 3,000 people and this definitely stood up to the test.  If I had any worries I must say having smelly pits wasn&#x27;t one of them.  I loved the way it smelled and it really kept me dry.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> amazing protection and lasts long too no white marks and not sticky loved when I got this bzz campaign from bzzagent and secret #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I have used gel deodorant before but I always have a problem with white marks. This secret outlast gel works great plus I am always looking for one that the smell will last all day. Being summer time I sweat and and I need to be cover full day.. this deodorant did the job well being outside with the kids on a sunny day I felt fresh and dry and enjoyed my day. Thank you Secret for the opportunity  to try this product I will keep on buying it.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this product. Is like my new baby. I feel very fresh and clean like I never felt. This deodorant is designed with fast-drying ingredients to evaporate in seconds, while rub-off resistant coverage lets you stop worrying. I received the deodorant for free thanks to the Secret Company.</li>
    <li> I was recently set the secret out less clear gel deodorant from buzz agent to try out.I tried the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant in Completely Clean before my workout and I am very impressed. It did not leave any white marks and dried instantly. The Completely Clean scent is nice since it is not overpowering. Definitely going to add this to my everyday routine. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.” #epic48 #gotitfree #loveit</li>
    <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and I am trying this product out for Free thanks to Secret. This product has me sold! I have tried many different brands of deodorant and also one from the Secret brand, but this new product is a staple. I have all always loved the clear gel deodorants over the white solid, but the long lasting odor and wetness protection is fabulous. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks being left on my clothing from the deodorant is just a sure protection all the way around. This product gives you the peace of mind that you are odor, sweat, and white mark free at all times. Wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way!</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Outlast® Clear Gel that I recived free from Secret through BuzzAgent. I can honestly say that I love this stuff! It goes on wet but dries fast. It&#x27;s not moist or sticky at all. It smells great and last longer than other deodorants that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from BzzAgent, and I am in love with this deoderant!  I normally don&#x27;t buy gel deoderant, but this dries really fast and smells amazing!  It definitely offers the 48 hours of protection, and makes me not super sweaty during my workouts!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the secret outlast clear gel I got for free through bzzagent. My excitement was however short lived. The deodorant went on gooey and sticky which I didn&#x27;t like. A bigger problem however was how often I had to reapply. I don&#x27;t sweat anymore than the average person and I live in upstate new york so the climate isn&#x27;t warm. I&#x27;d say more like 4 hour protection.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. #gotitfree #bzzagent goes on clear and work as promised. My on the go must have when I&#x27;m wearing black.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant for free courtesy of Secret, and really liked how it performed. It really does protect you all day, and is especially perfect for the hot summer months. Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant goes on clear, eliminating potential white marks from ending up on your clothes. You also feel clean and dry while wearing Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant. It&#x27;s perfect for long days at the beach, being outdoors or just being active throughout the day. I would definitely recommend Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant to anyone who wants a fresh smelling, lightweight deodorant that actually performs.</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant for free from BzzAgent to try and review. All the information will be unbiased and my true opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the deodorant was great, it lasted all day and it made me smell clean even through exercise. I like that it&#x27;s clear and I can wear dark clothes without any worries!&lt;br /&gt;With every awesome, they&#x27;re usually is a but, my dislike of this product is the scent, which does dissipate and I do like it at the end of the day, but for the first 30 min all I can smell is the deodorant on me! I would suggest going with unscented if you&#x27;re as sensitive to scent as I am.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great long lasting solution for many, so don&#x27;t hesitate to get it!</li>
    <li> I love the Secret Outlast Clear Gel! I have always been a fan of the Secret Brand but the clear gel is amazing...it never leave a white residue on my clothes. I noticethat it definitely lasts all day so i never have to reapply it. It is my new go to deodorant thanks to Bzzagent and Secret for letting me try it free.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled to find a deodorant that works. I have always been a heavy sweater and never found anything other then doctor prescribed deodorant to help until I tried the secret outlast. It is safe to say this is my new go to deodorant. After i lost my insurance i couldnt afford to go to the doctor to get some prescribed. This works just as well. I stay dry and there is no odor which is great. I finally found somthing that will help keep me dry and clean. I recieved a product sample and tried it and since then for months now I continue to buy only Secret Outlast.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. I got it free to try thru bzzagent and it&#x27;s great! It does everything it says it does. Wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like gel deodorant, but this Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel deodorant  is not bad at all! It lasted all day and I didn&#x27;t feel sweaty or gross with it like I have with other clear gel deodorant&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried. It dried pretty quickly after I applied it and I felt fresh all day. I received a sample free from BzzAgent for review, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I think Secret Outlast Clear Gel is a great new deodorant.  It works all day and keeps me dry and the best part is that it really does not leave any white marks.  Great product.  I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free as a promotion from Secret. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like it. I was used to solids, and my previous experience with Secret was the powdery-scented classic solid deodorant. Not bad, but not something I would wear. The Completely Clean gel was great! I loved trying something new, and I noticed the gel works just as well as any solid I have tried and goes on clear and smooth. The scent is so much nicer than a sweet baby powder smell. Slightly sweet without being overpowering and a bit energizing at the same time, and it had staying power for me in hot, hot southern US summer heat! I am definitely interested in trying some of the other scents now.</li>
    <li> As my first time trying out the Secret brand as a promotion from the brand, where I received it for free. Let alone the C&lt;br /&gt;completely clean clear gel deodorant... I was not sure what to expect. However, to my liking I actually like this product. It does goes on clear with a lovely scent. With a toddler, this deodorant is great when running around none stop, especially in the summer months. The only minor issue if that&#x27;s what you want to call it, that after a fresh shave, it will sting a bit. Nothing serious. Other than that, I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical of this deodorant at first, because I usually wear the solid version, not gel. It takes some getting used to, putting a wet deodorant on, but it dries quickly and the best part? NO white residue left on my clothing! I&#x27;d purchase it again, but I&#x27;d choose an unscented version because that&#x27;s my particular preference, not to smell any scents.</li>
    <li> As a bzzagent I was provided with a free sample of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel from the company to try. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to sign up for the campaign because Secret is already my go to brand (though I typically prefer to use the Clinical Strength solid). I was a little wary of the protection from a gel deodorant.  In the past, only the clinical strength has seemed to be any protection against sweat stains. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a different between the protection of this gel and the clinical strength solid I use on a daily basis. The one drawback to the gel is that it&#x27;s noticeably colder when applying, but an upside is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting those pesky white marks on your shirt... you all know what I&#x27;m talking about!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free as part of a review Promo.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I sometimes dislike using my body as a guinea  pig, I was excited to give this product a review.  I live in the south - where it is EXTREMELY humid during the summer months.  Because of this, it is hard to find an Antiperspirant/Deodorant that can be applied without the with marks AND prevent sweat marks - and keep you smelling fresh and clean without continuous application through out the day.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Secret Outlast Completely clean.  The product went on smoothly and dried quickly.  I did not feel so self conscious about body/sweat odor.  On my initial use, I did however feel that I had to keep checking to make sure the product was working - out of nervous habit and because the scent is not over powering or very noticeable after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only rating it 4 stars - and here is why - after using my sample (it was a small travel size, only lasting a week) - I purchased a full size because I really like the product.  However, upon realizing the cost for the product, I was disappointed.  Having a good deodorant/antiperspirant is very important to me - however - the overall cost is important too.  And I feel that the gel product is easy to waste while dispensing the product.</li>
    <li> ( First of, I must disclose that I got a sample of this product for free though bzzagent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is decent-to-good gel deodorant. While it certainly didn&#x27;t provide 48 hour protection for me,  it&#x27;s been a hot summer here in NYC, so 48-hours is asking a lot. It doesn&#x27;t hold up to my usual (Certain-Dri), but it&#x27;s also only half the price. . Not at all a bad product, and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. The gel goes on well, and it provides protection throughout the day. I did like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothing. And the scent is pleasant and not over-powering.</li>
    <li> I got this free as part of a promotion from Secret. I like that it has a fresh scent, nothing too over powering but smells nice. I like that there were no white marks on my clothes. So far I love this deodorant, it&#x27;s almost gone lol.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get to try this for free through BzzAgent. I have loved it since day one when I tried it. It does exactly what it says.  There were no white marks and it went on clear.  I would apply after I got out of shower and it would last all day and night. I live in Florida and it can get very hot. The protection was very good. I have two small children to run after during the day and I never felt that I need to reapply it during the day or before I would go out in the evening. Other brands I have used in the past does not comapare to this one. I would defiantly recommend this to my friends. It is definatly worth a try. Thank you BzzAgent for giving me the oppertunity to try this product. This has become a staple in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant! I got this free from BzzAgent and its totally awesome! It dries fast and has a great lasting scent with long lasting protection! Living in Hawaii you need a good deodorant with the constant humidity and this stands up to the sweat and heat with out leaving any streaks or spots on my shirts! I would defiantly purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I just tried Secret Outlast thanks to BzzAgent who sent me one to try for free. I have tried it for several days now and it does keep you dry and odor free. The scent is pleasant but I do prefer a lighter scent. It did go on a little wet and slightly sticky but dried within  a half hour and no white marks. I stayed dry all day long through errands and working out. I usually use Dove Clinical which kept me dry but left those embarrassing white marks on my clothes. I would recommend trying Secret Outlast because it does get the job done and no white marks!</li>
    <li> Want to have a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on your dark clothing? This is the antiperspirant for you! There is a different scents to choose from and they do smell great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells good &amp; not strong over-powering scents&lt;br /&gt;  No white marks on your dark clothes&lt;br /&gt;  Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Only 1!!! I am not a fan of the \\&quot;cold wet\\&quot; feeling when I put it on. It does dry quickly, but that is just eww at first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.**</li>
    <li> I Received Secret Outlast for free from Buzzagent and I have to say it did not disappoint.  It goes on clear and keeps me dry all day long.  I work in healthcare so I can not afford to be sweaty and smelly and this deodorant did the trick.  All day dry is what I need and Secret Outlast did that for me!!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast as a free trial test from bzzagent. However, all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this deoderant a few times, and still was unfortunately, not impressed. I sweat quite a bit, probably more than most and need something strong to combat the sweat and smell. This smells fantastic going on and lasts a couple hours, maybe a full work day, but the idea it should last for 48 hours is completely unfounded. Sorry Secret. I&#x27;m still not sold.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try out for free and this product offers 48 hours of odor protection which is different than other deodorants in the market. Also it&#x27;s good that the gel doesnt leave marks on the clothes and you can feel confident that you wont have those annoying white marks on the clothes. The deodorant is so good that you still feel fresh after a work out session.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I got a free sample through BzzAgent to try this product.  The product is easy to apply, two simple clicks and just enough gel is advanced for application.  It glides on easily and is easy to make sure that I have full coverage.  But...there it is, wet on under your arm.  I found myself standing with my arms up like chicken wings, flapping them around hoping that it would dry before my shirt wicked it all up.  Once it was dry, it seemed to work really well at providing good protection from odor and wetness.  I was glad that the clear gel didn&#x27;t leave a white mark on my shirt, but I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the wetness of the product at application - after all, I apply it to stay dry and it makes me wet.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast via bzz agent. I&#x27;ll admit I was somewhat skeptical. However, My daughters, whom are active in dance and cheerleading, LOVE IT!  They both agree it keeps them drier and cleaner then any other deodorant. Personally, I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re less stinky after a sporting event!</li>
    <li> I use secret, but this is better. I got it as a free trial through bzzagent and I really like the feel of this product and the smell is not offensive. I especially like the clearness. I use a secret solid that is supposed to go on clear, but it still will get on my clothes sometimes. I sweat, a lot and I usually don&#x27;t smell bad, but by the end of the day, I can tell my old deodorant is wearing off. This kept me dry and fresh smelling all day and into the next. I will definitely be switching to this clear gel.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to participate in the BzzAgent Campaign for this deodorant and received a free sample to try. My opinion is solely based on my own experience. I have always used a solid, I never liked the cold alcohol feel of a liquid gel. This was no different, however, the difference in this versus other gels I have used in the past is the fact that it dried fast and clear. I was able to pull on my shirt almost immediately without an embarrassing white marks. I can&#x27;t do that with my solid, I usually have to wait a while or put on my shirt first. The other thing I noticed was the smell, it was nice. Not overpowering and not too strong. I have always used Secret, it is a brand I have always trusted and I am glad to have another type of deodorant of theirs to add to my usual list.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! I sweat so much and this stuff keeps it in check. I found it was like the prescription stuff but didnt burn my armpits:)</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at this product, which is always a plus! Upon receiving it for free as part of a promotion from the brand, Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel proved to leave my clothes with zero white marks. And it dried quickly, which was my biggest hesitation to trying this product! Not only did I feel dry all day long (which, my days usually are 14 hours long!) but I even felt dry the next day when I woke up without a reapplication. I loved the clean scent too, because I am not a powder scent fan. Good product Secret, thanks for keeping me dry and protected!</li>
    <li> I tried this as part of the buzzagent campaign and for a gel it&#x27;s pretty good...I prefer solids because you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying and aren&#x27;t shockingly cold every time you apply, but I did like how this dried very quickly (a couple seconds) and had a pleasant but not overpowering scent. Also lives up to the hype of no wet spots, even on days I was rushing and didn&#x27;t wait for it up dry completely. Overall, if you like gels, it&#x27;s a good choice</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month now.  I got it free for being a bzzagent.  I have really like the way it feels.  It doesn&#x27;t feel slimy like other gels I&#x27;ve tried.  It is a little cool to the touch, so if you are using it on a cold morning and can be a shock.  I haven&#x27;t felt sweaty at all since I&#x27;ve been using it and I have in the past had really bad sweat.</li>
    <li> Decided to try Secret gel after getting it FREE from Bzz, and it works great, the smelt is good, not too strong and for sure, no white marks or stains! The (secret) is just to twist it up a very little at a time to use it... Took me a long time to figure it out but definitely worth it!! Love it.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I was sent a Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I was a little wary of it at first because I&#x27;ve never used a gel before. I usually use an invisible solid, and I&#x27;ve tried a roll-on, but never a gel. The gel was easy to open and easy to use. I just had to give it a couple of twists and enough gel came up for me to apply. I had just shaved so the gel did sting a little bit when I put it on, but that went away quickly. The gel is a little cool when you first apply it. It does have a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent. Amazingly, the gel held true to what it says and it did last all day long. I&#x27;m a substitute aid for a second grader, so I am very busy all day long. I am constantly up and down, following him wherever he goes around the classroom and outside, including for p.e., recess, and track. So, usually at the end of the day, my deodorant is gone. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel definitely worked, and I still smelled &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; at the end of the day. I&#x27;m sure my family appreciated that when we all arrived home. I was also happy that when I changed my clothes at the end of the day, there weren&#x27;t any white marks on my shirt. I would like to keep using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, although I would really like it if it came in a different scent, like powder fresh or shower fresh.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for over a month.  I rec&#x27;d the product from Bzz Agent and I immediately started using it.  I have to say.... I am finally happy.  I work outside a lot and it&#x27;s nothing to be out in 110 degrees and humidity.  I cannot believe how wonderful this is.  My teen daughter has officially stolen my backup and now I will need to make sure I buy them for her too.  The fact that it comes in different scents really makes a difference as I love the different options.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say, I do go through this probably 15% faster than I ever have other deodorant and it is more expensive that my previous options however just in quality alone I cannot complain at all.</li>
    <li> Stay fresh all day.  No white marks on my clothes.  No gooey, messy feeling.  These are some big claims that I have heard over and over again.  However, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Antiperspirant actually delivers.  I love this stuff.  I was lucky enough to get into the BZZ Campaign that allowed me to try it for free, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  This product truly does work all day long - keeps me dry but doesn&#x27;t give me that flowery fake deoderant smell either.  And white marks on the clothes -- well, those are now a thing of the past too.  How awesome is that?  I say Pretty Darn.....  Thanks Secret for making such a great product to serve us women well!</li>
    <li> I got to try this as part of a BuzzAgent campaign...#GotItFree Compared to other versions of Secret, this works just as well, but doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my black clothes barely at all! Considering most of my clothes are dark, this has been a long-time problem that I&#x27;m thankful to have finally found a solution for! Now if only they can make it last longer and keep it from drying out my skin so much (ITCHY!) it would be perfect...</li>
    <li> I was asked to review Secret Outlast after receiving as a promotion from BzzAgent and Secret. This product has its pro&#x27;s and cons. The pros did not leave white marks and it did keep me dry. The cons it goes on wet and takes some time to dry. If you are the type to just put on antiperspirant and get dressed quickly, this is not the product for you. Also compared to other antiperspirants on the market, you use this product a lot quicker. I am not sure why that is but I got a full size as a sample and it is almost gone after 3 weeks. I would not buy this product for those reasons.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel. Now that I have used it for several weeks, I can say that it is the best deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever used. This gel goes on clear, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing. It has a soft, clean scent that does not intensify or turn in warm or stressful conditions. And although I was skeptical at first, I really can apply once every 48 hours instead of daily and not worry about being unprotected. This product has worked better for me than a clinical strength product I have used in the past. Secret has always been my preferred brand and this product is now my number one choice for deodorant.</li>
    <li> First I have to say that I have never been a fan of the Secret brand.  However I was given, as a promotion by Secret, a full size sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean, so I tried it and was very impressed. It goes on clear, dries very quickly and seriously, it lives up to the hype....it lasts 48+ hours! I&#x27;m so happy that I decided to try this out! The only reason I gave it four, rather than five stars, is because of the smell. So when I go to the store to look at it I&#x27;ll check for different scents. If they have those they have my business and five stars!</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorants. In the past I have bought them and then used them for a day or two and then thrown them away. I love this product! It does not sting after I shave. It dries fast and it really is all day protection. I cannot confirm whether or not it is 48 hour protection because I shower every day. This particular product has a light scent that is not over powering or obnoxious. I would buy this product over the standard white deodorants but this is the only gel deodorant that I would every buy. I did not purchase this product, it was given to me as a gift to try and give my honest opinion via BZZAGENT.com but I would not give 5 stars if I did not LOVE the product.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free via BzzAgent in exchange for an honest review on the product.  I have been using Outlast for three weeks now and am impressed.  For reference, I live on a tropical island with high heat and humidity year-round.  I also formerly used Secret Clinical Strength because I sweat a LOT (even before living near the equator), borderline hyperhydrosis.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to switch deodorant because Clinical Strength works pretty well for me; however, I&#x27;ve found my new deodorant.    I participate in judo-based self-defense classes and am normally completely soaked in sweat afterwards, as the gym is outdoors.  Since using Outlast, I actually have an area under each armpit that is either dry or considerably less sweat-soaked!  I also love that this deodorant does not have the slimy feel that Clinical Strength does.    To sum it up: Outlast works very well in hot/humid environments for the heavy sweating individual, with a pleasant smell and a bargain price (as listed on Amazon) to top it off.  My only complaint is that it does leave a residue on your underarms that you have to wash multiple times with soap to remove; additionally, it leaves a build-up residue on the underarm of tight fitting shirts.  The latter is something that happens with Clinical Strength as well, so I&#x27;ve been in the habit of spraying stain remover on the armpits before washing, regardless of whether or not I think there is build up.    EDIT: After using this for nearly two months, I have to say it&#x27;s definitely not as good as it was initially.  Maybe my body is adjusting to it?  Compared with my previous deodorant, Secret Clinical Strength, this does not perform.  As I&#x27;m typing, I have sweat marks under each arm and I have the air conditioning on.  The other thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t actually deodorize as well as it did in the beginning.  After using Clinical Strength for five years without any strange adjustment issues like this, I&#x27;ll be switching back to Clinical Strength and saying goodbye to Outlast.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!! I was giving the opportunity through BzzAgent to test out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deordorant for free, with the understanding that I&#x27;d give my opinion of the product. I love the fact that it gives 48 hr protection, and that the gel is clear! The deodorant glides on so smoothly without leaving white marks on my clothing, nor does it leave a caked on feeling. It keeps me staying fresh with just one click and two swipes which is amazing! I have since purchased more of this product because it works! It does exactly what it states it&#x27;s supposed too! Very happy and happy to leave this positive review! #BzzAgent #SecretOutlast</li>
    <li> I received a full-size sample of this product from BzzAgent to review. I am a long-time Secret deodorant user since it seems to be the only one that can keep me dry and odor-free.  This one however, didn&#x27;t seem to measure up to the invisible solid that I typically use.  I like the smell and the feel of it, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- gel, dries clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue&lt;br /&gt;- scent is clean and fresh, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;- won&#x27;t rub off on clothing and doesn&#x27;t tend to leave &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34; in white tshirts&lt;br /&gt;- affordable vs. prescription or prescription strength&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not as long lasting as a solid.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t immediately dry&lt;br /&gt;- not super easy to control how much comes out. One click is not enough, two clicks is too many&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t travel well, especially if it gets too hot it can &amp;#34;ooze&amp;#34; out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all is said and done I will probably use this for times when I am in something sleeveless and don&#x27;t want white marks, but not as my every day deodorant.</li>
    <li> A Secret you shouldn&#x27;t keep to yourself . I have wanted to try Secret outlast gel for awhile so I was excited when I had the opportunity to test it out for free. Secret outlast gel dries fast and provides amazing coverage . I never have to worry about armpit odor . Unlike other deodorants Secret outlast gel doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty white marks on clothing .</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. When you put it on, it&#x27;s not like other gels that sting and burn.  It goes on like a solid but leaves no white marks.  I received this as a free sample from Secret, and I was truly skeptical.  All other gels I&#x27;ve tried before have never lasted and in just a few hours, I&#x27;m smelling, sweating, and itching.  However, this deodorant &amp;#34;outlasted&amp;#34; them all.  The first time I tried it, I had been outside all day in the Texas heat: gardening, being at the pool, and chasing after my vibrant 1 &amp; 4 year olds.  At the end of the day, I did not stink!  The Secret Completely Clean scent was all I smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my showers at night, and since my husband was home at that time, I wanted to give it a try in front of him.  My hubby is NOT a big fan of clear gel deodorants.  He actually cannot even wear them. I put some on his bicep close to his armpit just in case he had an allergic reaction to the gel (bc he usually does to ALL gel deodorants): NO REACTION!!!  This is the first gel deodorant EVER!  I&#x27;m hoping they make a Gillette like this (a gel that goes on like a solid).  That is his one complaint about the solids he HAS to wear: the solids get caught up in his armpit hair.  Anyway, I made him smell it. He loved the scent, and he couldn&#x27;t believe it went on like a solid but was clear. No white marks on his favorite &amp;#34;Batgirl&amp;#34; nightgown I wear.  He was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is from seeing the price of the deodorant.  Of course I received this free sample which is AWESOME!  Now, I&#x27;m addicted to it, but I cannot afford $7 deodorant.  I was definitely hooked until I came onto Amazon and saw that.  I hope Secret reduces the price soon.  The smoothness and 48hr freshness is awesome, but at a $7 pricepoint, this mom on a budget cannot afford.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to review for free from Secret and BzzAgent. I was a little unsure at first, because I usually steer clear of gel-type deodorants. They usually make me feel more wet than dry! When I got this deodorant in the mail, the first thing I noticed is the pleasant smell. This deodorant smells fantastic! For me, the smell of my deodorant is one of the deciding factors. I want it to smell good! I tried this deodrant out one day last week. I have to say, it is amazing! I felt dry and comfortable all day! It was hot here in NC, about 95. I was working all day, babysitting 6 kids and cleaning! Secret Outlast kept me fresh and dry all day! Best part is, I still smelled clean when I woke up the next morning! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used lots of gel deodorant before with not so good results so when the campaign came up on buzzAgent  I was skeptical but thought what the hey I&#x27;ll give it a try! Got my FREE sample and used it today and went fishing with my kids. Wore a black tank top just for the test and no white marks or sticky armpits after applying! Still no oder either!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really dislike the scent but as far as wetness protection i had almost half the perspiration i normally have after a workout! clear gel product so you dont get those pesky white marks on your clothes.</li>
    <li> Secret has always been my choice of deodorant, but I got to try outlast for free. It is my new favorite. All day protection, great scent, clear gel with no white marks. Great product.</li>
    <li> The Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant comes in a nice, clear plastic container. Its nice to have a see through deodorant stick so that you know how much more you have left and when your running low  you can go pick some up before you run out! However with that being said you also need to make sure your costumer likes what they see. This is where I ran into my biggest problem. When I first got it the bottom layer of the inside stick was below the secret logo.  However for my first use of the deodorant I had to twist it all the way up above the secret logo to get any of the gel out. If you take a look at the photo attached you will see exactly what I mean. Where did all that gel go? Did secret try and rip us off of almost half of the deodorant stick? Or did it all evaporate in the shipping process? My guess is the second theory. I think the gel evaporates, and if that&#x27;s the case how long is it going to last? Maybe secret needs to find a new air tight way to distribute the deodorant. But all that aside the deodorant works really well! It keeps you smelling nice and keeps the sweet down. I normally use stick deodorant this is my first time trying gel and I just might be coveted! For one you don&#x27;t get and white streaks and two it feels so much softer and natural on your skin. One thing I found that you need to be careful about is not to use to much because it will take to long to dry. Only use 1-2 clicks. The smell is not too strong or week, just the right amount in my opinion. At first it smelt a like flowers mixed with a little of hairspray. I wasn&#x27;t sold on it but the more I wear it the more I really like it.  I really like the deodorant I just hope they can figure out the disappearing gel issue. I don&#x27;t want to spend my money on something that will just evaporate into this air. (good thing I got this one for free for the propose of my review)</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from BzzAgent as a promotion for the brand. I&#x27;ve always preferred clear gel deodorants over solid deodorants, but I was starting to lose hope that I could find one effective enough for my busy lifestyle. When I first tried Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant, I was immediately impressed with how quickly it dried and the complete absence of white marks on my clothing. I&#x27;ve always been paranoid about getting ready in the morning and then discovering that I had to change due to white marks left by my deodorant. I no longer have to worry because this deodorant has proved that it goes on and stays completely clear. As far as long lasting, this deodorant is unmatched (in my opinion). Since having a baby, it seems as though my body sweats more and I was getting discouraged that my previous deodorant wasn&#x27;t cutting it. The day that I first tried Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant, I was pleasantly surprised that I could go through the day without worrying about sweat stains while at work. Even after my workday, this deodorant continued to provide protection. This was particularly impressive as the days of summer are nothing short of hot. I would highly recommend this product. In fact, I received a sample size of the deodorant and decided to purchase a full size right away. All of the claims are true as advertised. This is a great deodorant that is long lasting!</li>
    <li> #lifehack #momhack this is a great de orang to outlast your day. No matter what kind of mom you are!! First time using the clear gel provides 48 hours of odorless protection. #bzzagent #babysamplesize #secrets @secretdeodorant @bzzagent</li>
    <li> Thanks To Secret  I Got to try this for free , Its the best ,. I smell good and Its keeps me dry for 48 hours ,! Im just so Happy I got to try this because every time I get any other Deodorant it gives my shirt unwanted stain marks , and no girl wants that .I can only say this is the go to product from the summer Secret is a great brand that delivers what hey promise .</li>
    <li> When i decided to participate this BzzAgent company i didn&#x27;t really realized what it will be.I never used such type of a  deodorant as Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant.I mean,usually i use solid deodorant and was expecting same thing, just with gel covering.Wrong.Its different.&lt;br /&gt;It took couple days for me to get used to the thought to use it.You now, when you like and sure in something,(like i had my old deodorant) you don&#x27;t want to have bad surprise-like with bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;So  finally,for a not long and not far trip, i did it.Its easy to apply. Feeling cooling.Skin was dry fast.I tried with fingers-they were dry and clean-no marks,no grease (better than solid one). After my trip, under strong sun and awful humidity,my underarms were dry and clothe was clean.So I satisfied with quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing what i didn&#x27;t like is,when you apply it and turning a wheel, you don&#x27;t now when it is enough.Gel inside of a tube is not staying even and coming out more at one side and may not come at all at another side.I guess after some time you can manage that, but before you have to use it for a while and try to find the best for yourself.And,i think  bottle will be empty much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Still,its a good choice, the feelings of your skin much better,more fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I was invited to try this new deodorant by secret from BzzAgent and secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been a deodorant solid user and I will continue to be after trying this out today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I will comment on is the fact that the deodorant never dried.  In fact, it was pretty sticky feeling.  Not a good feeling when you live in Las Vegas and the temps are over 100 in the summer time.  Even after a shower and scrubbing my underarms, they still feel tacky. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also not something I am a fan of.  It&#x27;s a very weird, sweet smell.  I would have preferred unscented or power scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also made my underarms itchy.. Itching your underarms when you have deodorant on is not very effective, especially one that doesn&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the free sample but I won&#x27;t be buying this.  I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of this product!</li>
    <li> I got to try this deodorant for FREE thanks to Secret, and BzzAgent. I was a little weary to try this, as I have done the clear gel deodorant thing before, and regretted it. I hated putting slippery, gooey gel under my arms after I had taken a nice relaxing shower to get myself clean. I could tell this was not going to be the case with Secret Outlast. There is a typical &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; gel that squirts out of the top, but as soon as you apply it to your underarms, it dries almost immediately. No more standing in front of a fan with my arms in the air, or fanning my underarms wildly with my hand waiting for them to try! I put this deodorant to the ultimate test: walking around at a swap meet on a hot day. I can say that it did well for the most part. I did have a little bit of the slippery feeling. I was also bothered at the smell of the product. The smell was a little overwhelming for me. My biggest frustration with deodorant is the smell. I hate being reminded all day that I am wearing something to cover up my odor. I don&#x27;t know if it was this particular scent, but for most of the day, I kept doing the &amp;#34;smell test&amp;#34;, trying to figure out if it was me or the deodorant. I know not everybody likes the same smells, and not every smell works for every body, but I don&#x27;t think it worked for me. I did enjoy how the product worked (i.e. super quick drying time and ease of application). I only took stars away due to the smell of the product, which caused me to question if it really was working.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Clear Gel via mail through BzzAgent. I really love this product. It leaves no white residue on your body/clothes and you literally never feel like you need to &amp;#34;reapply&amp;#34; your deodorant during the day even on the days I&#x27;ve been super active. This is definitely a product I will be purchasing in the future. I personally prefer a deodorant with a milder sent or unscented but the scent does smells good. In the future I will purchase the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version just because of personal preference.</li>
    <li> I got to try this free thanks to Secret and BuzzAgent. I was not expecting much as I have used Secret products in the past. I am a Crossfitter and I sweat a lot during workouts. I tend to smell pretty bad afterwards and I am usually drenched in sweat. Throughout the day I reapply my deodorant as I tend to start to smell. I used this product for about a week so far and I have yet to reapply during the day. I put it on before my workouts and I have yet to smell during my workout. Best of all, my armpits are not drenched in sweat by the end of the workout. It is a little sticky initially when I put it on, but the product smell is almost non-existent and the stickiness goes away as soon as the product dries a few moments later. That is really the only thing I can complain about, it seems to take a little longer than comfortable to dry.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this through BzzAgent and I wasn&#x27;t too excited about trying a deodorant. It seemed boring and the thought of applying a gel to my armpits seems....unappealing. Now even though I did get this free, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it. It does take some getting used to if you use a regular solid deodorant, at first I despised the cold/wet feeling that comes with a gel but now that I&#x27;ve used my sample I love it and I doubt I&#x27;ll go back to a solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very hot and humid here in Indiana. (Especially in a home where we try to limit our air conditioning usage.) With the Secret Outlast I don&#x27;t feel like I smell bad and that everyone is looking at me. I also work somewhere where I need to wear a uniform and with my busy schedule and two kids I would forget the proper &amp;#34;order&amp;#34; of dressing and deodorant application. I would have the awful white marks that never seemed to go away even with furious scrubbing. Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry what order I&#x27;ve gotten ready in. Definitely a keeper for me and the scent is amazing as well. Clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> After receiving Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from a BzzCampaigns to try. I immediately threw the deodorant in my gym bag.  I usually work out on my lunch break, so after showering I need to reapply my deodorant.  I have to say I was pretty happy with the Secret Outlast Completely Clear Clear Gel, as I was expecting a gooey cold weird feeling when I went to put it on, but it went on smoothly and easily and didn&#x27;t feel weird.  It dried faster than what I was expecting as well, and of course since this is a clear gel, there were zero white marks.  Overall, I am quite pleased and may actually move on from my clear solid I was currently using to this Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> I was invited to participate in a Bzzagent Campaign on Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant and Deodorant,  thanks to the generosity of the Secret brand.  I was excited to try this new product,  as I&#x27;m very familiar with the Secret brand and I used it the very day that my Bzz kit arrived.  I was walking around, doing my normal activities and kept getting a whiff of something that smelled really good.  It took me a while to realize that it was actually me that smelled so good!  So,  I definitely like the smell of the Secret Outlast Clear Gel and was happy that it lasted the full 24 hours that it promised!  The only real downside that I experienced is that it didn&#x27;t dry as quickly as I would have liked.  My armpits felt sticky and moist for about 30 minutes or so after applying the product.  Once it dried though,  it did a great job at controlling odor and keeping me dry and I also like the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my clothes,  particularly since I have a lot of black in my wardrobe.  I think that I prefer some of the Secret solids to this gel,  but I&#x27;d encourage you to give it a try for yourself,  especially if you happen to prefer gels to solids.</li>
    <li> I  was asked to try this product  for Secret. They sent me a sample in the mail and I think this product is right on the money. I had to apply extra of this product to feel protected during these hot summer days.  It smells great!! Yes, it really does go on clear, and dries super quick! I wore this to a long hot day and I felt dry and fresh long after I made it home. #BuzzAgent</li>
    <li> Had I not received a free sample of this deodorant, I probably would not have tried it.  The clear gels that I have used in the past left me sticky, stinky, and flaky.  After trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, my mind has been changed.  The gel goes on smooth and dries fast, no stickiness.  The light scent is very pleasant, and the formula does not flake off.  The thing that really impressed me was how well the antiperspirant performed in the miserably hot  weather we have had lately.  We have been under a heat advisory, so sleeveless has been a given when it comes to tops.  My clothes remained free of both white marks and wetness even in the 100+ degree heat.  This is a great product and will change your opinion of clear gel antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> I was given this product by bzzagent.com to test and review. All my opinions are honest and are my own.  Honestly I was skeptical at first. I&#x27;ve tried so many products which promise to cut underarm odor for extended periods and promise to keep your clothes from getting deoderant marks. Secret Outlast is a gel stick deoderant which dries nearly instantaneously. The fragrance is quite pleasant and it honestly lasts the entire day. The maiden voyage for my sampling was on a very hot and muggy 89 degree day. I put it on at 7 am and by 4pm I DID NOT SMELL LIKE SWEAT. I approve.</li>
    <li> I really like the Secret. It was a nice change from the normal solid.  It had great smell and keeps you dry!  It was nice to put on a dark colored shirt and not have white marks.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like wasn&#x27;t instant dry, where your armpits felt gooey until it absorbed in half way through the day.  I did like how the great sent didn&#x27;t fade and kept you fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Wow, the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel came right in time. It really is clear and smells so good. I am not sure about the 48-hour odor and wetness protection but it does help at least 24-hours. Definitely NO white marks and is perfect when you wear something dark, so you don&#x27;t see no white marks. It sure keeps you fresh so if you are very active - this is the deodorant to go with!   #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m very impressed that a gel deoderant could work so well!  I love that there&#x27;s no stickiness. Thanks Secret and Bzz Agent for the opportunity to try this product!</li>
    <li> When I got invited to the BzzAgent campaign I was a little hesitant because I had never tried a gel deodorant before, I&#x27;m typically an invisible solid kinda gal.  But I figured I would give it a try, its summertime and HOT here, and since we spend a lot of time outdoors I need something to give me great protection.  I will say that I love the scent, it is one of my favorites.  This deodorant is also long lasting, even in 90 degree weather and being outside for a good 10 hours or more.  I sat outside for hours in 90 degree heat and I didn&#x27;t feel sweaty or smell like i had been sweating, it was great not having to worry about if people thought I was stinky.  The only thing I am just not fond of is the gel.  It had a very wet feeling when I applied it and it stayed wet for a few minutes.  The first time I used it, I immediately put my shirt on, which got wet and I had wet sticky spots on me for awhile.  I would still recommend that anyone who is looking for long lasting protection from sweat and smells should try this out for themselves.  I was given this product for free to review.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free as part of a BzzAgent Campaign to try and review.  I actually wasn&#x27;t in the market for a new deodorant as I&#x27;ve found Secret Clinical Strength, which I&#x27;ve been using for several years now, to work really well for me but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  And after using it for about week now, I have to say I&#x27;m really impressed with how well it works.  This past weekend, I spent a lot of time outside in the heat and humidity with my 2 young boys running after them and sweating quite a bit.  I was really impressed that at the end of each day I was still smelling as fresh and clean as I did that morning when I applied the deodorant.  I&#x27;ve had lots of trouble in the past with deodorants not keeping up with my active lifestyle and leaving me smelling no so fresh by the end of the day.  That&#x27;s definitely not the case with this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus to this deodorant is that it leaves no white marks on my clothes. I&#x27;ve worn several black or dark colored shirts this past week in order to test this and I was very happy to see that none were left with any white smears under the arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have is the fact that this is gel.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of how it feels going on, especially when it&#x27;s cold.  This deodorant is no different with that aspect but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me and something I could learn to live with for keeping me smelling fresh all day long.  I definitely intend to buy Secret Outlast Clear Gel again!</li>
    <li> The secret outlast clear gel is the best deodorant I have tried. It works for the long haul. The completely clean scent is refreshing. I received this as a free sample thanks to secret through bzzagent and I love it!  I will definitely buy this as my deodorant in the future and maybe try some other scents. I love that the clear gel stays clear when applied. Got it free! Bzzagent</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of secret outlast clear gel from bzzagent and I was very surprised at how it worked and great full that it kept me dry and odor free for 48hrs. Plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about any arm pit stains all summer long. I have 3 kids and we are out side all day in this summer sun and being able to stay dry helps when I go from chasing the kids out side to the store for groceries.</li>
    <li> First off, I got to try this free because I am a BzzAgent.  That definitely did have an effect on my opinion. I was REALLY impressed by the ability of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant&#x27;s ability to stick with me through a really tough workout. I washed off my usual deodorant and applied some of my freebie right before heading to the gym. I usually reapply my usual deodorant before the gym and still free disgusting when I leave, but this deodorant toughed it out. The scent is light but not overwhelming, which is important to me when at the gym. Nothing is worse than being overwhelmed by any smell when you are doing cardio. I was also pleased that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about chunks of white paste peeking out from my underarms while doing arm exercises as well.  If you are a gym junkie, this is definitely a product you will want to look into!</li>
    <li> First off, thank you for the free sample size deodorant. I received it from Secret via Bzz Agent. Ok I will start by saying that it does keep me dry and there is no body odor. However, the scent of the deodorant itself is so strong that it gave me an instant headache. I am used to the powder fresh scent, so this one, I am not even sure what scent it is... is way too much for me. If you don&#x27;t mind really strong almost floral scents, then this will be perfect for you. The other thing I don&#x27;t care for is the actual &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; part of it. It feels slimy and gross going on. I prefer the solid stick. This is just my opinion though and I still love the Secret brand. I just think I will stick to my usual powder fresh solid.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of the Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  Yes true, there were no white marks.  But i felt like my armpits were wet for forever after i put it on.  Didn&#x27;t feel as good as the normal stick deodorant Secret makes.  I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for free from Bzzagent to test.</li>
    <li> I am a fan! The ONLY thing that I do not like is that its a gel, so you have to deal with that icky wet feeling for a little bit. I was able to try this product for free! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Secret, I was able to try a sample bottle of Completely Clean Scent Secret Outlast. This product is amazing! It does not leave annoying white marks, gross arm pit stains and it smells great! It lasts well into the 48 hours, even through a hot humid Georgia summer.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use gel deodorants because they take so long to dry and I don&#x27;t like my armpits feeling wet.  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is quick drying and long lasting.  I feel and smell great all day.  I think I found a new favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a sample to try out for the purpose of my review.</li>
    <li> In the past when I used the gel variety all I could remember was how wet and sticky I felt when I put it on!  I was very skeptical to try another gel deodorant when I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  I have to say that this is the best gel deodorant that I have ever used!  I did not feel sticky after applying and it actually dried super fast.  I am also notorious for the white marks on clothes but I have been using it for right at a week now and haven&#x27;t had a problem with white marks at all!  That in itself is a great reason to buy!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I will use! It works great for my sensitive skin and does everything you want it to. I would definitely recommend it! After trying several other deodorants this is by far the best for sensitive skin. Best of all: I got it free from Secret as a BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try a truly white-mark free deodorant, especially one from a company like Secret--the brand I already trust for antiperspirant. I was very curious about the product and jumped at the chance to for a free trial from Secret through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I was very disappointed: The clear gel did not work for me at all. I knew that when I first applied it, it would feel wet for a bit. I expected it to dry and I&#x27;d feel dry. Rather, I went from a wet feeling when I first applied to just kinda sticky-tacky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, I realized that the scent was going to be off-putting. After I applied it, it was utterly overpowering, chemically, and manly--I was unable to wear any of my normal perfumes as the scent was so over-the-top strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did not keep me dry: I sweated right through it and ended up with that &amp;#34;I have body odor that I&#x27;m trying to mask by wearing too much perfume&amp;#34; smell. Unfortunately, it was a welcome relief to be sweating through the product, as the sweat washed away the sticky feeling...I just went back to feeling wet (so not really more comfortable than the sticky).</li>
    <li> I found the best gel deodorant to avoid getting deodorant marks on my clothes - Secret Outlast Clear Gel! I went out last night in my favorite red tank - without deodorant marks for the FIRST time! And Secret Outlast kept me stink free, even after FOUR hours on the dance floor. No more ruined tank tops for me. And the best part? I got it for FREE via buzz agent!</li>
    <li> I was sent this for free to review from BzzAgent, but all opinions are my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant has its pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s clear. Who wants white marks on their clothes?&lt;br /&gt;-it lasts. I went through some hot, sweaty, tough few days in the dead of summer this past weak, and my deodorant held up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;-strong scent. Now of course, scent is completely subjective. It is too strong and masculine for me.&lt;br /&gt;-it stung. Twice after I shaved my underarms, I applied this deodorant and it stung badly. I might&#x27;ve had a small cut because today it didn&#x27;t burn... But still, not somehing I want to be anxious about after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I rated it three stars. It held up, but the con&#x27;s would keep me from purchasing this particular kind again.</li>
    <li> I will honestly say that I&#x27;ve received this item 100% free but I&#x27;m going to give my honest opinion. The samale size is very convenient and can fit in your bag or purse easily. There are two things o don&#x27;t care for concerning gel deodorant.  For one thing, the gel generally takes forever to dry and once it does,  it can be rather sticky. Secret Outlast does not take long to dry, and once it does, you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there! The smell is great and was actually coming from the container before I opened it. I did notice; however, that one day I really put it to the test, I could detect some odor, but overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this recently thanks to a free sample I received.  This was my first time trying any gel deodorant and I&#x27;m glad I tried it!  I thought gel would be sticky or wet, but it dried quickly.  The fact that it&#x27;s clear is great, no white lines on my clothes!  I really liked the fresh clean scent and it&#x27;s been working well so far!</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple different gel deodorants in the past with no luck. I absolutely hated the wet and sticky feeling. I got this deodorant free from bzzagent and was not completely wanting to even try it. Glad i did i love this deodorant. I feel clean and fresh all day. I dont have to worry if i get a little on my clothing because no one will see it. I love that it is not powdery smelling. But most of all i dont feel wet. I will be buying this deodorant from now on.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Secret and Bzzagent.  I have been using about a week now and love it.  It works just as well as the clinical strength and a lot cheaper.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the white marks on your clothes either.  It&#x27;s a clear gel and love the scent too.  Nice a mild.  Will be changing to this product permanently.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel from Bzzagent about a week ago. The coverage is amazing and I am really impressed that even with the extreamly hot weather we&#x27;ve been having, I have not had to reapply at all. The smell is amazing and clean and its nice that I never have to worry about white marks on my shirt. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I have had issues with finding the best deodorant for awhile. In fact, the last one I tried made my underarms feel clammy and I ended up getting a gross fungus from it. Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to receive a free stick of Secret Outlast from BzzAgent, and I was really excited about it. I was hoping this stick would be the deodorant of my dreams--one that left me feeling clean, dry, and confident, without messing up my clothes or smelling overly perfumy. This did not disappoint. It is clear, so no ugly white marks and no buildup. It doesn&#x27;t feel gooey when you apply it--it goes right on and gets absorbed into the skin quickly. It leaves a fresh, clean scent that isn&#x27;t at all overbearing, and it keeps my underarms dry all day. I&#x27;ve found my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to BzzAgent and Secret.  The scent that I received was definitely not my favorite, but the deodorant seemed to do the job.  Enough so that I am willing to buy a different scent and give it a try.  I love how quickly it dries which is usually a deal breaker for a clear gel.  The best side effect that I have had is that all of the annoying bumps and red marks and razor burn under my arms has disappeared.  Goodbye ugly pits and hello beautiful skin!!</li>
    <li> I recieved Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free and totally loved it! It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all and it lasts all day which is important since I am a mom of 4. #epic48 #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I am usually not a big fan of gel deodorants but Iiked this type. It did not feel as &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; upon application and it really did work well at keeping the wetness and the odor away. I can&#x27;t say anything about the guarantee that it will work for 48 hours because I am a reapply your deodorant after a shower kind of girl. Also, it smells very pleasant. I did get to try this product for free as well, but that did not affect my review in any way.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent women&#x27;s deodorant as a brand promotion, and am already a fan.  The scent is fresh and clean, but not overpowering, and lasts the entire day - even in July.  The antiperspirant aspect is also phenomenal - the rest of my body will be sweating buckets, but my underarms will be dry and comfortable.  My only negative is that the deodorant is dispensed as a clear gel, which feels slimy for 10-20 seconds after application.  Otherwise - great product.</li>
    <li> Received this product through Bzzagent and absolutely a great win!! It smells sooo good and provides an effective long term results. The best part is not to see the ugly marks or stains on the cloths! It already took over the one I have been using it for many years! Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> First, I love the secret brand. Their clinical protection has been my go to deodorant for years. I was hesitant about trying this product, as I&#x27;ve never really liked gel deodorants, but I&#x27;m glad I did! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now. It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue. However, I will say, I find that secret&#x27;s clinical strength is a little more potent. If it&#x27;s a really hot day, I do find that I sweat more with outlast vs. clinical strength. However, this deodorant goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a funky residue, and gets the job done! I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Secret!</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually received this in the Active Fresh scent, but can&#x27;t find it on here. It has a truly airy and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent to it. It&#x27;s the perfect scent for these warmer months as it&#x27;s refreshing and energizing. This stuff lasts all day and I don&#x27;t worry about getting stinky half-way into the day. I will definitely be using it this summer!</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I was so impressed with the performance of this product. I applied it in the morning and I still felt dry and odor free the next day! The active fresh scent is light, yet feminine. If you are looking for a deodorant that will keep working, Secret Outlast Clear gel in active scent is your product!</li>
    <li> Love secret outlast! Goes on clear no resudue won&#x27;t wipe off and kept me fresh for 48 hours ( yes I tested it) love the smell too! Got it free from bzz agent.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Secret and im so impressed. No white marks, dries super fast and it keeps up with my busy mom life. Love this product. Defenetly a must.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Clear Gel will keep you smelling good all day long.  I do not have any white flaky mess when I use this product.  I would totally suggest you try this. It has 48-hour odor and wetness protection so I can feel fresh long time without repeated it every few hours. This summer belongs to me with this super strong Secret Clear Gel!!! Thanks to BzzAgent and Secret to give me a chance to try it before I buy it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the product from buzz agent to try and review. I really like this deodorant!! I like that it&#x27;s clear. I usually use a solid and it tends to leave stains on clothes, no an issue with the secrete outlast clear gel. This product works just as good as the clinical strength and smells great! Great for moms on the go!! #lifehack #secreteoutlastcleargel</li>
    <li> I just got this free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean and I love how it goes on clear and gives me a fresh all day feel on a hot summer day. it goes on without leaving white marks on my clothes giving me the confidence I need to get thru the day with no worries! Thanks a lot one happy girl here!!!</li>
    <li> OK so I got to try this for free (thanks Secret!) And I tried it today to see if all the hype was as accurate as many are claiming, like the no stains, and the lasts all day.. So I tried it out and used it right before my workout at the gym, I&#x27;m Italian so I&#x27;m normally a sweaty mess and smelling like a hoagie shop after a long workout! Well Secret Outlast clear gel definitely held up its end of the bargain! I was dry and smelling pretty good so I skipped the showers and ran a couple of errands and at the end of the day I was still smelling sweet☺ This Italian girl is a believer now!</li>
    <li> I got this free from secret and bzzagent. I&#x27;m a bad sweater I suffer from hyperhidrosis and I&#x27;ve tried everything but so far this is working! I&#x27;m also not a fan of gel but this dries and feels like a solid! It kept me dry through my autistic child&#x27;s meltdown!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a solid deodorant, so upon using this for the first time, I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of wet armpits. Ladies, the wet armpits are worth it. I was able to try this product free thanks to Secret and I&#x27;m so glad I was chosen to do this because I could not be more satisfied with this product. Once the deodorant dried, my armpits STAYED dry all day. On top of that, I didn&#x27;t have ANY white residue left on my black cami where with other deodorants I&#x27;ve used I&#x27;ve had white marks right up by my armpits. I have to say this is THE BEST deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t care for the price as I&#x27;m use to paying less, but for protection like this, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this product,free, as part of a bzzagent campaign. Since my 12 year old daughter is very active, and has had an issue with heavy sweating, and as such strong b.o., we decided that she would be a great person to actually try the product, and so far she loves it. Great scent and she says it helps her not sweat and smell better than other deodorants we have used. I have to agree, she smells less and seems to sweat less, from he pits anyway, lol, than before trying it. We will be buying the Secret Outlast for her from now on!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It kept me dry and refreshed all day!</li>
    <li> I am a single mother of one VERY active little girl. We are always on the go, and I need a deodorant that can keep up with us! I am generally more of a solid stick user, but have tried gels in the past (they didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations). I was a little hesitant to try this sample, but am incredibly glad that I did! The gel dried very quickly, I did not notice any residue on my shirts, and I LOVE the scent. I checked out retail pricing and found it to be about average compared to what I use now. This was a big bonus. I put my first day of sampling to the test with a trip to our local amusement park. I was actually surprised that I did not feel sweaty or smelly all day. I am very pleased thus far and I&#x27;m planning to try out more Secret Outlast once my current stick of deodorant runs out. I was able to sample this product thanks to Secret and BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Smells fresh and lasts all day ...especially in this humid summer heat! :) I will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Clear Gel via mail through BzzAgent. I was very hesitant about this product because I have tried clear gels in the past and they did not fair well.  This one went above and beyond my expectations.  I felt fresh and dry all day and it left NO white marks on my clothes.  This is an issue for me with almost all deodorants.  Not this one!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s talk about body odor... it&#x27;s not fun. I know. I may not be the stinkiest person but if I do not wear quality deodorant... you will know. I usually wear clinical strength so keep that in mind when reading my review. Here are my thoughts: Pros: -Dry all day (even after running after my active 2 year old and boot camp at the gym) -Non-smelly during everyday activities -Covers the basics well. Cons -Smelled a little funny after boot camp (although still rather dry). The scent of the deodorant and my sweat mixed was not pleasant. -I found out that I prefer solids instead of gels. I do not like the minute of wetness in my armpit when I apply it but that is just a personal preference. Overall, I would totally buy it again if it came in a solid for everyday use and use my clinical strength for going to the gym. #freeThankstoSecret #Bzzagent</li>
    <li> This product is great!..amazing smell..and no icky mess like other deodorants&lt;br /&gt;keeps you feeling fresh for so much more longer then the others also!</li>
    <li> Ive tried many deodorants before and by far this is my favorite. leaves no white marks and protects you for over 24 hours love it. i got a sample of this product to try out for free. Thanks secret.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as part of a bzz campaign for free, i absolutely fell in love with it and swear by it now. it keeps me dry and fresh, i am a sweater and living in south texas doesnt help, but this has been a saving grace. Love it!</li>
    <li> I got this To try for free from Bzzagent and I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect. I switch brands quite a bit, trying to find something that works consistently. And I wear a lot of dark colors and get so tired of deodorants promising no white marks and blah blah blah. I was also a bit nervous about the idea of gels. I have never been a fan of that gooey kind of feeling. But, with all that being said, I was really surprised with this deodorant. It really did dry super quick and works pretty much as promised. And my favorite part, no marks, that I have seen at least, on my clothing. The scent is pleasant, kind of like a fruity and floral blend, but, not too strong or overwhelming. Overall, very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approximately two weeks now and have replaced my previously deodorant of choice with it. I have noticed a significant decrease in white marks with this switch and have received compliments related to the new fragrance I exhibit. Overall, I have been impressed with secret outlast and would definitely purchase this product in the future!</li>
    <li> I received a trial sized Secret Outlast® Clear Gel product thanks to Secret, as part of a promotion from the brand through BzzAgent.  Secret claims it offers 48 hour odor and wetness protection.  I tried this product for a week and took it to the test, which you can see my results below in my full review.&lt;br /&gt;The Packaging :  The packaging is easy to open and has a cap to keep it closed when not in use.  Small enough to throw in a bag or purse, to carry it on the go.  Easy to twist to get the Clear Gel out of the container.  The Secret Outlast Clear Gel container has holes across the top that are evenly distributed when dispensed, so you can get an even swipe.  By time you twist it to get it started, it seems as though half the Clear Gel is missing.  To me, it&#x27;s a waste of packaging if it&#x27;s only filled half way.  If too much comes out, you can twist it the opposite direction and the Clear Gel that popped out of the holes will go right back in.  Which I like, so you use less and be less wasteful.  As long as you haven&#x27;t already swiped or smoothed them away, though.&lt;br /&gt;The Clear Gel :  Just like the product name, Clear Gel, it goes on clear and feels like gel.  Not sticky by any means, but more like aloe vera gel, smooth in texture.  I&#x27;ve tried this product for a week, while wearing different color and material of clothing.  I didn&#x27;t notice any streaks, marks or any residue left on my clothing while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The Scent :  It has a completely clean, fresh scent.  It&#x27;s not too strong or overbearing, but it is noticeable if you smell it out of the package or smell under your arms.&lt;br /&gt;The Test :  Yesterday I went to an amusement park with a water park on a 91F degree day. Before I left I applied the Secret Outlast Clear Gel under both of my armpits and didn&#x27;t reapply any throughout the day. I went swimming in the pool, down water slides and walked around the 180 acre theme park.  By the end of the day I was tired, sweaty and a hot mess.  After the long drive home, I was too tired to even think about taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;When I changed my clothes when I got home, I took a sniff of my arm pits and to my surprise, I could still smell that distinct, clean fresh scent from the Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  There was no odor what so ever.  I didn&#x27;t reapply any that night or the next morning.  The next day before I took a shower, I smelled my under arms again and there it was, that completely clean scent from the Secret Outlast Clear Gel product I applied the day before.&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed on how long it lasted, especially after sweating that whole day and going under water.  Though I didn&#x27;t take it on a full 48 hour test, that 24 hours sure felt like 48.  Maybe during the colder months I will come back and redo the 48 hour test and leave another review.  Or if Secret has another secret to keep the rest of my body feeling clean and smelling good for 48 straight hours?  Until then, I&#x27;m going to shower everyday! :)</li>
    <li> I tried a free sample of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant for the first time yesterday thanks to Secret. I put it on before my workout. It has a nice fragrance while wet but I honestly couldn&#x27;t smell it once it dried. It was a little sticky when wet but seemed to dry quickly and I couldn&#x27;t feel or see any residue. I participated in a workout class at my gym for an hour and I was sweating from everywhere but my armpits. It was the craziest feeling having to wipe sweat off my forehead and neck but not feeling it under my arms. With most deodorants I can smell its fragrance more when I start to sweat but not with this one! No smell, no moisture! I&#x27;m tempted to rub it all over my body because I hate the feeling of sweat. I absolutely love Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant and I recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like wet, smelly pits or residue under your arms and all over your clothes! This invisible, long-lasting sweat shield will protect you in the sweatiest conditions, so don&#x27;t sweat it, just trust Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant.</li>
    <li> I got to try this deodorant out for free from Bzzagent and Secret.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and I&#x27;ve gone back and forth on how I feel about it. Yes you don&#x27;t get the white marks on your clothes and it does smell good.  It works fairly well,  BUT it doesn&#x27;t last all day long. I find myself reapplying 2-3 times a day if it&#x27;s hot out, I exercise or even just chasing my kids around. Would I personally buy it? No.  I don&#x27;t really care for the gel, it has a wet feel to it for minutes after applying.</li>
    <li> When the BzzCampaign came along I was pretty skeptical, the memories of applying a cold goo to my armpits still fresh in my mind. But I gave the Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now. I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with it. It always gave me the level of protection from wetness and odor that I was looking for, without the white marks. I forgot how much better it was than the alternatives. So much so that I&#x27;ve decided a cold jolt to the pits in the AM was much more of a tolerable side effect than people moving away from me on the subway. Plus, i&#x27;ve done a little troubleshooting and I now give the stick a nice breath huff to warm it up. #GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I had an extra thing to pack for my vacation in the mountains last week (I got it free to test).  With my Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I was confident in staying dry and without odor in the heat of the summer.  It outlasted our ziplinning in the 95+ degree heat and walking the hot pavement down the strip each day.  It didn&#x27;t show up on my clothes either! That&#x27;s the best part.  I&#x27;m so tired of putting on clothes and then realizing my deodorant has made it&#x27;s mark all over my top. The smell is yummy too and I smelled it all day long so I know it was working.</li>
    <li> Simply the best by far love it keeps you dry through anything life can throw at you I got to try it free from Bzz agent and Secret i love getting to try things free before I buy and with bzz agent thats possible!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not normally much of a clear gel tyoe of person, only because when I think of gel I think of sticky. But, when it comes down to it, I simply love Secret Outlast and I&#x27;m so grateful I got the chance to #GetItFree thanks to Bzz. I love the smell and as a mom of 3, I love even more that this deodorant really does last all day long even in the blistering sun! Good Job!</li>
    <li> I think this deodorant is great because sometimes as a mom you don&#x27;t always have time to think about yourself. That means having to sacrifice yourself and you hygiene when life gets to busy. With Secret outlast 48 hour protection you will always be ready to go and smell fresh while you are doing it! Thanks for the free sample!</li>
    <li> I love Secret and was really excited to try this out, but it was a disappointment for me.  I got my free from BzzAgent.  I love the scent, but it didn&#x27;t live up to its&#x27;s claim of 48 hours.  I wouldn&#x27;t even say 24 hours.  It smells great going on.  Easy to apply,  I worked a full, busy day at my preschool, where we go outside a lot, and I felt really smelly by the end of the day.  I would not buy this gel.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my body&#x27;s chemistry, but Secret solids for me please.  I don&#x27;t like this product if it can&#x27;t last a half a day at work.</li>
    <li> I really like this secret outlast gel deodorant. I don&#x27;t normally don&#x27;t buy gel deodorants because of the way they feel. This one dried quickly and has a really nice strong scent..kinda masculine. Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent I got to try this for free.</li>
    <li> After receiving this product through a promotion from Secret, I was hesitant to give it a try. In the past, I&#x27;ve tried gel deodorants and they left me feeling wet and uncomfortable for hours. However, this Secrete Outlast deodorant dries quickly and left me feeling fresh and dry all day long. It lasts throughout the entire day and even through the 90 degree heat! I would recommend giving this product a try even if you have hated gel deodorants in the past.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic, never leaves streaks or white marks on my dark clothing items. I am definitely a fan, considering most of my clothing is dark! Also lasts all day for me too, so thats another plus! I got to try this out through bzzagent and did get it for free, but i have purchased it since then! Great product</li>
    <li> Hot &amp; humid outdoor wedding in the middle of summer, wearing a dark navy blue dress... needed a deodorant that would keep me smelling fresh with NO white marks. I was so happy to have my free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent! It was up to the task! Heat index of 100? No prob. 80% humidity? No prob. Navy blue dress? No prob. I am so impressed with the protection Outlast clear gel offered me -- no odor, no wet marks, no white marks! AND no sticky gel feeling! It dries so quickly, unlike other gels I have tried in the past. I highly recommend this deodorant!!</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of the Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant from BzzAgent and just got the opportunity to try this deodorant and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  I normally don&#x27;t like gel deodorants as they feel wet when applying and then sticky, but this one dried pretty quickly and worked pretty effectively for a clear gel.  There were no white marks from it, and I felt fresh and dry all day, even being outside on a stick summer night.  There was a fresh lavender scent that was pretty strong, but it was a pleasing scent so I didn&#x27;t mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when clicking the wheel to move the deodorant up, as you may get nothing on some clicks and then a whole lot on another!  Also, while the coverage from this deodorant lasted a good day, it didn&#x27;t quite stay effective for the second day and I definitely had to reapply to stay fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Secret and BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I had never tried gel deodorant because it didn&#x27;t seem like it would be as effective and I just thought it was kind of weird (I don&#x27;t know why)! But BzzAgent and Secret offered it to me to test for free and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it! I have tried every other deodorant and nothing works as well as this! I&#x27;ve officially switched over to gel now. It lasts a really long time and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue like the solid ones I&#x27;ve used and is way lighter! And works much better too!</li>
    <li> I got this product free via bzzagent. I hadn&#x27;t tried a gel deoderant since high scool and now I am 26 years old. I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the other deoderant I&#x27;ve been using for years actually! Normally after a day maybe 2 days I definitely need more deoderizement. But, with secret outlast? I can go 3 to 4 days! (I know your thinking ummm why would you go that long?) Sometimes it takes me up to 4 days to shower cuz I don&#x27;t even feel dirty or gross til about day 3 and I&#x27;ve had a baby for the first time so you know how that can be getting used to that new lifestyle of waking early and then crashing to bed early. Anyways! I&#x27;d totally recommend this deoderant! It also smells amaaaazing!</li>
    <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t think this deodorant would live up to what it clames im one of those people that when I find something I like I tend to stick to it and this just want my brand but i received this from Secret through buzzagent for free to try and it beyond surpassed any expectation I had for deodorant I can definitely say goodbye to white marks and it last a long long time and that&#x27;s saying something especially since we are currently under a heat wave with 108 degree weather and the A/C went out in the car and we have a lot of running around to do plus having 2 little kids to run around after I need something that can stand up to the challenge and this stuff was a miracle in a stick of deodorant just when I needed it I will definitely be switching to this brand from now on oh and it smells really good too but I would suggest not putting it on directly after shaving wait and hour if u can because when I put it on directly it stung just a bit it went a away after a few seconds but just a thought I would share</li>
    <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and they sent me a free sample of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel. These are my opinions. I live in the South and I work from home. It&#x27;s really hot where I live so I am always looking for a special deodorant that won&#x27;t sweat me. Dove didn&#x27;t do it for me as the scent is too strong and gave me a headache. I love using this clear gel. I have always been a fan of gel deodorant. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with wetness, I used to experience this when I was a teenager. I love the scent of this deodorant but the only con with it, is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me. I give it credit that it&#x27;s not overbearingly strong. There&#x27;s also no residue on my clothing and I can easily wash it off as well. I will recommend this gel deodorant as Secret is one of my favorite brands! As a warning, do not apply if you have sores or after shaving. It will sting! Thank you BzzAgent and Secret!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I was able to try this product through BzzAgent. I always struggle with staying dry and smelling fresh while running errands with my little one. The scent with this was absolutely perfect. It keep me smelling fresh all day without being overwhelming. It also kept me dry too. I dind&#x27;t have to worry about my deodorant getting all over her or the carrier I use during the day. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is really a great choice! I was lucky enough to try this deodorant for free through bzz agent.  It had a really great smell to it and it goes on super smooth and beyond invisible.  It&#x27;s almost like you aren&#x27;t even wearing any! There&#x27;s zero residue and no feeling of anything there! It makes you feel super comfortable.  Especially when sweating it out! I would definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of Secret Outlast deodorant for BzzAgent. Prior to receiving the sample I was already using a Secret clear gel deodorant so I was happy to try a new one. It works just as I would expect it to-keeps me dry &amp; smelling fresh, AND it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes! Happy I was asked to try this great product!</li>
    <li> I received a trial size of this brand and I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it. After using for a couple days I really liked it it kept me dry and it smelled good all day.</li>
    <li> I never been a fan of gel deodorants until i tried new Secret Outlast Clear Gel compliments of BuzzAgent. #GotItFree Now I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the best! It goes on super dry and keeps me even dryer. I smell clean and fresh all day and even better no white marks on my all black work shirt!</li>
    <li> Definitely not a favorite. I received this as a promotion from the brand to try.  While this deodorant stood up to high heat and humidity while working outside better than a lot that I have tried... It had a very alcohol-like smell, burns quite a bit if you recently showered or shaved, and leaves a somewhat &amp;#34; crusty&amp;#34; residue. It dried like magic shell!!!! I love the brand, but this particular one isn&#x27;t on my shopping list...</li>
    <li> I received a sample from BzzAgent and I love it! I don&#x27;t usually use this brand of deodorant but I just might switch to it. It goes on smooth, NO white marks, &amp; last all day!</li>
    <li> I tried the product for free thanks to Secret @ BzzAgent &amp; I Love the protection and leaves me feeling fresh &amp; clean without any residue on my clothing:))</li>
    <li> I get to try this sample for free thanks to secret!!! I absolutely love this product never leaves white marks &amp; absorbs instantly plus the smell is great not too over powering thanks bzz agent &amp; secret!!!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to bzzagent and secret brand. I really liked how the deodorant dried quick and lasted long protection wise. I&#x27;d definently recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deoderant! It goes on clear, dries in seconds, smells great and gives unbeatable protection! I got a free sample thanks to Secret and BzzAgent and have been using it for about a week now. Its by far the best deoderant I have ever tried and I am definitely switching for good!</li>
    <li> Prior to using Secret Outlast I had been using Ban and Secret Roll On deodorants, I loved that they were easy to use and left no residue but they just werent giving the protection and long lasting effect I wanted. After a few hours I felt like I needed to reapply. I was a bit skeptical about Secret Outlast having used other Secret products without being fully satisfied, but to my surprise it actually worked 10x better than I expected. I only need a little, it goes a long way trust me. And it dries very quickly, leaving no marks or stains. After even 6 hours I still smell fresh and have no need to reapply. I got to try this through BzzAgent thanks to Secret, but I will be purchasing once my sample is done.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from BzzAgent and Secret Deodorant. I was hesitant at first because it was a gel which im not a fan of. Ive never liked the gels because it made my armpits feel wet and squishy but this wasnt bad since it dried so quickly. The first day I used it i noticed it worked better than my usual one, I was dry all day instead of having wet and sweaty pits. I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> First let me say I&#x27;ve been using the same deodorant for over 10 years. I have very sensitive skin, so it was the only brand I could find to offer what I needed. Then Secret allowed me to try this product for free and I can say I just may be switching. It&#x27;s a clear gel that goes on a bit slimy feeling, but immediately dries. There&#x27;s no worries about residue as it&#x27;s clear and dries instantly. There is a strong scent, which smells good, but almost like a man&#x27;s musk. I don&#x27;t like it as it&#x27;s a bit too much for me, but it doesn&#x27;t stink, just too strong. I can get a good 5-6hrs of wear before I feel it&#x27;s worn off, but I think deodorant is a product you&#x27;ve got reapply at some point during the day anyways. If I can find another scent or even an unscented one, I will definitely be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel works really well. I love that it does not leave any marks on my clothes and lasts all day long. It is my new favorite deodorant! The only thing that I dislike about it is that the gel takes a while to ooze out but once it starts oozing it comes out fast and wastes a lot of gel. I received this as a sample to try but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> After only trying a gel a couple times in the past, I have always returned to a cheaper brand solid justifying to myself that they are all the same. I accepted white marks on my clothing as just a part of life. I received this sample through bzzagent and and happy I did.. Took a few times to get used to how many clicks to use to get enough out, but once on it was very nice to not have to look at my clothing after getting dressed and make sure the tell tale white marks were present. Second bonus, the smell is honestly my favorite of all that I have tried. Just simply clean and not overwhelming. Only set back for me was that since I shave my underarms daily, I suggest waiting a few before immediately putting on your deodorant, as I have discovered if you put it on right after on sensitive skin, it will sting. All in all, happy with the trial and will most definitely be a gel user from now on.</li>
    <li> So, as a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com and I&#x27;m so glad I did because my other deodorant just stopped working one day. I mean like out of the blue just didn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sitting at my desk and I smelled a weird odor. I immediately went looking for one of my kids only to have my oldest tell me *I* was the stink bandit! I&#x27;d been using the same deo for YEARS and I was totally embarrassed. Thinking it was a fluke, I went and purchased another stick of the same kind. A few days later - SAME THING - stink bandit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Secret sample came in the mail just in time. I tried it and no more stinky-mommy! It doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes and it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky, glue feeling behind after it dries. Yay me! And yay, Secret.</li>
    <li> My fav deodorant! Love it! Keeps you fresh</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have tried a gel and it was just not for me. The one thing I did like was the scent. I received the Active Fresh. Otherwise I didn&#x27;t care for how wet it felt going on and it also felt cold. It seemed to take a bit to soak in so I felt like I couldn&#x27;t let my shirt touch it. The scent didn&#x27;t seem to last long or help with me feeling like I smelled good for long. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. Opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Every day at my home is a madhouse. I wake up every morning and tend to my 3 young children and get ready for the day, barely having time to do any sort of pampering for myself before walking out the door to head to work. When I&#x27;m not running around like a chicken with my head cut off at home because of my beautiful little loves, I&#x27;m working in an environment that can be physically demanding at times and I NEED the protection of good deoderant. Upon recieving my sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant as part of a promotion, I decided to bide my time to try it the next morning, right before my work shift to put it through the test (I wear black scrubs so it was a PERFECT opprotunity to test how well the dryness factor would work).  Immediately after I put it on, it felt very wet, as in an uncomfortable yucky wet. I understand that given that the product is a gel that it is to be expected to a certain point, but it was an immediate turn off and if I lowered my arms, the wetness transferred to my clothes. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t a white mark, which I have had issues with in other stick products (black uniform, remember), but the wetness seemed to take FOREVER to dry on the cloth and sometimes it&#x27;s just not practical to keep my arms up or wave them around hoping it&#x27;ll dry quicker. As my day progressed, it continued to smell good, but it didn&#x27;t really do much about abating sweat, which in the heat and my black uniform, is going to happen regardless. To me this was a huge disappointment as that is what I primarily look for in a deoderant other than the smell, which I will say Secret has scored major points on how great it smells. Finishing up a regular day, even though I did still have a lot of sweating that no doubtedly wore some of the sent off, the majority stayed well enough to say that it completed its job. For myself, it&#x27;s not really a product that I myself would purchase, but if you have a less physically demanding job and don&#x27;t have to wear black uniforms or chase young children around, this may be the choice for you!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion through BzzAgent.  Works great.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.  Scent is very mild but pleasant.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any annoying white marks on clothing.  Best of all it lasts all day!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now for free thanks to Secret and BzzAgent. So far I am liking it. I usually use Platinum Protection and I feel like this works just as well. I just wish it maybe dried a little faster but it is worth it to not ruin my clothes :) It is time for me to go to this one full time!</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent trying the product for free... thanks to Secret.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin by saying I normally use lady speed stick shower fresh. Love the smell, lasts through the day. But the dare to wear black slogan is nonsense. It rubs off on underarms of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast doesn&#x27;t rub off. The gel dries fast, it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to cover the underarm either, maybe a click or two.&lt;br /&gt;The cons&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the completely clean scent, and this is where the &#x27;3 star&#x27; rating comes in. I could not stand the smell. I am not sure if it just meshed with my body wrong or what, but I tried to clean it off and put my old deodorant back on in less than an hour because I could not stand the smell of myself with it on. I smelled like I bathed in mens&#x27; cologne and body sweat. Just no. The old deodorant didn&#x27;t completely cover up the smell. I had to soap and water it off again and reapply old deodorant before I was even a little satisfied it was gone. So obviously I cannot vouch for the length of time that the deodorant works before it starts to wear off, I didn&#x27;t even last an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be willing to try other scents, though...because it definitely is clear on clothing and I would love to have a gel deodorant the is clear, doesn&#x27;t cake or feel itchy, and will last a long time like this one.</li>
    <li> I usually am a roll on girl. I don&#x27;t buy anything but roll on deodorant. But after getting a free sample from Secret I decided to go back to the brand I once trusted. It has been a good experience. The clean scent was perfect for me especially getting out of the shower. It lasted all day and did not get on my clothes. It is something I would consider purchasing again and tossing out my old roll on for this. Now that it is in a clear formula I am one happy girl.</li>
    <li> I recently tried Secret&amp;#34;s Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. It has been amazing! At first I was turned off by the wet/cool feel upon application, but the deodorant quickly dried. It left a wonderful fragrance that continued on throughout the entire day. It never left streak marks on any of my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared to Lady Speed Stick, Secret Outlast wins hands down. No competition. Speed Stick leaves streaks on my clothes, requires repeated application, and doesn&#x27;t mask the scent of sweaty armpits. Lovely :/ I am now a firm Secret Outlast consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I receive a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel through a BzzAgent campaign. The review expressed is all my own.</li>
    <li> I will never wear any other kind of deodorant after trying this one out. Not only does it keep me dry for up to 48 hours, but I no longer have to worry about white marks on my black shirts. since I wear black a lot, this is a plus for me. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin if I put it on after I shave. As a matter of fact, the cool gel actually feels good after shaving. I also love how it has a nice light scent to it, doesn&#x27;t get dry and flake off, and also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received sample as part of a campaign.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean thanks to BzzAgent and Secret, and all reviews of the product are my own. I brought my sample with me on vacation since I knew I would be out in the hot sun for a lot of the days, and I was impressed by the wetness and odor control. I felt fresh and clean all day, and I could really feel the deodorant working even on the hottest afternoons. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to reapply later in the day, and I could definitely tell my deodorant kept working beyond when I would expect my previous brand to quit. The only downside of this deodorant was that it went on very wet feeling. I felt like I needed to keep my arms up to let it dry, or it would smear all over. It didn&#x27;t leave streaks on any of my clothing, but I was concerned it was rubbing all over my arms farther down than my armpits. Overall I liked the deodorant from Secret, but not sure if I would purchase this exact version in the future because it goes on very wet feeling.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant from Secret. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it... I don&#x27;t know what it is with this stuff, but it goes on slimy, doesn&#x27;t dry quickly, and stays slimy throughout the day, with any minor sweating. It does smell nice though. That&#x27;s about the only thing I liked about it. Sticking with my solid deodorant for now. Sorry Secret, you missed the mark for me on this one.</li>
    <li> I get a sample for free for review this cute deodorant, and I can say cute because it was a tinny deodorant, clear, nice scent. I like the long lasting protection, finally I&#x27;ve found a good deodorant that take care on Me and my clothes, without leave that ugly white mark on my blouses. #GotItFree. thanks Secret Outlast</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try through bzzagent . I loved the scent and that it goes on clear. It definitely kept me dry and smelling good for the whole day. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Secret outlast clear gel deodorant because I am a bzz agent and I get products to review and give my feed back, back to the company. I received it free to review the product sample from Secret and bzzagent. I was excited to get it and I had to spread the word about what I was doing and why. But once I received the item I took it out of the box and it has a nice package and the scent is great. I though do not think that it is for me. I didn&#x27;t like how it felt sticky after I applied it. It left that sticky feeling all day. Then I also don&#x27;t feel that it held up to the protection that it was to do. I was telling my friends about it and they want to try it too. So I asked them what do you think? Some liked it and others did not. the scent was the winning thing about the deodorant overall. It has nice a nice appearance. Some of my pals liked that it did give them that protection and was fresh all day. But then there was me and a few others that thought it was sticky and left that sticky feeling and the unprotected feeling. I would recommend this to others just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t work for a few of my friends.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Secret Outlast in Completely Clean! It goes on nice and dries pretty quick. I don&#x27;t have to deal with deodorant marks which is awesome. The only downfall is after a few hours, I don&#x27;t feel like it keeps the sweat factor down. I was on a road trip last week, 4 hours in the car, and by the time I got to the destination I felt wet and a little funky. I decided it&#x27;s a great after-gym deodorant when I hit the gym after work. It works long enough to finish my day. They probably shouldn&#x27;t claim that it lasts 48 hours...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this free from BzzAgent, so I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted money or anything.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this free thanks to Secret! The price, at first, made me nervous. I don&#x27;t want to spend so much on something that doesn&#x27;t work great, is what I thought. But, it&#x27;s worth every penny. It stays on so long. I am able to do my work outs and not have to reapply! That to me is a huge deal. The scent is really nice too and you can smell it all day! I would recommended this to anyone and everyone!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this deodorant. I never use gel deodorants and always use the Clinical Protection but this one did the trick! It dried fast after application and left no white marks. It also lasted ALL DAY LONG! Sometimes by the end of the day, if it&#x27;s hot out or I&#x27;m running around a lot, I feel like my deodorant is wearing off, but this one did not. I felt fresh and confident the whole day through. I plan on making this my new go-to deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample free, courtesy of Secret and Bzzagent but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It dries fast so you don&#x27;t have the wet slimy feel of some gel deodorants. Definitely recommend this one! I was lucky enough to get a free sample! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got to try secret outlast deoderant for free. All opinions are my own. I was actually suprised at how well it works. It holds up to even the hottest summer days. I can stay confident and dry.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free with BzzAgent.  I have to admit, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this deodorant, because I had never used a gel deodorant before. The first time I put it on, it felt very wet and I worried that it would feel like that all day. However, I was wrong.  Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant goes on wet, but quickly dries and you can&#x27;t even tell it is on.  The smell is a little strong at first, but it is a pleasant smell. It took me a little bit to get over it the first day because it is a different smell than the deodorant I was wearing, but I quickly got used to it and the smell is no longer over powering.  Another great thing about Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is that a little goes a long way. You just need to click/turn the base once and you will have enough coverage for the whole day. Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant also will last on the hottest day, no matter how you sweat. On an extremely hot and humid day, I wore Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant. I was outside for a long time and the smell from the deodorant stayed, but I did not have any body odor. I haven&#x27;t had that great of coverage in a long time. I also noticed that it does not leave white marks on your clothing, like other deodorants can.  Overall, I really like Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant.  I think I may even like it more than what I was using prior to trying this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast for free complimentary of Secret through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I have to say it&#x27;s a pretty decent product. Let me preface this review by saying that I sweat A LOT, waaayy more than the average person and I&#x27;m 95% sure I have hyperhidrosis. That being said, there is no perfect deodorant/antiperspirant out there for me. Even the clinical stuff doesn&#x27;t cut it. So I&#x27;m taking sweat control out of the equation here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast has a great smell. At first it was a little much for me and actually had me sneezing a couple of times but I still really liked the scent. I got used to it after a day and it no longer bothered my nose. I love that it glides on smoothly. Seriously, gel deodorants are the way to go if you ask me. It dries really quickly too, all while leaving no residue behind. I like that because I buy really expensive bras and I often worry about the deodorant getting on the material and degrading the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant part works great since I&#x27;m fresh all day. As far as 48 hours goes, I think that&#x27;s pushing it at least for me. I&#x27;d say 24-32 hours is more accurate. Of course the sweat control isn&#x27;t effective for me but that&#x27;s just me. I will say the antiperspirant is better than your average product on the market because I&#x27;ve defiantly had worse. Overall I think this product is good and would recommend it to the average person because I think it would provide them with adequate wetness protection.</li>
    <li> BzzAgent sent me a free Secret Outlast deodorant I was excited as I have used Secret products before and was always satisfied.  This product promises 48 hour protection so I wore it in 90° weather at the state fair.  During the day a ran around trying to keep up with my two energetic, and albeit sugared up daughters.  We rode a giant ferris wheel (I&#x27;m not a fan of heights so I perspired a bit extra I&#x27;m sure) rode a rollercoaster, a mechanical bull, ate a hot gyro.  Then went to a concert at the fair, very crowded, very hot, and danced the whole time.  Secret Outlast brought new meaning to phrase, &amp;#34;waved my hands in the air line I just don&#x27;t care!&amp;#34;  I also had not white marks on my sheer shirt so no fashion malfunction!  We didn&#x27;t get home until after midnight so I didn&#x27;t shower and just went straight to bed.  Woke up still fresh and dry!</li>
    <li> Great long last protectin!! Also comes in awsome scents! I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret, I got this product for free to try and I absolutely love it. I usually buy Degree but I am thinking of switching it to Secret Outlast. I love that it goes on clear, dries in seconds, doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks and it really lasts you through out the whole day. I still use the deodorant daily but I probably could skip a day because I believe it would last 48hrs which I think is amazing.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Completely Clean scent because it&#x27;s a nice, simple fresh smell, not too overpowering or artificial.  It claims to protect you for up to 48 hours from odor and wetness, but I found it only works for me for 24 hours on a low-key day and 12 hours during an active day.  I had mixed feelings about the clear gel.  I liked that it didn&#x27;t leave behind white streaks on my shirts, but was a little annoying with how slow it dried.  Overall, it is an okay product.  I don&#x27;t know that I would purchase it unless it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a sample for free thanks to Secret, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get the invite from Bzzagent to try this deodorant.  I&#x27;ve used secret outlast products in the past and really liked them, but I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gels.  The gels are usually cold and gooey and take forever to dry.  This deodorant is different.  It was still cold and gooey, but it dried much quicker than I thought it would.  I stayed dry most days I&#x27;ve used it and smell great.  The deodorant has a light scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I received  a travel size version of  this product for free from bzzagent to review and give  my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have never really  been fond of gel deodorants. This one wasnt too wet  feeling, the scent isnt overpowering but does work well especially on hot sweaty day.&lt;br /&gt;My only cons about the product is that sometimes one click isnt enough coverage and then sometimes two clicks is two much!&lt;br /&gt;Also with gel deodorants its not  the best to out on if you shaved your arm pits that day because it stings. Which  of course is on thr the label about putting on broken skin. But my solids dont  do this. I would def buy this though.</li>
    <li> I received a Sample of Secrets Outlast Completly Clean Gel Deoderant thanks to #BzzAgent and I must say I was a Tad Nervous to try out a Gel due to previous experiences, but to my Surprise, I absolutely Love it. Secrets Outlast Completly Clean Gel worked ALL Day, Sweat Mark Free, White Mark Free &amp; Smelling Completly Clean.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find that after applying Secrets Outlast Gel, it Dries almost immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling Sticky or Gross, which was what I was most afraid of.</li>
    <li> I got to try the new Secret Outlast completely dry for free thanks to BzzAgent. I have been using this for a few days now and So far I&#x27;m happy with th product. It goes on easy and clear so no staying you clothes. And it keeps you feeling dry and fresh for quite some time. The only thing I have noticed that it burns for a second if you apply right after shaving. I do recommend this product and will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to a site called bzzagent.com which lets you try out products and give your honest opinions. This deodorant has some really good pros but a few cons. Pros : Smells good No white marks!! Makes you feel fresh all day Almost feels like your underarms got a fresh drink of water  Cons: If you put it on right after shaving, there is a slight burning sensations and irritates your underarms When you initially put it on, it takes a few minutes to completely dry and in that time period, you&#x27;re underarms feel slightly sticky</li>
    <li> I got to try the product for free thanks to Secret, and it is a wonderful deodorant. It keeps you dry for up to 48 hours, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any wet marks or white marks on any of your clothes. Which is a big deal for my teenage daughters. It smells nice and isn&#x27;t too overpowering, or perfumy smelling. It is available in other scents too if you would prefer something a little smellier. This product is great, and it will satisfy your deodorant needs.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Crest (i.e. Procter &amp; Gamble - the makers of Secret) of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. Through my service as a BzzAgent, I am participating in a BzzCampaign for Secret. I admit, I was skeptical at first. I have used clear gels in the past, and they have left me with more underarm wetness than I had started out with. I was skeptical . . . until I tried it. Sure, you get that gooey chill that comes with gels, but it warms up quickly and dries in moments. There is no scent which is nice (especially if you have a male friend that steals your deo!) I have sensitive underarms and haven’t really noticed a huge issue with using this, just some extremely mild irritation. I have used it a couple times in between my regular brand. It truly fights the Southern humidity! Now, if only they could come out with one for the entire body for summers in the South!!!  For extreme dryness, I’d definitely recommend this; however, I wouldn’t recommend it if you are extremely sensitive.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Secret in order to test it out, so for a few weeks I used my normal deodorant on one armpit, and the Outlast Clear Gel on the other to get a good comparison. Final conclusion: It&#x27;s just ok. Not bad, but not the greatest thing ever to happen to my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally don&#x27;t like gel deodorants...something about putting a gooey liquid in my armpit is less than appealing. As gels go though, this does dry relatively quickly and is only a little sticky. The product is clear and leaves no white marks, but I&#x27;ve never had any problems with white marks myself, and definitely not any issues with clumping (eew!). If white marks are a concern for you, this may be a product worth trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor protection continues to be inconsistent, but so does my current deodorant. The most significant thing for me was the scent of the product. The other versions of Secret Clear Gel have a very clear label indicating the scent. The fact that the Completely Clean version doesn&#x27;t mention scent at all is somewhat misleading, and I assumed that it would be relatively unscented. If you don&#x27;t want a noticeable smell coming from your armpits throughout the day, be sure to get the version that says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, not Completely Clean. All in all, Secret Outlast doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than my usual brand, but it&#x27;s not any worse either. It may be worth a shot if you have issues with white marks!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this product. I have shied away from Secret because it wasn&#x27;t working anymore but I was using the solids and not the clear gel. Then I got this and it worked beautifully. Coverage is nice and it doesn&#x27;t flake or ruin clothes I think that is the best part. Plus after a long day I&#x27;m not too concerned with odor. I did find that it didn&#x27;t last 48 hours for me but it did make it a whole day which is better than the other stuff. The fragrance is also pleasant and not overbearing too. I got this product thanks to Secret and BzzAgent but the opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I received it free in a BZZ Agent package and will now make it my go to deodorant. It works so well and keeps me fresh and dry all day. (Even my husband loves it. Shhhhh. Don&#x27;t tell.)</li>
    <li> I tried secret outlast as part of a bzz campaign.  I liked the invisible solid and the way it glides on. I gave it 4 stars because while it does last it is not as effective as I hoped for exercising. I did notice that my clothes seemed to be covered in less white streaks. All in all an effective gel that&#x27;s easy to use with a refreshing scent</li>
    <li> I love the scent, how long it lasts, and it keeps me dry. Oh lying bad thing is that it seems to stay wet for a bit long under my arms while I&#x27;m getting dressed. Other that that I would buy this product and recommended it to others. Thanks to bzzagent for giving me a chance to try secret outlast gel.</li>
    <li> Love this product - goes on clear without the sticky feeling and no white marks!  No worries about wetness or &amp;#34;natural smell&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Well it is great, sort of. They are 100% right about the protection and how great it stops odor. Trust me I know odor and stress and this product lived up to its claims. So now the not so great news. It does not dry very fast oh yeah it dries a lot faster than some but...... I had to put it on and wait about 5 minutes every time because it was too wet to put on my top. Be quiet I hear you yes I did try to use less and spread it over a larger area, more evenly, blah blah blah. I also want to say it goes on feeling sort of slimy and sticky and I get enough of that from the kids and grands. However if you have the time it really works even out under the sun on a hot and muggy Florida day it worked. So all in all a great product that I am so glad that I can say I am a BzzAgent and received a sample and coupons for this, because I will definitely be keeping some of this on hand.</li>
    <li> When I started the BzzAgent campaign I was skeptical. Up until this point I absolutely hated any clear gel deodorant because it left my clothes with a huge wet mark. When I got the package I was pleasantly surprised with the scent. It is very fresh but not overpowering. Secret outlast completely clean claims to work for 48 hours. I recently took this on my trip to India to test this out. It did not work 48 hours that is why I did not give it five stars.  When I did put it on in the morning it did last until night time though.  All I had to wait was one minute or so before putting on my clothes and there was no wet marks. I will deftly be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this Secret Outlast as a free sample but my opinions are 100% my own. I really like the scent of this deodorant. It is very fragrant, but not overpowering. I love this deodorant for when I go to the gym as it is a very strong and protecting deodorant. You never have to worry about smelling funky when you have this deodorant on. I also like that it did not stain my clothing at all. The only thing that I do not like about the deodorant is the presence of aluminum in the product which I believe get&#x27;s absorbed into your skin and can cause health problems later in life. I don&#x27;t believe you should use this deodorant every day but for going to the gym, etc. it is perfect.</li>
    <li> It goes on clear but I don&#x27;t find that the protection is as good as my regular deodorant so I won&#x27;t be buying it. I received the product as part of a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Gel deodorant/antiperspirant. I tried them and frankly hated them. They never seemed to dry completely and left me feeling sticky and gooey all day. The odor protection was pretty non-existent as well. Needless to say I never tried another until now. Be cause of past experience I was hesitant. I work in a very stressful, physical environment often working long hours (surgery). I need a product that works overtime as well! I must say I was surprised the first time I used Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel. I applied it right out of the shower after drying of course. I expected to have to wait awhile for it to dry and to be honest didn&#x27;t think it would. After I finished drying off I realized the Gel was DRY! I received the Completely Clean scent in my BzzKit #GotitFree. It was pleasant and not over powering. That&#x27;s important in my job as patients can be sensitive to smells before and after procedures. It can get pretty warm with all the lights, being gowned and gloved,and as I said before it is a physical job. We all keep deodorant in our lockers to get us through the rough or long days. Secret Outlast kept up and I didn&#x27;t need to make any mid day locker stops! I had been using a solid that claims not to leave messy marks but it never failed to disappoint in that area. Now with Secret Outlast I get No white marks and fantastic, long lasting odor and wetness protection! Best of both worlds in ONE product. I&#x27;m sold1</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant for free as part of a BzzAgent promotion. Memories of gel deodorants that never quite dried and that stuck to clothing left me hesitant to try this product, but I ran out of my regular antiperspirant one morning and reached for this new product in a moment of desperation. I have not switched back to my old tried-and-true brand since.    Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant dries quickly, provides all-day (and night) protection, and leaves no tell-tale white marks on my clothing. I like the scent and I love the product&#x27;s effectiveness. I&#x27;ve found it to be just as effective as the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; competing product I had previously used and less irritating to my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this in a Bzzagent promotion.  When I received the product I felt like it was going to be like all other clear gel formulas.  I would put it on and have to stand for 5 minutes for it to dry and then deal with my arm pits sticking together because it was so sticky!  This was NOT the case.  It went smoothly dried quickly and no sticky feeling.  The best part it gives me all day protection!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive a full size sample size of this to try through BzzAgent.  As soon as I opened the packed I was immediately pleased by the fresh and light scent that greeted me ~ and that was before I opened the product!  I was ready to put this product to the test with the unusually warm weather we were having.  I turned the knob and advanced the gel up and applied it.  I did wait a few minutes to get dressed as the antiperspirant felt a bit sticky when I first applied it.  I got dressed and went about my normal day of work and running errands.  I did experience some wetness and stickiness throughout the day and I didn&#x27;t feel it worked as well as it could have as an antiperspirant.  I noticed that even after I had used the product for multiple days, it didn&#x27;t keep my underarm area completely dry, and I wasn&#x27;t doing intense workouts or anything that should have allowed me to sweat through the antiperspirant protection.  I did notice a few marks on my shirt&#x27;s underarm area after using the product so I would not say that the claim of no marks is completely accurate, at least in my usage.&lt;br /&gt;In short, I would recommend trying this product and seeing if it worked for you.  The scent was the best part of this product for me as unfortunately I did not feel it kept my underarm area dry enough and did not live up to the claim of leaving no marks.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  I must say I was very skeptical at first before using this product.  48 hours of protection AND no white marks?  I thought for sure this was a joke.  After using it now for almost a month I can tell you all that I will never go back to another deodorant EVER again!  I have tried them all, the ones without chemicals and aluminum, the extra strength prescription protection, solids, sprays, gels... you name it I&#x27;ve tried it!  No matter what I used, I was always missing something.  I like being able to smell the clean scent of the product, while also not feeling myself sweat or being able to smell anything after a full day of use.  While I haven&#x27;t gone a total of 48 hours without using more, I can say this product will get you through a full day of crazy!  I&#x27;ve used it working out, working, cleaning, and just getting dirty!  While there isn&#x27;t much of a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell that stays with this clear gel, It does work and packs a punch against the funky odor that some can&#x27;t cut!  I love this product and kudos to Secret for finally making a good deodorant!</li>
    <li> absolutely the best gel deodorant ever. dries super fast and not one mark on my clothing. i always stayed away from gels but this is my new deodorant. it lasts forever too! worth the $  Thank you secret and buzz agent for the chance to try this!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smelling product.  Leaves not White Marks on clothing.  Dries quickly when applied to skin. Offers 48 hours of odor protection and keeps you feeling dry. I was given a free full sized product to try from BZZAgent.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a clear gel which is a tad bit cold to apply but who cares when it works so well!! I workout 5 days a week and this works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Yes I did get it free from BzzAgent but I will continue to purchase! The only thing at all that I didn&#x27;t care for was the scent....but I&#x27;ll try a different one next time!</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clear Clean Scent from BzzAgent to try.  I am a former Secret user but something in their formula changed and I gave it up.  I have to give them props though - I LOVED this.  It dries quickly and is long-lasting.  No worries about sweating or being stinky!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clear Deodorant from a BzzAgent campaign. I was skeptical at first because I have a hard time finding a  deodorant that actually work . I typically use a clinical strength deodorant and was not sure this was going to work for me.  The Secret Outlast worked really well for me. It went on wet, but dried quickly. It had a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a three year old that keeps me running and Secret Outlast keeps me dry when chasing after him.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant through a buzz campaign and I am a very harsh critic on deodorants.  In the last few years I have been going through peri-menopause and for those women who are unfortunate enough to suffer severe hot flashes, you know how hard your deodorant has to work!  I have been going through various deodorants through the last couple of years and haven&#x27;t been satisfied with any of them.  I absolutely hate the smell of deodorant mixed with sweat and it seemed that that smell was the best I could hope for.  This deodorant is completely different!  First, it has a nice pleasant smell, not at all overpowering.  And most importantly, this deodorant lasts all day!  My armpits smell fresh and are never wet.  I love this product and would and have recommended it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was completely taken aback by how quickly this deodorant works leaving no residue behind. I&#x27;m so glad I opted in for this bzzcampaign from bzzagent. Loved the mild scent..stays with me for entire day!!</li>
    <li> The first day I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel it was 86 degrees out at 9:00am.  I decided to go on a two hour bike ride...in the Texas heat.  I figured if I was going to try out a new antiperspirant/deodorant I would really put it through the ringer.  Well, to my surprise...it passed my test with flying colors!  Not only did it go on completely clear (which wasn&#x27;t a big deal that day on my bike ride, but it IS a big deal when I&#x27;m playing volleyball) but it had a very pleasant smell that didn&#x27;t overwhelm me or get overbearing the longer I biked.  I also wasn&#x27;t sweating through my shirt like I normally do.....Texas is HOT!  And just to make sure this freebie buzzkit wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I&#x27;ve worn it confidently for the past couple weeks.  This is now my new go to underarm protection.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary, free, product from BzzAgent, and I must say I wasn&#x27;t super enthused about trying it. I have tried gel deodorants in the past and could never quite get on board with putting a cold, gooey substance on my underarms. I am however, always up for trying new things, so I gave it a whirl. I really actually like this stuff. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever trade it out completely for the invisible solid (that really isn&#x27;t invisible) I currently use, but the scent of this is great. Clean and refreshing. It seems to work as well as the invisible solid I use, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the solids do. Overall, I am glad I gave this a whirl. It has changed my opinion of gel deodorants almost to the point where I would switch with just a few minor amendments with the formula. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.  I can honestly say I was not impressed with the deodorant.  The only thing I really liked was that it went on easy.  I felt that I had to keep reapplying through out the day, because I had a funky smell.  I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorants and I will not try this again.</li>
    <li> I have been extremely loyal to one brand of deodorant for many many years. Sure I delt with the dredded white marks on my clothes and the nasty lil deodorant clumps under my arms but it kept me smelling fresh and dry so I never thought about switching. But I recently got selected to participate in a #bzzagent campaign to try out and review Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I have to say I am forever a fan! Being Gel, it of course went on clear and surprisingly it wasn&#x27;t cold lol. It held up to everyday activities, house work and hours of yard work like a champ. It even stayed on and continued working after spending hours in the pool. It smells great, feels great, works great and best of all I no longer have to deal with white marks or deodorant clumps. I have officially made the switch and replaced my old brand with Secret Outlast Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend! What do you have to lose?! White marks, clumps, having to constantly reapply? Those will all be a thing of the past if you give Secret Outlast Clear Gel a try.&lt;br /&gt;#GotitFree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve was given this to try as a BZZAGENT and I&#x27;m impressed on how well it lasts and how fresh it smells....great product</li>
    <li> I used Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel by Secret that I got from Bzzagent for free and I loved it. I love that it makes me feel fresh all day. I love that it is a clear gel and won&#x27;t make stains on my clothes.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about deodorants, but Secret Outlast impressed me! I got a free product to test, and I tested it by applying it to my right underarm while using my regular deodorant (Degree) on my left underarm. I did not reapply for 48 hours. Right off the bat, I noticed that my black tee, that I put on prety much immediately after applying deodorant, did not have any deodorant marks or smudges. Within that 48 hours, I went to the gym for a 40 minute workout and went about my day as usual, in 90 degree heat as is customary for central Virginia this time of year. At the end of the two day period, I sniffed under my arms. The underarm that had Secret Outlast on it did not stink. The other side, with the other deodorant, smelled a little like b/o. Neither deodorant had me smelling terrible considering that I went 48 hours without a shower, but Secret Outlast really did back up its claim of 48 hours, through the gym and the muggy hot weather of running errands all day. I am very impressed. Also, it wasn&#x27;t overly perfumey and dried super quick at right after I applied some.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of a BzzAgent campaign for free. I currently use Secret pH balanced Invisible Solid deodorant. The amount of aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex Gly (active ingredient) is 18%. In the Outlast, it has aluminum zirconium PCTAchlorohydrex Gly as the active ingredient, but it is only 16%. I don&#x27;t know if the reduced amount is because the different chemical is stronger, but from the difference in how I smell, I don&#x27;t think so.  What I *did* love was the Clear Gel formula. It dried super fast and I had no marks on any of my clothing. I loved it.  I would use this if I was out of my normal Secret formula, but I wouldn&#x27;t switch to it, and it definitely wouldn&#x27;t last &amp;#34;48 hours&amp;#34; as it claims in the campaign (and wouldn&#x27;t you be showering it off before then, anyway? Ew.)  I would LOVE to see them use the active ingredient in the pH Balanced Invisible Solid and make it in a clear gel formula - that would be a dream deodorant!</li>
    <li> I received a small bottle of Secret Outlast Completely Clean from Bzzagent and I&#x27;m very very pleased with the product. First off, it smells great!!! I was worried about the gel being sticky and maybe leaking when I started to sweat but once its dry, its perfect. It lasts a very long time. All if takes is applying it in the morning and you are set for the rest of the day! I go to the gym at night once I get off work and don&#x27;t need to re-apply. I&#x27;ve recommended this to my girl friends as well since we live In Florida and it is EXTREMELY HOT AND HUMID in the summer time. Great product! Thanks Bzzagent and thanks Secret!!!! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Secret, and I can definitely say that it did not disappoint. This Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant is one of the best deodorants I have tried. It glides on so smoothly and goes on clear. Sometimes I see white marks on my clothes when using other deodorant, but not this one. It gives long lasting protection even when I&#x27;m sweating profusely and the scent masks all odor without the deodorant itself having a powerful scent. I haven&#x27;t tried wearing this deodorant for more than 48 hours as I usually like to shower after I exercise so I can&#x27;t say anything for the 48 hour protection. I&#x27;m skeptical a deodorant actually lasts for 48 hours but this did last me for a good 16 hours!!!</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try this product for free thanks to Secret and I am now a believer! This deodorant is great. I always have a hard time trying to find a deodorant that lasts through the day and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes. This deodorant not only dries fast but it lasts! I live in the heat and I never have to worry about ruining my shirts with sweat when I have this deodorant on. I love it! If you want something that dries fast, protects you all day, and doesn&#x27;t ruin your clothes, then this deodorant will change your life!</li>
    <li> This deodorant surprised me! I received it free as part of a promotion from Secret via Bzzagent.at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it because I haven&#x27;t really cared for gel deodorants in the past. Despite my reservations I used the entire travel sized deodorant I was provided not only was this deodorant not sticky but it lasted throughout the day.I wore it several times for a run outside and it lasted through the hot Louisiana heat. If you&#x27;re wanting to try a gel deodorant this is the one to try.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of secret outlast clear gel completely clean deodorant to try. I was completely excited to have received it. I tried 2 clicks on each armpit the following morning. But noticed about half way thru the day I could smell body odor. So I reapplied and hoped for the best. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love the smell and the way it goes on.  It leaves no white marks but it doesn&#x27;t last 24 or 48 hours. Thank you secret for the chance to try the clear gel, I&#x27;ll stick with you but in invisible solid.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel through BzzAgent. I was a little reluctant to try it out because I have not been a fan of gel deodorants in the past. Secret Outlast has changed my mind completely! You only need a small amount ( I use one click per arm) and you are set for the day! It has been a HOT summer and I have never had to reapply during the day. Not only do I stay smelling fresh all day, but under my arms remain totally dry! Combine the odor and wetness protection with no more worrying about annoying white marks and I&#x27;ve been sold. Once my sample runs out I will definitely be buying more of this. I found my new deodorant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Bzz Agent in a campaign for Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. Usually gel deodorant feels sticky and yucky on the skin. Secret Outlast doesn&#x27;t feel that way. It dried quickly with no sticky residue or whote marks left on my clothes. It has a light, clean scent that lasts amm day. I have used it everyday since I got the sample and I think it works great.</li>
    <li> I was supplied this deodorant for free from Bzzagent via Secret. I was skeptical to try Secret since it had been years since I had last used it. My underarms tend to be sensitive and so I usually drift towards natural and non-scented varieties. This July has been a scorcher and my Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant wasn&#x27;t holding up as well. I was excited to try this and once it came in I put it right on.&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;- It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;- My application lasted 48 hours easily through July heat.&lt;br /&gt;- It was easy to glide on and dried extremely quick. Didn&#x27;t leave any icky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;- It didn&#x27;t mark my clothes!&lt;br /&gt;Con -&lt;br /&gt;- The scent was very strong and a touch off-putting. BUT - it did fade over the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel as part of the a BzzAgent campaign and I loved it, it is a clear gel that does not stain my clothes and besides it smell awesome and also it help protect me from sweating.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I love the most is the smell and how smooth it applies.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast is the best ! it really last longer time and i smell good all the time.</li>
    <li> This was definitely a great find!  It saves me money because it really does provide that 48 hour protection as promised and there are no messy white lines that I am forever ruining my clothes with!  I am a bzzagent and I got this product free to try.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to try from BuzzAgent and Secret Outlast®. I also got some coupons to share with my friends and family. I like that this product goes on clear and it doesn&#x27;t smear all over my shirts. I wear tank tops sometimes in the summer and I don&#x27;t need everyone to see that I wear deodorant even when all adults really should. I love protection I get from this product it&#x27;s 48-hour protection. I sweat a lot especially in the summer and this product helps me to stay dry under my arms. I also like that I don&#x27;t have an smell to me after I wear this. I recommend this product and I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as a free sample. I will say that I am not a fan of gel deodorants, or &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; smells. But I will say that this deodorant lasted thru my very hectic shifts at wok. NO smell, no wetness. Plus did not leave the dreaded &amp;#34;white marks&amp;#34; on my clothing. I am slowly becoming a fan and would probably buy it in a different scent</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product free for review thanks to Secret.  I&#x27;m already a Secret fan.  I enjoy the fragrances from the Destinations collection quite a bit.  It&#x27;s never really bothered me in the past that solids will sometimes dry out and leave little deodorant crumbs behind, because I almost never show my armpits.  I may switch to a clear gel after all.  I like the way this covers and dries without a trace.  The scent is very light.  A little like cucumber-melon.  Either way, they offer the Destinations collection in clear gel form too, so I can have my pick.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed my tiny sample.  If I hadn&#x27;t told my boyfriend that I&#x27;m not allowed to buy any new deodorant until I finish what I have, I&#x27;d go out and get another of these.  Also, if you&#x27;re a girl going natural, it&#x27;s nice to have something that won&#x27;t cake in your hair.  Look, I&#x27;m a hippie too, but just because I look like one doesn&#x27;t mean I smell like one.  You don&#x27;t have to rub crystals in your pits to avoid deodorant residue.  Secret&#x27;s got you covered.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Clear Gel offers 48 protection hours and it works! The best part? No white marks in your black clothe</li>
    <li> I have been using the same deodorant for over a decade, but after receiving a free sample of Secret Outlast from Secret through BzzAgent, I have switched brands for good!  I haven&#x27;t used a gel deodorant in a good 15 years, but I was pleasantly surprised how well Secret Outlast performed in 90 degree summer heat day after day.  When my sample size Secret Outlast ran out, I bought some more at the store.  My only complaint is that the no white marks promise isn&#x27;t true.  I wore a black shirt after waiting five minutes for Secret Outlast to dry and I did see a small white mark on my shirt.  The white mark washed off with a damp washcloth though.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any yellow staining on my shirts from the gel which is definitely nice!  Definitely worth a try if you are in the market for a new deodorant!</li>
    <li> I  tried the product for free thanks to Secret and BzzAgent but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of this product.  I have tried other gels in the past and they were cold and gooey and took forever to dry. This comes out of the tube cleanly and evenly every time.  I only have to use 2 clicks and I am good for the day.  I also liked that the scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  I would recommend this product.  The only reason I deducted a star is because of the chemicals used.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL from Bzzagent.com. The scent is not overwhelming at all like some deodorants. It&#x27;s sticky until it dries which it doesn&#x27;t take long. You can&#x27;t apply it when you wear black clothes because it will leave some white residue. It is easy to supplicate by using the twist at the bottom to pop the gel out and just a little swipe under each arm and you are through. It does keep you odor free for a long time before shower. It&#x27;s good for people that does a lot of moving around such as running, workout in the gym, construction and etc... It last more compared to other deodorants.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this for free for the purpose of a review. I did not like it. It burned when I used it and did not help keep me dry. I used it for two weeks but just couldn&#x27;t do it anymore. I felt stinky and gross. I think I will st ick to my other.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of this product from BzzAgent. Loved the scent and clear application of this product, but didn&#x27;t love the lack of protection from inevitable summertime sweating! I&#x27;m active constantly between work, family, and activities. The biggest test I had for Secret was hiking the Red River Gorge in Kentucky for a weekend. After 8 miles, I was uncomfortably sweaty, but at least still smelled my deodorant rather than B.O. I&#x27;d permanently switch to Secret if it offered more sweat protection for me!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product as a Buzz Agent.  So I was happy to give it a try!  I have very simple criteria that I take into account when buying deodorant: It needs to take less than 5 seconds to apply, it needs to keep me dry &amp; smelling clean, and it should not irritate my skin. Unfortunately, the Secret Outlast Clear Gel failed on all of these. Upon first glances, the packaging is pretty. For a week, I used this every morning and again after working out/showering. I apply 1 &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; of product to each under arm. I then have to fan each armpit for about 20 seconds each to get the gel to dry. This is 35 seconds longer than I would like to worry about deodorant application. Of course that is silly, but if the deodorant actually worked, I think I would have happily continued fanning away. Throughout my day, I constantly noticed a lot of smells. I do not sweat much, so the peculiar mix of deodorant and sweat was distracting. I was self conscious wearing this. Without worrying about smelling of body odor, the scent of the deodorant was stronger than I prefer. To add insult to injury, at the end of the week the product started irritating my armpits. They were itchy. I was unhappy. I decided to keep this Secret to myself at that point.</li>
    <li> I have not used gel deodorant since I was a teenager because I also felt that it rubbed off too easily and didn&#x27;t last all day. Secret Outlast gel actually does work and doesn&#x27;t make you wonder if you are still smelling fresh or not. It says it last 48 hours and I believe it. I love that it does not leave any white marks. I got to try this as a free promo from Bzzagent and I liked it so much that I went and bought a twin pack. If you have bad memories of gel deodorant, I suggest giving this product a try because it might just change your mind.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Seceret and BzzAgent I was able to try this for free and the first time I used it my family and I ended up tackling a four mile walk to a ghost town we read about. It was a hot day and we weren&#x27;t lucky enough to have the reprieve of shade. So I thought for sure I would be stinky at the end of our adventure because I was horribly sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to my surprise the Secret Outlast lived up to it&#x27;s name and was as present after the hike as it was when I put it on that morning! My family and I do alot of hiking and outdoor activities and I have not found a deodorant will hold up. So I was very surprised and pleased, it&#x27;s safe to say I will be switching  to Secret Outlast asap and spreading the word far and wide!</li>
    <li> Lately I am pretty dedicated and attached to my clinical strength deodorants because to me they seem like the only kind of deodorant that does its job. When BzzAgent offered an opportunity to try this deodorant free from Secret I was intrigued. I have to say that the scent is great and it does last quite a long time. I, like anyone else  hates white &amp;#34;deo&amp;#34; marks on my black clothes! This deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave skid marks on your clothes! And for that greatness alone I would put this into my deodorant rotation. This deodorant is definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I was amazed by this product.ive been using secret powder deodorant for years and now that I&#x27;ve tried the gel ill never turn back to powder. It leaves no streaks on my dark clothes. It smells good throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t feel filmy on my skin like the powder use to. I love this product feels so good!!!</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this deodorant for free thanks to Bzzagent and I&#x27;m very thankful as it&#x27;s one of the best deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on clear and stays clear, keeps me smelling fresh all day and it hasn&#x27;t left any awful white marks on any of my clothes.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from Secret via BzzAgent and was so pleasantly surprised! I have always been pretty lazy about choosing a deodorant. I would always just go with a regular solid and with whatever brand happened to be on sale because they all seemed so similar to me. I had never used a gel before and I love it! You don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks with this and it feels really light and invisible on my skin once it dries. The only small drawback I&#x27;ve seen is that it sometimes dispenses too much product if you aren&#x27;t careful. A small issue though, and I definitely plan on purchasing in the future!</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Secret products and use them all the time so I was definitely excited when I heard Bzzagent and Secret chose me to review this product. This review is my own opinion. First off, I love that it is a clear gel which dries fast and leaves no residue marks on my armpits. Secondly, I love the protection it gives me. This deodorant can withstand my tough workouts and hot muggy weather and kept me dry. The scent is very clean smelling, it smells like you just got out of the shower which I love. The only downfall was the size of the sample. After a few uses it was done since it was a deluxe sample. Perfect size for traveling or throwing in your gym bag though. I would definitely purchase this product again from Secret.</li>
    <li> The product worked great, passed the trial on a hot 90degree day.  No white marks either!, but it had a wet feeling to it for a while before I could put my top on.  Good product, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really love being able to apply my deodorant once and be worry free all day long. This wonderful product won&#x27;t leave you with those unsightly white marks on clothing either. Its  win win! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received a free sample on Secret Outlast. I was pretty excited to try it, because I&#x27;m a Secret user. It&#x27;s the only deodorant that can even begin to keep with my busy days, but even it seems to always fall short. Then I got my sample and i LOVED it! It survived amusement parks, picnics, fairs and un-airconditioned buildings. I really noticed the difference when I used my regular Secret instead of my Secret Outlast when I went to a party in a small house on a 90* day. I was pretty stinky when I got home. So if you love your Secret products, then you&#x27;ve got to try this one and if you don&#x27;t use Secret, you will after you try this!</li>
    <li> Received this product, free of charge, for review purposes via www.bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I can not say that I enjoyed this product. The effectiveness of this product was lacking so much that I had to apply several times a day to get the same level of protection that I get from my normal product. Also, the scent of this product was incredibly overpowering.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love olay outlast it is my one and only go to deodorant to keep me feeling fresh and clean. Recently I was given a sample in my bzzkit from bzzagent and was thrilled to be able to write a review. I&#x27;ve been a long time customer and will continue. I love the gel because it dries clear and quickly as if it evaporates but remains strong all day long keeping cool and confident.</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent and got to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free. I like how it dries fast and leaves no marks. It has a 48 oder and wetness protection. I wore it through the busy holidays and had not problems. and had no problems. I would highly recommend  Update: I am still using Secret Outlast xtend clear gel and I still have no problems with this deodorant. I like it and so does my daughter. I would still recommend Secret Outlast xtend for adults or teens.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this to try and have to say I absolutely loved it! I have used the secret outlast before but never the clear gel. It leaves no white marks on clothing when applying. It worked all day to at outside events. I couldn&#x27;t believe it keep me smelling fresh all day!</li>
    <li> I was given this product from BzzAgent to try. It is great and really does what it says. If you are like me a sweat like crazy when it&#x27;s really hot, this is a must try for you. Love that it&#x27;s long lasting too.</li>
    <li> i really like this product works great goes on smooth</li>
    <li> never tried a clear gel before. I got this product to test free through bzzagent and I did the #epic48 challenge. it took me a few times to get the hang of using a clear gel.&lt;br /&gt;I did not realize you should let the product dry before putting on clothes or putting your arms down this was very frustrating for me. the clear gel did not last the whole 48 hours either and gave me a wet sticky feeling most of the day.</li>
    <li> I  received a free sample courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret. I have always been a fan of Secret and have used many of their products. I love this product. Yes it is a gel and feels wet for a bit but that does not bother me at all. I put it on as I am getting ready and by the time I am ready to get dressed it is completely dry. The best part is that it leaves absolutely NO white marks!! Everybody hates those pesky marks don&#x27;t they? Even on our hottest days it keeps me dry and protected. I will continue to purchase this product in the future and recommend it to everyone I can</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of gel because let&#x27;s face it I grew up in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s and never had a great experience. The squishiness and the feel always grossed me out. But before you feel this is a negative review just know that this product has changed my mind about gel deodorants. I left Secret years ago because I felt it wasn&#x27;t meeting my needs and I was always a stinky mess. I went with another product for a while until I was offered this mission from BzzAgent. They offered to send me a free stick of Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I love free stuff so why not. I put my other product away and took on this challenge. I started a life changing goal list and I needed a product that could keep up with me no matter if it was jogging, burpee&#x27;s, or whatever I was doing that day. Here I am thirty-three years old and trying to take control over my health. It took me a while to get used to the gel, but I decided to give it a fair chance. I am so glad I did. My deodorant can outlast me! I am usually a sweaty puddle on my couch after a jog, but I smell amazing. Now I love comparing products so I bought the clear solid to see the difference and I have to say the clear gel works harder. The solid has bunched under my arms leaving pearls where I never had that problem with the clear gel. I also feel that the clear gel didn&#x27;t wear off as easily as the solid. This product has impressed me so much that I am willing to let go of my distaste for the gel in order to have a better product. My husband even tried it when he ran out of his product and raves about how amazing my deodorant is. He said he went the whole day fresh and clean. With his hectic job working in a surgery center that is amazing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to try a new deodorant, because most just don&#x27;t work for me. But I had nothing but great experiences with the Secret brand, and looked forward to it when the BUZZ campaign came around. I received a free sample in an exchange for an HONEST review.&lt;br /&gt;And my honest opinion is, that this product is awesome. 48 hour protection without having to re-apply it, great scent and no white marks on shirts anymore. It dries very fast, too.</li>
    <li> The 48 hour protection is no joke.  I basically use this produce t twice a day, before my workout and when I jump out of the shower after my workout. The clear gel means you won&#x27;t get those pesky white balls in your pits and you won&#x27;t get any white marks on your outfits. Secret Outlast truly outlasts all my workouts, it leaves me feeling confident that I won&#x27;t smell out my neighbor next to me in spin class. I did get this sample sized for free from Secret, but I will be buying the full sized on my next shopping trip.</li>
    <li> I was given Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel Deodorant for free for testing purposes from BzzAgent. However, this review is my own opinion of the product. I typically use solid deodorant and don&#x27;t use gel deodorants. Personally, I&#x27;m not a fan of the cold, wet feeling of a gel deodorant when applying it. However, I was happy to find that this deodorant did dry fast and smelled great! Living in the south, this deodorant was really put to the test. I&#x27;m happy to report it keeps me dry all day and smelling great. This deodorant has definitely changed my opinion about gel deodorants.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this deodorant free from Secret and BzzAgent and this is my honest opinion of the product.  This product has a nice and refreshing scent. The product applies nicely to your skin. The gel doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry. That being said, the deodorant really doesn&#x27;t prevent you for sweating more than any other deodorant. Also, the deodorant doesn&#x27;t prevent body odor better than any other deodorant on the market. You need to reapply the deodorant as soon as 5 hrs after first applying it. So I wouldn&#x27;t say that it really &amp;#34;outlasts&amp;#34; other deodorants out there. I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase this deodorant in the future.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret clear gel thanks to Secret and BzzAgent. I loved how quickly it dried after application, no having to wait to get dressed until your armpits dry like other gels. Another plus of the gel, no marks on your clothes. The first few weeks of using this I absolutely loved it. Provided great odor and sweat protection, while going on clean and invisible. However, after a few weeks I felt like the odor protection was not lasting all day during hot or active days.</li>
    <li> I loved the protection and effectiveness of Secret Outlast. Goes on clear so no more messes on my dark clothing.Keeps me smelling fresh all day and night long especially on hot days. This is not my go to for deodorant protection. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand Secret</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from buzzagnet to review. I Love this deodorant. Right before receiving this sample I had actually started using a men&#x27;s deodorant. Because none of the women&#x27;s seemed to be do the job. But,secret outlast is amazing it works great n last long. Plus,it smells amazing</li>
    <li> I received this free as a member of BzzAgent. The Secret definitely keeps you dry, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks all over your clothes, however I don&#x27;t know if I really believe the 48 hour claim (nor do I really want to try!). Also, the tube seems to be used much faster than a solid deoderant which would cause you to buy it more often. Overall, a good product, but just for the convenience of not having to wait until I put clothes on to use it like with a solid, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast through BzzAgent.  I was not so sure I would like it.  I am so surprised to say that It will be my every day product now.  It goes on smooth, it drys quick, it does not leave any marks on your clothes, it has a good scent and best of all it WORKS.  You do not have to apply every day if you do not want to, it will keep working for 48 hours.  This is a must try product if you have not tried it yet!&lt;br /&gt;Janet</li>
    <li> When Secret Outlast promised that this deodorant would leave no sweat stains, I was very skeptical. I have tried many deodorants throughout my life and was sure that this was just another empty promise for no streaks. But I recieved a free deodorant sample from Secret Outlast and discovered this time, Secret is telling the truth!&lt;br /&gt;Now I love Outlast! I have grown used to the scent that lasts until I climb into bed and turn out the light. I love that this deodorant is room temperature and fast drying.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is getting rid of the deodorant that I used to use but will never use again!!</li>
    <li> If I could give 4.5 stars I would. This products works great and as advertised does not leave white residue on your clothes. I was of the opinion that it would likely not keep me dry during the hot, humid summer weather in Kentucky but it has worked really well. I will likely buy this product next time I need to purchase antiperspirant. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the Secret Outlast Clear Gel antiperspirant was that when I DID finally sweat through it during my workouts, it ran down my arms and dried with a white residue. Considering most people usually shower after sweating that heavily, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big enough issue to take my rating down to 4 stars though. I really liked my sample that I received for free from bzzagent and will purchase this for myself to use again in the future for sure.</li>
    <li> I feel like this deodorant is just okay, I like the brand Secret...Secret is the number one brand I use. I just don&#x27;t like gel ones. I was given this from Bzzagent to try out and I thought I would try gels again for this campaign, but it didn&#x27;t change my mind on gel deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling after applying it on. It feels wet for too long and awkward feeling underneath. A pro is that it keeps me fresh for a very long time. But, another negative is I don&#x27;t like the smell of this gel very much. But a positive on top of that is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white mark residue when applying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like that that you have to click it through little holes to get it. Sometimes I would get too much deodorant that would come out and I couldn&#x27;t just put it back in without making a mess so I was left with putting everything that came out on, because I didn&#x27;t want to waste it. I don&#x27;t like the amount that comes out when you click it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is just okay, I would just stick with the non gel Secret.</li>
    <li> I was sent this sample product from Secret to try and review. I loved the protection I received with this deodorant and the smell of it but I would have liked it to dry faster than it did. It claims to dry faster than other deodorants but I have other gel deodorants that dried faster. I guess I&#x27;m just not a fan of the gel version. I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling. I prefer the spray on deodorants. So if this was available as a spray on deodorant (maybe it is and I just don&#x27;t know about it lol) I would definitely buy it.  It did stand the test of time though and kept me feeling and smelling fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I will be buying the full size version as soon as possible. I am trying This product for free thanks to secret!!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is seriously the best out there. I had struggled in the past with by half way thru the day having smelly armpits no matter what deodorant i tried. Then i tried this stuff and it works so well and it last for a very long time. You don&#x27;t really have to reapply it again the next day but i always do just to be safe. It dries very quickly and it does not leave any white marks of your clothes like most out there. I would suggest this product to anyone. Second to none!!! I received this produce for free thanks to secret!!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this deodorant through bzzagent.  I wanted to give it a try because I am sick of the white marks my current deodorant solid always leaves on my clothes.  The gel worked well and kept me dry throughout the day.  I don&#x27;t sweat a ton but I sweat enough to need an antiperspirant.  The scent lasted as well, however I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of it.  It was a little too perfumy for my liking.  The best thing about it was that it left no white marks on my clothes. That being said, I will probably stick with my solid deodorant, mostly because I don&#x27;t like the feeling of putting the cold gel on in the morning and the scent is not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love secret Outlast clear gel. Perfect for that little black dress night. It smells fresh and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave marks. It last all day. Recommended to everyone I can think of. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I have had such a hard time lately finding a deodorant that actually helps me stay dry and smell fresh all day. When this came up on bzzz agent to review I figured it was worth a shot. I love it so much. I used it all week for VBS with 50 kids while volunteering in some of our hottest days of the summer and didn&#x27;t stink at all by the end of the day. I&#x27;m super impressed and plan on throwing out my other deodorant and get this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free from Secret and Bzzz Agent.</li>
    <li> Yes honey i love the secret outlast deodorant  it smell good keep me dry all day do not irritate  I have sensitive  under arms love this Proudct  highly recommend  it to you I like. that it don&#x27;t come out my clothing or leave a stain i feel comfortable  and happy knowing am fresh as I can be yes i got my for free to tested  and give my honest opinion for being a bzzagent  this has got to be the best I try. #bzzagent #epic48  #GotitFree</li>
    <li> I truly love this deodorant! What a realife it is to have a deodorant that leaves you feeling dry under your arms and not to leave any marks on my clothes!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant for free to test and review from BzzAgent and Secret. I am in love with this deodorant. I love the Secret brand. I like that it&#x27;s a clear gel. It has 48 hour odor protection. So no more wondering is my deodorant going to wear off during the day.</li>
    <li> Nothing kept me fresh on the go as Secret outlast did! I have use various deodorants and non have proved to be as good as Secret outlast. With a smooth gel like no residue technology it keeps you fresh on the go for hours!</li>
    <li> I have never used gel deodorant before . I love this . It really last all day . It has been really hot in lowa . And it lasted all day ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recently switched deodorants to Secret Clinical Protection, because nothing seemed to work for me in the summer heat. Trouble is, they recommend putting it on at night, and for some reason, it&#x27;s often difficult for me to remember to put it on before bed! So one morning after I&#x27;d forgotten, I decided to try out my Secret Outlast Clear Gel sample, which I got for free to try through BzzAgent. I was honestly expecting to be a sweaty mess, but I totally forgot I was wearing a different deodorant until the end of the day when I thought about how dry I was! The clinical protection is a little stronger, and therefore works a bit better, but I&#x27;d say the Outlast Clear Gel definitely works better than other non-clinical deodorants. I also like that the gel doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes -- but still be careful, as the gel seems to leave oily-like stains if you get it directly on some fabric. But overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent to try and review from BzzAgent. I was skeptical of how well it would work because I have tried clear gels in the past, and they don&#x27;t work well for odor. I sweat a lot and get body odor easily, so it&#x27;s hard to find deodorant that actually works. I have used the Secret Outlast a few times, and it worked better than expected. It goes on clear, dries quickly and has a nice, fresh scent. It definitely doesn&#x27;t work 48 hours like they boast, but it got me through the day without stinking.</li>
    <li> I tried this deoderant free through a Bzzagent campaign and fell in love. It goes on so smooth and dries quickly with very little residue. True to advertisement it&#x27;s still working the next day, so even if you forget to reapply, you&#x27;re still covered. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Secret Outlast. I actually purchased the full size because I loved my sample so much!</li>
    <li> I love Secret deodorants! I got a free sample from bzzagent. I put on my Secret Outlast deodorant for a baseball game when we were under a heat advisory and when I got home I still smelt good! I did have a black shirt on and it didn&#x27;t have any white marks on it!! I will always use Secret deodorants!</li>
    <li> I received a very small sample of Secret Outlast for free from a Bzzagent campaign. The deodorant does last while staying active, which is a great benefit. The biggest downfalls I had were that it feels very wet on the underarms after applying and the smell is something else. It smells of lightly scented rubbing alcohol and is a very rough smell to get past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred dry solid deodorants/antiperspirant. I was skeptical about trying Secret Outlast Gel Deodorant/Antiperspirant for this reason. When I received a free sample through BzzAgent I was pleasantly surprised from the time I put it on until the time I went to bed. In the warm summer heat, it was a refreshing feeling and the scent is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted through an almost 5 mile walk starting at 9 a.m. in July in Georgia, then through the rest of my day and night. I&#x27;ve definitely found my new deodorant/antiperspirant. I&#x27;m very loyal once I find a brand I like. Over the past 20+ years, I&#x27;ve only become extremely attached to two. In between those times, I was always on the hunt for my go-to deodorant/antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still puzzled by the fact that I actually LOVE this gel. I can quite pinpoint what it is, though the cool, fresh feeling and scent are one of the first things that struck me. If you&#x27;re not a fan of gel deodorant/antiperspirant, you might want to give it a try just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I try to use up the last of my invisible solids, I feel like I&#x27;m trying to rub two things together that weren&#x27;t meant to be, kinda like the feeling of two same sided magnets (positive to positive -- ya know how they repel each other).</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try from Buzzagent and honestly it&#x27;s not for me. I loved the smell and I loved that I could put this on and not worry if I had white deodorant streaks on my shirt but the smell didn&#x27;t last long. I can not stand body odor smell and I&#x27;m very conscious about it. If I am at home not doing much it will last all day and at the end of the day I can still smell the nice pretty smell of the deodorant. If I mow the yard or wear it to an amusement park and sweat more than usual I can start smelling the sweat more than the pretty smell. Which after I mow the yard I come straight in and shower no big deal but with other people at an amusement park you don&#x27;t want to have to carry your deodorant to reapply. All people are different so Secret Outlast might work amazing for them but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product as part of a product review.  During the summer time I am always conscious about how I smell... especially on those super hot days!  I am also very conscious about finding deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave any marks.  I LOVE secret outlast clear gel.  It lasts soooo long and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks.  I really liked the gentle clean smell.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t love is it takes a little for it to dry and a couple times it left my shirt feeling a little damp after I put it on.</li>
    <li> I only use this in the morning and I don&#x27;t have to worry about armpit sweat marks or odor. I usually get that embarrassing sweat marks on my gray and black t-shirts but not after I use Secret Outlast! Gives me confidence specially on Summertime! I got this product free from BzzAgent in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I was trying the product for free thanks to Secret. It was part of a BzzCampaign but it was not all it promised. I&#x27;m usually not a gel deodorant kind of girl because I sweat.... A LOT! This was sticky and wet and did not curb my perspiration at all. I was disappointed because it advertised 48 wetness protection but that&#x27;s pretty hard when it doesn&#x27;t even dry? This is not a deodorant for athletes or aerobic enthusiasts because you will be left with embarrassing sweat stains even after a calm night on the town if your a sweater.... Disappointed much</li>
    <li> Very great product!!!  Im a bzzer (bzzagent so i got it free) and I really like it. Im normally not a gel person but this is great! I also love of you click out too much gel you can put it back in....even some stick deodorants cant do that!!!!! I will be buying more soon! Gotta be dry for this hot weather!</li>
    <li> I received a sample free of charge- my experience with Secret Outlast was great! Five stars! Let me tell you why...&lt;br /&gt;-Super clean &amp; clear!&lt;br /&gt;-lasts 12+ hours&lt;br /&gt;-price&lt;br /&gt;-amazing scent&lt;br /&gt;-keeps you dry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a strict user to my last brand for over 10 years, after trying Secret Outlast, I will now be changing my brand!&lt;br /&gt;I took my sample with me to Disney World, in the hot hot summer. (July)&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the dryness throughout the day! Give it a try! You will be amazed!</li>
    <li> I absolutely detest deodorants that clump up and leave white residue on my clothing. Secret Outlast Completely Clear didn&#x27;t do any of that. I was even able to change my shirt without white streaks on the new shirt. I may have received a sample from Secret but am in love with this deodorant and will definitely be purchasing!</li>
    <li> I was given Secret Outlast Clear Gel to review from BzzzAgent for free as part of a promotion thanks to Secret.  When I joined the campaign, I was not going to get my hopes up that I would be recieving a great or even good product.  I have to say I was certainly wrong.  This deodorant holds up wonderful.  It does what it says; it lasts.  I am usually a heavy sweater, and this worked well for me.  No, it isnt a clinical strength, but I wasnt drenched.  The scent lasts, and isnt too overpowering.  Just a nice light scent.  I really enjoy this one, and I plan on using it in the future.</li>
    <li> Not a product for me! ^Got it for free from BzzAgent, and I was excited to try it cause I love the Secret Clinical Streight deodorant but was not impress with their new product. It takes a while to dry on the skin... especially if its hot, it has a pleasent deodorant scent but I did not like that I could smell this scent myself, so definetily not my favorite product, but still continue to use another Secret product that I love. Just not for me may be.</li>
    <li> I got this item free as a sample from Secret as a buzzagent. I am so thankful for this free trial. It is the first deodorant that has worked all day and is truly clear. It left no marks on my clothing and worked all day long on the hottest, most active days!. Thanks Secret!</li>
    <li> This Secret Outlast Gel is the most amazing deodorant that I have ever used! I usually do not care for gel deodorant because I dislike the way that they make my underarms feel. I can get past that for the staying power that this one has! It goes on smooth and it easily lasts 2 days. It smells pretty decent too! AND....it didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my black tees which is important to me because they are nearly impossible to get out. I am extremely happy with this product and I plan on purchasing it again! I did received this product as a brand promotion but I was not compensated in any other way and all opinions are 100% my own!</li>
    <li> I was quite excited to receive Secret Outlast clear gel antiperspirant/deodorant to sample by BzzAgent, despite always having had terrible experiences with gel deodorant. They never seemed to absorb and left a sticky, wet mess under my arms and on my shirts. The very first thing I noticed about Secret Outlast was that it absorbed very quickly and left a nice dry finish. I received this one in the Oh-La-La Lavender scent, which smells absolutely amazing, and seems to last all day! I tested this out the evening of my Christmas party and was a little hesitant, with my black satin dress and all, but after 8 hours of partying, my dress was mark free, and I was odor and wetness free! This one is definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a deodorant that will not only work well but last a good amount of time. I work out every day and sweat like crazy, thus I need something that will be strong enough to fight the odor and wetness. This one definitely is strong enough to combat odor and sweat! Prior to this I have been using Fresh&#x27;s deodorant which has a more pleasant fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last. At the end of the day, a sniff test would reveal a slight odor. With Secret Outlast, I know I don&#x27;t need to do any sniff tests. I feel confident about its ability to work all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also admire its ability to dry so quickly. With the expensive clothes I wear, I definitely don&#x27;t want any residue causing stains. Additionally, it&#x27;s nice to not have a dry feeling rather quickly after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is how quickly it&#x27;s gone. After two weeks of use, a good 30% is gone. No other deodorant has gone that quickly from use. I think I may need to learn how to gauge it. I think a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel Antiperspirant for about a month now.  I have to say I am impressed.  Secret has not always been my favorite deodorant brand and I prefer a solid to a gel. I think solids tend to work better.  Of course the downside of a solid deodorant is the white streaks it can leave on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast has a nice scent.  It does smell clean and I like that its not too baby powder-smelling or flowery, which is something I associate with Secret deodorants in the past.  This smells nice and clean, but there is no lingering scent and you don&#x27;t smell the deodorant smell all day long.  This is a bonus because it doesn&#x27;t conflict with perfume or other scents you are wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodarant has a twist at the bottom that you move and teh gel pops out at the top.  I say pops out because I was literally splattered with gel the first few twists.  This is no longer happening but I caution users to be careful because it could fly into your eyes.  So, one conern is with the popping gel flying around.  Once you get past that issue, though, the deodorant is easy to apply.  You get a small amount with each twists and I end up using one twist per underarm. The gel is cool to teh touch and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing about deodorant is obviously how well it works.  I must say I am impressed with this product for its efficiency.  I don&#x27;t tend to get a strong body odor on a regular day, or do I perspire much on a regular day (I often skip deodorant), but do sweat alot when working out.  Plus, my workout clothes just stink!  So, I started using this before I go to the gym.  I still perspire (obviously) but have noticed a lot less odor.  I find this means this deodorant is working.  It has definitely limited the amount of odor. I have not found many other deodorants to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros I see for this product are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;-no white residue&lt;br /&gt;-the scent is clean smelling&lt;br /&gt;-the scent is not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;-it works to combat body odor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I had were the spurts of gel when I twist the tube, although this was only initially and it seems to have decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recieve this product for free through BzzAgent for the purpose of my review, although all opinons are my own.  I do recommend this product for others and I think they will be pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> The scent of the deodorant is really great! I tried this product as a promotion through BzzAgent. They send me free products to try. With that being said, I ordinarily do not use gel products because they feel too slimy. This was no acception. It dried eventually and did the job it said it would. I just prefer a solid.</li>
    <li> I received a free Secret Outlast deodorant from BzzAgent to try.  I like the Secret brand in general, especially the solids that leave no marks.  I was unsure about using a gel because it goes on so wet, however, this is the fastest drying gel I have EVER used. It smells very fresh and feels dry and clean all day.  It&#x27;s really remarkable.  I can swipe it on in the vanity area and walk over to the closet.  by the time I grab a bra and shirt, it&#x27;s dry.  So I can throw my top on right away when I am in a hurry to get dressed. And I have not seen any residue or white marks on any item of clothing since I&#x27;ve tried this deodorant.  Not quite a 5 star product, because it does not provide 100% odor protection.  If it did, I would buy this deodorant exclusively forever!</li>
    <li> Received this sample Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant from BzzAgent. Had been using them without any regrets! It is so easy to apply and I need not worry about it staining my shirts unlike the other deodorants which I had used. It dries up fast and it is awesome. It kept me feeling dry and fresh all throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Seriously impressed!  I have tried many different brands of deodorant, and never felt as satisfied as i have been with Secret Outlast.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothing.  Not only can you expect to stay dry but fresh too!  I was given this product to try for free, now I will be a faithful user.</li>
    <li> I got this item to try through BzzAgent, and I am happy to leave a glowing review:&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel goes on clear and dries super fast without any sticky residue (like gels of the past). There is no white mess on your clothes. The scent is crisp and slightly musky, very pleasant but not overly perfume-y. Most importantly, the odor protection is long lasting, and I actually notice I sweat less with continued use.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel from bzzagent for free to try. I have never tried a gel deodorant before because I always thought they would go on wet and leave me feeling stuck to my shirt or that I had started to sweat before I even did anything besides apply the product. The morning the mailman delivered my bzzagent package was good timing as I was going to go outside and rake leaves so I decided it would be the perfect time to give the product a try. My first reaction was the same reason I didn&#x27;t want to try a gel, wetness, and I was instantly sad to feel it and uncomfortable. To my surprise though, I was relieved to find that soon after that I was dry under my arms as everything has dried quickly! By the time I put my arm down, it was completely dry and no icky feeling under my arm. That was super nice! The scent is a clean just showered type scent, not over powering at all and did not make me sneeze like normal scents do, I have to say the Secret deodorant kept me dry the entire time and I didn&#x27;t sweat a bit while raking up my leaves for a few hours. The only downside is, I also didn&#x27;t smell like that fresh clean shower any more either, I just didn&#x27;t smell like anything. If I had to pick though, I&#x27;d rather have no scent than one I couldn&#x27;t stand to breath in on my own self.</li>
    <li> I had an opportunity to try Secret Outlast for free as a promotion from the brand and part of BzzAgent - Secret Outlast is a fantastic product!  It goes on effortlessly as a smooth, cool gel....there is no wetness on clothes and no white marks either.  I have used Secret in the past and this new product goes above and beyond.  The clean scent is nice, crisp and refreshing - and not to flowery or overbearing.  This product is one you can trust and is a keeper for me- I will be cool, dry and sweet smelling from now on :)</li>
    <li> Although I have been a fan of Secret for years, I had never used their completely clear gel.  But thanks to BzzAgent and my free sample from Secret, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is now my everyday deodorant.  This new gel is fast drying, it literally drys in seconds, and I love the texture of the gel.  Not only does It keep you feeling and smelling clean and fresh, but it does it with 48 hours of odor protection (my number one requirement).  Then, if that&#x27;s not enough, no more white marks on your clothes ladies, that priceless!</li>
    <li> There is honestly nothing better than an antiperspirant that does as it advertises (stops wetness) and doesn&#x27;t leave behind unsightly residue on clothing.  Secret goes on smoothly, feels clean, and is fantastic in the summer (cooling).  It works like a charm and nobody even knows you are wearing it.  The scent is minimal and not offensive to those with sensitive noses.  It lasts all day without needing a touch up ;-)  I did receive this product as part of a promotion for the brand, but this is the brand/product I regularly purchase anyhow.</li>
    <li> Like someone else, i was a bit hesitant when trying this out through BzzAgent.  The memories of the sticky, gloopy goo had me very nervous.  But I have to tell you, not only does this smell amazing.....but the sticky goo only lasts for mere seconds!!  I can only shower every couple of days because of my skin. So, finding a good antiperspirant is imperative.    This kept me feeling fresh during and after my workouts, as well as smelling fresh.  Absolutely amazing. I have started purchasing this for me, and my daughter.  (And it didnt leave marks on my black silk shirt!!)</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this deodorant out through BzzAgent. I have never been a big gel deodorant kind of girl the consistency and how it felt on my skin seemed weird to me. I did however change my mind when I tried this out. The fact that it was marketed as 48hr protection had me a bit skeptical, I do exercise and my job can leave me running around like a chicken with it&#x27;s head cut off  so I did usually need to apply my deodorant twice a day to remain &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. Well happily I found out that I only need to use Secret Outlast once a day and i&#x27;m good to go. I also love the fact that I don&#x27;t have white residue left on my clothing, when you need to be out the door and your trying desperately to remove the marks that&#x27;s never fun. I will definitely be switching to Secret Outlast.</li>
    <li> After trying many different products over the years, Secret Outlast Clear Gel is by far the most effective and now my favorite. Just crank the pump at the bottom- enough of the gel comes through the small holes at the top to swipe the entire underarm area. The gel goes on smoothly, covers thoroughly with no sticky residue and dries very fast due to the slight amount of alcohol. I can get dressed soon after putting it on and never have to worry about smudging my clothing - even black silk t-shirts go on without a trace. The scent is pleasant and fresh, vaguely like baby powder, and not at all overpowering.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent....and I was pleasantly surprised! The last time I tried a clear gel I remember it leaving marks on my clothes if it wasn&#x27;t completely dry before dressing. Definitely not an issue with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel!  With this product you get the benefit of staying dry with the added bonus of Secret&#x27;s great smelling scents!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from Bzzagent to try out. I am very impressed!  I usually does like gel deodorant but this one works great. It goes on clear and has no white streaks on your clothes.  It lasts all day and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean is exactly what I would expect from the Secret brand. The product works as expected to prevent perspiration and odors. The scent is nice but not overpowering. Price is as expected also. The drawback is that the gel form package does not last as long as a solid would. The other thing that was a bit on the down side, was that the product may sting if using after shaving. It was not a horrible thing, but not something that I have ever experienced with a solid form of deodorant.    Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Secret brand. And it was a nice change.  I was lucky enough to have received this product as a promotional item to try through a Bzzcampaign.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is the only deodorant I have used that I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply throughout the day. At first I had a problem with it because it is cold, and took a while to dry. So I felt cold and wet for a few minutes while getting ready. But it kept me dry and odor-free so I kept using it. I realized if I spend a few extra seconds to rub it into my skin, I do not have the cold and wet issue. Now I love it!! I don&#x27;t have to carry deodorant with me anymore because it really does last all day! Also, I do not have to worry about any white marks on my clothes anymore. Even the solids that are supposed to turn clear always leave white marks.  I did receive this product to try through BzzAgent.com.</li>
    <li> I have never been a big fan of gel deodorants, I always felt like they wouldn&#x27;t be as effective and they would leave wet marks on my clothes. This deodorant I received as a bzzagent has made me change my mind. Not only does it dry super fast but it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling during the day. My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t last the 48 hours for me as it states it does but it is definitely a good product for the money and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark shirts which is a plus for me!!</li>
    <li> no white marks and a fresh smell - received it as part of a free Buzzkit.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent and I&#x27;m glad I did!  I used to hate using gel antiperspirant and have avoided it for 20 years.  But Secret Outlast worked so well, I&#x27;m now a convert!  I spend all summer in black tank tops and every time I&#x27;d put one on, I&#x27;d have to be really careful or I&#x27;d get white marks from my antiperspirant.  Inevitably I would end up getting some on my tank, no matter how hard I tried, so out would come the wash cloths to try and get it off.  Now I no longer have to worry about it!  Another thing I loved was how long it lasted, and how I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the last little bit of the antiperspirant block falling off.</li>
    <li> I was provided with a sample to try. These opinions are completely my own.....I am always looking for a deodorant that keeps me dry and odor free without leaving whitemarks on my clothes.  This Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel did the trick.  It goes on clear and dries clear and fast.  No more white marks on my clothes!!  Secret suggests using 2 clicks and then applying the product.  I recommend doing only the 2 clicks, not more.  I found that if I did more than 2 clicks, the deodorant would clump and then those clumps would leave white marks on my clothes, not to mention looking unsightly when wearing a sleeveless top.  This is a case where less is more.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the real deal!!!  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, does exactly what it claims.  I work in the medical field and wear black scrubs every day.  Before trying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel I had to shower put on my deodorant and walk around the bathroom with my arms up to allow the deodorant time to dry.  The days that I was on a hurry, i would have to wear my black uniform with the &amp;#34;zebra stripe marks&amp;#34; down the side...hate it!  In addition to the fast drying formula, the scnet is very mild, i do not care for over-powering deodorant scents.  But most importantly is the protection it offers.  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, goes on all day, nothing but dryness, some other products require a re-application during the day.</li>
    <li> Secret is the best by far.  I have been using Secret products for years.  I am  true to the brand.  I love the new outlast completely clean clear gel it goes on smooth and clean.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about those ugly white marks under my arms so I can wear those sexy sleeveless blouses and dresses without been self conscious.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 48 hour protection but it does actually work.  This was sent for review purposes by the brand.</li>
    <li> I have always been a Secret girl so when BzzAgent offered me the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel I was excited. Honestly, I thought ..how can you improve on perfection..well, they did. The scent is really fresh, not perfumey at all and the quick drying gel allows me to get dressed immediately after application which is especially nice on cold Vermont mornings.The only issue I have with this product is the claim of 48 hour protection. I don&#x27;t think I personally could go more than 24 hours with out using antipersperant..it just wouldn&#x27;t feel right. Sercret Clear Gel definitely takes me through the work day &amp; then out for a night on the town without worry of stains or odor..it&#x27;s a great product, one I&#x27;ll be using for years to come</li>
    <li> For years I have dealt with pretty bad perspiration. I will perspire within 1 hour of applying deodorants. Even &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; ones do nothing for me but make me smell funky. I thought I would give it a shot when asked to try Secret Outlast for free, I figured &amp;#34;what do I have to lose? It will probably just be another deodorant that wont work?&amp;#34; OMG was I wrong. I decided to give it a week before giving a review. Day One I was so impressed. It was the first time in years that I didn&#x27;t have to apply a 2nd &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; of deodorant and I am not even joking when I say I keep a deodorant stick in my top drawer at work and apply it in my office by the afternoon. Since then, it has been my go to deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample as part of a promotion from Secret Outlast and it actually worked. I usually don&#x27;t believe the claims a company makes about their products but this one actually worked. It had long lasting protection and dryness and did not leave a sticky feeling during the day. Secret Outlast also did not leave any marks and I dragged my dark t-shirt across it just to make sure, no stains no marks.</li>
    <li> Many deodorants give me a rash, so I was nervous trying a new antiperspirant. I got Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try for free from bzzagent.com. not only did it smell great and keep me feeling fresh, but I also didn&#x27;t get a single red bump! I love this deodorant and will not be switching to anything else. I recommend this product to anyone. I was also pregnant in the summer while testing it, and Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel kept me clean and dry. It goes on light and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with white marks.</li>
    <li> When I got the BzzCampaign to do this I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like it due to the fact its a clear gel. Well the reason it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is the fact its a gel and while I&#x27;m not use to it, the wet feel is weird but it does its job and keeps me feeling fresh and smells great too. It is invisible which is nice to have when you are in a hurry or wear dark clothes. I would buy this again for sure and hope that I can get over the initial wet feel as it is applied lol</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from BzzAgent and have absolutely loved it.  It really does keep me dry all day and has a clean, refreshing scent.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing either.  It has surpassed my go-to Secret aerosol deodorant as my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for a couple of days and wanted to give the best review possible.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:-&lt;br /&gt;1. Does exactly what is says...it goes on clear and more importantly it stays clear...NO WHITE MARKS!! None! I have ruined one too many blouses over this.&lt;br /&gt;2. Washes off completely clean. In the past I had issues with other Secret products where after a shower under my arms would have this sticky residue, but with the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel I am thoroughly satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;3. Keeps you dry! I wore this on an extremely hot day when I visited the Caribbean recently and I stayed dry all day long! Incredible!!! I thought it was a fluke but after a strenuous workout I was not completely dry but significantly dryer than if I used another brand. Great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this product is the Active ingredient Aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex. WOW! That&#x27;s a mouth full. Not too keen on this ingredient, I try to stay away from it because a couple of friends of mine have said that it causes their underarm to get dark.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I will give it the thumbs up because it does what it says!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bzzagent for giving me this product for testing and reviewing purposes!!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free from BzzAgent and I was impressed. Secret Outlast Deodorant lasted all day long even in the hottest conditions. It dried quickly and didn&#x27;t leave any white marks like some other brands of gel deodorant. I did not really care for the scent though. It was not a bad scent other people liked it. I just really like the lavender scent that Secret makes.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. I had been using a clear solid and was a slightly skeptical about trying this. It has given me the level of protection and dryness that I wanted and stays on all day. There is no residue whatsoever, which is great, and I think you get a lot of use out of the product.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent,  I got this Secret Outlast for free to try out. I&#x27;ve never been able to use any type of deodorant except for clinical strength, so I was so happy when I used it for the first time and found out it really did provide 48hr odor and wetness protection as well as not leaving any white marks#clearlybetter</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free thanks to BzzAgent&lt;br /&gt;This particular Secret goes on very smooth, there is no burn even after you have just shaved. It is moisturizing but not to the point where your amrpits feel greasy...not like you just put lotion on. It does not give the feel of greasiness at all, ever, but you don&#x27;t get dry and itchy like with so many other antiperspirant/deodorants. I absolutely love it! Oh, and the smell is very subtle...it won&#x27;t clash with your perfume! And, it does keep you completely dry and odor free for 48 hours...I don&#x27;t normally go a day without but wanted to test it... it worked!</li>
    <li> I used this deodorant while in labor. Even though I was sweating and working hard, I had no issues with wetness or odor. That sealed it for me! I&#x27;m a Secret Outlast Clear Gel girl!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast, as part of a BZZZAgent Campaign.  I traditionally use solid deodorants, but was up for trying something new.  For daily protection, I would definitely recommend this product.  The scent is pleasant and not overpowering, and it lasts throughout a traditional work day.  I am not so much a fan of the gel overall, as it is more messy than a solid, and harder to control application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as longer-lasting protection, and coverage for an active day, I wasn&#x27;t as positive about the product.  Even after re-applying before an evening exercise class, I found myself doubting the coverage mid-way through.  I don&#x27;t believe I will continue to use the product to cover while exercising.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be a fan of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant, but I am!  It goes on clear and you don&#x27;t have white marks on your clothing!  I just don&#x27;t like the feeling of it under my arms when I put it on and it&#x27;s still drying (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s only 4 stars).  Great protection throughout the entire day!  Please note, I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update - Secret sent me a second Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant and I&#x27;m even happier now!  My laundry doesn&#x27;t have the white mark issues.  So this means no pretreating the pits of my shirts. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was given Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try as part of a Bzz Campaign. I have been using it now well over a month and have to say I am really impressed with how well it has done the things it claims it will do.  It goes on easily and dries quickly.  There are no stains on your clothes which often happens with solids.  I feel fresh and clean all day long and well into the night.  I have not yet tried using it for 48 hrs. without reapplying but perhaps will on a weekend.  I just always feel I need to reapply a deodorant after showering.  On the whole though I highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a great antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant for free, courtesy of BzzAgent, and I must admit, I was very impressed!  I was never really a fan of the gel deodorants I had tried in the past, as I found them to be sticky &amp; \\&quot;gooey\\&quot;, but this product completely changed my perception of a gel.  First of all, it&#x27;s formulated with fast drying ingredients, &amp; it evaporates  within seconds of applying it.  No more waiting for your deodorant to dry before getting dressed!  It also has a clean, fresh scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering, plus it doesn&#x27;t leave behind any tell-tale white deodorant marks on your clothing.  Of course, the most important question when it comes to deodorant is \\&quot;does it work?\\&quot; Indeed it does!  It promises to minimize odor-causing bacteria for up to 48 hours, and I can definitely say I&#x27;ve put it to the test.  It&#x27;s stood up to my workouts, marathon cleaning sessions, &amp; just busy days in general.  If you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant that works as hard as you do, I&#x27;d recommend giving this product a try!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Not only do I not get the white marks on everything because it is a clear gel, but it keeps me super dry!  I live in a hot climate and tend to sweat a LOT!!  Since trying this out (I received from Bzzagent) I no longer get the sweaty underarms and wet t shirts.  The scent is very pleasant as well, not overpowering at all like the baby powder scent.</li>
    <li> I give it a 3 because under normal temperatures and circumstances it keeps you dry and leaves no white marks on my clothes. First let me say #gotitfree for a product trial. I loved that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks or a build up on my clothes after wearing it. The down falls for me were that the smell was too strong for me - it took a while to get used to. I usually pick something that has a lighter smell and I&#x27;m not used to wondering where that perfume smell is coming from and then realizing oh it&#x27;s coming from me. And the other thing that was a downfall was that it didn&#x27;t keep me dry. We had at least one day where it was warmer than our normal fall temperatures and I noticed that I was still wet under my arms. That was a pretty big negative for me.</li>
    <li> I was given this to review by Bzz Agent Juno and I was excited since I HATE white marks on my clothes...once I got the product I tried it and I HATED the way it felt once I put it on.  Very slimy and sticky.  It did dry, but it never had the odor protection of my current deodorant.  I will be sticking with my stick kind and will just be more careful putting my clothes on</li>
    <li> I thought I would never give up Dove. It&#x27;s inexpensive, it works, and it&#x27;s all soft and fun, right?    It&#x27;s so strange to talk about deodorant, but man, I really love Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to be used up much faster than my solid bar. However. I switched back to my Dove for a couple of days, and within a few hours, I was embarrassed to lift my arms. I do not have that problem at all with the Secret. It really does last, which makes it invaluable. I think I may have to switch.    In fact, I have pretty much decided to switch. It&#x27;s just so much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.  I don&#x27;t know what you did, Secret, because I don&#x27;t remember liking you this much before.  But I really like you now.    Disclaimer:  I got this product for free to try as part of a product review panel. I still like it so much I&#x27;m going to pay money for it.</li>
    <li> When I first checked the reviews a few weeks ago there were hardly any.  But, many BzzAgents have been here and now I am adding my two cents as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a #GotItFree sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Antiperspirant a few weeks back.  I currently use the Secret Brand so, it is something i already trust.  I don&#x27;t mind the &amp;#34;cool jolt&amp;#34; some have mentioned.  I don&#x27;t even notice the scent.  For me it is very light.  The protection however, is very strong.  I do not worry about odor or wet marks at all with Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I #GotACoupon to share and I have passed most out to those who wanted to try this product.  I used one for myself and my daughter.  She is also pleased with Secret Outlast. She especially likes the fact that the scent is light.  She exercises more strenuously than I do as she has PE Classes at school during the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I received a full-size sample of this deodorant free from BzzAgent to review. I&#x27;ve always had an aversion to gel deodorants. I&#x27;ve never tried them because they just didn&#x27;t appeal to me. I&#x27;ve always been a user of invisible solid deodorants of various brands, but all of them still leave some sort of white marks. They provide good protection, but the amount of white marks left behind are still bothersome. Always willing to try a new product though, I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;  Upon applying the deodorant, I noticed it felt sticky and wasn&#x27;t fast drying. The stickiness lingered for several minutes. According to the product information &amp;#34;all it takes is one twist and two swipes right out of the shower.&amp;#34; About a third of the time I used it, it took me several clicks for the deodorant to dispense and often times more than the needed amount came out. After that immediate downfall, I was impressed that the &amp;#34;clean scent&amp;#34; smell of the deodorant was pleasing. It wasn&#x27;t too overpowering or barely noticeable. The scent was just right. The next thing I noticed was it didn&#x27;t leave any white marks. I was pleasantly surprised by this as even the best invisible solid sticks I&#x27;ve tried still left behind some white residue. Not so with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. It lived up to its name.&lt;br /&gt;  This deodorant also held true to providing 48 hour protection. I tend to sweat a lot and through stressful days, workouts, and even normal, everyday activities, this deodorant held up against my active on-the-go lifestyle. I didn&#x27;t need to reapply a couple times a day. Once and I&#x27;m done and good to go. No wetness worries for the day!&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I am very pleased with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. It lived up to providing 48 hour protection. No odors, no white marks, and pleasantly scented. The only downside for me was it&#x27;s not as fast drying as I would like and it doesn&#x27;t always dispense well when clicked. Otherwise, agreat product that I would buy myself and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have been given this product for free to try as part of a promotion from Secret!!  I have found this product to help keep me dryer and smelling fresher all day long.  I have the confidence that I won&#x27;t have to worry about being embarrassed by those sweat rings that have appeared after childbirth has altered my PH Levels!  Thank you Secret for allowing me to try this product for FREE!  I will purchase this in place of my regular deodorant from now on!</li>
    <li> I have recently had the pleasure of using Secret outlast thanks to #bzzagent and I ama very satisfired with the product...i work out at least three times a week and i need something that will help me cause im a heavier woman and this is perfect...keeps me dry , and i fell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree&lt;br /&gt;#bzzagent</li>
    <li> Amazing! I usually don&#x27;t buy into the hype that deodorant companies put out there but this, really worked! Spent all day outside in the hot sun doing some fall landscaping and this kept me dry and didn&#x27;t leave any stains on my shirt! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean and Clear from Bzzagent.  At first I was concerned.  I have been a loyal customer to a particular deodorant for over ten years.  I always purchased the same one.  I can remember being a teenager and struggling to find the right deodorant for me.  I tried solids, gels, roll on, and spray.  However nothing worked to control odor.  Even my faithful go to, that I have been using wore off.  I found myself reapplying deodorant through out the day.  I gave Secret Outlast a try.  I already knew that I needed to let it dry, so I tried it on my day off.  I was thinking, if I start smelling, I will be at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were amazing.  I followed my normal day off routine of housework, dinner making, and children&#x27;s taxi service.  At the end of the night, I smelled just as great as I did after my shower.  The real test was trying on a day I went to work.  I work for a big box store, so I am all over the place.  I threw my old trusted deodorant in my bag.  Turned out I did not need it.  After a full eight hours of sweating it, I was still smelling presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest bonus of all, I was using less deodorant.  I got to skip all of the extra applications!  I immediately feel in love.  As time went on, I even discovered that I had less sweat stains on my clothes.  You know he wonderful yellowing in the armpits of your shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Completely Clean and Clear is now my new goto deodorant!  I am recommending this deodorant to everyone!  It is worth the few extra minutes of drying time.  I have found myself  saving time and money with this product.  Also, the added confidence of not smelling horrible!  I will definitely be purchasing this product!&lt;br /&gt;#sponsored #SecretOutlast</li>
    <li> First off, I gotta say, Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean smells AMAZING. Love that. It&#x27;s still very hot here in Florida and I spent the day shopping, A lot. Lifting and toting things around all day. I stayed very dry and smelled fresh. Also to my surprise, there were no white marks on my black dress. YaY. I am a heavy sweater and have been buying the very expensive &#x27;Clinical&#x27; deodorants but now I am switching to the Secret Outlast! A definite must try. I will be buying again and again. I got this item as a freebie / promotion through BzzAgent and they gave me coupons too! I am very happy they picked me to test it out!</li>
    <li> I love the new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel! It leaves no white marks or residue and has a pleasant subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t contridict my perfume or lotion! It honestly does work for about 48 hours, even though I apply deodorant everyday! I love the clean feeling it offers and it takes only seconds to dry so I don&#x27;t worry about feeling like I have to air dry my arm pits before I put my shirt on! Love this new product! #GotItFreeFromSecret</li>
    <li> I was not very optimistic when it came to the gel, i am a solid girl with white mark problems. after giving my free Secret Outlast Gel from a promotion a try I am here to say i am a changed woman!!!!! I love the gel! It drys fast and and leaves no marks!!!! not to mention the great smell!!!!!!!  #GotItFreefromSecret</li>
    <li> Got to try this stuff free as a promotion by the brand.  I went in expecting it not to work as most I try dont.  Well I was wrong.  It went on smooth and dried quickly.  To put it to the ultimate test, I put in on after I showered, then headed to the bike trails.  My daughter and I went mountain biking for several hours in 70 degree weather.  These were flat straight paved trails, these were hills, valleys, bumps, dirt and never once did my armpits sweat.  Now I did sweat in other areas, but my pits were dry.  I was very impressed with this stuff and will buy more.</li>
    <li> I love this Antiperspirant I normally would have never bought a gel because of past experiences, but I love the fact that this keeps me dry all day long and the smell does not diminish.  I have tried several other brands and types (dove, degree, certin dry, lady speed stick, clinical protection) and finally found one that really works for me.  Yes I am a bit of a Product Junkie but I believe in testing things out to make sure that it meets my needs. So if you are looking for something to keep you dry when you need to this is the one to go.  I glides on easily and dries instantly so no worries of the gel traveling all over your clothes or linens it immediately dries and gives you that 48 hour protection when you apply it.  Best applied after you shower. Enjoy!!!!</li>
    <li> The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel does a great job of keeping me dry. It is at least equal, and in some cases exceeded, other products I have used. The fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on clothes is fantastic! I have never used a clear product before so I have always had to check for white marks. My only dislike of this product was the application process. The instructions are to use 2-3 clicks. Sometimes 1 click is more than enough while other times it takes 3 clicks to get enough out. The package does not always release the same amount of product per click. I do not usually use gel products but this product did dry very quickly after applying. However it does feel very wet and cold until it dries. I took off one star for the issues with application I have mentioned. Overall I am impressed with the performance of this product. I will continue to use it and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to test this product for free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m just blown away with this deodorant! I got to test it for free for my BzzAgent campaign and from the start I was impressed with its effectiveness! It claims to keep you 48h odor free with two swipes after the shower and boy, it did! It kept me dry and odor free the whole day, from all day at work to my gym workout, it delivered as promised! One of the best things about it is that it&#x27;s white mark free and it does,t ruin my clothes, which is a big plus! I love the clean scent and the texture of it is just amazing! I would recommend it to everyone on the go, with a hectic day schedule like mine! Best deodorant out there!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is reliable and truly clear. Protects well against odor and keeps me dry. I can put a shirt on quickly after applying without worrying about white marks.  Didn&#x27;t feel it in my armpits throughout the day. Went on smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to apply the right amount. I received it free from secret and bzzagent and will buy it next time.</li>
    <li> I already purchase Secret deodorant but usually the solid stick form. I tend not to buy the clear gels because of the wet feeling that they leave behind. I was pleasantly surprised by this Clear Gel. It goes on clear, dries fast so no more wet feeling, smells great and really keeps me feeling fresh and clean all day. I love that it goes on clear and leaves no white marks and dries fast.It worked great for me through the holidays especially while being in a hot kitchen all day. It left me feeling confident and clean.The protection this Deodorant provides outlasts my day. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorites now! I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel from Secret in return of my review.</li>
    <li> I receive this from Secret to try.  I loved that it didn&#x27;t leave a white mess all over my shirt like my other &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; deodorant.  It smelled wonderful and dried pretty quickly.  It kept me odor free and dry all day.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as a sample for a trial and I must say it works great, not to mention it has a clean fresh sent and goes on clean and clear not messing up your tops. I love it and would definitely purchase it.</li>
    <li> Love this Secret Outlast.  Goes on smooth, has a great smell, NO WHITE MARKS on my arms or my clothes!  Isn&#x27;t too thick, but coats very well you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  Dries super fast and kept me fresh and odor free all day.  Much better than my current brand.  got it free to try.  This is one Secret I don&#x27;t mind sharing!</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Secret Outlast Clean Scent from BzzAgent to try and give an honest opinion. I must say I love the clear gel. It goes on smoothly and easily covers my entire underarm. I haven&#x27;t yet been able to find a woman&#x27;s deodorant that truly left NO marks on my clothes and now I have. When I first tired Secret Clear Gel, I wore a dark blue clingy top. I put on my top immediately after applying Secret Clear Gel and there were no marks or stains what-so-ever! I was very happy. I also find the scent to be nice, yet not overpowering. I&#x27;m a mom involved with many school and church  activities. I am constantly on the go and even on m busiest days of house cleaning and various activities I find Secret Clear Gel to keep my dry all day. Even during hot flashes when I break out into a cold sweat, Secret Clear Gel keeps me and my clothes dry. I will continue to use Secret Clear Gel after my sample is finished.</li>
    <li> I received this one from bzzagent..  I tried it..  It s so much better than white..  Sometime when you used white, you can see it on shirt..  or mess up shirt.. Clear, You cannot see it.. and it helped me a lot...  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received a free full size Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that I am a huge fan of Secret. I have been using it for over 25 years. However, I have never been a real fan of gel deodorant. I didn&#x27;t like how it always felt so cold when applying it and how it seemed to take forever to dry. Furthermore, it seemed to be sticky which made my armpits feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant claims to keep you odor and dry free for up to 48 hours. I will say that I shower daily so I can attest to the 48 hour claim but it did keep me odor and dry free between showers. Overall, I like this product but it still is shockingly cold when I first apply it in the morning. Furthermore, at times the gel does not come out evenly when turning the dial which I found to be problem some. I will say that it isn&#x27;t sticky like other gel deodorants which is a plus in my book. It also doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes which is great. Overall the product works great but I think I will stick to my solid deodorant in the future. I just can&#x27;t get over how cold it is.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I feel like I have to reapply deodorant in the middle of the day just to stay fresh. I started using Secret clear gel and I didn&#x27;t feel that way. I felt fresh all day. I also like that I don&#x27;t get the white residue on my shirt. I will be buying this again</li>
    <li> Love the Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel! Protects all day, while keeping you dry against rough conditions. Goes on clear so you don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks. I can honestly say I have never been comfortable with Gel deoderant due to the fact of it feeling wet as you are applying it, but I am completely satisfied with the overall daily dryness of this product. Will be sure to buy in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GOT THIS ITEM FOR FREE AS A PRODUCT REVIEW FROM:&lt;br /&gt;HTTP://WWW.BZZAGENT.COM!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO RECEIVED A COUPLE $1.00 OFF COUPONS TO HAND OUT TO FRIENDS ALONG WITH MY FREE DEODERANT IN MY BZZ KIT!!</li>
    <li> From morning til night, I felt fresh and clean with this deodorant.  Even thought it&#x27;s a gel, it dried within seconds, just like the claims.  I was able to #tryitfree courtesy of #bzzagent. Being a busy mom always on the go, this deodorant fits my lifestyle keeping me dry in the most important moments of my day!</li>
    <li> lasting effect with sweet smell. leave no mark on your white shirts!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this. So far, it has lived up to its name. It goes on clear and smells amazing. It does give lasting all day protection, but I do not know if it protects for 48 hr as the company states.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant! I love it, it smells great, leaves no white marks and it lasts a long time! I would definitely recommend this deodorant to anyone that likes smelling clean and fresh because it smells really good and you can actually smell it as opposed to most that you can&#x27;t when you put it on! I got this free to try with coupons and I&#x27;m glad I was able to try it because I will be using Secret from now on! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> The secret is out! I was a bit skeptical in the beginning after receiving a sample from Bzzagent but no more. I have always been more of solid deodorant kind of person but his gel is becoming my new favorite! First of all, I love the smell of this deodorant. It&#x27;s not too overpowering and it does not compete with my perfume. It made me feel clean and the smell was not too strong. It goes on a bit sticky but it takes a minute for it to dry. I had no problem with white marks or residue. A big plus for me is the container allows me to dispense the right amount I want to use. I tested it for a whole day and had no problems with odor or freshness. I will be purchasing this again!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Not as sticky and slimy. Goes on smoothly and leaves no marks.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Keeps me dry and fresh without any embarrassing white marks.  Definitely will buy in the future.</li>
    <li> I recently got to try Secret Outlast through BzzAgent for free! I was so excited to be able to try a new product, and one I use everyday. True to its word Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel dried clear and within seconds of application. It kept me dry as it said it would, but the buck stops there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy RN and run from the time I hit the floor until well past my shift ends. I&#x27;ve often times got engagements after work and always have babes to take care of. While I was impressed with the speed the gel dried i was quite unimpressed with the smell emanating from my underarms  just 2 hours into my shift. I finally went to the restroom, washed, and reapplied the deodorant. Same thing. 2 hours later! I need something I can put on and forget about, Secret Outlast completely Clean Clear Gel promises to work for 48 hrs, I would&#x27;ve been happy with 12!</li>
    <li> This product leaves you feeling fresh all day and night. I love the line of scents and I would recommend secret to every woman I know. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use the gel deoderants because it took forever to dry and felt sticky all day,plus burning after shaving under your arms. But was invited to work on the campain for the Secret Outlast Completly Clean scent Womans clear Antiperspirant. I was really amazed that when I put it on after shaving there was no burning, and as I rolled the deoderant under my arms I could feel it drying so much faster than the other gel deoderants I had tried in the future. No the real test was it going to be sticky all day and was it going to work all day and I am pleased to annouce that it did all of the above. Thank you Secret for a great product. #GotitFree</li>
    <li> Normally I use Secret Deodorant Spray. Recently I was given Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to try out from BzzAgent and Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy. Drys quickly. Does not leave marks on my clothing. I do not have balled up pieces of deodorant that fall off everywhere when I go about my business. I also don&#x27;t feel like I have build up in my arm pits the next day when I shower. Best of all the product works! It has a nice scent and keeps me stink free as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to join the campaign for Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Gel. I have been a loyal Secret user for years and was happy to create buzz around a product I believe in. Although, I do not use Secret exclusive, it is my primary deodorant because I can always count on the ultimate protection.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have other Secret products, this is the first time I am using the Secret Outlast® but it will not be the last. I have already bought two more Secret Outlast because I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;When you remove the cover there is a protective seal, I appreciate that the product team thought of that detail to make sure the gel did not spill in to the cover. Once the cover and seal is removed, I loved the fresh clean fragrance. I need a strong deodorant and antiperspirant and I was impressed with the wetness protection and the fast drying action of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Gel. Secret Outlast was better than I expected there were no deodorant residue or white marks on my clothes. I have been buzzing about the product and will continue to spread the word long after the campaign has ended.</li>
    <li> just received this in the mail from SECRET &amp; from the first click &amp; two swipes I new it was an amazing product! I love the 48 hour guarantee of freshness &amp; dryness along with the fresh scent!  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel  is my new BFF!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. I&#x27;m a BzzAgent. I got a free full-size sample as a promotion for the brand and I&#x27;ve been trying the product out, testing it. I wore it for 48 hours only taking a shower the first day in the morning. It passed--kept me completely dry and odor-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it when I went to the gym to work out and it held up very well; And I&#x27;ve been wearing it daily. It hasn&#x27;t smeared onto my clothes or left any marks and it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like many deodorants. Secret is up there at the top on my list right next to Ban.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this item in the future, preferably in bulk.</li>
    <li> Loving this at frist I wasn&#x27;t sure about it being it&#x27;s a gel based thought it might be a goo mess but wasn&#x27;t dried fast and it&#x27;s Water-based formula allows active ingredients to permeate sweat glands faster and more efficiently than invisible solid deodorant. and I love that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with any white marks on my shirts so glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast to try and give my honest opinion for free from BzzAgent! I was quite hesitant at first about all the claims that this deodorant makes because I have never used a deodorant that lived up to any of these claims.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that every single claim is completely true, it dries super quick, it lasts extra long and it leaves NO white marks!!  I am loving this deodorant so much and so happy that it truly works!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret outlast for 1 week now and I love it. Normally I&#x27;m opposed to the gel feeling. Outlast is great. It evaporated fast and did not leave any marks on clothes and I still smelled good after 12hrs of work without having to reapply. I did receive this product free from BzzAgents.com, but I 100% plan to buy in the future and recommend you try it too!</li>
    <li> keeps you dry but there is one downside .the scent is very alcohol smelling ,burns if you have just shaved your under arms and kinda of smells like hair spray all day . I will say that it keeps me super dry which is a good thing.I gave it 3 stars for the protection but I wouldn&#x27;t buy for myself because of the burning and smell .I got Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant for free to try out and review from @Secret .@BzzAgent sent it to me because im a BzzAgent</li>
    <li> Love Secret Outlast.  Goes on smooth, leaves no white marks and great protection.</li>
    <li> I have been trialing Secret on Bzzagent.com for free I do like this product scent is a little flowery for me but I do like the clear gel that dries very quickly without white residual on my clothes that other types leave. I have gone up to 3 days without reapplying and even though I work in a very warm environment I have not had wet or odorous armpits :)</li>
    <li> I received a free Secret Outlast Gel from BzzAgent in order to test the product. I&#x27;ve used regular Secret solid for years, and I&#x27;ve always felt that Secret offered great protection. I never tried the gels before, thinking they might not offer the same level of protection. Surprisingly, this did extremely well by me. I think it actually provided better protection and kept me dry through a 48 hour time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You click and swipe, which is nice and convenient. You do have to wait a minute for it to dry before putting on clothes, but I don&#x27;t see that as an issue. I get out of the shower, towel off, put this on and then go about fiddling with my hair. I did a big test with it this weekend: I used it on Friday, but didn&#x27;t reapply on Saturday or Sunday, but still had no issues despite various temperature changes requiring clothing that was a bit too warm for part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like the scent because I don&#x27;t like a lot of the scents used in anti-antiperspirants, but I didn&#x27;t mind this one at all. It was clean-smelling and wasn&#x27;t overpowering. Would I buy this again? Yes, I would. I think it&#x27;s a great choice especially when wearing delicate clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: ease of use, the scent, the long-lasting protection, it doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes, there&#x27;s no staining, and no pilling of excess antiperspirant on the skin like there can be with solids. It doesn&#x27;t sting after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: works out more expensive than solids because it gets used up pretty quickly. Some people may not like the scent, but my advice is to try the unscented.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and I love it. The Secret Outlast Clear Gel applies smoothly and lasts for hours on end. I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying several times a day. It goes on completely clear so I can raise my hands without hesitation because I no I don&#x27;t have any white residue on my armpits. I would recommend this product to anyone it is easy and comes from a brand that I love and trust.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotional trial, but was disappointed, and probably would not purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;While it kept me bone dry, I noticed BO by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out for about 2 weeks, and found that if I reapplied half-way through the day, that I stayed fresh.  However, I ended up going through the product twice as quickly as my normal brand.</li>
    <li> I used to be a loyal Dove sustomer, but I think I  will have to change that. I got to try the new Secret Outlast clear gel and I LOVED it. It goes on clear and dries quickly. It smells great, and most importantly it really does last ALL day. I would highly recommend trying this product. I will be buying it!</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Secret as a BzzAgent and was really interested to try it out.  I normally buy invisible solid deodorant, but lately, have felt the need to reapply one or two times a day (depending on how hot it is where I&#x27;m at).  I have never regularly used a gel because the wetness always kind of made me uncomfortable.  This was hyped as a deodorant that dried in seconds.  I was hoping that this would be the case, but found that it actually takes at least several minutes to completely dry.  Once it has dried, though, the protection seems to last much longer than my solid deodorant.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it necessarily lasts the 48 hours that they claim, but it did last beyond 24.  I am definitely not sold on this particular scent, but noticed that there are other options of scents, as well as an unscented version.  All in all, trying this product has convinced me that a clear gel might be a better investment than the solids that I have to reapply multiple times a day to stay effectively dry.  I&#x27;m sure the results aren&#x27;t the same for everyone, but I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s worth the couple dollars to try it out, if you&#x27;re looking for a more effective solution.</li>
    <li> At first I totally hated this product, it seemed like my underarms were wet for hours after using it! And the smell was so overpowering. And then I realized the error of my ways, I was using way too much. The thing is, the first click doesn&#x27;t bring any up on my stick, so the second click makes a bunch come out, so I can&#x27;t fully turn it the second time, just let a tiny bit come up and then apply. A little really does go a long way with this product. If you do not over apply, you will notice that it actually does dry very quickly. The best part, I wear black undershirts to work and I&#x27;m tired of the white streaks on them. This product leaves no white streaks. I also don&#x27;t notice any odor coming from me at all while using the product (which is great for a deodorant, I mean, that is why we buy them right?). I love this product. I received a sample of this product for free (from bzzAgent and Secret) in return for my review. The opinions in this review are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Not just dependable, but definitely clear! I got to try this as a product promotion through BzzAgent, but I am hooked. I decided to use it for the first time as a representative at a trade show - all day on my feet, high stress with customers, and a hot room. I couldn&#x27;t believe that it dried almost instantly after application, didn&#x27;t irritate newly shaved armpits, and most importantly, lasted ALL DAY and NIGHT (out with clients) without fail. Never saw a spot, white or otherwise, on my clothing. Time to get a subscription through Amazon because I don&#x27;t think I can go back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> Secret Outast Completely Clean Clear Gel describes it&#x27;s self right on target. My first day I tried it was after taking a shower. The first day it did burn a little since I had just shaved. The following day I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to go back and put on some more like I usually do every morning with my previous deodarant. Once I changed clothes I noticed no resifue left behind on my Lycra exercise shirt. It lasted all day even after I exercised for 2 long hours. Lot of people express that they felt wet but I&#x27;m happy to say I didnt. I recommended to anyone that wants a long lasting fresh feeling without any foul odors. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have super sensitive skin. I received this as a BzzAgent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used gel deodorant before. It made me feel sticky, sweaty, and stinky so I went back to the solid white type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Secret gel, I find one click for both sides works well. It takes a while to dry but once it&#x27;s dry - you are ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I made the mistake of putting too much on the first time I used it and it sucked. I felt wet, sticky, and stinky. The next day, I only clicked it once and it was the perfect amount. It dried after about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked out, went to work, and went out with friends in a silk blouse that showed no signs of wetness. I felt clean and dry all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I wore black. When I got home? No weird stains in the underarm area. YESSSSSSS.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I noticed? My underarm didn&#x27;t feel irritated and dry like it does when I use solids. I bet in time this will make my armpit skin pretty again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine for free from BzzAgent. Im so glad I did because trying this really changed my mind.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to review/try from BzzAgent. I love the coverage and the scent of this product. For me it keeps me dry and smelling good all day. I do not like that the gel takes forever to dry. I have to put it on early in the morning and walk around like a strong man with my arms out to let it dry. But that isn&#x27;t enough to keep me from this deodorant.  I will buy another one when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this product at first, but decided to try it!  I must say it did dry fast and I felt protected all day!</li>
    <li> I am the lucky and proud mother of an already very active five month old baby.  I noticed after giving birth that my hormones had changed and I was starting to a) sweat more and b) smell more.  Neither one of those made me very happy!  I stuck with my usual deodorant, mainly because I didn&#x27;t have time to find another option!  When I went back to work and started to balance being a new mom with working, I found many days when I didn&#x27;t have time to eat, let alone shower.  No shower + new crazy hormones &#x3D; unpleasantness for everyone involved.  I was excited when I had the opportunity to try this product for free.  When I opened my package and saw &amp;#34;48 hours of protection&amp;#34; on my new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, I was hopeful, but doubted any deodorant could actually combat the sweat that comes with chasing a baby around the house for hours on end.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Not only do I find myself sweating less and certainly smelling better, but on those days when I need the extra hours of protection, I&#x27;m covered.  I like that the clear formula means I never have to worry about white marks (I have more than enough laundry on my hands these days) and I love that I don&#x27;t have to do the subtle pit check throughout the day--I know that my scent is fresh and clean.  My husband in particular seems very happy with this new scent, I&#x27;m sure he is happy to have his fragrant wife back (now if we could just work on getting rid of the poopy diaper smell).  I would highly recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to any woman who has an active lifestyle.  If you want to be able to swipe on your deodorant and not have to worry about your odor for the rest of the day, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I have tried a gel deodorant before and it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I was skeptical about trying this but I went ahead and did it. I was pleasantly surprised with the results! It lasted all day, I wasn&#x27;t feeling like I needed a refresh after a few hours, there were no marks on my clothes! The only downside is it did take a little longer to dry, but after all is said and done, I would definitely consider this product again in the future!</li>
    <li> I received the product through BzzAgent and was asked to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s asking a lot to be &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by a deoderant, so I think Secret Outlast is a good product for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;The Completely Clean scent is very fresh (almost alcohol like, but then settles in to a powdery scent).&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave any white marks, but it does take a few minutes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 2 weeks now and I like it. I still like solid deodorants better, I prefer the texture, but if you like gel deodorants then this would be a good one to try.</li>
    <li> I am testing Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel for free. To give a little history, I do have a bit of a sweating problem and some unpleasant B.O.which usually requires me to reapply my deodorant at least once or twice a day even though I ALWAYS buy a dedoroant with at least a 24 hour claim and I am fairly certain I have tried 48 hr deodorant as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not always buy the same brand but I do have one brand I have been fairly loyal two which is a men&#x27;s unscented roll on (I&#x27;m female).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Secret Outlast for 3 days. Honestly, I knew after the first day that I would be writing a very positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually decided to test the deodorant by using Secret only on one armpit and a &amp;#34;white stick&amp;#34;  deodorant on my other armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon applying the gel, the first thing I noticed was...the gel. It does NOT dry immediately. I do not use gel super frequently so I can&#x27;t really compare how fast it dried compared to how fast other deodorants dry but I did feel the gel on my armpit for a fairly long period of time after applying it and initially  this made me feel less positive towards the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I notice the scent which was not my favorite. I have a preference for unscented, vanilla or powder fresh  but this deodorant was so lightly scented that I was and am okay with it as it is not really very noticeable unless you are sniffing the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids probably thought I was gross but every few hours I &amp;#34;wiped&amp;#34; and sniffed my armpit. Gross, but what better way to test it? I was very, very surprised that after several hours the side with Secret on it was still smelling pleasant and still had a bit of the scent from the deodorant remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waitin 24 hours I reapplied the deodorant and decided it was time to put the 48 hour claim to the test.  I am going to have to say that the deodorant performed remarkably well, in my opinion. and especially compared to the product I used on my other armpit. After the first 24 hours I still had no yucky odor and no wet armpit mark on my clothes, although the fresh deodorant scent had clearly left.Basically it was a neutral smell under my armpit at the 24 hour mark with just a trace amount of the &amp;#34;Clean Scent&amp;#34; remaining.  I was able to leave the deodorant on  for about 36 hours but I had to stop the test there because I couldn&#x27;t take a shower without washing my armpits. At 36 hours my armpits didn&#x27;t smell beautiful but they were still dry and still not noticeably STINKY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test the claim that it did not leave a mark on clothes I used both the clear gel and a competing white stick deodorant and marked my black shirt intentionally. Secret Outlast does make a mark which is clear and slimy looking  but it is obviously less noticeable than the white stick. My only big concern is that after washing the shirt the mark from the white deodorant came out completely,  while the gel mark was lessened but actually left a visible mark on my shirt. I would accept that as a cost to the deodorant that works so much better than my man deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all,  I have to say that I AM very impressed with the completely clear odor and wetness protection provided by this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast complimentary to try it and I am giving my honest opinion of this product. Its a good product, but not great. I loved the scent of this deodorant and that it was clear and didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing. However, it wasn&#x27;t so effective for me ask I would like it to be. It didn&#x27;t have 48 hrs of protection. For me it was the most 6-7 hrs.</li>
    <li> I am a die-hard solid white Dove user.....but tried this because of a FREE promotion from Secret (I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand)......Soooooo, yeah, you&#x27;d think &amp;#34;oooh, yuck, clear equals sticky&amp;#34;. But this is SO not the way! Goes on smooth, dries quickly, and I am NOT afraid to wear a sleeveless shirt. No chalky armpits! GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I received a sample from bzzagent. Works great, lasts all day, and leaves nothing behind.  I left off a star because the scent is a little too strong for my taste although I am very sensitive to perfumes and other scents.</li>
    <li> I was selected to try Secret Outlast clear gel free from BzzAgent and I&#x27;m so glad I opted in.  I never would have bought the gel version because I thought it would be messy and slimy feeling under my arms.  Boy was I wrong!  It absorbed very quickly with no deodorant marks showing and kept me dry and smelling great all day long.  In the past I have had problems with sweating and have been a frequent user of clinical strength antiperspirants so I was also skeptical about how this would hold up to the stronger clinical versions and it has been great.....NO problems with sweating at all!  I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great.  It took couple days for the effects to kick it but it worked just as well as my clinical Mitchum oxy. Secret just smells better. I don&#x27;t like how the gel keeps coming out of the top but I suppose that is from the heat. Would recommend. FYI I got my free sample from Secret.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It is easy to go on and and I have not had any problems with it not working when I need it the most.  I workout everyday and I have used it and it is still stronger after a 30 minute workout.  I got this product to test and tell my opinion.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works really well. I have not used a gel antiperspirant before, but this one is amazing. It kept me from having any embarrassing sweat marks after the gym. Also, no body odor. I am thankful I got to try it for free, for being a BzzAgent. I will definitely continue to use this!</li>
    <li> Works great. I have always been a die hard solid deodorant fan and used the same brand for years! I was given this as a promotion from the company to try and give my opinion. It goes on smooth, dries fairly quickly and smells great. If it was a powder scent it would be even better!! ;)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample (full size) of Secret Outlast through Bzzagent to try the product and give my honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to be part of this campaign and try out this gel product! I have always used solid deodorant and was ready to try a different type of product. However, I was very disappointed in what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product a week. I found myself feeling sweaty still each day. Not smelly, just moist/sweaty. This doesn&#x27;t work for me. I want to feel dry and clean. As soon as I would feel sweaty, I would be self conscious and feel not clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone back to my solid and left this gel sitting in the bathroom unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had some issues with a lot of air bubbles and inconsistency. The first time I went to apply it, I felt like I had to click the product to where there was only half left inside before I got product to actually come out. I had more issues with air bubbles in the following days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Secret deoderants in the past and loved them. I was given this product to test out by bzz agent and secret. It does help you stay dry and leaves no white marks! The only thing you have to get past is the cold feeling when first putting it on. The smell is good and I would buy this product!</li>
    <li> I like the smell but not the cold wet feeling the gel causes when it gets on your skin. I really don&#x27;t think I lasted all day without smelling. And I&#x27;m not normally that smelly of a person. I prefer solid better.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like this deodorant. I tried again today and its not working for me. It makes me smell worse than normally I think. eewww like solids better.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try it free from bzz agent and normally i love everything they send me but this one is unfortunately just not strong enough for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome deodorant. Dries fast, no white marks, works for 48 hours and it smells great. What more could you want? Thanks bzzagent for letting me try this.</li>
    <li> A little chilly when you first put it on, but it goes on clear and saves my clothes of white marks. My days can be stressful and I can tell the difference when I wear secret outlast vs regular secret. It gives me a longer protection and leaves me feeling confident. I got to try this thanks to secret and bzzagent #gotitfree #bzzagent. But I am not hooked that this is my new favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free promotion through BzzAgent and I have to say I have mostly been pleasantly surprised.  The last time I used a gel was in junior high or high school and I hated it&#x27;s goopy wetness.  That is not a problem with this antiperpirant.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  You don&#x27;t need much and it protects you for a long time.  I threw some on before boarding a flight to India (26 hours travel time) and still felt perfectly fresh when I reached the hotel.  My normal deoderant would not do that.&lt;br /&gt;This has a pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like antiperspirant, but like a perfume.  I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that it burns like the dickens after shaving and that it seems to be drying out my underarms.  I usually use Dove&#x27;s antiperspirant with that quarter cup of lotion or whatever, and it keeps my underarms very smooth.  I think the alcohol content in the Secret Outlast is very drying.</li>
    <li> Received this as a free trial product from BzzAgent and I must say it does a good job. Great odor protection for the days when I workout after work without having to reapply. Also for a gel it goes on clear without leaving any white marks.</li>
    <li> Feels very clean and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or go through my shirt. And the smell is very clean!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Antiperspirant for free for testing purposes from BzzAgent. I&#x27;m not a big fan of gel deoderants but I do like the Outlast. My favorite thing about it is that it goes on clear and stays clear. I hate having white marks on my clothes and with this I never have to worry. It smells good and seems to protect great.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I received one of these for a promotion going on through bzz.  When I received it I was skeptical.  But I love it and so does my mom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying Secret Outlast via a free promotion of their brand. The deodorant works well, but not quite as well as the Secret solid I use. There is a bit of a burn, so don&#x27;t use right after shaving. No white marks!  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great for every day or a night out, but skip it for the heavy workouts.</li>
    <li> Ummmmmmm super rich! Recently I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, for being a BzzAgent  and my experience has been very good, 48-hour odor protection, leaves no stain, feels cool and fresh when it is applied, but stays dry throughout the day and have a great aroma. I give her 5 stars. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I was able to sample this product as part of a Bzz Agent campaign.  I&#x27;m really happy with it!  I usually don&#x27;t use gel, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I do find it has the same great protection that my solids provide.  The one thing to remember is that you probably want to wait to put any clothes on for a few minutes because it does stay wet/have a wet feel for a bit after application.  It is easy to control how much you put on and it provides great protection throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Got this with a Bzzzrate campaign and it is AWESOME! I really enjoy the clear gel and no underarm mess. I&#x27;m going to buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> Received this product from Bzzagent. It is one of the best antiperspirants out there. It goes on clear and dries within seconds and the scent is great, not to loud but a light scent and that is great especially when you are wearing this with your arms out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, love that it&#x27;s clear and love that it last. It has a great clean smell. It last a long time. It doesn&#x27;t leave white residues on your clothes. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was how sticky it felt and it seemed to take a while for it feeling to go away. I am normally allergic to a lot of the smelly deodorant but this one didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin at all. I reviewed this product for buzzagent. Loved being part of them.</li>
    <li> Got it free through BzzAgent and was cautiously optimistic about replacing my favorite brand. Turns out I shouldn&#x27;t have worried, product lived up to the hype...no white marks, fast drying, 48hour protection, great wetness &amp; odor protection. Outperforms the brand I&#x27;ve been using since high school which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
    <li> Not only is this completely clear the 48 hour wet free protection is AMAZING! I have found my new deodorant! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. A nice cool gel that dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a trace! No more white marks here. And it is seriously the best smelling stuff ever. I was hesitant about trying a gel for several reasons and honestly, if I wouldn&#x27;t have received this deodorant as part of a free promotion from Secret, I may have never known how great it is!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! I received it for free to try out from the brand as a part of a promotion. I hate when deodorant leaves white streaks on my clothes, but this one doesn&#x27;t. It also smells very fresh and it dries very quickly. It also works very well. Love it! I will definitely be buying this one from now on. Gel deodorants are so much better than the solid white ones.</li>
    <li> It really is clear. Doesn&#x27;t make any mess on my clothes. Dries quickly and smells good. I&#x27;m also a  BzzAgent and received a free full sized sample to try!</li>
    <li> This time of the year for me is busy. I am constantly on the move whether it is with work, going to class, or preparing for the upcoming holidays but Secret Outlast gel has outlasted every hurdle I&#x27;ve thrown at it. Initially I was put off by the smell of the gel, I quickly discovered that it did not have a weird smell as I worked throughout the day and kept me dry. And that is something that I really do like about it. If the buyer is looking to find a deodorant that is smelling like flowers or baby powder, this is not for you, but it does allow the users the flexibility in what scent they use for body spray/perfume.  ~~A buzzagent reviewer who received the good as a promotional service</li>
    <li> I not tried clear gel deodorant since it  first came out  on the market many years ago it. It use to be sticky,  and take for ever to dry. Wow has changed, I received it free to try and was impressed how fast it dried. And it didn&#x27;t leave a sticky film, nor any white marks. It also lasted forever. I had to go from a spinning class to a dentist appointment without a shower, as I ran out of time. Totally impressed by how well the order protection held up.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this deodorant for free from BzzAgent. Overall I was impressed with this product, but I do wish it had better odor protection.  I would use again, but only purchase with a coupon and/or sale/promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Clean Fresh Scent&lt;br /&gt;Does Not Leave White Marks&lt;br /&gt;Dries Faster Than Expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Gel Is Really Cold When Applying to Underarm&lt;br /&gt;Order Protection was Not What I am Used To&lt;br /&gt;Seem to got through the product much faster than a solid, even when using as directed</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzAgent to review, it definitely worked in the sense that it kept me dry and not smelling bad, but omg was the scent strong. My husband walked in and it&#x27;s the first thing he said was that something smelled floral. I don&#x27;t know if it was the scent per se, but it gave me such a headache within an hour of wearing it. I am very sensitive to smells though, so that may be just me. I think if you have a higher smell tolerance, this would work for you, but if like me, you are sensitive to smells, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Secret Outlast Completely Clean from BzzAgent to review for free!&lt;br /&gt;I am a very active mom, I run around with my kids all day, and I am also a runner- usually running an average of 20 miles per week. I have had so much trouble finding deodorant that keeps me dry, I often sweat for hours after a run and shower. This clear gel goes on easy, feels smooth, and dries instantly. I&#x27;m very pleased that I am still dry hours later, and still smelling fresh:) I do not have to re-apply or have to go fan my underarm area in private to try to dry my embarrassing sweat! This gel dries so quickly and keeps me dry all day. Finally, a product that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had trouble in the past with night sweats, and waking up with a not-so-pleasant smelling underarm area. This Secret Outlast gel keeps me dry and fresh all night. As far as the marks left on clothing, there is always a little residue left on certain fabrics, especially black, but not as bad as other clear gels I&#x27;ve tried. Very happy with this Completely Clean Clear Gel! I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I received this deoderant free as I am a Bzzagent. As far as deodorant goes this one is fine. I suppose that the less you notice about a deoderant the better. There are no white marks on my clothes so that&#x27;s a fantastic plus. The first time I put this deoderant on it was after shaving my armpits in the shower, to be honest it burned. I&#x27;ve never ever experienced burning from a deoderant before, that was a definite turn off but the product does as it should, it keeps me dry and odor free so overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to keeping my pits protected all day long. I&#x27;m a work hard, play hard kind of girl. Between remodeling my house (down to the studs- yikes!), working in a home improvement store, playing mom to 11 animals, and spending my free time outdoors doing everything from offroading to geocaching to grabbing a drink or two, I need something that can stand up to my lifestyle no matter what I choose to do. And this stuff has stood up to the test so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear, clean, and dries in a jiffy! No more fighting to wiggle my hands under my shirt to avoid white marks on my clothes, which means I don&#x27;t have to worry about stretching out my tighter fitting tops just to make sure I get my deodorant where it&#x27;s supposed to go. I can swipe before I get dressed without worrying about the horrid streaks of doom down my clothes, and get about my day. I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying between work and play, and no more &#x27;subtle&#x27; stretching and sniffing to make sure I&#x27;m not making a stink. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as part of a promotion because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent, but it&#x27;s a new staple in my bathroom and this review is all mine.</li>
    <li> I received a Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret. I am usually a solid gal but was open to the idea of trying and reporting on my experience with a clear gel deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed by Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear. The deodorant keeps me dry all day and I do not have to worry about embarrassing moments at work, parties or during my daily routine. I usually apply deodorant in the morning and stay dry all day without having to re-apply. There is also no residue on my clothes. Zero residue is a huge benefit to me because I do not want to worry about my clothes and outfits showing deodorant marks.</li>
    <li> For once something worked as advertised.  You really can wear your black clothes without streaks!  And it smells terrific.  I like black clothing and I have tried a few other brands but they either didn&#x27;t work or left white streaks.  This really works!  I received this free from Bzzagent to try it out and I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried when buying this deodorant that it would leave me with that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling under my arms. However, this seems to be a new and improved formula by Secret. I am used to using the Clinical Strength deodorant, but felt like this product protected me just as well for almost half the cost.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completley Clean Clear Gel goes on smoothly and dries in seconds. It offers 48 hour protection even on your most stressful and sweaty days. The best part is that it will not leave white marks on your clothing and it smells so clean and crisp. I was so happy with the product after recieving it for free as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel ever since I got my free sample as part of a promotion by the brand, and I just love it. I will never use any other deodorants, the no white mark formula, wetness protection and fast drying formula are perfect for my lifestyle. I have a toddler and she&#x27;s keeping me on my toes all the time. You name it, we do it, mommy and me yoga, playgrounds, playdates, toddler and mommy workouts, you get the idea. I am constantly on the move and don&#x27;t always have time to take a shower when I need one and if I do get to shower I don&#x27;t have time to wait for a deodorant to dry so Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel has become my best friend and we go everywhere together. Its the number two item in my diaper bag (right after diapers of course). Being a busy mommy is all about finding the right products to make life easier and I know that Secret Outlast® is one of the</li>
    <li> Super clean feeling and lasts all day!  Definately a new tool in my daily kit.  Was given the chance to try for free through BZZagent and love it</li>
    <li> I got to try this Item for free because I am a BzzAgent and was asked to share my opinion.  I actually like this formula more than I thought I would.  The smell is pleasant and light.  It does last a long time as well.  But just know that the gel does dry white.</li>
    <li> I chase 2 little boys around all day - no sweating! I was worried about a gel and feeling &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; but it dried quickly and left no white marks on my dark shirts - amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love it , no white spots, lasts longer what else can u ask more</li>
    <li> Got this from BzzAgent to give it a try. I have never used clear deodorant before. I was a little skeptical. I was very impressed with the protection it gave. I have always put deodorant on after my clothing so I will not end up with white makes on my clothes. With that being said that is a habit now and a few times I would bump my shirt and the gel would get everywhere. This has a great scent and kept me dry all day. Great product,give it a try.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally like the clear gel but this is wonderful even after workouts I feel as if I don&#x27;t smell as much</li>
    <li> Works really well and lasts throughout the day. Smells great and is effective for 14+ hours! Plus, I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. #Bzzagent!</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzzAgent!  I love this deodorant.  It does exactly what it says.  It goes on clear.  It fights odor for 48 hours.  It dries instantly!  I always bought Degree.  Now I have a whole nother choice!  And it&#x27;s CLEAR!!  Love it!  #ClearlyBetter</li>
    <li> I liked how this clear gel antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your arm pits or not enough coverage so you feel like you have to reapply all the time. I also liked the light scent and easy application. I also thought it went on smoothly and not too sticky after you put it on. I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of the promotion of the brand.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! I received it as part of a promotion from BzzAgent and Secret. Before receiving this free sample, I had given up on finding a deodorant that actually prevents underarm sweating. I&#x27;ve tried several other 48-hour deodorant/antiperspirants in the past and they only marginally prevented underarm sweating. I&#x27;ve got white shirts with yellow stains in the pits to prove it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret&#x27;s clear gel antiperspirant actually stops me from sweating! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and the only time I&#x27;ve had any underarm sweating was during workouts at the gym (and any antiperspirant that can prevent sweating there is just a miracle worker). I also enjoy the clean scent and the clear gel that doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t make any comments about the 48-hour protection since I shower daily, but this deodorant does last throughout a whole day at least. I will definitely be purchasing it once my sample runs out.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me as a free sample to review. I don&#x27;t normally choose clear gel deodorants, but I figured i&#x27;d give this a chance. I&#x27;m so glad that I did. The scent is really nice! Hours later and I still feel fresh and clean. It goes on easily and dries nicely. The only reason I did not give this a full 5 stars is that it claims that it does not leave white marks, but the first time i used it, i put it on and let dry for 10 minutes while finishing my hair and makeup. I then put on a black tank top. I still ended up with white marks on it. They were not near as bad as other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, but its still something worth noting. I would definitely purchase this product again and would recommend it to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I use secret, but this is better. I got it as a free trial through bzzagent and I really like the feel of this product and the smell is not offensive. I especially like the clearness. I use a secret solid that is supposed to go on clear, but it still will get on my clothes sometimes. I sweat, a lot and I usually don&#x27;t smell bad, but by the end of the day, I can tell my old deodorant is wearing off. This kept me dry and fresh smelling all day and into the next. I will definitely be switching to this clear gel.</li>
    <li> I was given a stick of Secret Outlast Gel to try out as part of my participation in the BzzAgent program. All opinions are my own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d not tried a gel deodorant in many years. I&#x27;m an invisible-solid sort of girl (always Secret brand though). My previous gel experiences were that they took too long to dry, resulting in wet marks on my clothes. I also didn&#x27;t like that they had so much alcohol in their formula, which meant burning if you have sensitive skin/razor burn issues, like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Secret Outlast Gel deodorant promises that it will dry quickly, without leaving marks, and will protect you for 48 hours. I found that yes this deodorant does dry lightning fast and really doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on your clothes - especially no white marks. Another bonus is that the gel goes on smoothly, more so than a solid, so there&#x27;s no chance of clumping or clogging pores. As for the claims that it protects for 48 hours, I didn&#x27;t find that I could go completely without reapplying for 2 whole days. What I did find is that I didn&#x27;t need to reapply as often, so I think it&#x27;s still outlasting my other deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I was really happy with this deodorant. I took one star off for not living up to the 48 hour claims.</li>
    <li> Got to try this out for free through a BzzAgent campaign from Secret. Loved the smell, clean not over powering. Im not usually one for smelly deodarants but this was lighter then most. It goes on  wet and it feels that way for a minute or two. Im use to solid so it took me some time to get use to that but once it dried it did what it says. No white marks which is great because I can change my mind about the shirts I wear  and helped protect against odor. #gotitfreefromsecret #clearlybetter #gotacoupon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the secret clear gel deordorant for about a week now and I love it! Feels a little wet going on when you&#x27;re used to the stick deordorant but it dries fast and provides me odor protection far longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used. Best part is no white marks! Thank you #bzzagent #igotitfreefromsecret</li>
    <li> I have never tried a clear gel before, as I always thought they would be messy. I like this product as it provides great protection from wetness and smells fresh hours after applying. I gave it 4 stars simply because it burns on recently shaved underarms. It doesn&#x27;t burn too bad or too long, but it&#x27;s still there. I&#x27;m guessing because of the alcohol. Overall, I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Was surprised how much I liked this. Have used gel in the past ... don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling. But this one dried quickly and worked great. Nice scent, no mess. Clear and Confidant feeling all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Received free for review ... opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying another clear gel deodorant. In the past I&#x27;ve been left with a sticky mess under my armpits. While it does take a few minutes for this product to dry, in the end you are left with a fresh, dry and clean feeling, and a fantastic fragrance that lasts all day and longer. A really pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of using this deodorant gel at first, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it! I got it free from BzzAgent to test out and I will definitely be replacing my old deodorant with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. It goes on clear, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes, and provides all day protection! My old deodorant (Suave) didn&#x27;t do anything of these things (except dry quickly) so I was definitely ready for a change, and Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is definitely the way to go! I definitely recommend this product to anyone! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant courtesy of bzzagent for testing purposes! I must say this is the Perfect deodorant for the busy women! I work 10 hours a day, lots of moving and walking, this stuff not only kept me dry and smelling clean all day, but also lasted through my workout, It dries super fast and smells awesome. best part, no white stains on your clothes!! Highly recommend! Best clear gel I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a part of BzzAgent campaign. It has such a fresh and youthful scent. Plus I am confident about wetness protection - a win-win in my book. A clear gel dries really fast and does not leave any residue or smudges on anything I&#x27;m wearing. Also, it might be a little thing, but I appreciate that the plastic with the holes, where the gel comes out is matte - when applying it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky-goopy slick against my skin.</li>
    <li> Tried this product and love it!!!  Smells very light and clean! goes on easy and dries instantly!  No more white marks doesn&#x27;t leave any residue!!! I got to sample this product from BzzAgent and will be buying it for sure!!</li>
    <li> I rarely used clear gel in the past due to the fact that it would make my armpits feel wet for such a long time after applying it. One of the reasons I love the Secret Outlast Clear Gel is that it dries in seconds so I don&#x27;t get that yucky wet feeling. I also like that it really does work. I get superior odor protection. I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks or embarrassing wet marks on my shirts. This really is a great antiperspirant and deodorant. I was lucky enough to receive this product for free from BzzAgent and I will definitely be purchasing it again in the near future.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I got this free from BzzAgent and I think I might make the switch.  If you put it on right out of the shower it will offer unbelievable protection.  It goes on clear and dries fast.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  It has a fantastic light smell and really protected against odor and wetness.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best ever deodorant! I hit the tread mill for over an hour and the secret gel stopped the BO smell like no other deodorant i have ever used. When i put on my shirt there were no white marks which is good cause i wear a lot of dark colors.I have used dove for the last several years but not anymore i am a secret woman from here on out. It is especially great when going thru menopause it helps me feel fresh all day and night!!!</li>
    <li> I liked this product because of the scent and the way it stays clear throughout the day. Even though I usually wear solid antiperspirants, surprisingly this one last long than I have known other clear deodorants in the past. I would recommend it for those who prefer clear deodorants.</li>
    <li> It smells good and it last a long time. You don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying. A really good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on the inside of your shirts.</li>
    <li> this gel antiperspirant is the best gel kind i have ever tried...it not only keeps you smelly fresh it goes on easy is not sticky and leaves no marks! it is great and i would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this from Bzz Agent. I am impressed be several things about this deodorant: 1) It goes on as gel but dries fast, 2) It truly doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes, 3) It keeps me completely dry, even on a balmy day or while I&#x27;m otherwise sweating, and 4) It has good odor protection (and a strong scent).  I&#x27;m not a fan of this scent, however - it&#x27;s musky and unpleasant to my nose. Otherwise, this is an A+ deodorant.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from Bzz agent. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t like it, at all. I ususally use secret dry solid. The odor protection was ON PAR with my regular deoderant, but this product never dries. I end up getting it on my shirt, which transfers it to my hands and to whatever I touch next. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I like the subtle scent. Not overwhelming at all. I like the dispenser because you can use a little or a lot. It feels refreshing but does stay sticky for longer then i would like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a go right now and so far so good! It&#x27;s a bit too feminine smelling for my personal preference but it does hold up great throughout the day--even when doing things like moving and unpacking--and really did stay clear which was fantastic. I would have liked a more subtle scent but overall I&#x27;m happy with the product and can see using it again. I received this as part of a promotion by Secret via BzzAgent but opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> I tend to buy the clinical strength secret deodorant, however after trying Outlast, I feel confident switching and saving a few dollars too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works amazing!  I used to have to reapply deodorant throughout the day, but I don&#x27;t have to any longer.  Thank you for the free sample Secret!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this deodorant especially since I have a really hard time finding a gel deodorant that i like. Bzzagent and secret gave me the opportunity to try Secret outlast out. This deodorant is a clear gel which surprisingly dried in a suitable amount of time. True to this products claim I didn&#x27;t experience any odor but I didn&#x27;t test it out for 48 hrs so I can&#x27;t really attest to 48 hr protection. The only downside to this deodorant is if you put it on right after shaving it burns like a son of a gun. As i mentioned above I&#x27;m not a huge gel fan but I liked it and I&#x27;m so happy to find out they have Secret outlast in invisible solid, I definitely will be picking it up on my next shopping trip. Overall this deodorant is pretty good it will keep you dry and odor free and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I live in FL. Before living here my hormones were totally different. I feel cold in 65 degree weather now and I actually sweat (it used to take a long workout for sweat to appear). I have been using regular solid deodorant for years and had a feeling I wouldn&#x27;t like Secret Outlast and unfortunately I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions which were to use just 2-3 clicks. Great directions because I would&#x27;ve actually turned the whole thing and placed too much under my arms. It felt gooey. The smell was fine for hours as I expected, but there was actually wetness in the underarm area of my shirt, that was embarrassing. I&#x27;m sticking with my usual brand, and usual type of deodorant. Luckily I received this one free to try courtesy of Secret, because I would&#x27;ve been upset if I paid for it and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of this product thanks to Secret and Bzzagent. I will admit that I was a little skeptical and unsure at first. I had tried clear gel antiperspirants in the past and did not like the way they felt. They seemed to take forever to dry and made me feel wet. When I tried this product, the first thing I noted was that it did dry very quickly. There was no wet, uncomfortable feeling. That was important to me, since you don&#x27;t want to use a product like this and end up feeling wet and icky. Secret Completely Clean did not cause that issue. The next important point is that it not show on your clothing. As it is completely clear and dries quickly that did not appear to be an issue, however I did test that out by wearing a black shirt to a concert. No problem with marks on the clothing! Finally, the true test of an antiperspirant, that it keeps you dry and odor free. Secret was successful in this respect as well, keeping me cool and comfortable, even in a crowded concert. Overall, I can recommend this product without hesitation. It does everything it claims to do and is a good value product.</li>
    <li> To be honest I like this deo gel a lot! I wear it a lot but with some restrictions. I will not wear it in Texas summer months. It absolutely does no good. Just slips and slides and offers no protection against sweat or odor when it is 100 degrees and 100% sick and twisted humidity. Fer few will do that (ahem Secret Clinical will). This is really to be expected in that typre of atmosphere. NOw......with that being said..... I absolutely LOOOOOVE this deo in the fall, winter and spring months. No white mess on your beautiful clothes and it actually does the job it is designed to do, because it can in that type of environment. I have been using this deo for a while now, not just from the campaign, but in life. It really is great, but I MUST switch back once the humidity rolls in.</li>
    <li> Got this product from buzz agent to review. So far I&#x27;m pleased. It smells great has kept me dry and feeling fresh. Also a positive about this is absolutely no white marks showing on my cloths!! Def recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is one deodorant that lives up to it&#x27;s name!!  I received a sample from the manufacturer and I was skeptical at first so I tried it at home while cleaning house all day and purposely wore a black shirt.  I was actually amazed and completely impressed that it left not one trace of a white mark!!  Dried fast and worked well overall!!  I will definitely be a repeat buyer!!</li>
    <li> I got this product free as a sample and I was skeptical at first from previous experiences with gel deodorants.  However, secret is a trusted brand that I hAve used for years so I figured why not!  I can say I&#x27;m still not a fan of the wet feeling when it is first applied, however it does dry much faster than I recall from previous experiences.  The scent is pleasant and it lasts me an average day so that&#x27;s a plus!  I don&#x27;t know if I would buy the product on my own but I am happy to have had my old beliefs of gel deodorant changed.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!  No white marks -- dries fast and lasts for 48 hours!  Would buy it again!  Got my full size free sample to try on Bzzagent.com!  Get free products to try and review!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this for free. I am usually a solid/semi-solid deodorant user, so the cold gel is hard to get used to with the chilly mornings lately. The good part is it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks (even on my all black sweater). It just isn&#x27;t strong enough for my liking. Feels like it stops working full strength half way through the day. Though I&#x27;d say the same thing about most deodorants.</li>
    <li> I love the way this goes on my skin.  It is fairly smooth, non sticky.  It does dry fast and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  The problem I have with it is the very strong &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell.  It isn&#x27;t a natural smell and tends on the side of chemical.  Aside from that, with any deodorant, it doesnt ever seem to wash off easily.  They always stick too hard when in the shower with soap and water.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, and Secret,  I got try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free!  I&#x27;ve used plenty of different deodorants in the past, from roll ons, solids, clear solids.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a clear gel, and I&#x27;m super impressed with it!  The smell is strong at first but, then after at bit of time it fades away to a nice soft smell that lasts all day. I applied 2 &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; and it was wet feeling and a little sticky, after I flapped my arms like a chicken a few times it dried quickly. My kids seen me doing this and they all joined in and we did the chicken dance!! (Thanks Secret for a great family moment!)  1 click I have found, is plenty enough protection for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purposely put my shirt on and made sure I got some on my sleeve, and no deodorant marks showed up at all.&lt;br /&gt;I like to exercise, and do a 3 mile fast pace walk, everyday and the wetness, and odor protection is superior against and other brand I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a busy Mom, exercise fiend, and super caution about the way I smell and look, I&#x27;m very happy with this deodorant and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Secret Oulast Clean Clear Gel is an excellent product.  I can use this with confidence all day long.  Avoid white marks on your clothing and do not worry about it wearing off.  It is totally clear and smells fresh all day.  The product packagin is mess free and dispenses the right amount with each use.  I was lucky enough to receive this product free from BZZ Agent as a promotion but will be purchasing this in the future!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Received this secret gel stick from bzzagent. My daughter and I love it. Last all day. Says it last for 48 hours but we haven&#x27;t tried that lol! But works great and smells great! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel Deodorant through Buzz agent.  I have tried many different types of deodorant.  I love the secret brand and have recently been using secret clinic, however I always end up with a white mark on my clothes even if I put the deodorant on after my shirt.  With Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel I don&#x27;t have that problem, my biggest pet peeve with deodorant.  The one thing that I do not like about this deodorant is that for about 1/2 hour my armpits feel wet.  The scent is really good and it does a great job preventing me from having underarm odor.  By the end of the day I still feel like I have good coverage.  I would definitely by this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I received this as a promotion from Secret!  In the past, I would never have purchased a gel because they are wet and sticky.  Boy was I surprised when this one wasnt!  It dries very quickly and keep me dry, even through very stressfull days.  I love that when I take off my expense black dress, there isnt any icky white marks.</li>
    <li> I did a 48 hour challenge to see if this really would work. Amazing. 48 hours with only one swipe per underarm and zero moistness and zero smell. In those 48 hours I worked 26 hours which is basically me running around typically sweating like crazy. This product is amazing and is now a must have for me. I did receive it free for a trial of the product but will be purchasing from now on</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel really does dry within seconds. I was really surprised that a gel can do that. I have been wearing a lot of black shirts and dresses with the fall season and this has been the first antiperspirant that has not left white marks on my clothing. I can put it on and not worry about odor nor marks for the entire day and into the evening.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as part of promotion. I have used a gel deodorant in the past and have never liked them. Too wet or sticky so I stuck with solids. But this deodorant is awesome! It dried quickly after applying and I stayed dry all day long. I was shocked! I always sweat through my shirt but not anymore. And it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Secret sent me a stick of the Outlast Completely Clean gel deodorant to try out. I normally use the lavender scented Scent Expressions, also by Secret. The Outlast worked just as well as my regular deodorant but I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of the scent. I hope they will come out with other scents in the future.</li>
    <li> I am trying Secret Outlast Clear Gel for the first time after receiving it as part of promotion from the Secret. In the past I have been skeptical of clear gel products but now I am not sure what I was thinking. I love the clear gel and the Completely Clean scent is perfect. The gel is not sticky once it goes on and works great. With other products, I would have days where I felt like I had to reapply but not with Secret Outlast.  I believe I have found a product that I will be sticking with for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have never liked gel deodorant because I hated how wet it stayed in my arm pits for hours on end. I tried a few many many years ago and never went back. I generally buy the solid type that goes on clear.  I found that this Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel works great as long as you routinely shave your armpits.  I know that may sound weird and a little gross, but let&#x27;s be honest....hardly any woman shaves their armpits every single day. When I used the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel with a couple days between shaving, I noticed that my armpits stayed wet for more than 30 minutes-1 hour after application. I ended up wiping it off and using my old deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it another try the next day after shaving and found that it dried pretty quickly, before I finished getting ready for work in the morning. The product directions say to use 2-3 clicks, but I found that 1 click was good enough for me. I&#x27;ve not seen the first white mark on my clothing when using the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant.  The scent is nice while not overpowering.  The product claims 48 hours of odor protection. Although I&#x27;ve not tried it this long without a shower and deodorant, I can say that it definitely works 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a free sample as a member of BzzAgent, but all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I received a free one from Bzz Agent and SECRET as part of a trial group.  I was leary of using a gel.  It dried quickly, no white marks on my black shirt, smelled nice, and it did last for 48 hours!!  I will be buying this from now on!!</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical about using gel deodorants but i received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, #GetITFreefromSecret, and after one use, I knew this would be my new deodorant. It dried so fast that I forgot that I was wearing it. The scent was fresh and I felt protected all day long.</li>
    <li> I refuse to use anything else but secret brand but now I will only use secret outlast! Best fragrance ever. I even got my friends addicted to it.</li>
    <li> I have not tried a gel deodorant before so I was a little hesitant about it. But I absolutely love it! I have to wear a black shirt to work every day, so it was nice not to have to worry about white lines. Somehow I usually end up with them on the back of my shirt, but not with this  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel! I have always used Secret so it is not surprising to me that this works fantastic at stopping odors and keeping me dry. I was very surprised about how quickly it dried once applied. I was worried I would be feeling it all day but it dried quickly. One extra benefit is that there is no build up, so shaving isn&#x27;t difficult. I did receive this item free from the manufacturer and was asked to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I recently received this Secret product to try out for Bzzagent. I have used many Secret products in the past, and was eager to try this one. I noticed it was somewhat wet when applying, but did not take long at all to dry..and caused no problems on my clothing. The smell was wonderful and I felt confident that it would help any daily odors. I think I gave this deodorant the BEST workout when I had to go car shopping! (whats more nerve wracking that that!?)  Even at the end of the day, I noticed I had no body odor and even had a hint of a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell. LOVED this product and will continue to use for other stressful situations when I want to feel confident!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this brand before and was not happy with its performance, as it felt like it was leaving a thick residue behind that required a loofah to remove at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently, I got the opportunity to try it again. I will say the thick residue issue seems to have gotten better. It still leaves a little behind, but this formula has improvements. The odor protection was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from Secret through a Bzzagent campaign. I have to say that I am very impressed with this product. It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks. For a gel, it dries remarkably fast and keeps me dry all day long. It also has a very plesant scent.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean scent gel as a part of a promotion through Secret.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a solid choice for a deodorant.  Many other deodorants claim to be, \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; or \\&quot;clear\\&quot; -- this deodorant actually is.  No white marks or stains on anything I&#x27;ve worn thus far (and I wear quite a bit of black).  The smell is nice, not cloying or overpowering.  There is a bit of an alcohol smell to it, but presumably it&#x27;s the alcohol that helps it to dry so quickly.  The alcohol smell disappears once it dries.  My only concern is with the aluminum content.  In order to allay my fears of aluminum I use deodorant sparingly (I have tried numerous natural deodorants that were aluminum free with no success).  This deodorant is also great if used sparingly because it does seem to last slightly longer than other deodorants.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try for free through Bzzagent.com a little over a week ago. In that time I have fallen in love with this product! I have trouble finding antiperspirants that actual withstand my hectic work shift and allow me to leave work feeling as dry &amp; clean smelling as I arrived. This gel applied easily, dried fast without feeling sticky or slick under my arms, and the scent is wonderful but not overpowering. Winner all around for me :) I&#x27;ll definitely continue using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> First off the smell is amazing, it&#x27;s very fresh and clean. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it at first because I don&#x27;t usually use a gel. I was able to get over that very quickly! It goes on quick and clear and I never have to worry about stains on my clothing. Best part is it lasts ALL day! I put it through the test last weekend when I went to NYC. It was a fairly cool day, but 5 minutes in the subway system and you are not feeling so fresh. Although, I was hot and bothered I never felt smelly or un-fresh. This product works great, I&#x27;ve been telling all of my friends about it!</li>
    <li> I have used the secret scent expressions in the past, as well as many different solids. I must say the clear gel is my favorite by far! I was able to try this secret outlast completely clean for free for being a BzzAgent, and it was just as wonderful as the scent expressions! The clear gel is a little bit colder when applied compared to a white solid, and it seems to be a lot wetter, but it really does dry instantly. It is dry by the time you go to put your shirt on, and there is no worry about horrible white marks on your dark shirt! If you are a person who puts the deodorant on after you are completely dressed, there is still no worry about this product being noticed on your clothing, because it just does not happen! In the past when I used white solid deodorant I would always end up with white lines on my shirt some how, and it really amazed me. I think this outlast has a nice clean scent, but if you are into more fruity scents like peach the scent expressions is pretty much the same in my opinion. I have used the secret clear gel while pregnant and even though I always feel like I am sweating I never have to worry about smelling thanks to this wonderful deodorant, because it really does keep you fresh all day long. I will never use anything except for secret clear gel!</li>
    <li> I have been trying the new clear 48 hr  outlast secret for the past 2 days that I received as a free sample to rate. So far I have not had any odor, white streaks, or major sweating at all. The scent did take a little getting used to, I have the clean one and it has a strong scent of rubbing alcohol when you first put it on, it also takes a bit longer for the stuff to dry than it says. If you don&#x27;t wait for it to dry it is a little sticky. But overall it does the job and I have not had to reapply more than the once a day which saves time and money in the long run!</li>
    <li> I have been a Secret user for over 20 years. This is my first time using the Outlast Clear Gel that I received via Bzzagent to test out. I was hesitant about using a gel because I worried it would leave my armpit area wet and sticky. The formula actually dries very quick and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothing. I love the smell of Secret&#x27;s products. They smell fresh and light and are never overpowering. The formula worked well to keep me dry and odor free-even after long days at work followed by working out. Highly recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I normally use Secret&#x27;s invisable solid, but I received a free sample of this clear gel. It has kept me dry longer and no white marks on my clothes. I tend to wear a lot of black, so I&#x27;ve been very pleased with no deodorant stains on my clothes.</li>
    <li> The Secret is out. This Smells great. And it does not leave white track marks on your clothing. It drys really fast.  I can&#x27;t get over how well it works and smells.</li>
    <li> I recived this Secret Outlast completely Clean Scent women &#x27;s Clear Gel Antisperspirant from Bzzagent.  , This is my 1st time using it, I have never used the Clear Gel before, I was using another brand, but the 1st time I used I like it, because I like the fact that my cloth didnt stain like the other brand did. and I felt clean not wet like the other brand did. I told my sister that I got this product and she told me that that&#x27;s the only one that she used.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast come in clear gel formula, doesn&#x27;t live white marks. Antiperspirant deodorant protect 48 hours from sweat and odor. Has pleasant light fragrance. Keep me fresh and clean even in very busy days. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms after shaving. Got it free from BzzAgeny Campaigne.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel!!!! The deodorant glides on evenly and keeps me fresh and smelling good all day long. Plus, there are no annoying white marks left on my clothes! A lot of deodorants do not work well for me, but this one works perfectly with my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I am a first time mom to a 2 month old.  My baby loves to be held and rocked, and refuses to be put down until she is ready to nap. Holding a baby for hours a day makes me hot and sweaty. On top of that, I am not afraid to admit I have gone 48+ hours without showering because looking after a newborn and household will do that to you. Secret Outlast actually kept up with me and my busy schedule.  The odor protection lived up to the promise and my husband appreciates that too. The deodorant dried quickly after I applied it and it did not leave any marks on my black shirt.  I only wish the light fragrance stayed around a little longer but that is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Secret Outlast dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave marks. Especially good for busy moms like me, it keeps its promise of 48 hours of protection! I was lucky enough to try a free sample through a BzzAgent campaign and plan to buy it from now on!</li>
    <li> I received this Secret Deodorant as part of a promotion from Secret...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done gel deodorants before and didn&#x27;t really like them because it felt wet ALL the time and would get my blouses wet as well.&lt;br /&gt;But this deodorant dries super fast. And leaves no white stuff behind. AND IT LASTS!!!&lt;br /&gt;I applied it before going to a party- I danced my booty off, got home and fell asleep. The next morning I ran around the city running errands and to my surprise... I DIDN&#x27;T STINK! And I sweat a lot! The only downfal is that the actual deodorant scent does fade a bit after like 24hrs BUT! you still don&#x27;t smell bad. Would like it if the scent of freshness would last a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;I like this better than the clinical stuff. The clinical stuff is much more expensive AND it leaves white stuff behind. I&#x27;m sticking to this one for now on. So glad I got to test if first.</li>
    <li> I had never tried this brand or gel deodorant before.  I usually use a solid stick, but this is a keeper.  I like the soft, clean, not overpowering fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white mark or stain on my clothes.  Gel takes several minutes to dry, but once it dries give all day odor and wetness protection.  Is great for hot weather. I smelled fresh all day !! I have a very sensitive skin and some deodorants are too strong for me, not this one.  I highly recommend this product.  Disclaimer: I received this deodorant for free as part of BzzAgent campaing. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to try from bzz agent. I always liked Secret but was a little skeptical when it came to gel. I have used gel before but always felt sticky or some sore of residue after. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the product dried quickly and left no hint of being there. I loved the fragrance, it is nice but not overpowering. I felt like 48 hours is pushing it&#x27;s limits a bit, but it did last longer than my regular deodorant. If it had not claimed the 48 hours I would have given it a 5 star review. It is a great deodorant and will be a part of my regular routine even after the bzz campaign is over.</li>
    <li> I really loved the scent, it dried much quicker than other Gel antiperspirant/deodorants.  The protection was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a promotion product but I have purchased more after trying... You will be staisfied!</li>
    <li> WOW! AMAZING! I got a sample of this deodorant and it is my new favorite deodorant.  Goes on a little wet and slippery but it dries fast and keep you dry and smelling fresh all day long.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it does not leave marks on clothes, at all.  It does take a bit to dry on your arm pits.  I have to remember to put it on a bit before I get dressed and not afterwards or it will dampen your clothes.  The smell is nice, but it does not provide 48 hr odor protection.  It should maybe say 18 hour protection.  It does work great all day, but if I do my AM workout before a shower the next day, I am stinky by the time I am done.  I am still not a super fan of the gel product, but after receiving the product free from BzzAgent.com, I will continue to use it up, I would just enjoy it more in solid stick form. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received this Free as a sample to try.  So far (after 3 days of use), I love it!  It is not sticky like other clear gel deoderants.  I tend to be a heavy sweater but this keeps me nice &amp; dry.  I&#x27;ve not had wet pits in my shirt since I started using it.  I also love that it is clear, no white marks on my clothing.  Great product!  Now the real test is does it yellow my white shirts like so many others.  Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many many many different types of deodorant.  No matter what I&#x27;ve always gone back to the tried and true stick kind.  I received this free as part of a Bzzagent campaign and I&#x27;ll have to admit I was a little apprehensive about it, but much to my surprise I actually really like it.  It dries very quickly for me and does seem to have long lasting protection.  I&#x27;m a nurse  and long 12+ hour shifts that can include lots of running around and wearing very hot and stuffy isolation gowns will put any antiperspirant to the test and so far I can say I leave work without any nasty dampness or odor.  I love the quick drying aspect as nothing is worse then walking around with white marks on your scrubs.  My only main complaints about it is that it takes several clicks to get enough antiperspirant to apply and it does not come up out of the container evenly.  I would recommend people to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have no intentions on trying the 48 hour test so I&#x27;ll just take their word for it.  I prefer my daily showers :)</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of get antiperspirant because I can&#x27;t get over the cold and wet feeling. I got this product for free as a promotion from Secret and even though I still got the cold and wet sensation I will end up buying this product based on smell and the fact that it is clear and i can wear black without worry.</li>
    <li> When I got this deodorant from BzzAgent, I expected to try it once and then trash it. It smells fine - the fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming and quickly goes away, but I just didn&#x27;t think it would be strong enough for me. Lo and behold, it works like a champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an acrobat and this baby kept my armpits dry and stink-free through a 3 hour performance, which is absolutely incredible. I usually wear men&#x27;s deodorant and have to reapply it through the night. Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my costumes and under my arms! I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
    <li> I received this to try through Bzzagent, and am so happy for the opportunity! I normally shy from gel deodorants because of the sticky feeling.  No sticky feeling here!  I stay completely dry all day and it smells wonderful. Try it!</li>
    <li> I just want to tell everyone that I have tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, and I love it. It  not only keeps me fresh and dry, I have no ugly residue on any of my clothes!!!  I am a BzzAgent, and I got to try this product for free from BzzAgent and Secret!!</li>
    <li> I usually buy solid, but received this from bzzagent and decided to give it a try. It goes on clear and dries real fast.</li>
    <li> I had always used to think that solid deoderants would provide more odor protection, when really they do not. This Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Womens Clear Gel does the job, lasts all day, and does not leave behind a clumpy mess in your pits or your clothes.  Will buy again. I have been more than happy with this product.  Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent I was able to try this product for free</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a sweater. Obviously not the kind you wear but the kind that is constantly doing smell checks under the ol armpits. I have struggled to find a deodorant that can slow down, if not stop, the foul smelling, moist pit that is under my arm. I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Completley Clean Gel for free as a BzzAgent. I was a bit hesitant at first because my deo stash Only includes that of the clinical strength variety. It was free so might as well.    My first use I had my shirt on and applied the Gel. Ewww. It was pretty wet and I hate wet clothes. Eventually it dried or I got used to it one. My smell checks passed everytime and didn&#x27;t require a reapplication. After learning I needed to wait for it to dry I have been applying it as soon as I&#x27;m out of the shower and still have my towel on. My clothes are usually the last thing I do after hair and make up. It gives it time to dry completely and I haven&#x27;t noticed any marks from putting my shirt on after deodorant.    I do believe I&#x27;ll be sticking with Secret Outlast Gel. At least until my body decides to over power it or I get to try another kind for free! I recommend giving it time to dry before clothing yourself but think that it is a great product with a light, fresh smell!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product free to try from BzzAgent - but I already had used the product in the past and was a huge fan. I only departed from it because I wanted to try the clinical strength deodorant but that does not even compare to the Outlast gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product is very easy to use and don&#x27;t have problems &amp;#34;cranking up&amp;#34; the gel. It just takes a few turns to &amp;#34;prime the pump&amp;#34; so to speak and then you are good to go. I just use one twist per side and I&#x27;m more than covered for the day and night. I put it on right out of the shower then go about my morning routine of makeup and getting dressed - it is dry in no time. I&#x27;ve never had wet sticky pits all day. The scent is also pleasant and clean and really does last for more than 24 hours. I can&#x27;t say that about any other brand of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a bonus too because there are always coupons for Secret and it is way cheaper than the clinical strength and lasts even better. Win / Win for me.</li>
    <li> I liked the new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant. It went on smoothly &amp; dried fast. It didn&#x27;t leave any stains or marks on my clothing after applying.  It kept me fresh all day &amp; had a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I loved the new Secret Gel Antiperspirant I was pleasantly surprised as to how it went on and I did not feel wet.  I was dry all day!! I got my Secret from a promo with Bzzagent and Secret</li>
    <li> Got it for free. This is based on my personal experience with Secret Outlast Clear Gel. No white marks! Odor Protection you ONLY need. This is a must.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to sample for free from BzzAgent.  I really like how it dries super fast and that it doesn&#x27;t leave annoying white marks on my shirt.  The only downside I found is that my armpits did get sweaty during my workout, but it wasn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
    <li> I am able to try this product out from BzzAgent for free - THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used gel in the past and wasn&#x27;t impressed. I switched to solid deodorant but it didn&#x27;t last, had to use a ton or it&#x27;d leave equally unimpressive marks on my clothes. Along came the Outlast gel deodorant and I must say I love it. I live in humidity all year round so knowing it dries fast, smells good and I can work without fear if someone was super close - I feel assured using this product and will be switching to this for the long haul.</li>
    <li> I have never used a clear gel before but I was asked to review this product as a #bzzAgent and I #GOTITFREE. I always thought it would leave me feeling wet and that it would sting but I was wrong. It dries quickly, does not sting at all and leaves no white spots. It has a very fresh scent and last a long time. Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant is an excellent product and I would recommend it to everyone. I plan to continue to use it after my bzz campaign for this product is over.</li>
    <li> I received this Secret Outlast clear gel antiperspirant / deodorant as a promotion from Procter &amp; Gamble. I wasn&#x27;t really sure about changing deodorants. I have used several different ones over the years. Many of them were different kinds of Secret. I usually use a solid or what they call a smooth solid. These other forms of Secret do a good job, but you end up with a white film on your shirts. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t do that. It goes on clear and stays clear. There&#x27;s no white residue on your shirts.  It also seems to be stronger than your other Secret deodorants. This lasts for up to to 48 hours. I&#x27;ve also noticed that even though it&#x27;s a gel, it dries really fast. I love that. I highly recommend this deodorant. They&#x27;ve sold me. I&#x27;m switching to Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> I normally use stick type deodorants, don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling of gel.  I was impressed that it worked all day long.  I was working 11-15 hour days and doing a lot of lifting of boxes during that time and I never felt like the deodorant stopped working.  It dried quick so there was no sticky feeling all day long.  I received this as part of  a BZZ Agent Campaign and will say I was impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> I really like how smooth it goes on. I like how wonderful the scents are, it&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;m wearing perfume. I like how long the scents last, and how long I am protected.  I like how long my protection lasts and keeps me dry and smelling good.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of clear gel deodorant. They take forever to dry and leave you feeling sticky. I was given this free to try. Well, my mind has been blown with this Secret Outlast Clear Gel. It is AWESOME!!  It dries fast, has a fresh but not overwhelming scent, you don&#x27;t sweat or smell, it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything. I am in love with it!! I am switching to this deodorant permanently. It lasts well into the next day of use. Thank you Secret for making the perfect deodorant for me!</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Keeps you odor free for 48 hours for sure which I was skeptical about of course. Doesn&#x27;t leave those crappy white marks on your clothing because it&#x27;s clear obviously.  It does take some getting used to at first but it dries pretty fast, just flap your arms for a few seconds after you put it on :) I might have gotten this sample free for being a BzzAgent but regardless of that fact I&#x27;m going to continue using the product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used secret in a few years. For some reason way back when I switched to Mitchum and then Dove (both I swore by). Always unscented because fragrant deodorants always bothered me. Needless to say I was skeptical on the scented one that came with this campaign. I love it. I put it on in the AM and even after I workout in the evening I&#x27;m covered. One click and then one swipe and I&#x27;m good to go. Since it&#x27;s a clear gel once its dry there is literally no trace of it on my skin. Love this product and will definitely be buying more once this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I received this from Bzzagent as a promotion and it was the first time I&#x27;d tried it.  I have to say I was skeptical at first but it has been awesome!!! I have really loved this antiperspirant.  It smells great and really gives great protection.  I highly recommend it for all day protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the Secret Outlast gel for free thanks to a promotion from the brand, and I have to say that so far I&#x27;ve not been digging it.  I just don&#x27;t like the wet feeling when I first roll on the gel.  The first time I put some on, I immediately put my shirt on and got the inside of my shirt wet.  Very unpleasant.  Now, I have to apply the deodorant and then wait a minute or two for it to dry.  Sometimes I&#x27;ve resorted to flapping my wings...I mean arms...trying to get it to dry faster.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Secret; I usually use the solid, so I&#x27;m already getting great protection.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything better with the Outlast gel.  One plus would be that I don&#x27;t have any white marks on my clothes like I sometimes get with the solid.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching from the solid, though as I just don&#x27;t like that initial wet feeling.</li>
    <li> I received the clean outlast for free from bzzagent. I like the protection but not the smell. I would have preferred something with a nice aroma.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell hated the way the product came out. Its smells great however I was having trouble with turning the bottle to get the gel out. Then it felt like I had tons on one arm and nothing on the other, The product works great as far as protection just hated the way it came out of the bottle. I am a buzzagent and received this product for free.</li>
    <li> I remember the days of there being only one brand of deodorant that lasted 24 hours. It worked alright, but my skin was so dry the whole purpose eventually backfired. Thank God those days are over. This Secret Outlast is water based gel,  so it works very well, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I can put it on once a day and have full protection the entire day! The claims are true. My basically black wardrobe shows no deodorant marks, and the scent is fresh and clean. Thanks to BzzAgent, I GotItFree. I&#x27;m a fan and surely will be a repeat customer. This Secret is no secret around me!</li>
    <li> I got to try out this deodorant as a part of a Bzz Campaign.  I am used to using an invisible solid, and never use gels.  I was pleasantly surprised by this new deodorant.  It is a gel, and goes on wet, but it dries almost immediately.  And because it&#x27;s a clear gel, you don&#x27;t have to worry at all about it leaving white marks on your clothes. It lasts and give you wetness protection for a very long time.  I don&#x27;t know about 48 hours, but it definitely lasts more than 24 hours!  It also has a nice light, pleasant scent--that also lasts throughout the day(s)!  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast is just ok. I&#x27;m a pretty sweaty woman and have yet to find anything that works GREAT (besides Certain-Dri, which I don&#x27;t like to use unless absolutely needed). HOWEVER, it still keeps me feeling pretty fresh. The gel goes on easy and isn&#x27;t very messy like some clear gels I&#x27;ve tried. And it doesn&#x27;t turn white - which is probably the best part! The Completely Clean scent is nice, not overly strong or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a low/moderate sweater I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great, but if you sweat a lot you might have to keep searching. This definitely doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of gel deodorant but I have to say, the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent is probably one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried. I received the deodorant through being a BzzAgent and I was definitely interested to try something new. I can&#x27;t say that I love it, but I don&#x27;t hate it either! Try it out for yourself!!</li>
    <li> Finally! A clear gel deodorant that goes on smooth. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel deodorants, as most go on kind of gooey and slimy. I was able to give Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent a try for free through BzzAgent. Secret Outlast is not like that at all. It goes on smoothly, feels great, and offers the protection I need in a deodorant. Not only do I stay fresh all day long, my clothes still look great at the end of the day. No white marks, no sweat stains, and they still smell great! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel free through BzzAgent.  As someone that usually uses deodorant/antiperspirants with the title of &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34;, I am always on the look out for a new and better solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast goes on clear, so I don&#x27;t end up with any white marks when I put my top on.  However, I am not a big fan of having to stand flapping my arms for a little while to get it to &amp;#34;hurry up and dry&amp;#34;.  Sorry, I just don&#x27;t like the gel part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried Secret Outlast, it worked really well.  Would I say that it lives up to the &amp;#34;Lasts 48 hours&amp;#34;?  I highly doubt it.  However, I can say that through out all my useages, I did NOT have an odor problem, no matter what time of day- so kudos to Secret Outlast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used Secret Outlast, uh oh...we had some moisture issues. In fact, at several points through out the day, if I got warm (not hot, warm.  I was just going about my business, not running a marathon), I noticed that it failed on the wetness protection.  Again- no odor, but I can&#x27;t stand to feel the wetness.  Considering that it claims 48 hour protection, I was not anticipating it failing after only 2-3 hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant/antiperspirant is easy to apply and easy to use, but it just fails in it&#x27;s claims for 48 hour protection.  While you may go odor free for 48 hours, unless you are one of those blessed people who rarely sweats at all, you will probably not go wetness free.  It&#x27;s a pity, I was really pulling for Secret Outlast, but alas- just isn&#x27;t going to work out between us, unless it&#x27;s a laze around the house day.</li>
    <li> I received the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Gel antiperspirant/deodorant as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I&#x27;d been using the Secret brand stick deodorants, but I hate that they leave white marks if I forget to put my shirt on first (and sometimes if I applied it sloppily even after my shirt was on). I had used gel deodorants in the past, but didn&#x27;t like the cold, wet feeling they left me with. Well, I don&#x27;t know if Secret changed their formula in the past couple of years, but their gel dries almost instantly when you apply it. I don&#x27;t have that icky wet feeling that I used to get, and that makes me happy. Plus, the clean scent is perfect for me. I always prefer fragrances that are light, clean, and fresh, and the smell of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent is exactly what I like.</li>
    <li> Im still on the fence about this one.  I never use gels, but I got this one as a tester and decided to really give it a try.  Ive been using it everyday for a week now. It definitely last LONGER than my normal stick deodorant! I love that! Ive always had issues with it not lasting the whole work day.  Im not a fan of the Gel because I dont like that it feels wet under there until it dries.  but using it now for a week, I&#x27;m getting used it it, and it quickly dries, and once it does dry its actually better than a stick.  with a stick even though its not wet, I can feel it under there. with this one, as soon as its dry I can really feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sooo:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Last so much LONGER! that alone makes it work it :)&lt;br /&gt;  Once dried, can&#x27;t hardly tell its there, whereas a stick I can still kind of feel the cakeyness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Still getting used to the wetness when first applied (not sure if I like it)&lt;br /&gt;  It burns if I&#x27;m applying it shortly after shaving :(</li>
    <li> There are no words to describe the complete and lasting protection from this antiperspirant. I absolutely love that I can put it on and have no worries of it \\&quot;wearing\\&quot; off or marking up my darker colored clothing! I love that it is a gel and that it goes on smooth and clear!  Receiving this as a part of BuzzAgent has been awesome! This will be my go to brand from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used solid because they&#x27;re fast and convenient, but I have issues with product rubbing off on my clothing. I recently received Secret Outlast Gel to try as part of a product review for BzzAgent and I&#x27;m happy to report that I don&#x27;t have this problem anymore. I&#x27;ve found that ONE click of dial is all I need - any more than that is too much and wasteful. It takes about 30 seconds to dry and I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;m happy to have found something that protects, offers odor protection AND eliminates the white smears that my coworkers always seemed to enjoy pointing out.</li>
    <li> I remember trying &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; deodorants when I was younger with much disappointment. They were sticky and wet, as well as not blocking much in the way of odor. So needless to say, I was skeptical when trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for BzzAgent. I immediately noticed a difference when I first applied it. It was smooth and silky, and dried rather quickly. It had a fresh fragrance that was pleasant. So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the day, I didn&#x27;t notice any odor or moisture. It was holding up just as well as my usual brand deodorant and antiperspirant. I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse so it was put to the test. My building is like a sauna! When I get home I usually walk on the treadmill for 45 minutes. After my workout, I still smelled fresh! I admit that I am surprised at how well a gel worked and held up through my long day.  I think I may have to switch to this stuff!</li>
    <li> So I have been doing my gel challenge for about 2 weeks and I love it. I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free from Secret and BzzAgent to try and give feedback. This is a great deodorant. The pros for me are 1. It is long lasting. I could still smell the fresh scent after a long day. 2. The scent is a very nice clean smell and not overpowering. 3. It leaves no white marks even on black shirts. My cons are 1. It does have a wet feel for most of the day 2. On a black shirt it can look a little wet if the gel gets on your shirt. Overall my pros outweigh my cons and I have found a new deodorant and I would defiantly recommend this for a great odor protecting deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used Secret for years. When they asked me to try the new product for free, I thought what could it hurt. I absolutely love this product. I wear a lot of black clothing and tank tops, so when I saw there were no streaks under my arms after all day wear, I was pretty excited. I love that it works for so long. With most deodorants you have to reapply numerous times a day, but this protects you all day long.</li>
    <li> Dries Fast, stays dry and no white marks. So glad I tried this product for free through BzzAgent. Will use my coupon to purchase next I need deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is the first deodorant I have tried that truly didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my black clothes.  It also didn&#x27;t leave a wet/sticky feeling when I applied it.  I have always trusted the Secret brand, but this product takes deodorant to a new level.  I had the opportunity to try it via a free sampling program, but I will definitely be replacing my old deodorant with this one in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that are always in a rush in the morning. With trying to get two little kids and myself ready for school and work I tend to do everything last minute. I&#x27;ll be running out of the door and remember I need to put deodorant on. Unfortunatly, Secret Outlast Comletely Clean Clear Gel takes a while to dry. I made the mistake of putting it on for the first time and I was wearing a nice shirt that got soaked through in the armpits with the gel. :( I then had to take my shirt off, wait for it to dry, and then put a new shirt on. The coverage is great, but it&#x27;s just remembering to put it on first thing in the morning to dry before putting on my shirt. Another bonus, it doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks when putting on my shirts too! I just have to remember to put it on BEFORE anything else and let it dry! (NOTE:I was able to test out this product as a part of a promotion for the brand.)</li>
    <li> Was able to try this deodorant free from BzzAgent and I really like it. Helps keep my underarms feeling dry and even when I am working out I feel like it helps to keep me feeling dry and it still smells great through sweat. Really like the scent. The formula doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling which I really love because you can get dressed right after applying it and not get it all over your clothes.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size Secret Outlast deodorant in the scent Completely Clean to try out and here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just start out by saying for one, the scent Completely Clean smells completely amazing. I have gotten several compliments just on the way I smell. Which can be a little odd, especially when I tell them its from my deodorant. But non-the less, it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drys quickly and leaves no white marks on my clothing. It defiantly lasts longer than any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. Through working out and sweating, it keeps me dry and smelling fresh. I will be purchasing a full size stick soon.</li>
    <li> im so glad i got to test out this product thanks to bzzagent,i really enjoy using this deodorant.i normally use the basic bar deodorant and they do work for me but they always leave ugly white marks on my underarm and on my clothes even the ones that claim they dont but this deodorant by secret is amazing! it leaves no white marks at all!! when i applied it felt so nice i was worried it be a thick gel but it was like a cool thin serum and it felt nice and fresh on my skin.after using it several times in the hot california desert weather i do say it works very welll against sweat,im no longer kinda smelly when i sweat so thats awesome! i love the scent not too strong and not to light.im def going to keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant after receiving it for free from BzzAgent. I tested the Completely Clean scent. It changed my mind about gel deodorants. The gel does not leave you feeling sticky or slimy and dries pretty quickly. One of the things that I like about this product is that it does not leave white residue on clothing. I struggle with getting shirts or dresses on without those awful white marks. But Secret Outlast is a gel and solves that problem with ease!! Love how it leaves your underarms smelling fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> I got this awesome deodorant sample from BzzAgent and I fell in love with it!!!! I have always use the solid ones since I hate the feeling of my armpits wet and sticky! But I was so shocked and impressed how fast it dries up and leaves no white marks!!! and most of all the fresh scent it has!!! I would recommend this to everyone!!!!</li>
    <li> The Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant is super easy to apply and dries within seconds! It smells fresh and lasts all day. I had odor and wetness protection for my entire day, except for the normal sweating once I step outside in this 90F degree summer  heat! I did not have any residue left on my clothes, and the pits of  my shirts smelled like deodorant instead of body odor. The Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant outlasted my crazy days of geocaching, running errands, doing yard work, playing frisbee, and studying. Thanks to Secret and Bzzagent, I was able to test this product for free.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent gel deodorant from BzzAgent to try out and review, so let&#x27;s get to it:&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely a big fan of Secret deodorants, but I was disappointed with the clear gel version for multiple reasons. I use the invisible solid version on a daily basis, tried all the available scents you can imagine and I am a HUGE fan of the Secret invisible solid deodorants, they are gentle on my sensitive skin, give me the sensation that I am clean all day (even after a very hard and sweaty day of work). Now on why I disliked the clear gel version:&lt;br /&gt;- First of all: It burns my skin if I use it on the day I shave or day after I shave, which is uncomfortable from the start&lt;br /&gt;- Second: When you sweat, instead of having dry armpits your armpits ALSO get sweaty as if your deodorant is now melting as you sweat and that is ALSO not what I am looking for on a deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;- Third: It&#x27;s more expensive if you compare the clear gel with the invisible solid version, the clear gel is gone very quickly, so you run out of deodorant and end up spending MORE money than you have to. The invisible solid last for AT LEAST double the amount of time (I didn&#x27;t count exactly how many days one last vs. the other, but you see your clear gel running out way too quickly and there is no way you can ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: The ONLY thing I liked about the clear gel was the scent, which was very pleasant. Other than that I recommend you getting the invisible solid instead that ALSO has amazing scents, will save you money and make you feel clean and dry like you&#x27;d expect from an antiperspirant!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Secret Outlastcompletly clear for free via Bad agent i, exchange for honest opinion. Honestly is does what is says. It goes on clear, it&#x27;s a clear liquid. It does help protect from underarm wetness like it says. Not sure for 48 hrs because I tend to shower daily, so that I cannot vouch for. It does dry fairly quickly, but when applying it feels weird. It&#x27;s a gel so kind of weird for me. It doesn&#x27;t run off on clothing, a super plus.I gave it  3 stars because I absolutely cannot stand the smell of alcohol, and when applying it has that smell.Although it only lasts a few seconds, for me it&#x27;s too much. I have a sensitive nose . Other than that the product works like it says it does.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free as part of a BuzzAgent campaign. First off let me say that it does not leave white marks as advertised and the smell was quite nice, but it stops there as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It burned my armpits and I would not say I have sensitive skin and I just couldn&#x27;t get over the cold wet feeling I got from the gel. If I would have bought it, it would have been returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seriously not impressed with Secret Outlast® Clear Gel. The first day, it was great. No white marks, no smudges- golden! But I live in Tennessee, and the summers here are brutal. The first day I went outside with this deodorant on, I knew it had failed. I almost instantly had wet marks on my shirt in the armpit area, and I could smell the telltale armpit smell sneaking through the clear gel barrier. I absolutely love Secret, but from now on I will stick to my Sport protection, Clinical strength from them. Much thanks to BzzAgent for letting me try it before I bought it!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a heavy sweater, but aren&#x27;t a huge fan of paying the higher prices for the clinical strength, I would encourage you to try this.  This might be able to replace my clinical strength antiperspirants that I usually use for most of my daily activities. I would likely still use the clinical for some big events where I know I&#x27;ll be sweating heavily, but this is a great daily use product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a sample through BzzFeed #GotItFree, and am very glad that I had the chance to try it. I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of the clear gels, since they always felt sticky and gloppy, but this seemed to absorb directly and immediately. I wore this for both sports and regular wear, and no white marks was a great feeling on both occasions. I did skip wearing it a few days, to see how the claim of an epic 48 played out, and I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised at not noticing any underarm odor the second day.</li>
    <li> I was one of the lucky few to receive this product as part of a BzzCampaign to try out.  I have to say was mostly very happy with this deodorant.  I found that it worked just as well for me as most clinical versions of deodorants do.  It held back any moisture that I would have had, had I not been wearing deodorant.  I was also happy with how long it lasted.  Not only did it last all day, but it also lasted throughout the night as well.  I get really hot and sometimes even sweaty as I sleep but when I wore this I didn&#x27;t notice any perspiration under my arms.  The only con for me was the scent.  I received this in the &#x27;Completely Clean&#x27; scent.  It&#x27;s not that the scent is offensive or foul-smelling, it&#x27;s just not my scent preference.  It was pretty strong and lasted throughout the day, which I guess is really a good thing that it doesn&#x27;t wear off, but I would have appreciated that quality more if it was a scent I liked.  I found it to be a bit chemical in my opinion, I&#x27;d like to try the powder or unscented scents in the future.</li>
    <li> It smells good and definitely doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, but does not stop the sweat. I sweat a lot and use Secret clinical or Mitchum. The only two that work for me. I was skeptical on using the clear gel, but got is as a sample with BuzzAgent, so I figured now was the time to use! I&#x27;d use it again, but not during very active days.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample from Bzzagent and I was pretty excited to try it. It has been a long time since I used a gel deodorant since I generally don&#x27;t like the wet and sticky application. So when I got this sample I was hoping that it would feel drier but it didn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s still that wet, cold feeling when applying. I even put on as little as possible and just hated the feeling. Now, I gave this review 3 stars because after it dries, it does work! I wore it out on a hot, humid day and wore it when I went to the gym. It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s not as great as the Secret Clinical but it does work, smells nice, and I didn&#x27;t notice/see any white marks anywhere (which is always a plus). So if you&#x27;re looking for something that works, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, and can get over the wet application - this will work well for you.</li>
    <li> I love this secret outlast completely  I got this product for  BzzAgent  to try out and I love how it makes everything better for me because az its hot</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  It really works great.  The gel goes on smooth and dries quickly.  No more white marks on clothes to deal with.  The smell is pleasant and not overly powerful.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I am a member of BzzAgent so I have received this item complimentary from them to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely reluctant to try this product because years prior gel deodorant was simply messy. It took forever to dry, messed up my clothes badly and left them wet. So I was dreading trying this product. To my surprise this product blew me away positively. It was not messy, applied neatly, dried quickly and did not get onto my clothing. Gel deodorants have certainly improved over the years indeed. This will be my new go to deodorant going forward. Its not hard to wash off either. Say goodbye to white balls underneath your armpits forever! Awesome product, totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Really great and awesome product. I was never a big fan of clear gels and would avoid them like the plague. Wet, nasty arm pits are not what you want when applying deodorant. I want a DO that will go on easily, leave not wetness, have an amazing smell and last all day. With working out, cooking in a hot kitchen, running around all day and night and taking care of two children I needs a DO that will help me stay fresh, Secret Outlast Clear Gel does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more sweaty pits that stinks just half way through my day that result in either a shower or most frequently another application of a DO to help control sweat and smell. I know that sounds bad, but really with my crazy life sometimes it was easier to just reapply and head on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Clear Gel goes on clear, smooth and drys basically instantly. It leaves no stains or marks on clothing and it truly last ALL day. I am very impressed, especially after all of my mishaps with clear gels before. I would say give it a try it is WELL worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks BuzzAgent and Secret Outlast for allowing me to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free. It was one of the best experiences ever!</li>
    <li> In recent years I had moved away from clear gel, and on to invisible solids.  When I was invited to do the Bzz campaign I was exicted to give this deoderant a try because I have always had great luck with Secret products.  Dealing with the heat and humidity this summer I definitely put this deoderant to the test!  I was very impressed by the staying power and pleasant scent.  Felt great even after a long day!</li>
    <li> Tried this deodorant for free from Secret via BzzAgent and was surprisingly impressed! I usually wear Secret Clinical Strength and was hesitant to switch. But it&#x27;s great! It dries super quickly and smells lovely. Most importantly, it&#x27;s clear and it works just as well as the Clinical Strength!</li>
    <li> When it comes to deodorant I am a bit of a snob and rarely try another but when the BzzCampaign came out I figured I would give it a shot - it was free after all, and I liked my deodorant but hated the traces it left on my clothes if I smeared it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely happy with the scent and how well it went on and the cool, invigorating feeling as it hit my skin.  Sometimes these products can cause irritation and I was very happy to see that even after I shaved it made the skin feel refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a business owner and mother and always on the go and whether at the gym or running around I did not fear that my deordorant was not working. Secret has always made great products but this deordorant glides easily on the skin, does not irritate, is not overly scented (does not compete with my perfume when I use it) and does not leave a nasty reside or film on clothes or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my new and only deordorant.</li>
    <li> (I got this for free from Bzzagent.com.) I wasn&#x27;t so sure about trying this - I&#x27;m not a fan of gels, have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t really have a huge issue with sweating and/or odor. Still, I was getting it free so I thought I would try it. I used it for 2 days in a row on three different times. I was correct in my doubts. I really did not like the feeling of the gel as I put it on. PLUS the amount I got varied from nearly nothing to WAY too much. (You turn the thing for 2 clicks and it is supposed to give you the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; amount to put on.) I did NOT like the smell - just not a pleasant smell to me. And I am not sure if it is the scent or the gel, but after two days of use (each time) my skin started to itch. Badly. After the third attempt I also started to develop little pimple like bumps under my arms. NOT fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the beauty of having so many choices is that we get to find what works for our personal tastes. This particular product is just not for me. But, hey, maybe it&#x27;ll work for you?</li>
    <li> I had tried Secret products in the past, so when the offer came to try a free sample of their clear outlast gel I thought, Why not? I had a fancy wedding to go to and had a little black and red dress to wear and thought already about my old deodorant and that I needed something new that wouldn&#x27;t leave a mark. I decided to test the Secret Outlast that I got with a black tee first. It worked great! I loved the scent (clean I believe it was called) it was not too overwhelming and didn&#x27;t already smell like B.O. The test run was a success as there were no marks on the inside of my shirt even. The night of the wedding I didn&#x27;t sweat or have white stains on my dress even though I boogied hard, so all in all it was a good product. It does feel a little sticky at first, but seemed to dry fast and once it did, it was good to go the rest of the day. I have been wearing it regularly since with no complaints! I noticed there is even an unscented option which I bought and have not used yet.</li>
    <li> I was given this product by BzzAgent to review; I am not required to post a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this gel deodorant!  I feared it would take a long time to dry like I have experienced in the past, but this kind does NOT!  I intentionally did not give it extra dry time, and didn&#x27;t even notice how long it took--which is good!  No marks on my clothes, no stink later in the day.  I did not have complete dryness, although it is marketed as such, but I am a difficult crowd there anyway :)  It also smells terrific, which is a HUGE plus for me.</li>
    <li> One of the PERKS of being a BzzAgent is receiving awesome products to sample and review such as Secrets Outlast deodorant. I am very impressed with the Secret Outlast product. I have always used Secret Solid but after trying the Secret Outlast product I am now switching over. It leaves no white residue on clothing and really lasts a long time. The fragrance is not to overwhelming and leaves me feeling fresh all day. I am one satisfied product user.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL from Bzzagent.com. The scent is  not overwhelming at all like some deodorants and smell like lavender . It dries almost instantly, you hardly even know its there! You can&#x27;t apply it when you wear black clothes because it have some white residue that left in the dress. It is easy to supplicate by using the twist at the bottom to pop the gel out and just a little swipe under each arm and you are through. It does keep  you odor free for a long time before shower. It good for people that does a lot of moving around such as running, workout in the gym, construction and etc... It last more compared to other deodorants. I would definitely buy and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free as a sample and have had a really great experience with it. The last time I voluntarily tried a clear deodorant was in 1999 - I borrowed my mom&#x27;s and wiped it right off when it wouldn&#x27;t dry, so I was admittedly a bit skeptical about this product. I must say though, I have been pleasantly surprised. The &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; has no discernible scent, which I love. It goes on easy and really does only take a few seconds to dry (it seems to dry faster if you don&#x27;t put your arms right back down). I have hyperhydrosis, so I&#x27;m used to being a sweaty mess all the time, but this has really kept my underarms dry and comfortable, even during a major workout or long run. The best part? No white marks on your shirts - you can change your clothes without worrying about it transferring, and it has never left a mark on my favorite sleeveless black dress. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this free from Secret for being a BzzAgent. I like it. I actually forgot to put deodorant on one day. Then remembered I used Secret Outlast Completely Clear the day before. I didn&#x27;t sweat it! It kept me protected through two days, with no wetness, nor odor. One thing I have to share is I wished it dried a bit faster after application.</li>
    <li> When I was offered a chance to review this gel deodorant by BzzAgent, I jumped at the chance. Previously, I avoided gel deodorants because they seemed messy and not as effective as the solids I am used to. I was SO wrong! I received one clear gel deodorant for free (I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand) and I love it, it is my new go-to! I cannot wait to try other scents. I was skeptical at first, but just 1-2 clicks covers me for the day/night! It is a nice clean scent, not too overpowering. One other thing that won me over, this deodorant leave NO white marks or streaks on my outfits! LOVE!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean clear gel as a BzzAgent campaign. I was incredibly skeptical at first. I actually _like_ being able to see that I have deodorant on. Yes, I know, I&#x27;m weird like that. But there&#x27;s something reassuring about being able to see that I&#x27;m protected (especially since I&#x27;m pretty absent-mined sometimes, and I&#x27;ll wonder if I put any on). Plus, I thought that if I couldn&#x27;t see it, then there was no way it was actually on and working.    I was very, very wrong. The gel goes on and dries within 10 seconds (if that). It&#x27;s 100% clear, which is pretty cool. And it smells really nice all day long! I usually have to reapply later on in the day since I&#x27;m fairly active, and some of the other brands wear off mid-day. I was very pleasantly surprised. It even still smelled nice after my daily 30 minute cardio workout - I definitely can&#x27;t say that for some of the other brands!    The gel also seems to last longer than the directions say it will. I can get by with only using two \\&quot;clicks\\&quot;, as opposed to the directions that say you need three. (Side note: I didn&#x27;t specifically grab the tube to read the directions. I know how deodorant works. It was more of a curiosity to see how long the whole bottle would last.) But two clicks get me through my entire day with no problems, and I still smell good when I wake up the next morning.    I am not quite brave enough to try to make it the whole 48 hours that Secret says this will last. My luck, I wouldn&#x27;t notice it not working, but my co-workers would. But a full 24 hours is more than enough for me!    The only downfall to this is man-oh-man does it go on cold in the winter! It definitely wakes you up in the morning, though. It&#x27;s not unbearable, but it takes some getting used to.    I would definitely buy this again! Thanks for a great product, Secret!</li>
    <li> I Love love love the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel ! It works ladies! I stay fresh all day ( even after a workout ) and absolutely no white spots! I&#x27;m a Bzzagent, and as a Bzzagent I got to try this product for free. I really didn&#x27;t think this would work because I&#x27;ve tried clear deodorant before and it usually dries up and wears off pretty early on. Not this stuff! I went to the gym, ran errands in my gym clothes all day and by the end of the night I was still smelling fresh and no white marks. I highly recommend the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to everyone!</li>
    <li> When clear deodorants first came out, I tried them but wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  So I was very hesitant to try again with Secret Outlast.  I started this out fresh; fresh out of the shower and ready for the day.  The scent was nice and the wetness protection actually worked!!! I was amazed!  Looks like I found a new deodorant for myself and my daughters!  Thanks Secret!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. No white markings and protection throughout the day . What I can use both my current job , which is a bit sedentary , but also for more active work , like when you exercise and still continue to be protected from bad odors. Recommend this product : Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. 5 stars !!!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Gel from Bzagent for review purposes and had to report on this great little necessity. The gel formula is great if you like wearing black clothes a lot but hate any marks deodorants would leave when putting clothes on. Also, I found that it is effective at eliminating odors throughout the day. However, I did not test for the 48-hour claim as that would mean going 2 days without showering, The only thins I might add is that it has strong active ingredient, so if you are very sensitive, you might want to keep that in mind when trying for the first time.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent is a clear gel that works great and does not leave marks on your clothing.  I am famous for getting deodorant marks on my dark colored shirts and was pleased to find out that wasn&#x27;t happening with Secret Outlast.  It is a clean non overpowering scent that last though out the day even on the days I am more active. I much prefer this to solids and sprays.  I received this as part of a Bzzagent campaign, but have made the switch and am happy to finally find a deodorant that stays on my skin not my clothes.</li>
    <li> I have had a generally good opinion of Secret deodorant. However, I normally use the invisible solid.  I received the clear gel as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and this was the first time I tried the clear gel. I have definitely been impressed with this deodorant. Not only did it not leave any marks on my clothes, my underarms remained dry and smelled completely clean throughout the day. The fragrance of this deodorant is not overwhelming, and smells great. I would highly recommend this deodorant to anyone. I will be using the Secret clear gel from now on!</li>
    <li> This was such a pleasant surprise thanks to BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product out for FREE! It keeps me dry, and helps me feel fresh all day without feeling weighted down. I love that Secret gel goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t get all over my shirts like some other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Secret is most often my go-to deodorant.  I sometimes have a little sensitivity to some other brands. I have never had that issue with any of the Secret brand products. So when I was invited to try The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel  as a promotional trial I did not hesitate or worry about it bothering my skin.&lt;br /&gt; I normally use the solids so the gel was a bit of a change for me. It felt different going on. It had a cool sensation that I am not use to but dried rather quickly. I had not previously tried a gel because I was worried about it leaving a damp sensation but it was not an issue at all. The first time I used it, I likely let it dry longer than it had needed to just to be safe when getting dressed.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the smell. It reminds me of clothes drying on the line in the spring. My best description is a cross between a typical clean linen scented oil warmer and sunshine. Very Pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Brand I trust!&lt;br /&gt;Reliable even under strenuous conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Great Smell!&lt;br /&gt;No annoying residue or clothes staining.&lt;br /&gt;Secret is always priced right for my budget and always has money saving offers available, big Plusses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no cons to list. I honestly like it and cannot find a bad word to say.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean compliments of Secret and BzzAgent to try free.  This antiperspirant/deodorant claims to leave no white marks on clothing and gives 48 hour odor protection.  I was skeptical of these claims as I&#x27;ve tried other brands making the same claim but those proved to be false.  However, the Secret Outlast Completely Clean held up to both claims to my surprise.  I first wore a black turtleneck shirt to see if indeed there wouldn&#x27;t be any white marks....there wasn&#x27;t any white marks at all!  As for the 48 hour protection, sometimes on weekends if I don&#x27;t have any plans and I&#x27;m just working around the house, I won&#x27;t shower everyday hence this would be a great test as to the 48 hour protection claim.  Once again, this product lived up to the 48 hour claim.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being very happy with no white marks and the 48 hour protection, I really enjoyed the scent.  It wasn&#x27;t overbearing or flower smelling.  I was also pleased with the applicator.  It allowed me to put on just the right amount without oozing all over after using.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel works great.  It&#x27;s very comfortable to put on, it doesn&#x27;t feel wet when I put it on, and doesn&#x27;t show on your clothes.  Most importantly, it works all day long.  I didn&#x27;t have to wait for the deodorant to dry before getting dressed, and didn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt.  I definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Gotitfree from Bzzagent</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try this product through BzzAgent (#GotItFree) and was pleasantly surprised.  I shied away from gel deodorants for a long time, as the cold jolt to the armpit coupled with the forever drying time was not worth the mediocre protection other products provided.  I&#x27;ve been putting this through its paces for two weeks now, including very active days at work and maybe a day or two where I forgot to apply...but the protection was still there!  The scent is light and not overpowering and I don&#x27;t have any of those really annoying white streaks on my darker tops.  This product is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant.  In fact, it is my new favorite deodorant.  It offers everything I need and want in a deodorant - nice, fresh scent; no white marks on my clothing and it really works - I feel fresh, clean and odor-free all day long!  I received a free trial of this deodorant for the purpose of my review, and I&#x27;m grateful I had the chance to try it.  I would recommend it...it&#x27;s the best deodorant you can get!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great deodorant!  Lives up to all its claims - 48 hr odor protection, no white marks, rapid drying.  I received a free sample from BzzAgent.com to review.</li>
    <li> This product really does dry fast and when I put on my shirt and looked in the mirror I didn&#x27;t have any white marks to wipe off. It kept me feeling dry and smelling good all day. I received a sample to try but I will be buying Secret Outlast Completely Clean from now on. #GotItFree #ClearlyBetter</li>
    <li> The secret outlast clear gel comes in a decent size and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks as promised. The smell is not overpowering. Be cautious when you turn to use the gel, if you twist too much a lot of it might come out. Left me dry all day.    I got it free from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> My old deodorant wasn&#x27;t holding up all day anymore!  :(  Tried out Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel when it arrived FREE from bzzagent!  Dried quickly, no white marks, and kept me dry all day…  and I run around after a house full of littles all day!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t LOVE about Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel was it stings a little if you apply after shaving *ouch*!</li>
    <li> We love Secret Outlast in my house. Its perfect for me, because I tend to sweat directly under my arms and it keeps things nice and dry. My daughter loves the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn her arm pit after shaving. Win Win for us.</li>
    <li> Secret missed the mark on this one. I am a #BzzAgent and I #GotItFree to try. Excitement faded almost as quickly as the deodorant. 48 hours? Ha! I was lucky to get through 8 hours - working at a desk! Goes on cold, wet, and sticky and unless you leave your arms up for 2-3 minutes it will stay that way ALL DAY. The scent is okay, but a little strong after first applying. After the first day I actually picked it up and read the directions on the back just to make sure I didn&#x27;t use it wrong. Surely Secret would have produced a better product than this? Nope. Directions call for ONE click per arm. It takes at least 2-3 clicks per arm. Just about all the advertising/hype for this product is false but I will say that I did not have any white marks and sweat didn&#x27;t permeate my shirt. For the price this deodorant was a complete and utter disappointment. The other Secret varieties work MUCH better.</li>
    <li> I had been really unhappy with my regular deodorant/antiperspirant and then Bzzagent selected me for the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel campaign and sent it to me to try for free. I was eager to try this new product. I immediately liked it. The scent is nice and light, the gel applied easily and dried fast. There was no staining on my clothes like with a stick deodorant. The Secret gel, protected me all day. I did not smell any offensive odor and I was outside working up a sweat. I will absolutely be purchasing the Secret Outlast Gel. It will replace what I previously used for sure!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast free to try from BzzAgent. I typically use a dry solid, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a gel. As it turns out, this one is not too bad! The directions say to give it 2-3 &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; to dispense the gel, but I never use that much. I use 1 click. I was expecting a cold, wet feeling when I applied the deodorant, but that never happens. It goes on feeling comfortable. It is supposed to provide protection for 48 hours. On a normal day I wouldn&#x27;t have a need to test out that claim. But one weekend morning I was staying home, so I didn&#x27;t shower or use more Secret. I can say it seemed to do the job! The scent is called Completely Clean. I like the clean scent, but more as a cleaning product, not for a deodorant. However, the scent dissipates pretty quickly upon application, so the scent is not all that important. I may buy Secret Outlast again in the future, but I would prefer a different scent.</li>
    <li> I received this #Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel #for free since I am a BzzAgent. I was skeptical that a deo would advertise it lasting so long and no white marks. Well. I&#x27;ve been using my Secret Clear Gel for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s still doing it&#x27;s job perfectly! I&#x27;ve went out and bought more to stock pile up because I sweat profusely. This Secret Outlast Clear Gel is #clearly better in my own opinion. I would encourage everyone to at least give it a try. It&#x27;s #clearly better than any other antiperspirant on the market. These statements are my own and I #got it free for being a #BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I received this antiperspirant from BzzAgent to review. It was great timing as I was getting frustrated with my deoderants not lasting the whole day. I had numerous brands and none lasted. Plus I hate the white marks I always seem to get on my clothes. Anyway I got this and was a bit skeptical. I normally steer clear of the gels because they take way to long to dry. This dries in seconds. And as an added bonus it lasts all day! I have found my new deoderant / antiperspirant. It&#x27;s not sticky like other gels tend to be and dries in seconds! Love it!</li>
    <li> This clear gel is truly clear.  I wear a lot of black and a bunch of colorful bras.  I never see any residue of my deodorant.  I&#x27;ve always used Secret for my deodorant but usually get the cheaper ones.  They work great as well but outlast really does \\&quot;outlast\\&quot;!  I recommend the upgrade to all Secret users!  I received a sample of this to review from Bzz Agent.</li>
    <li> I got a full sized sample of Secret Outlast Completely clean for free as part of a promotion. I had my reservations at first. In the past, gels have been very sticky and a deodorant that lasts 48 HOURS!!!! that is unbelievable. I have to say, I am so glad I got this sample because it has changed my opinion of clear deodorants forever! It goes on easily and dries so fast. It is honestly like putting on a solid but even less sticky. I love that it is clear because there are no white marks.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the odor protection part, it really works for at least 24 hours. I am a creature of habit and have not gone past 24 hours before reapplying. I ran a 5K and that was the ultimate test. I applied the antiperspirant the night before the race. I was amazed that my armpits were dry after the race.&lt;br /&gt;I love this and will continue to use it when my sample runs out.</li>
    <li> I am a Cub Scout leader and camping has become a regular weekend activity. When you&#x27;re tramping around the woods with a dozen boys and several men, &amp;#34;I need a shower&amp;#34; becomes an archaic phrase. However, this mama likes to smell good - well, at least I like to NOT smell - which led to a bizarre routine of wet wipes, deodorant and baby powder. Thus, when BzzAgent asked me to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, which promised 48-hour protection without the gunk of regular deodorants, I jumped on the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I must admit, I was skeptical. The gel deodorants I have tried in the past have been rather sticky and uncomfortable. But, hey, I&#x27;m up for a challenge and it couldn&#x27;t be worse than smelling like a clean baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great. Honestly, great. The clear gel is a bit wet at first, but dries quickly. No white smudges when I pulled a black tank over my head. We headed out for a weekend of camping, hiking, canoeing and no showers. Twenty-four hours later, I did the sniff test. No smell. Forty-eight hours later, no smell. Nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the secret&#x27;s out - Secret Outlast truly outlasted my weekend and overcame the eau de camping body. I ditched that old solid when I got home and am happily dry and smell free! (Now, if they&#x27;ll just come up with something that works as well to keep my hair decent for 48 hours!)</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample from BzzAgent and was willing to try but skeptical since I have very sensitive skin and when I change products it can mean disaster for my skin. However a month later my armpits are still looking and feeling great. I might have found a new deodorant that will keep me dry and fresh with no white residue!</li>
    <li> Great deodorant that doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied over and over. Once a day with this deodorant will definitely keep you smelling good all day long. Lasts longer than normal because you only need to click it once and swipe twice and not need to reapply over and over. The smell of it is not to soft and not to strong. Also doesn&#x27;t leave those horribly deodorant marks on my clothes which is a win in it&#x27;s own. Great overall product!!</li>
    <li> I have always love the Secret deodorant brand, but I really love the Outlast. It has a nice scent to it that is not too strong when you are wearing it. I also love the fact that it is a gel. It does not leave white marks in your dark clothes either, which is a huge plus. I know this because I purposely wiped it on my black shirt to see what would happen lol I would say you are able to go 24 hours without reapplying but I think 48 hours might be pushing it. Overall I give this 5 stars. Thanks BzzAgent and Secret for letting me try this free!</li>
    <li> The first thing I can say is Wow! Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is magnificent. At first I was a little denied by my previous experiences with deodorant gel had not been good. I did not like at all the wet sensation that left. But with Outlast® Secret Completely Clean Clear Gel does not happen, it dries almost instantly. The scent is fresh, and not have to worry about the marks on clothing. Thanks BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I am a busy mom and I work full time. I get about an hour to myself every night. Sometimes, I don&#x27;t have time to shower every day and often skip a day or two. I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel complimentary from BzzAgent and Secret, and thought it would be an awesome product to try. I wasn&#x27;t totally sold on the gel aspect of it, however. I typically use solid stick antiperspirant because it dries fast and works great for me. So on my first day of trying this product, I thought it felt icky. It went on wet and I had to wait some time for it to dry. But it worked great! It kept me sweat free and smelling fresh between showers. The more I used it, the more I liked it. I don&#x27;t get that icky feeling when I put it on anymore and can&#x27;t argue with the results. And it doesn&#x27;t mark up your clothes. I definitely will consider purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to be selected to be part of the Bzzagent Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel campaign and was able to try the product for free.  I had never tried a gel deodorant and was really excited about Secret Outlast&#x27;s claim that it would not leave white marks on dark clothes.  My current deodorant always leaves white marks on my clothes and they don&#x27;t always come out in the laundry on the first washing and need to be re-washed a second time.    When my kit arrived, I could hardly wait until the next morning to try it out.  When I first opened it, I gave it the sniff test.  I am very particular about the smells of my personal care items.  I do not like anything that is too strong smelling or flowery or perfumey.  Secret Outlast passed the test!  It didn&#x27;t smell too strong and the smell was pleasant.  I can&#x27;t really describe what it smelled like because it wasn&#x27;t flowery or perfumey or like powder or fruity or like normal air freshener scents.  It is just light and pleasant.    When I first &#x60;rolled it up&#x27;, it is not at all what I was expecting.  I had assumed that a gel deodorant would still be solid, but just softer.  This was wet and almost the texture of applesauce.  I put it on and would describe it as a cold, wet, kind of icky feeling.  My first thought was that there is no way I was using this.  But, since I committed to the campaign, I felt it was my duty to continue on and use it until at least 25% of it was gone to give it a fair trial.  After using it for several weeks now, I am used to the wet feeling and the strange texture so it no longer bothers me. Just make sure to apply it before you get dressed or the wet gel will get on your clothes!  It dries pretty fast.  I am surprised at how fast I am going through the deodorant though.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long as a regular solid deodorant.    I am super thrilled to report that Secret Outlast&#x27;s claims are correct!!  Their Completely Clean Clear Gel does not leave any white residue onclothes!  This is fantastic and why I gave it 4 stars.    The deodorant does also work as well as my usual product does...but doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better.  Sometimes I do still sweat while using it, but I have not found that it emits any odor so their claims to that effect are correct as well.    I would recommend this product to others.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as my usual product and I still don&#x27;t love the wet feeling when applying it.  I still use my original product though if I am already dressed and forgot to apply it so that the wet gel doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes before it dries.</li>
    <li> I needed to try a new deodorant.  I love Secret but have always used the invisible solid. I have a very busy, active lifestyle and lately, I had noticed my deodorant was not holding up its end of the bargain by the end of the day and I needed to reapply. While I was researching new deodorants to to try, Bzzagent had contacted me to try this for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use, I was impressed with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deoderant. It went on clear and I didn&#x27;t worry about streaks on my black shirt. Putting it on, it did feel a little different than the solid that I normally use...it was more wet and it kinda felt funny, but it dried very quickly and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything.  I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work since i could FEEL the deodorant on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I wore this deoderant, I had an extremely busy day and night. I was constantly on the move. It wasn&#x27;t until I got in my car to head home that I remembered the new deoderant that I had put on that day. Of course I did what any normal person would do...I sniffed my armpit. I was amazed that the deoderant had held up all day. The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel doesn&#x27;t have a strong sent, but it smells clean...I could still smell that clean scent at the end of the day. It definitely holds up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While i don&#x27;t think i can go 48 hours using this deodorant without having to reapply, but the 24 hours i was wearing it, it definitely held up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased solid deodorants so I was excited to try this clear gel formula, provided by BzzAgent  I really liked the scent of it! It also provided good protection throughout the day, against odor and sweat.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like was just the wet, cold feeling upon applying.  It&#x27;s getting colder as we go into winter and it just felt unpleasant to apply this wet cold substance in my underarm area.  Also, when I first tried it, I felt like clicking the dial once brought out too much product and felt too &#x27;wet.&#x27;  I think I&#x27;ll like to use this more in the summertime, but it&#x27;s a nice deodorant to still have and use, especially when I want to guarantee no white marks!</li>
    <li> I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant for free as part of a BZZAGENT campaign. It couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time! I wore it when I volunteered for Halloween at my son&#x27;s school. I spent the day running around like crazy and the Secret kept me dry and smelling fresh! It also kept my black dress free of white marks. This really is a great product for everyday that has be covered when my day gets crazy. I will defiantly buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I received SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL through a Bzzagent campaign.  At first I was skeptical but became pleasantly surprised.  While I am not a fan of clear gels, if it works as advertised I will use.  While the deodorant does not work as well as OTC prescription strength I use it as part of my deodorant rotation.  The gel does have that cold clammy feel to it, but does dry and does not leave white marks on my clothing.  I would recommend to someone who needs a reliable deodorant to their rotation.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a BzzCampaign through BzzAgent, and recommend it. True to its claims, it does provide great odor and wetness production, along with confidence of no more white streaks on your clothes due to the clear gel formulation and its quick-drying properties. I normally use Secret Clinical and this Outlast Clear Gel formula gives me similar protection with no smudges, even on my black sweaters! The only minor complaint is that it is cold when first applying.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free from BuzzAgent! I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the wetness. It actually dries super fast and I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the embarrassing white marks. I give Secret Outlast a thumbs up!!!!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel starts working before I sweat.  It goes on clear, does not leave residue on my clothing or skin, and definately comes in handy on my most stressfull days!!!  Got it free by being a BzzAgent!!!  #GotItFree  #ClearlyBetter</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Outlast Clear Gel for a few weeks now in place of the invisible solid that I have been using for years.  Some things I like.  Some things I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Completely Clean fragrance which I was very satisfied with.  I don&#x27;t like smelling like a bowl of fruit or bouquet of flowers, so this simple, clean, fresh scent is very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using a gel deodorant.  The package directions suggests using 2-3 clicks.  I applied 2 clicks per underarm.  I had major flashbacks to my roll-on days - NOT pleasant memories.  The product was wet and sticky when applied.  I had to hold my arms up for several minutes in order for the deodorant to dry.  This seems like a step backward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a significant amount of my time in a volunteer work that requires me to spend time in and out of the car.  During the winter months that means dressing for frigid temperatures then sitting in a warm car.  I noticed a sticky feeling under my arms as I got a little warm in the car.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because Secret Outlast is not that great of an antiperspirant or if the increase in temperature reactivated the gel.  Either way, it was uncomfortable enough for me to not want to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast does provide excellent odor protection.  Even in the case where I felt the wetness protection lacking, I detected NO unpleasant odor.  Since the product boasts 48 hour protection, I decided to put it to the test.  My schedule allows me to be at home 2 days in a row, so I opted to go without a shower to see if Secret Outlast really provided odor protection during this time period.  It definitely did.  Keep in mind, I spent both days limiting my activity to normal household chores.  But the odor protection lived up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast claims to leave no white marks on clothes.  Again, I wanted to put this to the test.  I made it a point on two separate occasions to wear a black shirt and a navy blue sweater.  After taking them off, I turned each inside out and saw NO white marks.  This really impressed my, but not enough to override the sticky, wet feel of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that I noticed after a couple weeks&#x27; use was how quickly I was consuming this product.  After two weeks, about half the deodorant was gone.  I am accustomed to my invisible solid lasting 2-3 months.  Not only do I not want to pay the extra money, but I am not interested in having to buy deodorant twice as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a complimentary product by BzzAgent.com to test and provide reviews.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from BZZAGENT.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I was a little skeptical at first but I gave it a try. I always use a solid stick as I do not like the stickiness of gels. I have used it for over 2 weeks and absolutely love it! The scent is fresh, it keeps you dry all day AND........NO WHITE MARKS ON YOUR CLOTHES! It glides on smooth and dries very quickly. I am going to try the &amp;#34;Ooh La-La Lavender scent next! I would recommend Secret Outlast to all of the Women out there.</li>
    <li> When I received my free sample of this product from BzzAgent I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve tried gel products in the past and not been a big fan. I&#x27;ve been using invisible solids for a while. But after trying this product I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upsides: The gel, though it goes on wet, dries really quickly. I have not had to worry about any white marks on clothing which has been really nice as well. It does seem to work well at keeping me dry and smelling good throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides: I don&#x27;t think it lasts for 48 hours without re-applying. The gel does not come out evenly. It says 2 clicks of the dial. Sometimes 2 clicks gets you no gel and other times 1 click gets you way too much. You have to mess with the dial alot to get the desired amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would purchase when my sample runs out. No white marks, dries quickly, keeps me dry. What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> I received this to try for free from BzzAgent, but all opinions are my own. I must say, I was so skeptical about this deodorant. Usually when deodorants claim to last long, I get very skeptical about it. We all know how that goes. I  really was very impressed with this product! I can&#x27;t say if it lasted 48 hours, but when i would shower daily, I could still smell the deodorant and it would still be holding up perfectly. It smells great! It goes on clear and it LASTS! I love this deodorant! This will be my go to deodorant especially during the summer months when I am out and about in the heat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent trying this deodorant for free thanks to Secret. I will be honest and say that this deodorant does work as well as it claims to. The only problem I have found is that the scent is a bit to strong for me. I prefer a milder and more delicate smell from my deodorant that doesn&#x27;t conflict with my perfume.</li>
    <li> I tried a free sample as a BZZagent.  I have used secret deodorant for years, but I haven&#x27;t used the gel until this sample was sent to me.  I was afraid that I would feel sticky after using the gel.  But I was surprised at how quickly it dried and then I felt clean all day!  I especially love using it after a good run.  I also love that it is clear, so it doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes.</li>
    <li> I got this product from bzzagent for free to try out. While I think it smells amazing, it doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly but it does last for hours and even in 100° weather. I probably won&#x27;t buy it. But I think others might enjoy it if you like clear gel style. I prefer solid.</li>
    <li> I was once a skeptic of gel type deodorants, but after getting the opportunity to try this product for free, thanks to BzzAgent, I am now hooked. I not only feel refreshed after applying the Secret Outlast Clear Gel, but smell great as well! It definitely held up to its promise of all day protection!</li>
    <li> I have a serious sweating problem and have gotten to the point where I always need to use the clinical strength deodorants/antiperspirants. I was skeptical that this product would work well for me, but was open to trying it out. I was pleasantly surprised - this product works better for me than most of the clinical strength products out there! It also has a light, fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I will definitely be purchasing this when my sample runs out! I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Secret!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical trying this deodorant for a few reasons. First of all, something about applying a cold wet gel as a deodorant did not seem pleasant, and other reason was that I tend to sweat a lot so I wasn&#x27;t sure if a gel would help or contribute to my problem. Well I was very pleasantly surprised. It did take a few days to get used to the feeling of the gel. But it helped with my sweating, and it seems to last all day. I just apply it before I put on my shirt, and let it dry while I put on my makeup... but the time I&#x27;m done, its dry and I&#x27;m ready to get dressed. It has a nice smell that&#x27;s not too overwhelming. Another added bonus is I don&#x27;t have to worry about deodorant stains on my clothes, which is so nice since my favorite color to wear is black. * I was given a free sample from bzzagent but all my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free from BzzAgent to review and test. well i was trying Secret outlast completely like one month and i am not a big huge for this kind of deodorant i prefer more on spray but i really like it, make me feel great for 48 hours and super fresh, i can do my routine like every day i am not worry for my deodorant anymore, of course i would recommended my family and friends...:)</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m testing this product for free from Secret through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and I really like it! I&#x27;m a huge Dove fan and never cheated with them till now after receiving a free sample from BzzAgent.I t&#x27;s clear as it say and when you put it on, you have to wait for it to dry. Make sure after you shower, your arm pits are dry! I didn&#x27;t wipe my armpit dry s well since I was in a hurry and put on the Clear Gel and at the end of the day... I could smell my self!!! Lol Obviously!! Usually with Dove, I can smell my self a little at the end of the day... I thought it was normal till I used Secret Outlast Clear Gel. With the Secret Outlast Clear Gel (using it correctly), I didn&#x27;t smell any order at the end of the day... I think this deodorant works way better then the Dove... everybody has different experience and opinion and this was mine and I&#x27;m loving every second of it. But the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is... it&#x27;s hard to wash off during shower since its like a waterproof. But hey, now we know during summer time at the beach/pool this will work all day! After this is gone, I will be replacing my Dove Deodorant with Secret Outlast now... sorry Dove.&lt;br /&gt;I have edited this since I received another free sample of this.</li>
    <li> Since having a child I seem to need more help in the deodorant department. Maybe it&#x27;s a hormone change or maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m running after a toddler all day. The summer puts me through my paces being hot as the face of the sun outside and running after a toddler and a dog all day and basically finding no relief at night. Let me tell you this stuff gets my seal of approval! I&#x27;ve tried gel deodorant before and had terrible experiences of caking and cracking, not attractive stuff. I loved how quickly it dried once I put it on and how it really did last 48 hours. The smell is also really great which is always a plus. I am a gel convert and this is my go to stuff. I was so lucky to get to try this stuff via BzzAgent to try and review as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a free sample from BzzAgent and as blah as I generally feel about deodorant (I mean who really cares what we use as long as it works?) I was pleasantly surprised. I stopped using women&#x27;s deodorant almost a year ago because I was tired of paying over $8 for a stick (of the clinical strength stuff) and only mildly being protected and still being sweaty and slightly smelly. I started using men&#x27;s and was much happier, albeit more manly scented now. When this came in the mail, in the middle of a hot Georgia summer, I thought, &amp;#34;Here goes a waste of time...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold though, it actually works! I&#x27;m a vet tech student doing lots of manual labor most days and super busy so I need something that is gonna keep me dry and feeling fresh during the day and not looking/feeling like a ball of sweaty gym clothes when I get home. This is the ticket. No sweat, zero pit stains, no white marks, decently scented (I don&#x27;t really care for the scent, but it is better than BO), and lasts all day. Seriously, I might get to buy women&#x27;s deodorant again!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Bzzagent I got to try this for free for my review! Love the smell and the fact that it works!! I always hated the gels due to staining and the goopy feeling. With this one I didn&#x27;t have to worry about marks and after sweating for awhile I didn&#x27;t smell an odor, just the fresh smell of my deodorant!! Thanks Secret!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of secret outlast deodorant. I am loyal to my current brand but was willing to try this out. I loved the fact that it goes on clear I am not a fan of white deodorant residue on my clothing. So this did not disappoint also it kept me dry and clean even after an intense workout. I definitely recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Much better than expected! One click is enough deodorant to last the entire day. It makes you feel as if you are not wasting since it portions itself out. Goes on smooth, stays on all day, light smell, no white marks! Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend it. This product came to me through a BzzAgent kit to try. I will be purchasing soon!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is incredible. I had the small travel size that secret had given me to try out for free and it lasted me an entire month. I NEVER had to reapply and even though it was a gel I never felt gooey or yucky under my arms better yet I was dry. I loved the sent it gave off even on the second day. There is also no need to apply everyday because I had complete coverage for 2 days and if I was lucky sometimes 3. All you need is one click of the dial and no more. If you are debating on purchasing it don&#x27;t you will NOT be disappointed. I will be purchasing mine very shortly because I just ran out and I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Secret deodorant for years, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll wear.  After recieving a sample of Secret Outlast, I was surprised to find that it is my new favorite!!  It has a nice, clean scent and is not sticky to apply.  It gives me confidence to be clean and fresh throughout the day.  I was even able to go straight to the store after working out, and I didn&#x27;t think twice!!  You&#x27;ve &amp;#34;outlasted&amp;#34; my expectations Secret, thanks!!  #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Works fine, but still have white deodorant marks on clothing :-(</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant. It smells amazing along with very good sweat protection.The only downside is there is not a lot in each stick and It gone very fast. :(</li>
    <li> I tried out this deodorant as part of a BzzAgent campaign where Secret sent me a free sample size deodorant. I had tried other Secret products in the past but I was excited to try the new Outlast Completely Clean Scent since I do not like having white marks on my clothes or smelling unfresh!!! After 4 weeks of trying the product I&#x27;m happy to report my complete satisfaction! 1. No white marks! 2. Dries fast 3. It really does last all day 4. No bad odors 5. Love the Clean scent, smells so fresh If you are someone that sweats excessively and maybe you&#x27;ve even considered a prescribed deodorant, I strongly recommend that you try this deodorant! It protects us women that sweat like a man, but provides a light scent to remind us of our femininity.</li>
    <li> I am thankful that BzzAgent sent me this product to try out. I have tried Secret before and it has never let me down. With Secret Outlast Clear Gel I never have to worry about white marks or worry if my deodorant is going to fail me, because it won&#x27;t, not with 48 hours of protection at least. I will be getting Secret Outlast again in my near future!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to say I&#x27;ve always been stinky, but I&#x27;ve definitely had a difficult time finding one that lasts for as long as I do! I was given the opportunity to try this product via #BzzAgent, and I am so glad I did. I am used to working long hours and enduring intense exercise and nothing seemed to hold up! This is honestly the FIRST deodorant where I haven&#x27;t had to do a sniff check! lol! I recently ran out of my sample and so you know what I did? I ran right out to buy another! I love that they have an assortment of scents to choose from. My sample was this Completely Clean gel and I bought the Cocoa Butter one. I am VERY happy with this product and that I&#x27;ve finally found something that works!! #GotitFree #Secretdeodorant</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free to test from secret. I love this deodorant! It really lasts a long time! It goes on smooth and dries quickly. Does not rub off. And they offer a lot of amazing scents!</li>
    <li> So usually I don&#x27;t like gel deodorant.  It feels nasty going on under my arms and I feel like in sweat more when I wearing it. I got a trial size of it for free through me being a bzzagent. At first I was skeptical, I loved the smell of it no doubt, but gel?? I was conflicted so I just said okay I can do it for one day! I put it on after I showered and to my surprise  it dried super fast, no jelly feeling under my arms at all. That was awesome and on top of that every place I went people asked what I was wearing, what body spray I had on. It was actually the secret outlast clear gel that smelled so good. I normally  wear men&#x27;s degree because it lasted all day, but with this secret outlast it lasted all day and night while keeping me smelling fresh! Ladies this is a must have for any busy momma!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Gel compliments of bzzagent. The scorching summer heat here in Texas has been brutal, and I found this deodorant was really able to outlast the August temperatures. It really did last all day and had a nice smell to it without being over-powering. My only dislike was the gel formula never seemed to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and I was left feeling slightly sticky all day.</li>
    <li> I received this Secret product as a free sample from BzzAgent. I normally hate gel antiperspirant as it always stays wet. I was hesitant to try this but upon receipt I was please to discover it has a quick drying action. It has long lasting protection and is overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this. It keeps me dry and no marks on my clothing! It also smells great. Great product! *Received this for free for review*</li>
    <li> Secret outlast clear gel is a effective and best deodrant in the market. This smells really amazing and leaves no white marks whatsoever, unlike any other deodrant that claims to be clear gel but still leaves marks on your clothes. I have tried every brand of deodrant that sells clear gel ones and claims to be not leaving any marks but secret outlast beats them all, absolutely must have on my dresser now. Got this as sample in my bzzkit for testing purpose but now it has become staple in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product when I received it in my BzzAgent kit! I&#x27;m a nursing student, a mom, a maid, a chauffer, and just about everything else! I&#x27;m always on the go and so I sweat a lot! I hate having to stop and reapply deodorant! There&#x27;s just no time for that! When kids are yelling for mom or call lights are going off, there&#x27;s just no way I can stop to keep myself fresh. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry! I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel this last weekend for my clinical rotation, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! There were no more unsightly white marks on my scrubs, and I stayed odor and sweat free my entire shift! I just can&#x27;t thank Secret enough for giving me a sneak peek of their product! #GotItFree #epic48</li>
    <li> Having been less than impressed with other &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; deodorants, I was skeptical ... but this gel deodorant really is different and really works. I not only have no white marks on my clothes, there is no gunky build up on my bra or the inside of the armpits of my t-shirts! I find that it is also effective in keeping me dry all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically buy unscented when I can, but the scent of this is pleasant and unobtrusive and doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this originally as a sample from BzzAgent, but the opinion here is my own. I do plan to continue to purchase this product myself in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new deodorant so when I got an invite from BzzAgent to try out the new Secret Outlast, I said yes.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the odor protection.  The gel never seems to dry completely, but I don&#x27;t smell and I&#x27;m not soaking my shirts so I&#x27;m happy.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have used for a few weeks the Secret Outlast deodorant and so far I have liked. I noticed that despite being transparent it evaporates quickly, not like other clear deodorants that dry several minutes later and I have to be with arms raised for the product to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think it has much to do as the ingredients are water based, because if I notice that the effect of deodorant lasts longer than other solids. The only thing I dislike about this deodorant is that as it is water based, I feel stick armpits, and those deodorants who are solid leave a layer that I do not feel bonded skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously another advantage is that it does not leave a white film, so it is perfect for use with dark clothing. It does not leave a white mark, even if I am putting it on before dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand thru BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> This is no ordinary gel deodorant. I used it through my whole 5 day stay on the Las Vegas Strip. It worked great through our miles of walking. I never broke a sweat. It also dried quickly after applying and left no residue on clothing. I would definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product if you&#x27;re concerned about white marks on your clothes.  But, I didn&#x27;t think that it held up to odor and wetness for the 48 hours like it promised.  It had a really clean scent, but didn&#x27;t last for long, especially in sweaty situations.  It&#x27;s an ok product, but I think I prefer my solid with better odor and wetness protection.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this for free from BzzAgent.com and Secret. It goes on clear, and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue. I honestly appreciate the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave marks because I tend to wear a good amount of black attire and we all No the struggle of keeping our deodorant off of it.  The smell is clean and refreshing perfect for this mom of two. It kept me dry throughout the day. I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Finally a deodorant that I can have everyday faith in that there won&#x27;t be any white marks, it will last throughout my busy mommy day, and smells good! Goes on dry. Feels comfortable. I can&#x27;t thank you enough Secret for sending me a promotional sample to review.</li>
    <li> I was never a big fan of clear gel deodorant.  The first time I tried one (at least 10 years ago) it was very sticky and I didn&#x27;t feel like it gave great protection.  I was able to get a sample of this for free thanks to Secret and absolutely loved it!  It was very easy to apply without any sticky residue and offered great protection!  I&#x27;m definitely sold on Secret Outlast Clear Gel!</li>
    <li> Being a long time Secret user, I did not need selling on the fact that they had a product that would work and provide protection from my day to day activities as well as my more strenuous activities.  What I was skeptical of was how good a gel could really work.  So, when given the chance to test a product as part of a free promotion, I figured now was as good a chance as any to find out how well this product did in fact work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clicking the dial was easy and the gel didn&#x27;t ooze, but seemed more like a soft solid.  The Clean Scent is really just that.  It&#x27;s a clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, isn&#x27;t flowery, isn&#x27;t powdery.  It is a fresh scent that was pleasant.  The application was smooth - more smooth than the Outlast solid I currently use and did not leave me feeling slimy as I honestly feared it might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of a hot and humid New England summer day, I still smelled fresh and clean.  It clearly did it&#x27;s job and outlasted my crazy #epic48!</li>
    <li> When I recieved this product for free I was a little skeptical. I was very surprised by how well this product holds up in the heat where I live. I will definitely be buying the full size.</li>
    <li> I to try Secret Outlast Gel for free through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve tried gels in the past and was never happy with the results. I&#x27;ve been using a solid for years and have gotten pretty tired of deodorant marks on my clothing. I am loving Secret Outlast Completely clean....It smells great, I&#x27;m still dry after running around for 2 hours and my clothes are not stained! I am so happy with these results I&#x27;ll be switching from my regular solid deodorant.</li>
    <li> I was sent this deodorant to try for free from BzzAgent. I really appreciated that it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothing. You will definitely want to wait a minute until you put a shirt on to give it time to dry, but once it&#x27;s dry you can definitely tell it&#x27;s working. It has a nice clean scent, as well. There only downside for me is that I am a heavy sweat-er and have not found any deodorant that keeps me 100% dry, including this one. However I think if you are normal, it would be great, lol!</li>
    <li> Im normally not a fan of clear gels but Secret Completely Clean Clear Gel dries pretty fast plus its clear so no marks on my bras or shirts. I would use it again.</li>
    <li> As a member of bzzz Agent I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I normally use a dry solid but was willing to try the liquid gel. However with how hot it has been in my area lately I foundyself reapplying more than usual, and if I were to wear a tank top I needed to make sure the deodorant was completely dry otherwise a wet make would appear on the tank top and remain even though it had dried.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try this product for free because I am a BzzAgent. I love the protection that it gives me. The quick drying gel formula leaves me dry and without the white marks on my dark clothes. Since trying secret outlast I will never try another deodorant.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific. Drys fast and clear. Keeps me fresh and dry all day. Thanks Secret and box agent. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> so i have always used secret but i was able to try secret outlast for free through bzzagent and i have to say i was skeptical because i dont normally like gel but i am very pleasantly surprised... it keeps me dry and not smelly all day long, no need to reapply or worry about if it is going to stop working throughout the day. i love the product and i will continue to buy this one for sure!</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical when my sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant came in the mail free from bzzagent.com. I mean I had tried clear gels before and they were always a disappointment. They were either goopy, never dried, or smelt so bad. Sometimes, they wouldn&#x27;t even last a hour on me. I tried this the first day and was shocked that it wasn&#x27;t goopy and dried right away. I am a store manager and a mom. I lead a very active life and am constantly on the go. This deodorant is the best I have ever tried. It kept me clean and smelling good all day. I highly recommend this product to any woman who needs a new deodorant!</li>
    <li> Outlast sent me a free sample to try and I was very impressed by the product. Outlast went on smooth and dried right away. Was nice not to have to wait to be able to put clothes on after applying. Since most gel deodorant take a while to dry, where outlast did not. It Also did not leave a residue after applying, I did not have any under the arm deodorant looks at the end of the day with my dark t-shirt I was wearing. Normally I apply deodorant twice a day, but with outlast I only had to apply once and I was good all day with great protection. The scent was also great. it was not to heavy of a scent to be overwhelming which I liked.  I give this product 5 stars. I would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I got this product to test free from bzzagent. I tried this deodorant before I went to work out. I did two class totalling 90 minutes and I was happy it kept me from smelling. I dont know if this works 48 hours but I liked how there were no white streaks and It lasted while I work out!</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Secret Outlast gel deodorant to try out and review. The first day I tried it was on a very hot and humid day doing yard work. The smell at first can be a little strong but once you put it on it balanced out. I was really impressed with this product as it kept me dry and odorless after sweating for several hours. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I received my promotional Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent, and I am very impressed with this product. I don&#x27;t have to use, or reapply, a lot to get results. It smells great and dries quickly.  And the best part- No white streaks! This was always my biggest issue with other deodorant brands. I wear a lot of black, and I was forever wiping these white lines off of my clothes. I was also blown away by this product&#x27;s lasting power! It&#x27;s July here in Texas, and it is HOT. I haven&#x27;t had to reapply Secret Outlast at all during the day, like I had to multiple times with my other deodorant. All in all, a very good product.</li>
    <li> I do not like Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant. My cheaper, solid deodorant works so much better and no icky wet feeling! I took the dog for an over 1.5 hour walk in a breezy, cool, lower 70s weather. Right before, I put my regular brand on one armpit and Secret Outlast on the other. Immediately after returning home, I snapped this comparison before hopping in the shower.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and clean, works great (really does last at least 1 day for me)!</li>
    <li> great product works like it claims</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying new deodorants to try and find one that works for me. Secret&#x27;s outlast antiperspirant (completely clean) is amazing! It not only masked or staved off any odor, it helped considerably with my sweat issue. I suffer from hyper-hydrosis, so it can be difficult to find anything that will help with the wetness. Because of the sweating, I frequently wear dark clothing. Secret outlast not only masked odors and kept me from having massive pit stains, it also didn&#x27;t leave a single white mark on any of my dark clothing! This will definitely be a must have product for me from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> Thanks to #BzzAgent and #Secret I #GotItFree to sample and review.  I think Secret Outlast clear gel works great! It provides complete odor and wetness protection and truly dries immediately. I will admit that I was skeptical because gels usually take longer to dry and can be sticky or greasy but not this one. It dries immediately and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky ore greasy and dos net mark your clothes.</li>
    <li> This deodorant came as a sample from BzzAgent and a free sample from Secret! I was really surprised when I got it because I was thinking to myself &amp;#34;ew, another awful gel&amp;#34;, but I was extremely surprised by the outcome.  For starters, this stuff smells amazing! Very fresh and very clean! After applying, I dreaded the &amp;#34;will this ever dry&amp;#34; experiences of the past.  This stuff dries crazy fast.  Within just a few seconds I felt dry enough to go ahead and pop on my shirt. My only real issue is that I feel it doesn&#x27;t last as well as it should - and this is an issue I&#x27;ve always had with gels.  Indoors, while I was cleaning, crafting, playing with my pets, etc - I felt like it lasted, trapped perspiration and worked like a charm.  However, when outdoors I felt like I needed to reapply often - and I barely sweat.  I glisten at most.  When I would go inside I just felt like it could be better under the arm.  I never smelled like body odor, but I just didn&#x27;t feel &#x27;fresh&#x27;. I really think if you were a big-time sweater, you&#x27;d have an issue.  Other than that little issue, this stuff is pretty good.  I like using it while i&#x27;m working in the house cause it&#x27;s light and fresh, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for outdoors.</li>
    <li> So I received my sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel from BzzAgent and have been using it daily. First off let me say that I thought it was going to be a full-size product, but instead was a 0.5 oz, which is ok. The use of this product has been a great one to me because, I use to use this kind of deodorant as a teen, (the clear gel kind), and the thing I like about it is that it keeps me dry all day, no it doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave stains on my clothes, and to some people the scent might be an overpowering turn off, but my opinion is different. I actually like how it smells, and so does my teen daughter. Thanks to BzzAgent and Secret for this awesome sample!!!</li>
    <li> I love secert outlast clear gel deoderant. It is the best for those long days when 24 hours feels like 48. I no longer have to worry about marks on my clothes or deodorant protection wearing off. I&#x27;m so thankful to BzzAgent that I was able to try some for free, I&#x27;ll never buy another kind again.</li>
    <li> #GOTITFREE, I just try this product for Free thanks to Secret. It maintains you fresh and odor  free. Try it won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product to try for free from secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I only use a solid form but thought I&#x27;d give the gel a try since it was free.  I liked it, but not sure I would actually buy it unless it was an amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t leave that wet feeling that usually gel&#x27;s leave and it didn&#x27;t leave marks or stains, so really it&#x27;s just a preference issue.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant through an online promotions co (BzzAgent.com). I have always worn Secret&#x27;s invisible solid deodorant, but was disappointed with the white marks it left on my clothes, especially in the heat of summer. This clear gel has totally revolutionized my choice in deodorants. It lasted all day, even through a four hour dance rehearsal, and.....no white marks! So excited to make the switch!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this free from a promotion, for the first time , actually it was my first time with gel deodorant! I always thought Glen would be messy and not work as well, WOW was I wrong! This is totally the Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used!!! It goes on clear, dries super fast and leaves none of those dreaded white marks on clothing! And the very best part for me was it lasted ALL DAY!! AND didn&#x27;t leave that yucky clumpy feeling!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I received my Secret Outlast® Clear Gel in the mail as part of one of their promotions, but it is probably good for someone who doesn&#x27;t sweat as much as I do but if you&#x27;re very active or sweat a lot I would not recommend this product. It did go on clear and dry fast, but sadly it did not keep me dry for more than six hours.</li>
    <li> I did receive this deodorant as a sample from #BzzAgent and i&#x27;m absolutely happy I did. I would have never even tried this product if I didn&#x27;t try it for free. I like that it has a very fresh and light scent. I love that it does go on clean although I felt the first couple of time I was putting hair jel under my arms lol. I do like that fact after a day of having it on you still have that #48hour odor protection. I also love at the end of the day when you shower you actually feel clean and not build up from the white sticks. I live in MI and the weather is so crazy. This summer it&#x27;s been a crazy one really rainy , hot humid. On the days when the humidity was really high and it felt like 100+ degrees out Secret held up pretty well, I don&#x27;t completely hit that &amp;#34;here smells is no Secret&amp;#34; stage.  All and all this was a great experience and this will be a purchase I will be making on my own really soon. #gotitfree!</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent for Women. Its Amazing! Secret Clear Gel gives you 48-hour odor protection plus goes on clear for no white marks. Its Simply Amazing. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. Will not go a day with out it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week (I got it for free as a part of the bzz campaign) and I must say that it isn&#x27;t the best or the worst. I work in NYC where I trek around 20 minutes outside to get to work, and since its been so humid out I have been looking for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make feel gross or smelly. Some days the deoderdant works all day, but sometimes it fades around lunch, forcing me to reapply. It also has a strong sweet smell, so if you don&#x27;t like that I would recommend against it. Also, when I carry around with me, it does melt, so the deoderdant becomes uneven (comes out heavier on one end when you twist it)</li>
    <li> Ever have one of those days that just seems to drag along, you get frustrated, hot and sweaty and all of a sudden, your deodorant fails? Well that&#x27;s happened to me before so I was delighted to be able to try a free sample Secret Outlast® Clear Gel because I knew I would be going on a road trip with friends and I knew that the party would go on and on so I didn&#x27;t want my deodorant to stop working! When I used this deodorant I first noticed the great smell, it smelled so fresh and clean as if I and just stepped out of the shower. I figured that this scent would go away after a few hours but I continued to smell it the entire road trip through three states!  When I finally had the chance to take a shower, I didn&#x27;t even smell bad because this deodorant prevented me from becoming all wet and sweaty. The best part is, I brought dark clothes with me, which can be a pain because I always get white deodorant marks. This deodorant is fast drying so you can just throw it on as your rushing to get out of your motel room and on to your next journey. It will go on clear, dries right away, evaporating in seconds and won&#x27;t stain your clothes! I love the fact that it is specially designed to adhere to your skin so I don&#x27;t have to worry if my underarm gets accidentally rubbed on your shirt or someone else&#x27;s!  The dual action odor technology actually works before you even start to sweat and it minimizes the bacteria that causes odors. I can&#x27;t believe it lasted for me a 48 full hours even when it was 90 degrees outside. I am so happy that I decided to bring my free sample of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel deodorant with me on my road trip, and I&#x27;m sure my friends sitting next to me were glad too! I smelled great the entire trip and felt the freshest and cleanest I&#x27;ve ever felt!</li>
    <li> I have never been a big fan of gel deodorant but I received this for free to try thru Bzzagent so I gave it a try. I will be sticking with the Secret solid for now. I did not like the fact that there was no scent to this deodorant, I like being able to smell my deodorant when I am working hard, it reassures me that it is working as hard as I am. I also do not care for the way the gel feels or that if I don&#x27;t wait, or put it on after I&#x27;ve dressed, it leaves wet spots on my shirts.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve tried so many free samples and rarely go out and buy the product for regular use, but Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is one of the exceptions. I absolutely love this deodorant, it goes on completely dry, leaves no stains on clothing, completely prevents mid-day sweat stains. Definitely my new go-to. I&#x27;ve tried other gel deodorants in the past and hate the cold, wet feeling that they give me. With this one, you barely feel it as you apply it. I wholeheartedly recommend this deodorant and will buy it exclusively going forward.</li>
    <li> This products actually works pretty good, it doesn&#x27;t leave my underarms feeling gooey or sticky like other gel deodorant I have tried before. I got this product to try out for free thanks to Secret and Bzzagent. Secret clear gel is awesome and I was very hesitant to trying it, but I&#x27;m glad tha I did, it makes me smell shower fresh . I work in the radiology department and I&#x27;m so busy that I needed a deodorant that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about, Secret is definitely it. Thank you</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I have ever used!!  It gives me protection all day long and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing! I will not buy any other brand! Definitely give it a try  &amp;#34;received product as part of a promotion from the brand&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and in the past I have tried scented gel deodorants with horrible results. This is the first time I have used a scented or a gel deodorant in over 10 years and surprisingly I really like it! My skin has not had a single issue with it and the it really lasts; usually I feel like I need to reapply deodorant before going out in the evening but I haven&#x27;t had to do that despite the fact that it has been 100* this week. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes which has been my primary complaint of my usual deodorant. I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t like the gooey feeling of a gel but it doesn&#x27;t really feel gooey at all and within seconds of applying, it feels great. I was given this product to try for free courtesy of Secret.</li>
    <li> I loved trying Secret Outlast Clear Deodorant Gel for free thanks to Secret. I don&#x27;t usually use gels, but this one is awesome! It dries clear and super fast. I was also skeptical about it lasting 48 hours, but it actually works! I tried it out on a camping trip and it was awesome. I have been using this for awhile and I always feel dry, clean, and confident with Secret Outlast Clear Deodorant Gel. Love the scent, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel deodorants but it&#x27;s been a while since I tried it so when given the chance to try it free via Secret, I thought why not? I was surprised. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected and it stood well as advertised. The gel dries very fast and left NO white marks/residue on my black shirt. As much as I was sweating in 95 degree weather, work, and chasing a four year old my underarms stayed dry and smelling fresh. While I can&#x27;t vouch for the 48 hr protection because I can&#x27;t go that long without showering, it held up in every possible way I needed it to. I strongly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have recently had a chance to test this product thanks to a promotion from Secret and BzzAgent. I love how smooth it rolls on and it goes on clear. it is not sticky at all, which is a problem i have had with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t sweat a lot. So its hard for me to say if this keeps you dry. I don&#x27;t have to reapply deodorant several times per day.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had this problem with this brand of deodorant. It dries quickly. I feel like later in the afternoon that I may need to re apply if i go outside again, so i don&#x27;t think that it would last 48 hours but who goes 48 hrs without reapplying or showering??</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deodorant. It goes on and stays clear throughout the day. However it doesn&#x27;t last 48-hours for me. I run around all day inside and outside in the heat with preschoolers and it barely gets me through my work the day.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret I&#x27;m trying out the Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant for free, but it&#x27;s no secret now. I absolutely have to say I am loving this product a lot! No more sweaty underarms and residue on my shirts. It has an awkward smell to me, but I like, all through the day I get a wisp of the scent and it just makes me say &amp;#34;gosh I smell good&amp;#34; lol, love it. Secret Outlast is definitely my go to deodarant now.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it smelled. For me it lasted all day and did not stain any clothing. Best part is I was not worried of &amp;#34;deodorant clumps&amp;#34; in my under arm area with this product.</li>
    <li> I received this free from bzzAgent. I was shocked at how impressed I was with this deodorant. I am a sweaty girl,  gross but it is what it is.  After trying what seemed like every deodorant out there, I gave up and switched to a clinical strength antiperspirant. I agreed to try this with a bit of hesitation, fully expecting it to fail.  Well it didn&#x27;t. It kept me dry,  the scent was great and the gel is cool going on which I love. The only negative is that being a gel, I feel like I use it a lot quicker. (0.5oz lasted me 5 days.) And the completely clean scent is stronger than the name leads you to expect.</li>
    <li> love it and recommended, no residues on your  clothes or skin, great smell, easy to use, no burns on the skin, the bets brand and works perfect for me..... and protect me all day long even the hot day ... I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand from bzzagent ... thankyou</li>
    <li> I do not normally get excited about deodorant. It is just something I have to buy so that I don&#x27;t stink. When the bzzagent website first contacted me asking if I would like to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent deodorant completely for free and give it a rating, I thought &amp;#34;Ehhh, why not. It will save me from buying deodorant this month.&amp;#34; Once I received my package in the mail and tried it for a few days, I realized that this deodorant was actually pretty great! It wasn&#x27;t really goopy like some gel deodorants are, it goes on smooth. Another thing I usually hate with any gel deodorants is how long you feel wet after applying it. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent gel deodorant dried much quicker than the other gel deodorants I have tried. With a fresh clean scent, quick dry time, non-goopy application and the fact that it kept working all day long, I think Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent has a winner with this deodorant! I plan on buying it again!!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from bzzagent and I mostly like it. I like the scent and it lasts a long time. I just don&#x27;t like the wet feeling of the gel when applying it. I prefer an invisible solid but this is a good deodorant.</li>
    <li> I got to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free in a campaign from BzzAgent and I must say I love it! It goes on super smooth and dries fast and not gooey and wet like you would think as its a gel deodorant. I really enjoyed the Completely Clean scent, it smelled fresh and clean but wasn&#x27;t overpowering. And best of all it leaves me feeling fresh and dry all day without any white marks left behind! Chasing my 9 month old son around, trips to the grocery store, walks in the park, hot pool days, there is no activity I have found that it doesn&#x27;t hold up too leaving me feeling fresh and dry. I&#x27;m not so positive it could last a whole 48 hours (I haven&#x27;t tried since I like to shower daily) but I do know it can last a good 24 hours. I&#x27;ve tried invisible solids and clinical strength deodorants and none of them compare to this! I highly recommend using this deodorant!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of secret outlast in the mail from buzzagent. The smell is great I could smell it as soon as I opened the package. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about the gel is that it is really wet when you put it on. Over all it did keep me fresh but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it lasts for 48 hours.</li>
    <li> When I was given the chance to review this product but Bzzagent, I was skeptical to say the least. I tend to shy from gel formulas for two main reasons: they seem to have a tendency to stay sticky for quite some time, and they just all around don&#x27;t feel comfortable. But this time, I was proven wrong. The gel went on very smoothly, wasn&#x27;t sticky at all, and seemed to dry down much more quickly than any other gel I&#x27;ve tried. And the protection was amazing! I stayed dry, and smelling fresh all day long. I enjoyed this so much in fact that I&#x27;ve used the product I was sent and have repurchased a full size. Now just to get one for my daughter so she stops using mine!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of Secret Outlast to try from Bzzagent and my initial thoughts were that it&#x27;s a little overly perfumed and takes a little longer to dry than I&#x27;d like. But after a whole day of use, it still felt like it was working, much better in fact than the solid one I usually use, and you barely need to use any of it.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is a good product. It last all day and also leaves no white marks. The one issue I had was that it felt a little sticky when outing it on, but it dried fast and worked well. I tried this product as a promotion.</li>
    <li> Are you looking for a deodorant to keep you fresh and dry throughout the day and night? Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is the best way to go. I was stuck on using the same deodorant for years; even though I had to constantly reapply it throughout the day. Then Secret® sent me a free sample of the Completely Clean Clear Gel. Since I&#x27;ve started using this I&#x27;ve never felt more confident in what I wear; I know that no matter what happens in my day it will never show!</li>
    <li> The Secret Outlast Deodorant worked wonderfully especially in the heat while doing yard work and sweating profusely! It kept my underarms dry and I still smelled &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; after being out in the heat most of the day. It goes on quick, dries fast and is easy to use. I really like the fact that it goes the extra mile and still smells good the next day without needing to be reapplied.It does not leave the white armpit marks in my shirt that solids and roll-ons do. I received this sample as a promotion from Secret and it works great. I am glad I got to try a diffferent type of antiperspirant/deodorant and look forward to using it in the future.</li>
    <li> i have a hard time finding a great antiperspirant/deodorant that protects as well as doesn&#x27;t leave stains. well i have found it! the smell is definitely a plus, not too strong and pleasant enough that i know i can be comfortable all day! while it does take a little longer to dry than most, i am confidant that it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.*</li>
    <li> Awesome! Not only does Secret Outlast deodorant smell good, but it keeps me cool &amp; dry through out my busy day. I also got to try Secret Outlast for FREE!!! I&#x27;m a Secret Outlast user now. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try a new deodorant because I hate the ones that leave white marks on my clothes...I also wear my baby in a black soft structured carrier often and I don&#x27;t like it when the straps turn white from deodorant because it&#x27;s so hard to get out. That being said, I&#x27;m glad that BzzAgent gave me the opportunity to try this because the Secret Outlast Clear Gel is really clear! I love that it didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing or baby carrier and it really worked to keep odors away. It can get quite hot on a warm day when you also have a baby strapped to you but I always felt fresh and clean with this product. I will be replacing my other brand of deodorant with this one and would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I received a free stick of this product prior to doing this review. This went on smooth and stayed that way throughout most of the day. The only issue I might bring up is that you may want to reapply after a while. The nice thing about it was that it did not cause oil in my skin to clog or create acne, either.</li>
    <li> Love the Secret Outlast Completely ....the scent smells great. It dries fast and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the drying time but I love this Antiperspirant.  I was able to try it risk free after receiving a free stick to try.  I really feel like it has 48 hr protection and dried faster than I thought.  It feels a little strange putting the wet gel on, but it is not sticky or anything after it dries.  I love the fresh scent too.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I just #GotItFree from Bzzagent for testing and review and after a few uses I can say that it is one of the best deodorants I ever tried it really does runs clear and loved the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day!  Love not having white marks!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent and switched over from my usual invisible solid. Now, I am an antiperspirant snob. I&#x27;ve tried everything that&#x27;s ever been introduced to the market, including those for men, in the hopes that I could find THE perfect one. It&#x27;s particularly important, as I am only half kidding when I say that I sweat more than a 400 lb man. In any case, I had tried clear gels in the past but was turned off by the stickiness and long drying time. It looks like they&#x27;ve solved those problems. The drying time is much shorter, I would estimate no longer than two minutes, and I am happy to report that there is no stickiness at all! The packaging promises 48 hours of coverage, and although I haven&#x27;t waited that long to shower and reapply, I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that claim. Great stuff. I just wish it was summer.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE FROM SECRET AS A PROMOTION AND LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! IT SMELLS SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this as a free sample from BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve used Secret classic solid white stick for years. The clear gel avoids the white marks and works as well for odor and wetness control but it just doesn&#x27;t dry very fast. It leaves a wet feeling for a while and then feels a bit sticky, not the smooth almost lubricating texture I&#x27;m used to. Is everyone claiming it dries fast hanging out with their arms up while it dries? I could see using it maybe with a formal sleeveless top or dress but for daily use I&#x27;ll stick with the more comfortable classic. The scent on this one is pretty good. Not too strong or perfume-y, it stops the stink very well without people ten feet away smelling your deodorant like you bathed in it. It&#x27;s a classic clean soapy scent, a bit of an alcohol scent that goes away after it dries, and has a faint floral note at the end almost a jasmine scent.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel as a promotion through bzzagent to try and review.  While Secret has always been one of my go to Antiperspirants I do not usually use the clear gel.  I found that this does dry faster than previously tried clear gel products.  The scent is nice, it does its job.  I still prefer the solid form, but overall this does what it advertises and if you prefer gels this is one to try!</li>
    <li> I have been a Secret customer for almost 2 decades now. I usually use the original invisible solid Secret. Secret sent me a sample to try out of their Outlast Clear Gel deodorant. The sample I received was the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant in the Completely Clean scent. I found it to be useful, especially in the summer when you do several outfit changes. I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any white marks. I felt like the completely clean scent did a better job at lasting a while to protect me from odors. However, I get headaches from perfumes, so I purchased a full size Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant in unscented for my trip to DC. The price was just right being under $4. Again, I liked not having to worry about white marks on my clothes, but the unscented didn&#x27;t protect me from odor protection more than my regular Secret invisible solid and it most definitely would not provide 48 hour protection. I had to apply it at least twice a day to feel comfortable. I would still recommend it, especially if you&#x27;re prone to white marks.</li>
    <li> I had the chance thanks to Bzzagnet to try Secret Outlast Completely clean, clear gel for FREE (i received a Full size Sample) and i am like always impressed. You re sweat free and def &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; free for at least 24 hours. A big plus is that it do NOT leave marks on your shirt or Armpit after applying. Thank Bzzagent for letting me try and review it!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s plenty of stress in my everyday life and more than enough on my To Do List. With Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel odor and sweat are two things I do NOT have to worry about.  All it takes is a quick second first thing in the morning and the protection lasts for 2 whole days!  Just swipe and GO!  It&#x27;s specially designed to dry quickly. I love the fact that the Gel is Clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about those annoying white marks on my clothes.  Oh, did I say it works for 2 whole days and it works fast too.  It&#x27;s water-based so it gets into sweat glands faster and works better than solid deodorants.</li>
    <li> I received a sample to test for free and I love the Secret Outlast clear gel with 48 hour protection. Dries fast and leaves no white marks.</li>
    <li> I am a devoted Secret deo purchaser. However, I will not be buying this clear gel anytime soon. Although I appreciate the idea of the use without getting on my clothes to leave me white embarrassing marks, I still feel like I am an adult and responsible enough to apply the invisible solid without getting residue on my clothing. The clear gel came to me in a bzzagent kit complimentary. I was very disappointed to find that the product left me feeling sticky and did not allow me to feel refreshed and clean like the invisible solid I use in the exact scent. I did not like that the gel did not come up equally among all the holes in the top of the deo. I was very disappointed in this product, but still a secret fan!</li>
    <li> I was send Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel for my review for free. I love how it goes on clear and leaves no white marks on my clothes. And more importantly the odor protection is there. So no more being self conscious about ever underarm smell throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I normally use Dove-brand solid deodorant, but I often see white marks on my clothing from it.  I was therefore excited to give this new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel a try.  I was given a stick of this clear gel in the Completely Clean scent for free to test as part of a promotion, and I found the scent to be very pleasing, and I can still notice it hours after applying.  I also, of course, don&#x27;t have to worry about any white marks showing on my clothes from this clear gel, but those are the only positive aspects of this clear gel that I&#x27;ve found.  I applied this clear gel for the first time after getting out the shower where I had shaved my underarms.  I immediately noticed the wetness of the gel obviously, but then I also experienced some burning sensations as well.  I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn on my underarms, but this clear gel still burned, which never happens with my Dove solid deodorant.  The burning stopped after a few seconds, but the wet feeling never fades.  No matter how long after I apply this clear gel or what type of top I&#x27;m wearing (sleeveless, t-shirt, sweater, etc.), my underarms always feel damp.  This is not a pleasant feeling.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any wet marks (and there are of course no white marks) on my clothing, but I always *feel* wet.  Like I mentioned, this clear gel has a very nice scent and leaves no white marks, but its wetness protection is a letdown.  I&#x27;ll therefore return to using my Dove solid deodorant.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received a sample of this deodorant from Secret for free through BzzAgent.com. I used to be a big Secret fan when I was younger. It was my go-to Deodorant brand all through high-school, but I switched to Dove and Degree for some reason. When I received my sample of Secret, I instantly remembered how much I have always liked the Secret scent. The fresh-clean scent isn&#x27;t too potent and makes it smell like you&#x27;re fresh from the shower. The deodorant formula dries quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it on your clothes. I feel like the deodorant did a great job of lasting for a long time and giving me sweat and odor protection. Even after a sweaty game of tennis I felt like my armpits still  had that fresh from the shower smell. I love that the clear formula avoids those pesky white stains on your clothes and armpits as well. The only issue I have with this deodorant is the dial you have to use to push out the deodorant from the tube. I feel like using the dial, I always get either too much or too little, so that is the only flaw in the product design I would like the Secret brand to work on. Either way, I love this deodorant and it reminded me why I used to use it. I&#x27;m definitely considering switching back to the Secret brand!</li>
    <li> I got to try this deodorant for free through BzzAgent, and it&#x27;s one of my favorite trials so far! I tend to sweat quite a bit chasing 3 little boys around for a living, so I need strong wetness and odor prevention. The first thing I noticed about it is that the Clean Scent smells great! It&#x27;s not too perfumey, not at all fruity or flowery, and not overly strong. The second thing is that it doesn&#x27;t go on feeling really wet. I think part of the reason is that there isn&#x27;t a large amount of gel going onto my skin (like other gel deodorants I have used in the past). This means that it dries quickly and never feels cold or uncomfortable. The third thing I discovered is that it kept me dry and odor-free throughout my 12-hour workday, and even up to bedtime. I was able to hug my husband when he walked in the door without knocking him over!  Huge accomplishment in my world. And last but definitely not least, the gel dries completely clear, so there are no white stains on my shirts. These are the reasons I love this stuff and would recommend it to anybody, but especially active people who like to share their love through bear hugs.</li>
    <li> Got this to try from #bzzagent for free! It&#x27;s awesome to use and not get white streaks on my black scrub tops! I love it! Smells good and lasts all day long. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it stings when you use it after you shave.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free to try and review for bzz agent. I am not a huge fan of this deodorant because it irritated my skin. I do have sensitive skin and mostly use sensitive skin products so this may be due to having sensitive skin. I disliked the wetness when applying and the smell was not my favorite. It did however take care of any odor when I worked out but my original deodorant does the same.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this to try from Secret and bzzagent to try and review.  These opinions are 100% my own.  I spend roughly 4 nights out of every week at the baseball fields watching my lil&#x27; slugger play ball.  There is no shade so it is hot as I am in Texas and it&#x27;s always hot!  I have tried every deodorant under the sun and have never found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  I have been using my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel now for approximately one week.  I usually stay away from clear gels because I have found that they go on incredibly wet and sticky and that feeling lasts all day.  This gel did go on a bit wet and sticky but it did in fact dry as the product description states.  It kept me completely odor free and dry each day I used it.  I did not have to reapply as I have had to with previous brands  and versions.  This is a keeper.  If it stands up to the test of a hot baseball game then I would say we have a winner here!  My favorite part is it does not leave white marks on clothing.  That is an absolute pet peeve of mine!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample, as I have always used secret solid, I was willing to try. I loved how it lasted as long, dried quick, and NO white marks on my clothes!!</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of Secret, but seem to be pretty impressed. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel has a pleasant scent. I did not like the sticky feeling after applying it. The scent continued throughout the day. After 11 hours, the scent was still there, but seem to be wearing off. I am one that does require a very strong deodorant and was very active today. For those who do not perspire a lot or require a very strong deodorant this may be the deodorant for you. I also used this deodorant on my 6 year old who requires deodorant and it worked perfectly for her. After a long day at school she did come home smelling fresh. Love the &amp;#34;no white residue&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I received a stick of this deodorant as a sample and I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it. I have tried clear deodorant in the past and it just did not work. After two days of using this I am pleasantly surprised. I have stayed dry and smelling fresh. I had a baby 6 months ago and my hormones are still all over the place. My usual clinical strength deodorant hasn&#x27;t been working well, but this actually worked, crazy hormones and all! I am very please with this deodorant and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I normally use clinical strength deodorant but tried Secret Outlast Clear and I love it! No white marks, long lasting protection and it smells great! The best part for me was it totally controlled how much I sweat! Definitely my new favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> I love the new outlast clear gel by Secret!! Not only is it gel but it does not leave white marks even if it is not completely dry when u put on your shirt. It is a must try!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> It really does keep me dry and smelling good all day. i was surprised at how fast it dried, there were no marks on my clothes, and how great it smelled. that you thank you Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for letting me try this product for free for being a bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant! I got a sample free from BzzAgent and I am picky about deodorants but this one stood up to its name! Smells fantastic, dries quickly and does not leave a white sticky mess. I love how it even protects me under stressful conditions for over 48 hours! No other Antiperspirant has done that for me! I am a faithful user of this brand and will continue to buy Secret from now on.</li>
    <li> I really liked this deodorant, I received a free sample to try. I&#x27;m not usually a fan of the gel, but I found that I liked it better-but only this one!</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant!! I really gave it a workout literally first I applied it before I put on my black tanktop because one of the claims is it does not leave white marks....and it was true to its word, no white marks. Second I went on an 8hr hike with a friend which always makes my underarms wet from sweat...again, yes there was a little wetness but nothing like before when I use my other deodorant and great odor protection as well! Last I applied it before I went to work and wore a light heather grey shirt which always shows when I&#x27;ve been sweating and at the end of the day no wetness under my arms (I work with small children and run around a lot). I cant tell you how much I love this product and highly recommend it. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand but would buy it regularly now .</li>
    <li> I am trying this free!  I like how I don&#x27;t have to worry about white streaks on my clothes with this.  It did seem to take a bit longer than I would have liked for it to dry but gave a cool refreshing effect.  It did seem to fight wetness which is something I struggled with with my other antiperspirants.  Overall, I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was selected by BzzAgent to try out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant.  I&#x27;ve been a Secret user for years but have not tried the clear gel till now and I will only be buying this one going forward. The scent is nice and it goes on smooth and clear and no white gunk on my clothes. Denise AKA Sookiedog!</li>
    <li> This is now going to be my go-to deodorant of choice for an every day fresh and clean scent and feeling. I love Secret, and have been using it for years to keep unwanted odors and moisture away. I usually use one of the solids, but was given this clear gel one to try from Secret through Bzz Agent. It has a light scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it goes on clear and stays clear. I&#x27;ve had a lot of deodorants cake up, but Secret never has. If you want a product that&#x27;s dependable, Secret is your best bet. It says 48 hour odor protection though and I have not had it last that long yet. For me it seems to last 12-18 hours which gets me through the day, but I need to reapply each day. I am totally fine with reapplying each day which is going to be needed for me anyways because I shower or take a bath everyday anyways. If you are looking for a new deodorant that works great and smells great, this may be the right deodorant for you. I am very happy that I was able to try it out for free and will also be fine with paying for it when I run out. This stuff is really great.</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of trying Secret Outlast® Clear Gel for FREE via BzzAgent for review purposes! My opinion is that of my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First trying this product I noticed a light, fresh scent! Which I LOVE because I do NOT like overly scented deodorants. I want to smell fresh and clean, NOT like I bathed in perfumed!&lt;br /&gt;I really put this deodorant to the test! I read the claims of 48 hours of protection from wetness and odor. I put some on one morning and did not reapply for 48-hours. I was a bit worried I was going to stink, and noticeably so....&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;I did not! After jogging, walking, running, chasing after two kids, chasing after two dogs, and doing all that I do in a 48 hour time frame, not once did I notice my under arms to have a foul odor. I was amazed... not that I will wait another 48 hours ever again, but it&#x27;s nice to know that the claims are not false!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy about the clear gel formula, no more worrying if I accidentally get a little of my deodorant on my clothing (It can be my little secret and no one will know)!&lt;br /&gt;I will also state I am also happy about the price point, for this deodorant! It&#x27;s affordable and it works! Try it, you might like it too!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using my free trial sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. The scent is light, fresh and clean smelling. I let my boyfriend use it and he loved it as well! He used it while teaching a fitness class and while doing #epic48 work outdoors in the Summer heat and smelled great after each. I think he may have liked it more than me, even. I did find that there is a burning sensation if I apply the gel right after shaving in the shower. Other than that, I thought it was great and effective!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free in a BzzAgent campaign but I think after trying this I&#x27;ll stay with my Secret solid. This dries in a okay amount of time and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. However, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t keep me dry all day as I live in Florida and work at Disney which means i&#x27;m in the heat pretty much the whole day. It really let me down when I needed it most in my day since I don&#x27;t have time to reapply throughout a shift. Maybe if you have a inactive life this would be a good choice for you but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. I won&#x27;t be buying this after this trial.</li>
    <li> #BzzAgent #GotItFree #ClearlyBetter  I love this deodorant because it does what it claims to do, which is provide 48 hour odor &amp; wetness protection!! It goes on clear &amp; dries in seconds without leaving any white marks on your clothing!! As a busy momma &amp; wife, I am always on the go, so I would recommend this deodorant to everyone!! Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant is awesome &amp; will leave you feeling fresh after a long hectic day of running errands or chasing your kids around. I have super sensitive skin &amp; it didn&#x27;t cause any rashes or breakouts!! Thank you BzzAgent.com for the free deodorant!!</li>
    <li> I received this from Secret for a campaign for BzzAgent.  I usually get rashes from deodorant, especially from gel.  The Outlast didn&#x27;t do anything bad to my skin, which was amazing to me.  It lasted a really long time with a scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  I will absolutely be recommending this to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works! I have very bad sweating problems in my armpit area (I know. Sounds gross right). Because of that I&#x27;m limited to what I can wear and what colors. But I&#x27;m so happy after being able to try this free from bzzagent. I forgot I even had it on until I came home and realized that my pits were still dry!</li>
    <li> Loved trying out this deodorant! I received it as a BzzAgent campaign but I will definitely buy this in the future. I liked that it was really fast drying and didn&#x27;t level white marks. The odor protection was also good but it lasted 24 hours instead of 48.</li>
    <li> Things I like about this product:  No white marks, no strong scent, glides on easily, protects well.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that takes getting used to is how wet it feels when I put it on. This is not a big deal now that is is fall in MI where I live, but I wonder what this would be like in the summer or in areas where there is more humidity? I received this as part of a marketing trial through bzzagent and I would buy it again, but I will be curious to see what it is like in the warmer weather because of its consistency.</li>
    <li> I received SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL free to try and review.  I was more impressed than I expected to be.  It really does last a long time like it advertises.  I felt dry all day long and it does not leave white marks on clothing/skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like is it did not dry as quickly as it advertises.  I solve this by using a blow dryer to dry it and after that it does not feel wet or sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and plan on purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am totally switching from a solid to this gel. It keeps me dry all day and I never worry about odor. It goes on nice and dries fast. I love that it doesn&#x27;t sting after showering too. I am a bzzagent and received this as a free promotional gift, but I will not hesitate to purchase this myself!</li>
    <li> I got this free from BzzAgent to test. I have always used invisible solids, and steered away from gels. But now I am a convert! The gel went on smoothly and dried relatively quickly. The best part was that there were no streaks or marks on my black shirts or dresses. Hooray! This is going to be my regular deodorant from henceforth.</li>
    <li> Usually, I am not a fan of gel deoderant. I would rather have white marks on my shirts then feel sticky from the usual gel deoderants. However, I recieved a complimentary sample of this product through Bzzagent, and I was pleasantly surprised. While it did feel wet going on, it dried completely, with no marks on my shirt, after about 30 seconds. Although I recieved the unscented version, there was still a slight scent to it. Not overpowering, but enough to notice I was wearing deoderant. I really enjoyed this product. My only reason for the four stars is that even though I have only been using this products for a week, the product is half gone already. I&#x27;m wondering if because it is supposed to provide 48 hour protection, they expect the consumer to  only put it on every other day? I&#x27;ll stick to my at least once a day anti perspirant adherence, 48 hours or not.</li>
    <li> I received this in a Bzzkit from Bzz Agent to try. I was very impressed! Most of the other clear gels I have tried are fine odor protection wise (for me) but they stay wet and sticky feeling for too long and you feel like you have to walk around with your arms in the air for five minutes waiting for it to dry! This went on smooth and I was shocked at how quickly it dried! It had a nice clean scent, nothing to remarkable, but not overpowering, which is good for deodorant. And of course being a clear gel you don&#x27;t have to worry about the dreaded white marks on your clothes! I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Works great with a pleasant smell that lasts all day long! I used to use Avon roll-on and Dove, but this sure beat both of them by far.  It dries fast under your underarms and there is no need to reapply during the day!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I used Secret in the past but wasn&#x27;t in love with it. They&#x27;ve improved! I used this before attending an event that I would sweat a lot but this did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I received this for free for review purposes, but my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for about a week for a BzzAgent campaign. I was willing to try it, but I was a loyal user of a Clinical Strength cream deodorant that I&#x27;d been buying for a few years. I thought I had an embarrassing issue with excessive sweating, but it turned out that it was the product I was using. It left a greasy feeling coating that never quite felt dry or comfortable. The very first time I tried the new Secret Outlast Clear Gel I was convinced that it was the product for me. It dries quickly and completely. There is no white filmy mess and no coated feeling. It just feels clean and dry. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Not usually a gel user but I received this free in a BzzAgent kit and am giving it a try. I have to admit, I am pleasantly surprised. Though I don&#x27;t like the cold, wet feeling that it gives right out of a hot shower, I do find that it dries quickly. Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I actually enjoy the scent, though it is quite different from my usual Dove Cucumber Melon. I typically purchase the Dove in clear solid form and have been using it for years, though I do find that it rubs off and through my black shirts sometimes. Using this Secret gel has been a pleasant change, though I don&#x27;t care for the dispense system. As another user mentioned, the gel does not come up through the holes evenly and you either end up with too much or too little. This is easy to solve by rationing among both armpits but it is still not ideal. At least with a clear solid, you can know where you&#x27;re swiping and how much is going on. On the whole, I am pleased with the product and would potentially consider switching permanently moving forward though I would love to see a cucumber scent which I find to be incredibly refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed!  I have learned the hard way about buying cheap antiperspirants, and so I&#x27;ve made Secret my goto for a few years now. I just started using Outlast and LOVE it.  I am dry and smell great, even after a day of chasing my toddler!    Full disclosure: I received the product free to try out from the brand.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed trying this product out thanks to Bzz Agent. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent for women really works. It does not leave an odor or residue and it keeps my underarms smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant about trying a gel deodorant.  I normally wear an invisible solid.  My past experiences with gels have been sticky or that they haven&#x27;t dried fast enough.  I received this deodorant as part of a promotion two days before I left for vacation.  I liked it so much that I opted not to take my travel size deodorant and packed this one instead.  And this is a huge deal because I pack travel sized everything because room is precious when I pack!  I spent the weekend in Florida on the beach and outside and never once had any underarm issues.  Tank tops the whole weekend and not once did I smell that purfume-y deodorant smell...just clean!  Plus, no white marks!  This stuff dries very quickly too and never felt sticky all day!  I will be buying this deodorant from now on.</li>
    <li> I received this for free from Bzzagent and I really like it, I was using the clinical strength invisible solid and thes blew that away in my opinion, for me the protection lasted longer, it dried quick for me about 30 seconds. The smell is okay but it dissipates I think once the gel dries. I would buy this as a replacement for the formula I was using before.</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant for free courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret but my opinion about it is truly honest.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this deodorant! The gel is very easy to apply, it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. It has a very nice and pleasant fresh scent. It is very efficient in preventing wetness. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to be able to try the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a promotion for the brand. I am proud to say that I am a now a new fan and consumer and won’t be going back to the previous brand! Previous to my new found love for this deodorant, I was using a popular white stick brand from a different company. I was not happy with my old brand for a number of reasons that Secret quickly corrected. With Secret, there are no more of those nasty, embarrassing white streaks that appear on your clothes that makes you seem like you are incapable of dressing yourself. Also, I love the packaging that it comes in not just because it is pretty but because it is purposeful in that I can see how much product I have left before I run out. Most importantly, I feel secure when I wear it. The smell is fresh and clean and it truly reduced the amount of sweat and odor that I previously produced. It is a quality product that is defiantly worth the price and I would recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to anyone that is looking for a great product with a proven track record of reliability.</li>
    <li> I am normally a solid deodorant user, so this was a change for me. I got this product for free as a promotion for the brand, so it was nice to try something new. However, this product is not for me. Being a gel, it is much wetter than a regular solid, and it stays wet for longer than promoted. It was a good 15-20 minutes before my underarms felt dry. I will say that the product does deliver on odor protection and is long lasting, as I did not have to reapply after a lunchtime work out, which was nice. Overall, the product works well but I prefer my solid to the gel.</li>
    <li> BzzAgent sent me this to review.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much, since I&#x27;ve used Secret in the past and was not impressed, but I really like this stuff.  It goes on easily (after my first try, anyway), and lasts forever without making me aware that I&#x27;m wearing it.  The scent is unobtrusive and there is no sweat at all on my shirts at night!  I even wore it to an interview and it kept me dry.</li>
    <li> I am a Secret user, but I usually use the solid antiperspirant. I received this clear gel to test for free from BzzAgent and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like it. I was afraid that it would not dry quickly enough for me in the mornings when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get dressed, but it dried very quickly. I don&#x27;t have a severe perspiration problem, but I do sweat like everyone does and this gel keep me dry and made me feel secure.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Free from BzzAgent. I usually use a solid stick. I tried this product for a week and I&#x27;m torn. It went on nice and felt good throughout the day. I didn&#x27;t notice any sweat or sticky feeling. However, the scent I wan given was nauseating. It was so strong I had to discontinue use. I&#x27;m sure this is a personal preference and I can not judge it based on the scent. If you prefer a strong and long lasting scent then you will like this product.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample to try out this deodorant and well it was OK!  I personally prefer the solid sticks, but if you like clear gel that this product might just be for you.  One reason I prefer the solid sticks is that I feel it lasts longer.  The claim on secret is that one click and two swipes will last for 48 hours.  I do at least 2 clicks and at least once a day.  So my problem is that I go through the product too quickly.  Even with putting on extra product though, it seems to dry quickly and keeps me sweat free.  It is very neutralizing and does a great job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; kinda gal when it came to deodorant. But I may be a convert. This product applies easy -- it&#x27;s cool and refreshing, and glides right on. But best of all, it dries almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. This means no white marks on your clothing, no little &amp;#34;clumpies&amp;#34; in your pits, and no greasy feeling. And of course, I wouldn&#x27;t be giving it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t work -- it keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day. (Full disclosure: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, but opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean gel deodorant as a sample from Buzz Agent.  I also am used to using the solid stick deodorant, so it is a different sensation putting the gel on.  I do feel like it&#x27;s a pretty good value for the money because I feel like you can get a lot out of it.  They recommend that you only need one click and I agree with that, much more and it feels too gooey to me.  I also like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaving a mark on my clothes, unlike with regular stick deodorant.  The scent is subtle.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant I got it free from #BzzAgent I was not going to try it but I do sweat a lot and yes I do get the white marks . I do not like having them I could have gotten the white marks because I used a spray on. I really do not know but I am glad I tried the mission. It  is not a heavy deodorant , the smell is nice. I will be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> I received a container of this deodorant as a promotion through BzzAgent.com.  I&#x27;m torn on this deodorant.  On the one hand, I love that it goes on clear, has a very pleasant scent, has kept me very dry (seriously!) through my hour-long walks in very humid weather, and does not leave white marks.  However, I had to click the first time over 120 clicks (which seems like a lot of wasted space in the deodorant container that could be filled with more deodorant) and, when applied directly after shaving, it BURNED!  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with burning when applied hours after shaving but directly after was extremely painful!  I&#x27;m going to continue to use the deodorant to see how I like it over time.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample as a bzz agent. I&#x27;m not a fan of gel deodorants but thought I would try again. Definitely better than ones of tried in the past. It dries very quickly, no stickiness &amp; lasts all day. As a PE teacher, it is important that my deodorant outlasts my day. I&#x27;ve used it for several days and will continue.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant free to try…and at first I was a little skeptical.  It came RIGHT BEFORE we went on our trip to Disney to celebrate our boys birthdays.  If you know anything about Disney World and the HOT FLORIDA SUN, you know that sweating is just par for the course there.  I always wind up sweating through my shirts and having sweat stains in pictures…I put it on before I left the hotel, and to my surprise it kept me DRY and smelling great all night!  no sweat stains or bad odor….I think I found my new go to deodorant!</li>
    <li> For some reason when i tried the trial size i waa not impressed. But when i got the full size ot seemed different and more efficient. This deoderant wont leave white streaks on your garments and it does dry quickly so its perfect for everyday use and special holiday,birthday, and date night :)</li>
    <li> I received this free from bzzagent to try and give my honest opinion. I really love the Secret brand and have been using it off and on for years. I really like this clear gel deodorant. It gets a huge thumbs up from me for not leaving any marks on my clothing. I work in a professional setting and need to look good for my job. It is so embarrassing and lets face it just looks horrible when deodorants leave white marks on clothing. I have had to change my shirts many times over the years due to this problem. I love that Secret Outlast does not leave any white marks whatsoever. I also like that this gel dries very fast and the user can select just how much gel gets rubbed onto the skin.  This deodorant claims to work for 48 hours but I have never tested that claim. I shower daily so I have never had to rely on such long protection. I found this deodorant kept odor at bay and sweating at bay. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this CLEAR gel. I have tried a few and it comes out clear out of the tube but it&#x27;s a whole different story when it get&#x27;s to my shirt. This was actually clear. You have to wait a little bit (not even 2 mins) to dry a bit but after that you are safe. I was able to get a full days worth of fresh smell from it. I am quite pleased with this product. Thanks Bzz agent for giving me this product as part of a promotion for the brand</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first because I tend to stay away from gel deodorants due to the feeling of wetness that remains for a while. I was actually pretty surprised when I tried this Secret outlast. The smell was great and suprisingly, there was no sticky wetness. It dried very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any wet marks on clothing. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and I would definitely use this product again!! I gave 4 stars on because I had a hard time turning the dial and getting the gel out for the first few times.</li>
    <li> It leaves no marks, dries really fast, and lasts all day. It is one of the best deodorants I have used. If you are worried about gels then this is the one for you to try. It has worked well for me over the past two weeks.</li>
    <li> I am trying Secret Outlast for free through BzzAgent.  I did not care for the clear gel. I did like the fragrance and the idea of it not leaving white marks on my clothes. I felt sticky and it only lasted about 5 hours before I felt like I was sweating. I was quite disappointed that the product was supposed to last 48 hours and I was sweating after just a few hours of hanging around the house with no manual labor.  I had to wait a few minutes before putting my shirt on because it took forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was very impressed with this product!  I have used other gel deodorants before and they were always so sticky and the protection didn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel however went on smoothly and the protection lasted all day! It doesn&#x27;t take much deodorant when you apply and the coverage is complete and long lasting. And it dries so fast! When you apply, it is cool and wet feeling but within seconds it is totally dry and you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not my favorite, but it is a nice, clean, and fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to see that it did not leave any traces of residue behind on my darker colored clothing pieces. Which is such a great thing, especially when it it warm weather and you want to be in short sleeves all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a member of BzzAgent  and I was sent this product to try, but I would very strongly recommend that you give this deodorant a try, too.  You will not be disappointed. I will continue to use what I was sent and I will buy it after that is gone.  I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of a free campaign through BzzAgent. In exchange for the product, I was asked to give my honest opinion on the product. I was a little skeptical about the gel. I normally do not buy gel type deodorant because of the slimy feeling when applying it. Although this does occur with the Secret Outlast Gel, the feeling subsides almost immediately. This gel does not leave any white residue at all. Overall, it is a good product that does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I received this for free to try and review and I have to say, it surpassed my expectations! I usually don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; deodorant, but this one dries super fast! I sweat more than the average man, which is unattractive in a woman, and this really worked to keep me dry!</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Clinical strength deodorant for years because it was the only thing that I felt worked to keep me dry. I was excited to try Secret Outlast Completely clear because the one downfall with my normal deodorant is that the white cream leaves marks on my black clothes. I am a musician, so black makes up quite a bit of my wardrobe! I have figured out in the past how to roll the bottom of my clothes to get past my armpits so that I would not leave a mark. I also had the routine of putting on my deodorant, then putting on my pajamas to wear until I was ready to get dressed so that I knew that my deodorant had time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are my observations of Secret Outlast so far after 2 weeks of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it dries fairly quickly! I read other reviews about it before I tried it and some people were upset with how long it took to dry, but I have tried other gel deodorants in the past, and compared to those, this one dries quickly. It kind of reminded me of how hand sanitizer dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it is not super cold when you put it on! Another thing I did not like about previous gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- although it is clear and dries quickly, it can still leave marks on black clothes! They are more subtle, but I tried putting on black clothes immediately after putting on Secret Outlast without trying to be careful, and it did leave minimal reside on my shirt. It is still much better than my white deodorant, and used after it dries completely and more carefully- I think it will be a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it works! Granted, the really hot days are over, but last week I took a walk with my family and it was 90 degrees outside and I still felt like the Secret Outlast was working! I have gone through leading multiple rehearsals, multiple walks and every day life, and I feel just as protected as I did with my clinical strength deodorant. I do not think it would last for 48 hours, like it claims, but it works well for one day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much BzzAgent for letting me try Secret Outlast Completely Clear!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective. Does not leave a film on your skin like other options. Dries quickly and controls both odor and wetness from the get go. Have yet to leave it on for over 24 hrs but still feel confident about it&#x27;s effectiveness. Will def try the scented version soon after my free trial tube runs out.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a free sample of Secret Outlast &amp; couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! The scent is fantastic,  the gel is smooth and goes on clear &amp; cool.  Even after doing some intense yardwork,  I was fresh!  I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This really works! Feels a little wet when it goes on but keeps me smelling fresh and dry all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant free as part of a BzzCampaign that I was invited to, because I am a BzzAgent. I was really excited to give Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant a try. I have seen it in the store and thought about buying it, but my other deodorant seemed to be working well enough. I received a 0.5 OZ Gel Deodorant to try for free thanks to Secret! I must say the smell is a little strong when you open it up and first put it on. I&#x27;m not going to lie, for me it was a little over powering at first, but after you put on your shirt you kind of forget about it. It is not the most comfortable feeling putting it on as it is a little cold and wet, but I put it on right after a shower and  by the time I get my shirt on it is dry. It is pretty fast drying as it dries in about a minute. I LOVE that this deodorant leaves no white marks on your clothes. My other deodorant  left white marks so I was able to really enjoy this part of the deodorant. Now this deodorant claims to have 48-hour odor and wetness protection. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I felt like the next day after applying that it was time to apply more.  It does work great for at least 24 hours. This deodorant is pretty high priced, but you only use two clicks (1 per arm) at each application. I really put this deodorant to the test in our high 90 degree weather. I was very satisfied with the results and I really enjoyed the scent as well. I have decided that this will become my new deodorant because it meets all my needs.</li>
    <li> I received a full-size sample from secret and I&#x27;m glad I did. It is a great product and not only dries fast but leaves you dry all day long and smells great. You also don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaving white marks like other brands.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best clear gels I have ever used. I loved how it went on dry unlike most clear gels. I have a 7 month old son and he is always on the move. Mostly crawling, but he is already trying to walk. It keeps me dry all day as I chase around my little one.</li>
    <li> It works great for me.  I have tried many different deodorants over the years, Secret Outlast completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel is a keeper. I received a sample a few weeks ago form Bzz Agent as a campaign.  I have been using it almost daily as I go to the gym for my workout or just running around.  It keeps me dry and smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Secret is a brand you can trust and Secret Outlast completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel is one you&#x27;ll want to try.</li>
    <li> I recently tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel (for free, via Bzzagent) and am happy with this product. It lives up to its claims that it goes on clear, dries quickly, and provides long-lasting odor and wetness protection. I usually use a solid and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like a gel, but it has been nice not to worry about white marks on clothing. This deodorant claims to provide up to 48 hours of protection, although I&#x27;m not sure that one would need this length of protection very often. That feature seems a little silly to me, but I did notice that it lasts all day and through the night. I did notice a little stinging when I put it on immediately after shaving, but nothing very painful and it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen at all if I wait for a few minutes to put it on. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I received this as a free sample. But, quickly decided that this would now be my go to deodorant. The smell is great. It isn&#x27;t very strong, it just has a clean scent that I appreciate. The highlight for me is that it really doesn&#x27;t feel cold on my skin. I have never been a fan of gel antiperspirants/deodorants because they were uncomfortable to put on. This is great. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t send chills all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps me dry and comfortable no matter what time of day, no matter what my activity level is and no matter what the temperature is. It goes on and dries quickly, so I don&#x27;t have to wait around to finish getting ready.</li>
    <li> I did get to try this for free from Bzzagent &amp; Secret but my review is my honest thoughts and impressions of the product.  I am not a huge fan of gel deodorants - they leave you feeling wet for a while and I don&#x27;t have the patience for that! :)  This does but it dries fairly fast and a little will go a long way.  I think its easy to get too much and then you&#x27;re feeling damp for a while!  The scent is perfect at smelling clean but not too floral or sweet.  Good if you just want to feel fresh and not like you have a flower garden in your pits!</li>
    <li> #BzzAgent #GotItFree I am a BzzAgent and received a full sized Secret Outlast Deodorant to try and then review. Sometimes when trying new things it isn&#x27;t always good, BUT in this case I love it! I feel more secure and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. I wear black tank tops just about every day under my clothing and usually over time the stains under the arm area are gross and faded and stained white. So to test this product to it&#x27;s fullest, I went and bought a few new black tank tops. Now after a week or longer, no stains, no fading, NO WHITE! Change is definitely happening in my household. The fragrance is wonderful or you can get fragrance free if that is what you prefer. The odor control was amazing and long lasting! Definitely recommend this product with 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this through BuzzAgent. Since using this for about a week now, it has taken a little to get used to wearing a gel. It does dry quickly and not sticky. Love that there are no white marks, even with the accidental swipe across the shirt! While I think this did a great job as a deodorant I don&#x27;t feel like it did as good as an antiperspirant. Overall it is pretty effective but not sure it would really last the 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean from BzzAgent and I love it.  I have been using Secret Outlast Completely Clear for years and love that I do not have to worry about getting marks on my clothes.  The scent is light and fresh and not at all overpowering.  It dries relatively quickly and is a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and was hesitant to try a new deodorant but not being satisfied with my current clinical strength deodorant I decided to try secret outlast clear gel deodorant. Thanks to bzzagent I got it free! Having always struggled with moisture and odor no matter the temperature or deodorant I used I an happy to say secret outlast clear gel has impressed me. It has done a better job at preventing moisture and odor than the sensitive skin clinical strength deodorant that I had been using for at least half the price. Not to mention it has been very gentle on my sensitive skin. I would not hesitate to purchase Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try out Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant complimentary from BzzAgent.  I found that this antiperspirant did what it said it would.  Secret Outlast&#x27;s gel glides on smoothly and dries quickly under a couple of minutes.  I wore it when i was wearing black clothing, and it did not leave any white residue marks.  Overall, I liked the product and would recommend to anyone, whether you live an active lifestyle of just want a good antiperspirant, I think that this product is effective.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard invisible solid girl when it comes to deodorant,  but when I received this in my bzz kit, it totally won me over. I don&#x27;t have to reapply it at all during the day. It is not messy (like some clear gels are), and it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothes. I am a Secret gear gel girl now!</li>
    <li> This is one of my absolute favorite new deodorants! WOW does it first of all, smell amazing! I was putting it on this morning and my friend even made a comment how good what I was putting on smelled, and all I&#x27;d used was the Secret Outlast! I love how its clear so I can both apply it before and after I have on clothes without a second thought.  It also DOES last a long time so I don&#x27;t worry abouthaving to re-apply as often as I normally do out of habit! I&#x27;m so glad I was given the chance to try this product free thanks to BzzAgent, without a doubt I will NOT be switching!</li>
    <li> I must admit that I was skeptical about using this product. So many deodorants have left me in the lurch. I am pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> So I received this as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and when I signed up, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure I would like this product. I have memories of roll-ons that were wet and took forever to dry, and a gel sounded like it might be similar. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised - I was using Secret solid, and was happy with it (except for the white marks on the clothing), but after using this, I like that it is easy to apply, dries fast, does NOT leave white marks on my clothing and really does last 48 hours for both wetness and odor protection. I prefer this to the white solid deodorant sticks I have been using, and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I tried the new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant.  After using the new Secret Gel formula I have a few thoughts on it.  First of all, the odor protection is fantastic!  I went 24 hours without a shower (bathing at night) and I was completely odor free.  I was actually surprised that it kept me dry and odor free.  The scent was extremely strong and still lasted after 24 hours time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the gel burns my underarms every time I apply it.  I have tried it when I shaved and not shaved.  Both times my arms burn for around 5 minutes after application.  I am not sure I like the wetness of gel either.  I feel like my arms were a bit soggy after application for around 15 minutes.  You also can not put your clothes on right after since it makes them wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any white marks on my clothing which was wonderful!  I was very happy about that.  In closing I felt that the odor protection was fantastic, gel burned when applied to the skin, a little soggy after applying, strong fragrance, and no white marks!  I did receive the antiperspirant for free as a Bzz Campaign with BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this deodorant, and I love that it dries clear.  I also like that I can feel the coolness when I put it on and can tell when it has dried.  I wear a lot of sleeveless clothes and I love not worrying about seeing deodorant.  It keeps me dry and odor free all day.  I did receive this product as a promotion from Secret to try out, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a promotion from Secret.  Used it because it was free but will continue to purchase because I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels a little wet when first applied but that goes away pretty quickly.  Keeps me dry all day, but I do find myself reapplying around bedtime.  Love not having to worry about white marks on my dark clothes and bedding at night.  Unlike bar deodorant I don&#x27;t smell this during the day when I move my arms, but that&#x27;s fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a gel and I&#x27;m not quite used to air drying before putting my shirt on. It takes a minute to dry (no matter what they tell you), but once it&#x27;s dry it works really well. I love the scent. Disclaimer, I received this deodorant as a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel through a promotion from BzzAgent. This antiperspirant works well and provides me with long-lasting odor and wetness protection, even when I find myself in stressful situations. Although in the past I haven&#x27;t liked using gel products, this one dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel cold and sticky like some other brands. I also liked the scent. And since this product doesn&#x27;t leave with marks like a solid deodorant stick, you don&#x27;t have to worry about how you put on dark shirts in the morning. Overall, this is a pretty good product and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I used to avoid clear gels like the plague...I&#x27;ve always loved Secret and have been using the solids for years.. but.. those gels were always so wet, and sticky.  So what a pleasant surprise to find that this gel dries fast and isn&#x27;t as messy as I remember gels being... Hurrah!  It worked just as well as my Secret Solid in keeping me dry and odor free, and didn&#x27;t slow down my morning routine waiting for it to dry.  Although, I do find that I go through the gel faster than my stick, it is nice to know that I have a choice now.  The Completely Clean scent is very nice... I am someone that is obsessed with the way things smell and how those scents co-mingle.  No one wants an antiperspirant that over powers or clashes with their perfume.... Completely Clean is very fresh smelling and blends cleanly with the perfumes I wear.  Total win!  If you have been hesitant to try a gel antiperspirant, give Secret Outlast Gel a try, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll have great results too.  (I got to try this product free as a promotion from the brand because I am a BzzAgent.)</li>
    <li> I got this free to try and thought I would not like it. I usually never like the clear deodorants because they usually never dry and do not offer good protection. I actually loved this product. It offers up protection that matches the protection in my previous deodorant which is the clinical strength - so its impressive and you do not have to worry about white marks on your clothing. I highly recommend this. The only thing I did not like was the scent as I prefer to have my deodorant unscented.</li>
    <li> I tried this deodorant as part of being a bzzagent, and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did. When it arrived it was particularly humid in So. Cal and &amp;#34;It can outlast humidity&amp;#34;. My pits were dry, non sticky and there was no odor. I have very sweaty armpits and have tried everything short of Botox this deodorant is definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free from Bzzagent.  I am a frequent user of Secret and I love this product.  It gives me a worry FREE wetness of my underarm and leaving it fresh all day! I like the completely fresh scent, but I would like to see this clearly gel on Hawaii citrus breeze scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m highly recommending this! It won&#x27;t fail you.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean for free from the brand to test and review and here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Secret Outlast Clear Gel in the Completely Clean scent! I like the way it smells - a bit fruity, floral, and very refreshing. I wore it all day walking around outdoors in sticky, 80+ degree weather and after 8 hours not only did I not smell any body odor, I could actually still smell the original fragrance on me. On a regular work day (where I&#x27;m mostly indoors) I noticed that after 18 hours I could still smell the deodorant fragrance on me. So it truly kept me fresh all day! I haven&#x27;t tested its claim for 48 hours of odor protection since I apply deodorant daily, but I know it can definitely hold out for 24 hours on a regular (not overly active) day! Also, the dry down is pretty quick and no white marks on my clothes. Overall I am very happy with this product and would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Normally I buy solid but I received the secret outlast clean sent as a promotion from the company and I thought I give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised I applied deodorant after I get out of the shower and it took a few seconds to dry,  once I put my clothes on it didn&#x27;t feel damp at all. I like the scent too.  Secret kept me dry all day. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy  it especially if it were on sale!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for a couple of weeks now.  I am really impressed with how quickly it absorbs into my skin! My underarms are dry within a few seconds. I also really like the fresh, clean smell. I am an incredibly active woman, and it is out of the ordinary for me to reapply my normal deodorant in the morning as well as in the evening before working out.  I haven&#x27;t had to reapply Secret Outlast at all; one application in the morning has held me stink-free all day!  I have one complaint, though.  Since I apply the deodorant shortly after showering, and shortly after shaving my armpits, there is definitely a little bit of sting upon first application. This is partly due to my rush, I suppose, but that is the only complaint I can come up with.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE invisible solid antiperspirant user. I&#x27;ve always used it because it is the best. Well, I thought it was the best. I live in south Texas and we are always in tank tops and sleeveless shirts because it is so dang hot down here. I&#x27;ve never really thought about going to a gel because what I was using was so great. Was, is the operative word. As much as I like the invisible solid, it leaves a residue and that is just NOT attractive when you&#x27;re wearing a sleeveless shirt. But I&#x27;m a creature of habit and I just refused to change to a gel because what if it didn&#x27;t work and I was left walking around all stinky. That&#x27;s no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then this campaign came up with BzzAgent and I figured that I would give it a try and now, after using the same deodorant for more than 10 years, I&#x27;m switching to Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I feel kinda silly that it took me this long to try it. Other than the stinky fear, I was always afraid that this gel would sting if I put it on right after I shaved but it really doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower. I feel comfortable wearing perfume and not worrying about the two scents mixing and just being too much. I also find that I&#x27;m not sweating as much, which is great since we live in what feels like Mordor down here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used. Ever. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!! I will definitely be switching from my current brand and start buying this. So worth the money. Love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product as part of the BzzAgent campaign but this review was in no way swayed by that fact.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel works great for many reasons.  First it is a clear gel so it goes on clear and drys clear so there are no white marks.  It also has a great smell.  Not too strong but strong enough to smell refreshing.  Lastly the deodorant makes you feel dry for many hours!  I apply deodorant in the morning and after I shower at night and the good smell never goes away.</li>
    <li> I always use the extra strength deodorant and was skeptical about trying a gel. Overall it performs as well on normal days. It stings a bit after freshly shaving though and didn&#x27;t last me through a 3 hour run like my regular. But I like the scent and protection for normal day to day activities and how it doesn&#x27;t leave marks! #gotitfree #clearlybetter</li>
    <li> I was kind of sketchy about Secret clear gel because I&#x27;ve not great experience in the past with a clear deodorant. I wore this to a football game in 70 degree weather and it held up all day during sweat and plenty of yelling!! I did not have to reapply! Outstanding!! I got it free for being a bzz agent!!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this product for free. While I&#x27;ve loved Secret products in the past, I was skeptical of the gel. I made the mistake of putting it in after dressing, which left my pits feeling cold and sticky for a while. I decided to give it another go and made sure to let it dry before dressing but it took too long for my rushed mornings. The scent was alright, if you don&#x27;t think about how it smells like a chemical plastic. Lucky for me, the scent didn&#x27;t stay with me for long at all. By the end of the day I didn&#x27;t feel protected and it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Outlast&amp;#34; my normal brand.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent in order to test the product. I was very skeptical because i have not had very good luck with gel based deodorant in the past. I have been experienceing excess sweating due to hormonal changes after haveing a baby about 6 months ago so i was looking for something stronger or clincal strength. I gave secret outlast a shot and i was so impressed! My wet under arms are gone! Its like a miracle, thats the only thing i can say because i was caking on layers of deodorant because of the sweating as not to smell bad. Secret outlast actually works and im hooked. Already bought some from the store and added this to my subscribe and save on Amazon. Secret has made me one happy Mommy and customer.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try for free from Secret Outlast through BzzAgent. I actually really like it! It&#x27;s got a  great scent! Sometimes I will click a little too much and even then I don&#x27;t ever feel like I&#x27;m goopy or that I have too much on. I do think I will go through the gel faster than a traditional solid stick. It&#x27;s nice not to have to worry about ever leaving a smudge on my black shirts! I have had reactions to other deodorants that leave me with a rash but no problem with this one! Overall a great product and I would recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant vs my old 48-hour protection solid. The scent I receive, Completely Clean is also very nice as well. As I am not a fan of powdery scents. #GotItFree from Bzzagent.com</li>
    <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent. I love the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel! It keeps me from having stinky pits and doesn&#x27;t smear all over my blacks and dark color shirts, which is all I wear lol! Today is day 3 of not having a shower, as a busy mom of 3 most days I would much rather take a nap than crawl into the shower lol. So even after 3 days and nights I still have fresh smelling pits! The cold gel is kinda gross though but on the upside it dries quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m doing a review for this product that I got  free from  bzzagen But first I like to say thank you SECRET. This product is OK I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Smell it wasn&#x27;t girly enough for me. Also it made my arm pits burn. But it did last  When I tried it on again. This is not for me. But I was free.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample of Secret Outlast as part of a Bzz Campaign. I really did not have high expectations for this product because in the past I did not have a positive experience with Secret deodorant. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this stuff works. Not only did it keep me fresh for 48 hours I did not have to deal with white stains in my shirts. This is a great product I think it would be especially useful for preteens who have not gotten a handle on their hygiene routine and very active women.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to try for free from Bzzagent I was a little nervous at first to try it because I can be a little sensitive when it comes to different deodorants. This deodorant works perfectly for my sensitive skin. I have had no issues and the smell is such a clean smell. I absolutely love this products and would recommend it to anyone looking for something new.</li>
    <li> There is a strong alcohol smell when using this product.  It does keep me dry all day and smelling fresh but don&#x27;t care for the wetness of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I got Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel through a promotion on BzzAgent.com.  It is unbelievable it keeps me dry for hours the scent to awesome.  And when i wear black or dark colors it doesn&#x27;t leave those embarassing white marks on my clothes.  I was an avid spray user now Its the Gel for me espeically Secret Outlast .  Buy it you will LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I have been a Secret fan for years, and I recently had the chance to try out this formula, the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel deodorant. I wore this while on vacation, doing many outdoorsy things in the hot weather. This did hold up great, and it kept me odor free all day and dry. I will say that you do have to let this dry for a few minutes when you put it on, as it is a gel, and it will have that wet feeling at first. Once it&#x27;s dry, I put my shirt on and finish getting dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself like solid deodorants better, just personal preference, however this one works fantastically, and kept me confident every time I wore it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Works wells , but severly dries underarms if you use this gel everyday.My skin likes the solid better !</li>
    <li> When Bzzagent ask me to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel i was very curious about this gel formula. Usually i use roll on or stick and have tried spray versions as well, but the clear gel is very easy to aplly and dries very fast, the smell is pleasant, fresh and fruity but not strong. I have been using it for a while now, and the odor protection lasts all day and without white marks. For sure i will buy it again when this free sample is finished, it meets all the requirements I expect from a deodorant at a fair price.</li>
    <li> #ClearlyBetter #Bzzagent  I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel deodorant as part of BzzAgent.com mission in cooperation with Secret/Proctor &amp; Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;I will attest that the above named product holds true to its claim of NO WHITE MARKS. 48 HOUR ODOR PROTECTION. This truly Outlast other gel deodorants this baby is quick drying leaving No white marks. I was very skeptical just like you. But Given this opportunity was a Godsend☆ THANK YOU♡♡♡</li>
    <li> I got Secret Outlast free from BzzAgent. I really like how it keeps me odor and sweat free longer than my other deodorant, but it is pretty wet when you first apply it. I really like the fresh scent as well.</li>
    <li> When I got to try this product from BzzAgent I was really excited cause I&#x27;ve been a fan of Secret for years.I normally use invisible solids because of the white marks that come from solids and the gel deodorants ( including previous formulas from Secret) are too wet and smear on your clothes.This ones perfect! It dries extremely fast and I was able to get dressed immediately after applying!Best part - no white marks and smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different items from this brand before and it&#x27;s on top of my list in terms of effectiveness. I have never tried the gel version until I got one to try from Bzzagent. It does live up to its claim of leaving no streaks at all. The gel formula dries clear and if this is one of your issues with other kinds of deodorant, you have one less thing to worry about with this. The scent I got it in is something that I find very fragrant and pleasing to the nose. The scent isn&#x27;t that faint, but I catch a whiff of it randomly and actually wondered what it was before realizing that it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using! Now for the most important part of this type of product -- does it work? In the time I&#x27;ve tried it, heck yes. In fact, it seems to almost work too well. What I mean by that is when I go to shower off after an entire day, I have to actually wash my skin extra to get rid of any antiperspirant/deodorant residue. When you have this type of product on, you can tell especially when water comes into contact with the area it was applied to. I have to scrub extra just to get all of the product off my skin. This made me a believer and it&#x27;s now my go-to product when I&#x27;m involved in activities that require a lot of movement such as hiking.    I took off one star because as awesome as it is, it didn&#x27;t live up to one of its claim fully. It claims to dry instantly. It does in a way. It dries pretty fast but it leaves you a feeling of wetness in the area for a while. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a property of it being a gel and it feels \\&quot;cool\\&quot; or what. But it does dry fast even when it may not feel like it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from  Bzzagent.  Initially I really liked this deodorant.  Easy to twist and enough product came out with just a slight twist.  It smelled fresh and I didn&#x27;t notice any marks in my clothing.  While I live in the northeast so the weather is too cold right now to make me sweat much, even while running around indoors I haven&#x27;t noticed any wet feeling from perspiration. So, this is how I felt after the first few days of using it.  Then I must have gotten a slight nick from my razor when I shaved my underarms.  I didn&#x27;t notice until I put this product on.  It really stung.  I&#x27;ve not experienced this problem with other deodorants.  I tried this again a couple of times after that and the same thing happened, so I discontinued using it.  I would think if I used it quite a while after shaving it might be ok.  However, I shavd in the shower and put the deodorant on right after.  I was disappointed because my initial reaction was really good.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Clear Gel Deodorant! No more worries of white marks!  It is Fast-drying, great smelling, and offers 48 hours of protection!  So, if you are in a hurry, you have two options: 1) throw on Secret Clear Gel Deodorant and run out the door since it is fast drying or 2) skip the deodorant all together since you put it on the day before sine it offers 48 hours of protection! Either way you will be protected odor and wetness!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Secret Outlast Antiperspirant/ Deodorant. Since it&#x27;s formulated as a &amp;#34;clear gel&amp;#34;, I can assuredly say that it leaves me clean with absolutely no &amp;#34;tell tale-&amp;#34; white marks on my clothes or even my body. Most importantly, though, I can relax knowing that I have no nasty body odor due to Secret, &amp;#34;my silent, but strong protector!</li>
    <li> I am always switching deodorants so I was pretty excited to get the Secret a Outlast in my Bzzkit! I usually use a solid so a gel was a little big of a leap for me. Guess what? It&#x27;s pretty neat. Although it does take a second to dry, it really is quick. There are no white marks on my clothes which is great. It took me a little bit to get used to how much comes out with a full twist. It was really too much, but now I can use slightly less than a full twist send it is plenty. It works well although I would like to test it out in the hot summer!!!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail to try free from Bzzagent. I wasnt sure what to expect because when I used gel deodorants before, I was left with it coming off my arm pits and rubbed onto my shirts even waiting 15+ minutes and then I was sticky. I ruined a good amount of shirts in the past. This time I decided to wear an old night shirt for the test. I was very surprised that once I applied it, it dried! It dried very fast and I was not sticky! The scent is refreshing and not overpowering. I am hooked on this! I bought 3 more to stock up on because im fully excited knowing that I will not ruin my shirts and no sticky arms. Thank you Secret for a great product!</li>
    <li> I was always told to stay away from clear deodorants because they didn&#x27;t work.  I can say that after testing this product, I was wrong about it. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel provided me with strong odor protection while sparing me the dreaded &amp;#34;snowballs&amp;#34; and deodorant marks. I received the product free because I am a BzzAgent and was testing this product for review.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent I received a sample of Secret Outlast to sample and I must admit that its a bit different. The first thing you notice and have to get use to is that it goes on wet which feels a bit strange but for me it dried almost instantly so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. The pro&#x27;s: pleasant smell and truly is clear! Works great for short periods of time. Cons: doesn&#x27;t last as long as my regular stick deodorant.  I put it on right before PT one day and it worked great during my session but I have noticed that when I put it on the AM before work, 9 1/2 hours later when I get home I have to reapply as it simply does not last the day, by afternoon I am looking for my spare deodorant to get me through the day.  Works great for short periods, if you need something long lasting try something else.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! It goes on clear and dry best of all it holds up under pressure!!!  #GotItFree and #ClearlyBetter</li>
    <li> So impressed with Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Xtend deodorant.  It kept me dry for the entire day and the gel has a quick drying formula so when you put it on you&#x27;re not waving your hands in the air trying to dry your armpits.  I am grateful for being selected to try the product as part of a promotion from the Secret brand!  The SECRET IS OUT now!  The deodorant is designed to go on dry so you can keep your cool! #epic48 Thanks to Secret for letting me try this product for FREE!</li>
    <li> I really like Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant.  It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, &amp; smells great.  It helped control body odor &amp; sweating as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.  #GotItFree  #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I am a Bzzagent, so I was sent this product to try n give my honest opinion. And honestly I would highly recommend this product! It has a clean scent. It does protect from odor and wetness very well and for a very long time. One click dispenses the perfect amount for each underarm, not too much. not too little. It dries quicker than other gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I received this to try out by BzzAgent a few weeks ago. I was using a smooth solid before trying this. My issue with that one was the white marks it left on my clothes...having to change a top because of white marks was getting old. For the first weeks after receiving this I would alternate between the two because applying the gel felt a little different. I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t used my smooth solid in more than a week. I&#x27;m loving my Secret Outlast Gel deodorant! I have no white marks ever, it dries up fast and I feel protected all day long. I always believed Secret was the best ever but Secret gel is their best item!</li>
    <li> This works like it says it does.  It goes on clear, dries fast and no white marks on your clothes and most importantly works for 48 hours.  I am a bzzagent so I got to try this for free.  I tried &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent and it&#x27;s very subtle and not overpowering in smell.  Just fresh.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the solid stick but I&#x27;ve been on the same one for well over a month and probably have 2 more weeks left until it&#x27;s all gone.  So it&#x27;s economical in my opinion.  I have a very hectic and busy lifestyle and I live in desert southwest so I sweat daily and need a good antiperspirant.  Secret overall is the best brand I&#x27;ve found and now I&#x27;m a huge fan of Completely Clear Outlast because it&#x27;s awesome and works for 48 hours.  I&#x27;ve tried other clear gels (my husband&#x27;s) and it&#x27;s so sticky!  But not this stuff, it dries before you can even put your arm down.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of the gel deodorant making a comeback, but I was definitely surprised at the improvement. I got to try this product as part of a Bzzcampaign for free. I usually use a regular anti-perspirant deodorant that leaves the messy white marks if you aren&#x27;t careful. I&#x27;m not particularly brand loyal and will jump around and use different brands. I haven&#x27;t used a gel deodorant since I was in my teens and the memories are not good. It always felt wet and slimy and instead of white marks you got clear streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret has made gel deodorant wearable! It absorbs quickly and you never get that wet, sticky feeling. They claim that it lasts 48 hours on odor protection, and I do think this is correct. I don&#x27;t think it lasts 48 hours on wetness protection. I exercise daily and if I skipped a day I do not think this would keep me dry the second day. I do love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my shirts and that it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think they did a good job rebooting the clear gel deodorant. I would definitely buy it to replace my old brands.</li>
    <li> LIBERATE YOURSELF.  TRY NEW SECRET OUTLAST COMPLETELY CLEAN SCENT WOMEN&#x27;S CLEAR GEL ANTIPERSPIRANT.&lt;br /&gt;I WAS GIVEN THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE TO TRY BY BZZAGENT &amp; SECRET.&lt;br /&gt;I BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER A MONTH NOW EVERY SINCE I RECEIVED IT FOR MY FIRST BZZ CAMPAIGN.&lt;br /&gt;I STARTED THIS THE SECRET OUTLAST CAMPAIGN JUST AS I WAS RUNNING OUT OF DEODORANT AND THINKING ABOUT SWITCHING MY BRAND.  YOU KNOW HOW EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS YOU HAVE TO SWITCH BRANDS BECAUSE EITHER&lt;br /&gt;IT STOPS WORKING OR YOU JUST CAN&#x27;T STAND THE SMELL OF IT ANY LONGER.  WELL IT WAS THAT TIME. MY CAMPAIGN CAME JUST IN TIME AND I HAD NO OTHER BETTER TIME OR NO EXCUSE TO NOT TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL I TRIED THE SECRET OUTLAST COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL AND I&#x27;VE BE USING IT EVERY SINCE THEN.&lt;br /&gt;IT GOES ON DRY NOT WET, TACKY OR STICKY,  IT DRIES BY THE TIME YO CAN REACH TO GET YOU SHIRT.  DOES THAT I NOTICE GOES WITH OR HAS A SCENT.  IT KEEPS YOU DRY AND ODOR FREE LONG PASS THE 48 HRS THAT IT CLAIMS.  DURING THE ELECTIONS DAY LEADING UP TO AND TWO DAYS I WAS REALLY ABLE TO TEST THIS OUT.  i KEEP CHECKING MY SELF BECAUSE IN COULD BELIEVE THE AMOUNT OF HOURS TWO SWIPES COULD PROVIDE.&lt;br /&gt;IT KEEP ME FRESH UP TO 96 HOURS AS WE BASICALLY WERE WORKING THREE DAYS STRAIGHT WITH ONLY A FEW HOURS REST IN BETWEEN.&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.  ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS YOU&#x27;LL SEE IT WORKS WITHOUT A QUESTION.</li>
    <li> I received this to try for free from bzz agent and it is a nice formula and kept me dry. I like that it is clear so it did not get on my clothes. The only thing is I would rather a different scent like the romantic rose or the lavender. The completely clean smells a little medicinal to me.</li>
    <li> Overall this product is fine. I received it from Bzzagent as a promotional item for this brand, and I was willing to try it. I did not like the smell, but there are other options out there that I am willing to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier !  We have all heard the claims of clear deoderant , wetness free and odor free , but this is the real deal!!!  When I received this from BZZ agent I researched the product before using it , the best part is that it is water based so it enters your glands faster.  The scent is very light , dries in seconds and the best part is that even through my workouts at the gym and my black friday marathon I stayed dry , and odor free!  Thanks Secret , this is the only deoderant for me from now on !</li>
    <li> This product delivers! I received a free, full-sized sample of the Clean Scent version of Secret Outlast as a BzzAgent to try for the last month.  This was a great product, delivering on all all of its promises not to leave white streaks on your clothing, to be long-lasting, and to really deliver everything I would expect from a brand like Secret. I loved the gel formula and how you can dispense a precise amount. I applies cleanly and doesn&#x27;t feel wet or goopy on application. Only one minor drawback was that I got a sample scent that I might not have bought had I choose it for myself. As a migraine sufferer, I can be sensitive to certain scents and although this was generally light and pleasant, it was still a little perfumed but that really is more of a personal preference. I will buy this again, however, in the unscented version since the performance was overall unlike anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Got this free from Bzzagent and I must say this stuff is really good, it does not get on your clothing and it is easy to apply and dries fast. I wear a lot of dark clothing so this is a great product for me.</li>
    <li> I received this for free as part of a Bzz Campaign, and I guess this deodorant just isn&#x27;t for me.  The product was alright... the smell was ok and it didn&#x27;t leave any white marks, but it was kind of slimy and dried out my skin.  Maybe if I tried it in the solid for instead of the clear gel it would get a better review, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother trying it since I like my other brand of deodorant more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of product IN there.  If I had actually paid for this, I would have wanted more for my money.  Again, the product isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just not for me.  Smell is just as important to me as how well a product works - it has to have everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the thing I liked best about it was that it DID last a long time.  Even after going for a run I was still relatively dry and definitely didn&#x27;t stink, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Deodorant is a great choice if you like gel deodorant.  I am not a fan of the way it feels (cold, wet) when I put it on right out of the shower.  I will say, however, that this deodorant dries completely clear.  I have a favorite dark navy tshirt I wear frequently and my old deodorant ALWAYS left white streaks, which was especially frustrating when I was running late for something and had to go and change my shirt.  I have not had that problem at all since I joined the BzzCampaign for this product and got a free stick to try.  I will definitely purchase again since the pros outweigh the cons for sure.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think there was any odor protection with this product.  It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for keeping me dry either.  I did like that it goes on completely clear and it does seem to dry pretty quickly, but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this anytime soon.  I received this deodorant from BzzAgent to sample and review.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enought to be able to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free from Secret (Thank you!). I was very nervous and nearly resistant to try a new deodorant /antiperspirant - I loved what I had been using (and I had been using it loyaly for YEARS!). I am sure I am like everyone else about being conscious about not having offensive body odor (sometimes I think mine might be to a compulsive level but hey...) But I gave Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel a try and at first I thought &amp;#34;Oh goodness that feels wet! I am going to have to run around the house with my arms in the air to get this to dry without it being sticky. HOWEVER I went ahead an put my arms down to test it out. There was no stickiness! I felt so fresh and clean and there weren&#x27;t any little clumps under my arms at the end of the day either like I had had with my &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; solid I had always used (sorry I know that sounds kinda gross.... but you knew exactly what I was talking about right?). I never thought I would use another deodorant/antiperspirant but consider me a convert with Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel!!!</li>
    <li> When I first got this deodorant from bzzagent, I was skeptical because I have always hated gels and I have extremely sensitive skin so I always have to use unscented deodorant. When I first started using it I will admit it burned a little bit and I was contemplating stopping using it due to it. After about a week of me using it regularly the burning sensation went away which I attribute to  having such sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and I love it.  Every morning I put it on, sometimes before or sometimes after I get dressed and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being on my shirt either way. It keeps me dry all day long. I&#x27;m in a very stressful situation right now and I&#x27;m constantly anxious and hot and this keeps me completely dry. I love it and I&#x27;m so glad that I got to try it for free because I will definitely be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> BzzAgent sent me the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel  to try and I was not impressed. Normally I love Secret products, but this is not one of their best. The wetness and odor protection lasted all day, just like their other lines, but it went on sticky and stayed feeling sticky all day long.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I walk 2 miles every morning with a girlfriend and have always forgotten to apply additional deodorant in the morning - I am lucky if I remember to brush my teeth that early! - and I know that some mornings I have offended myself when I got home before I hit the shower. Since I have been using Secret Outlast Completely Clean antiperspirant I have not had that problem at all. It really does last and last, and it smells good too. I tend to be allergic to some of these products but have had no problem at all with this one. I am very happy with it, and will absolutely buy it again and again. I have recieveed this as part of a Buzz Campaign as a promotion from the company.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and recieved Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel little over a month ago.  I love the scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes.  However the odor protection does not last for the 48 hours it claims on the container.  The gel does dry quickly but I prefer the feeling of the solid deodorants better.</li>
    <li> I got the pleasure of trying out this deodorant through BzzAgent. I was skeptical of the clear gel at first, remembering the cold gooey gel deodorants of my teen years, but the new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel quickly won me over. It dries so quickly I can put my shirt on right after applying with no white marks on my shirts. Odor protection was amazing, even in my most stressful situations over the last month of testing, I smelled wonderful! But, also not too overbearing and flowery. I can&#x27;t stand when in stressful situations you all of a sudden smell like a bouquet of roses, almost as bad as sweat smell itself...almost. Secret has made some major improvements over the years and I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel really does provide 48-hour odor protection with no white marks.  There were absolutely no marks on my clothes and I stayed dry all day, even on the most stressfull days when I have presentations to give in front of large crowds.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used different secret products for years. I really like solids, and that&#x27;s what I usually go for. The gel, however, works great at keeping me dry.  My only dislike with gels is the dry time and the wet feeling under your arm after applying it. If you can get past that, then you will love this product. I love the smell of the completely clean secret outlast. It&#x27;s a fresh, clean scent that isn&#x27;t too strong or over powering if you want to wear perfume as well.  The Secret Outlast gel does a great job at keeping away odors and staying dry all day long. I did receive this product as a promotion from the brand, but I feel like it is a product that is priced well for the value and excellent product.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel as a promotion from Secret through BzzAgent. I normally don&#x27;t buy clear gels as they tend to make my underarms sticky and wet. This deodorant drys almost instantly and you do not need a lot for great odor protection. I use only 2 clicks (suggests 2-3) and it gets me through the day and through my workouts in the evenings and well into the next morning. The best part is, it causes no white marks! I&#x27;ve worn several dark tops while wearing this deodorant and it has caused no marks of any kind. The clean sent is very refreshing. Its not overpowering like other deodorants can be. I&#x27;m so happy I had the opportunity to try this or I might not have found my new go to deodorant!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is a strange. I don&#x27;t care for clear gels and this was better than most since it dried faster but I still felt icky putting it on my armpit since it was slimy feeling.</li>
    <li> Fast drying clear gel that doesn&#x27;t leave an annoying residue. Keeps me dry longer than I expected. Great quality deodorant that will leave you secure. Happy to received this product by promotion from the brand!</li>
    <li> Just got to try the Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel, through a BzzAgent Campaign, and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps me dry and smells great and so far no marks on my clothes and I have tried all different colors and materials. Nice feeling and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Only draw back is the wet feeling of putting on the gel. It is something that initially turned me off from clean gel because I was too used to the solid formula but I must say that this one dries quickly and overall makes me wish to purchase it and use it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product and compared to other clear gels this one is so far hands down my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It leaves you feeling dry and smelling good. When you live in the heat  this product is what you need. It leaves no white marks. This is one of those must try products. I got to try it thanks to Bzzagents.</li>
    <li> I got this secret outlast free sample from the brand.Secret outlast is great product,it is clear,smooth and worked effectively.When i  applied first time it was very smooth on my skin and i liked the fragrant and look of the clear gel.</li>
    <li> Give it a try no white marks and to stay fresh all day long. It has a smell that is amazing and long lasting. I really like how this last all day and night. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I am the most sweaty person I know. I get sweaty from heat from chills from stress from nerves. You name it, I&#x27;m sweating it. Gross! I&#x27;m so used to sweat and I stopped wearing white shirts. This Secret Outlast might be my answer! I had a job interview and I was a little nervous, but I didn&#x27;t sweat through my shirt for a change! And there have been no wet or white marks on my clothes for weeks. I am super impressed. I hope it lasts. The other positive is the smell. I smell fresh all day and even if I sweat a little all I smell is the Secret Outlast. This product is so worth it. I&#x27;ll pay to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the sample bzzagent!</li>
    <li> I have received this product for free via BzzAgent. This deodorant has a refreshing, clean smell and provides hours and hours of odor protection. The clear gel also ensures that you don&#x27;t have the messy white streaks.</li>
    <li> A very nice product! I got it for free on BzzAgent.com and I really enjoyed it. I was a little hesitant at first because I never tried a gel before but to my surprise it dried very quickly. It is also super refreshing and smells great!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free product from BzzAgent and Secret. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the gel deodorant so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations. It worked great. The new fast drying formula made it absorb really fast so that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the sticky mess. And the odor and wetness protection really lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample through BzzAgent to review.  Although the &amp;#34;gooeyness&amp;#34; feels a little weird when you first apply the antiperspirant, this lasts briefly. It dries fast and (according to my husband) smells great.  This worked really great and I&#x27;ll be buying this for myself and my teen daughter.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outladt Completely Clean Clear Gel to try through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ll admit it took about a week for me to adjust to using a gel deoderant, and I wasn&#x27;t completely crazy about the scent - I always use unscented products - but I was very pleased with the product overall. It dries quickly, lasts as it should (although I&#x27;ve never been much of a sweater) and leaves no marks or residue behind. This was probably the biggest reason why I liked it. No matter how careful I am with invisible solids, I inevitably end up with white marks on my clothes. This was never the case with Secret Outlast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Secret brand deodorant, so I was excited to be able to try the Outlast Clear Gel. I usually get the solid, not a clear gel so I was curious to try this. I generally stick with the solid because I&#x27;m afraid the gel will make me feel like a sticky, wet mess (and isn&#x27;t avoiding that the whole reason why we wear deodorant?). I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Secret Outlast. I&#x27;ve worn it the last three days, with great results. It doesn&#x27;t feel super wet or sticky, goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and keeps me dry and stick free. That gets 2 thumbs way up from me! It says that it will not leave marks on black. I haven&#x27;t tried wearing black yet, but I did wear a dark gray dress yesterday and no marks, yay! The container says it is good for 48 hours, but I&#x27;m not good with going 48 hours without showering, so I haven&#x27;t tried out that claim myself. I&#x27;m a happy customer though and will be getting this again. *I received this for free as part of a promotion from Secret</li>
    <li> I received this from Bzzagent as a promotion from secret. I have been using Secret invisible solid for years but I have never liked gel deodorants. Secret Outlast clear gel feels very cold and wet when it goes on but when it dries my underarms are dry all day!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white mark on my clothes like the solid deodorants do, so I will continue to use secret outlast clear gel. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a Secret Deoderant girl. I usually use the Clinical Secret and I was very excited to try the new Outlast. On my first application I noticed it was slightly sticky for about 30 seconds then POOF! Dry! I wanted to put this stuff to the test so I put on a solid black tee and no white marks! Yay!! Now to the real test...I am a mother of 2 babies under 17 months so taking showers and applying Deoderant sometimes ends up on the back burner. So off we gooooo!! I chased babies and ran around and 24 hours later I gave myself the &amp;#34;sniff test&amp;#34;. Yep I still smell fresh! Great product! I will buy this again, and I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my other mom friends! #gotitfree And thank you BzzAgent for the sample!</li>
    <li> I am a longtime Secret user.  I have never used the clear gel before so when I had the opportunity to get a free bottle from Bzz Agent, I jumped on it.  I typically don&#x27;t care for gel deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent and it does do a good job of keeping me dry, however, the claim about it &amp;#34;not leaving white marks on your clothing&amp;#34; I found to be not exactly true.  I managed to get a little on the front of my shirt as I was putting it on one day and it dried as white as snow.  Another thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the sticky feeling when you put it on and then you have to wait for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was pleasantly surprised that it did not take that long to dry as it does with other gel deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably just stick with the Secret solid.</li>
    <li> This deodorant dries in seconds completely clear. With a good smell that will not compete with any perfume or lotion. I am a black clothes wear and would put my deodorants on after my tops/dresses were on for fear of white spots. With this Outlast deodorant I don&#x27;t have to do that, it dries fast snd clear so I have not gotten a single spot on my black clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended it and it&#x27;s now my go to deodorant.  Thanks Secret Outlast for my free deodorant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is really good but there were a few things I did not like... one being it burned a little from just shaving my armpits and two it takes a few min to dry so I just put it on after my shower and didn&#x27;t get my shirt on until in was dry. The smell is great and it kept me really dry all day. I will be buying this again to try out the other scents :) I got this free from Bzzagent</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing!!!!  I received a free Secret outlast Deodorant for being a BzzAgent  as party of a promotion from Secret, but my review is my own opinion.  I was skeptical at first about using a gel deodorant because in the past it left my armpits feeling wet, but this doesn&#x27;t.  It truly does dry in seconds and left me dry and smelling good the whole day!  I will definitely be buying more of this for not only me, but my teenage daughter as well! #</li>
    <li> I love this product that I received from Bzz Agent for free. It goes on clear and smells divine. Doesn&#x27;t get white marks on my clothes It is perfect for a busy girl like me.</li>
    <li> Works good and the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave a white mark on your clothes.  Just bit a fan of the wet feeling when you first put it on.  It does dry quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful Suave 24 hr invisible solid user for over 6 years. Before that I used whatever was on sale. I decided I would test out Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to see if it could beat my old favorite. In two words &amp;#34;it didn&#x27;t&amp;#34; Let me explain. The claim that it dries quickly, false. I had to stand with my arms bwmt like chicken wings, I even flapped a little, lol, to get the gel to dry. If I didn&#x27;t allow it to dry before putting my arms down, it felt like I was sticky with perspiration for a few minutes. I thought the point was to be dry. As for long lasting protection, I tested it from early morning one day, went to work, did not shower that night, and went to bed. I found that I did need to reapply more deoderant the next morning. I&#x27;d say it lasted 24 hours. The scent is also a little strong for me. I choose deoderants that arent heavily perfumed because I want sweat protection without noticeable scent. The Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel deoderant scent get stronger the more I perspired and I felt people around me could smell the it. I don&#x27;t like that. I went back to usong my reliable Suave deoderant and antiperspirant within a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel antiperspirant because of the wet gooey feeling when it&#x27;s applied followed by the sticky clear coat feeling when it dries (like I smeared clear nail polish on and let it dry!) Secret Outlast Clear Gel has won me over though. It still has that gooey wet feeling when applied but it dries supper fast and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaving a wet mark on my shirt. And there&#x27;s no stiff clear coat feeling after it dries. It does it&#x27;s job just as I would hope. Keeps me dry and is comfortable all day. Not to mention, I LOVE the scent. I wouldn&#x27;t even try a different one. (*I received a free sample of the deodorant to test out. I love it though and will be purchasing for myself after this one is all used up. The opinions here are truly my own!)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel as a BZZAgent. I normally use the Secret brand, but am really impressed with the Secret Outlast.  Now that I have used it for several weeks, I can say that this is one of the better deodorant/antiperspirant I have used. This gel goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing. It has a soft, clean scent that stays with you all day. I have used clear gel in the past and they all apply wet and sticky so I can&#x27;t say this is a negative of this particular brand, but I don&#x27;t like the wet feel when applied.  Other than the wetness, I think this is a great product and will be my number one choice for Secret deodorant.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  I am a Bzz agent that gets to try products for free and give honest feedback.  I have always used the solid antiperspirant.  When I saw this was a gel I was not sure I was going to like it but I was committed.  Can I just say, &amp;#34;AMAZING!&amp;#34;  It glides on so easily and dries almost instantly.  It does what is says, no residue and long lasting.  Although I normally use Secret solid, I will from now on buy the gel.  I loved how it just spread so easily and dried so quickly.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as a BzzAgent product Campaign. As soon as i received the product i tried it on and loved how great is smelled and how fast it dried. As the day went on following my normal routine i noticed i wasn&#x27;t smelling as fresh as i did when i first applied this product. For me the &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34; was more like 4 - 5 hour protection. I tried using this deodorant for a few more days and am still not convinced of the &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34;. I will be disconinuting use and going back to me regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret Oulast Completely Clean Scent for over a week now, and I think I&#x27;ve just found my new go-to antiperspirant!  I was provided Secret Outlast as a part of a BZZAgent campaign and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is an easy to apply, clear gel that goes on smoothly and dries incredibly fast.  Since it is clear and it dries so quick there is zero risk of getting deoderant marks on my clothes!  It also has proven to be an excellent antiperspirant/deoderant that has stood up to heat, humidity, and exercise classes with ease.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample of this product to review and give my opinion on.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised!  I used to avoid clear gels because they never dried and didn&#x27;t offer the same odor and wetness protection as a solid.  This one is different.  It dries very quickly and give me the protection I need... plus, no white marks ever!!  The only dislike I have is that my underarms feel a little sticky after application but only for a few minutes.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve relied on Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength Antiperspirant for the last few years after searching for the perfect balance of protection and odor prevention.  As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of Secret Outlast&#x27;s Completely Clean Gel as part of a promotion from the brand.  I&#x27;m confident in stating that this product goes on clear and dries within seconds, the fragrance is mild and smells refreshing and, best of all, there isn&#x27;t any evidence of smearing or wetness from the clear gel.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL when asked to test this product by BzzAgent and Secret. I have been a Secret user for years but always the Secret Original Solid could not imagine putting a gel on when I wanted to stay dry. I had visions of the 80&#x27;s and the gel version of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put the product to the test by wearing a black T-shirt to see if the gel left a residue. As I took off the lid it took me a minute to figure out you had to turn the knob at the bottom to get the gel to come up and it looked wet and gooey... But as I applied the gel while it was wet it was not gooey but dried fast. I was actually dry by the time I put my arms down and put the lid back on. I am at the age when I deal with hot flashes and usually worry all day about under arm stains and odor. I was surprised that I went all day never feeling that telltale wetness under my arms. I also noticed that the pleasant smell I started with in the morning stayed with me through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When undressing in the evening, I again was surprised that there was no residue on my shirt and more importantly that there was no crusted gel under my arms. Just clean smooth skin. I am not able to speak to the 48 hour claim as I take a shower every morning but before stepping into the shower after a night of the night sweats my underarms were still fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After testing the product for a week now, I am still pleasantly surprised to find the SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL kept me dry all day and left no residue on my shirt. I will be buying this product again without a doubt!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried gel antiperspirants in the past and have not been happy with the ooey gooey stickiness that happens under my arms. But I got to try the new Secret Outlast Gel as part of a bzzcampaign and I&#x27;m giving it a thumbs-up! This formula really does support the hype. No white marks on my clothes, and no icky stickiness! It goes on smooth and dries almost instantly to an almost powdery finish. And it keeps me dry and odor-free all day long, even during an extra-long day of sightseeing on my recent trip to Florida. I think I have a new favorite product!</li>
    <li> Been using Secret Outlast for about a week now and love it.  It really lasts long, leaves no marks and drys quickly.  Most of all, it works great.</li>
    <li> I hate, truly HATE, gel-type products, so I was very wary to even try this. But I did. First, it&#x27;s always so nasty and wet when you first apply it, that I don&#x27;t feel clean at all. This product advertises that it only requires &amp;#34;1 click, 2 swipes&amp;#34;. Not true. 1 click, okay, but I THOROUGHLY swiped the stuff in before I didn&#x27;t feel like I had covered my armpit in goo. Aside from that, I was pleasantly surprised. It was completely clear, stayed dry, and kept me dry. I have continued to use it in place of my regular product. The biggest perk for me is how clear it actually stays. On days when I don&#x27;t shower first thing in the morning, I hesitate to put on my regular Dove because it still leaves white marks (even though it claims it won&#x27;t). This actually doesn&#x27;t leave marks, so I can apply it right when I get up - or the night before - and not have to worry throughout the day if I&#x27;m going to change clothes. If it were on sale, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got to try this item free from the Bzz Agency. I did not like it. It did not give me wetness protection at all. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I usually only purchase white stick deodorant because I always preferred it over the gel type. I used to find that gel would take forever to dry, it was sticky, and it never came in any scents that I liked. With the white stick deodorant there are so many choices, and I love the fruity scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free, from BzzAgent. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it because of the lavender scent (not a fan of floral smells) but it isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took forever for it to come up to the top, but once its up, one or two turns will give you more than enough product to apply to your underarms. It does take a few seconds to dry, but definitely not as long as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran errands all day, and I didn&#x27;t feel any wetness. I generally don&#x27;t get smelly under my arms, unless I&#x27;ve been working hard, and I can say that this has great odour protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, white or dark. This also is great because I always manage to get white marks all over my clothing when I use the solid sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very surprised by the quality of this deodorant. If there were more scents available (preferably fruity) I would switch from my normal brand. I stocked up a few months ago, so next time I go to purchase more, Secret Outlast Clear Gel will be at the top of my list!</li>
    <li> I usually only prefer gel antiperspirants so when secret offered a trial of this product through bzzagent.com I was excited to try it. This really does last quite a long time, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a full 48 hours of protection  but it does hold up a really long time longer than regular deodorant&#x27;s. I am definitely going to continue using this product !</li>
    <li> After receiving this in a BzzKit, I made the switch my from normal deodorant.  First thought?  Wow that is wet!  I had to click a few times to get it started, and once I did, by the second arm I over clicked...  Don&#x27;t do that.  2 clicks was plenty, which leads me to believe this deodorant will last me at least a month, another plus.  The scent is good, subtle which I like.  After the first few days of use, I had no issues with the deodorant.  I was &#x27;free of wetness worry&#x27; and after getting accustom to the initial wetness of the deodorant, must say it dries impressively quick.  Today I even put a dark grey dress shirt on AFTER my deodorant and had no need to baby-wipe-away the evidence.  I have to admit, I am not an overly sweaty person, so for me deodorant was never a huge issue.  For moderate perspiration, I can confidently say it works.  Another plus of this deodorant, which I am not even sure is an aim of the product, is that in the 10 days or so I have been using it, I have shaved my arm pits twice, and the razor bumps I usually have for a day or two after due to sensitive skin are no where to be found.  That alone would be worth a permanent switch.</li>
    <li> I received  this deodorant for  free to try it out. I realy liked it, it went on wet and clear and dried quickly. Since it is clear there were no white stains left on my clothes. The smell is very light, not heavy and perfumey which is great for me as I don&#x27; t like heavily perfumed products. This deodorant  gave me hours of odor protection. I highly recommend it. It is my  new favorite  deodorant!  These opinions are completely  my own.</li>
    <li> im a bzz agent i was pick to do a CAMPAIGN for SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL. i have never use gel only solid but i figured secret is a really good brand so i figure i would give  it a shot. i give it 5 star it does everything it say it will like no white marks on clothes and last for 48 hour odor protection free and the Water-based formula allows active ingredients to permeate sweat glands faster and more efficiently than invisible solid deodorant thank you secret for making a great product and for amazon for having a great price on Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant.. #GotItFree and #ClearlyBetter</li>
    <li> I love that it leaves my skin clear of any horrible white marks that are left on by other deodorant brands.</li>
    <li> I actually liked the product! I was dry all day, great protection and no wet feeling the only wet feeling was when I first put it on and it dried like in seconds but overall I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but willing to try this when it arrived from BzzAgent. I am usually a stick antiperspirant user and have had bad experiences with other forms. I was pleasantly surprised. The gel quickly dried before putting on my top. Unlike my usual stick form, I have found no white marks on my clothes. And I have many black clothes that have white marks from previous deodorants. In addition, I find that it keeps me smelling good all day and all night long. I would recommend this to anyone that uses antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I really like the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant because it gives that cool and clean feeling--especially after shaving. I can wear my black shirts without having to wonder if I left any white streaks or residue. I could definitely see myself purchasing this deodorant in the future. The only downside is I don&#x27;t like that fact the main ingredient is Aluminum Zirconium (I think?) and I prefer more organic and natural ingredients to put on, or in my body. That being said, I would use this on occasion.</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Outlast for almost a month now as part of the BzzAgent campaign. I saw that other people were skeptical of the product for quality reasons, however I was initially skeptical because of health reasons - I typically break out when I try to switch to other brands. I was pretty pleased when that didn&#x27;t happen, but I was also pleased to see that the product did not leave an white streaks on clothing, and so far it&#x27;s kept me pretty dry. I work out a lot and have noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can complain about is that Dr. Oz once said that some deodorants can be used as a barrier for chafing for runners. This antiperspirant is so dry you can&#x27;t multitask the product like I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I&#x27;m happy with the product!!</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant. I got it free through Bzzagent to try out and review. It smells good and it lasts all day long. I have not had any issues with wetness or white marks. The only thing that I would say I dislike is that it is a bit hard to remove in the shower at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT!  Also, seriously considering switching it to my main deodorant.  I found 1-2 clicks gave me enough coverage and though it has a nice, fresh scent to it, it&#x27;s not too overpowering.  Putting it on right after a shower or bath I didn&#x27;t notice it as much and it didn&#x27;t give that uncomfortable wet feeling.  Even putting it on when completely dry, it dried quickly (around 15-30 seconds).  It was completely invisible.  It also lasts a good long time.  Not sure about 48 hours, but definitely over 24 hours.  This lives up to what it claims!(I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.)</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to try out and give my opinion on compliments of BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant dries slightly faster than most gel deodorants do. Still had to hold my arms up to have them dry, but not as long as I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. I was able to put it on in the morning and it would last all day and was still working until I went to bed that night. It even lasted through me doing some Zumba classes. I would definitely use this during the hot summer months when I am sweating a lot more and so then it wouldn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes like most deodorants do.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I got a free sample of this from BzzAgent, but I&#x27;m totally switching. It&#x27;s not as sticky and gross-feeling as other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve tried and it dries quickly. Admittedly it&#x27;s been pretty chilly where I live so I haven&#x27;t been doing much that would cause me to break a sweat, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any underarm odor even when I&#x27;ve skipped showering for a day (and haven&#x27;t shaved in much longer than that). And since it&#x27;s clear, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it marking my clothes. The scent is pretty nice too, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> What I love about secret outlast clear gel deodorant that it really goes on clear you don&#x27;t have to worried about white Marks on your cloths. What is best the fragrance smells great. Now I receive a free product to try but all my opinion here are my own, which I receive just the travel size but that make me realized that is time for me to switch brands because Secret outlast clear gel deodorant works for me 24 hrs, you might say why 24 and not 48 well I&#x27;m a mom of 4 kids so I do lots of running and I move alot. But you will love this product I do.</li>
    <li> tried this product from buzzagent and was pleasantly surprised at how this product worked.  Not only did it prevent wetness but odor protection was great.  I used this product while down in Florida, out in the sun all day.  It goes on without leaving residue and whiteness on clothes.  I would highly recommend secret outlast  ~LORI TARABORRELLI</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to try and provide my honest opinion on. The product is one you can trust to keep you dry all day. No white marks, dries fast, pleasant smell. The only product of this type that I would give 5 stars to would be one found in the natural section only because I avoid chemicals wherever I can. But, when I need to give a presentation I don&#x27;t use the natural products. I need strong reliable protection and this product meets that need.</li>
    <li> I liked this deodorant a lot. It really does go on clear and dries fast (as long as you don&#x27;t put to much on) so you don&#x27;t have a wet under arm feeling.  It has a nice fresh scent that I loved. And it last for up to 48 hours. Which is great cause when you live in the Florida heat and when you have days where you forget what deodorant even is it, you know it is still going strong. I will use this again. I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free from Secret and BzzAgent for testing purposes. Opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> I recived a free sample from BzzAgent and had really good results from it.  The quick drying leaves no spots on anything your wearing.  Working in the nursing field we don&#x27;t have much time to do much of anything.  All that running around will make for a person that doesn&#x27;t smell so good.  Thankfully when we get a break I can grab this and put it on and know I will be good to go for the rest of my shift.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product for free from Secret for a bzzcampaign and absolutely love it! Normally I wouldn&#x27;t have even considered a gel but decided to give the sample a shot and was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s not sticky and slimy like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried and smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> First, I want you to know that I received my Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel for free from BzzAgent. Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel was very refreshing and it had a great smell. It really did last all day. The gel felt icky at first, but once I got use to it it was no problem. It went on clear and did not rub off on my clothes. I have really found a deodorant that I really like and it is here to stay.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this deodorant for testing purposes from BzzAgent. I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gel deodorants at all, but this one really is different. It dries really quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel goopy like some other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is really nice, and the fragrance and protection are really long lasting as well. I used this deodorant during my outdoor august wedding and felt really cool and smelled nice all day long, and there was no residue left behind to leave marks on anything. I will be repurchasing this deodorant when I&#x27;m finished with my sample!</li>
    <li> I am very lucky to have tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant for free from Bzz Agent.  I loved the scent and was really surprised that it still seemed to be working in the morning BEFORE my shower.  It did leave a little white on my shirt when I used it though.  I would recommend to a friend, however I wish it was a solid deodorant.</li>
    <li> Trying this product free from Secret, but Found it sticky and didn&#x27;t dry fast enough. The scent didn&#x27;t last long enough on the days I was working hard or it was hot out. Unimpressed.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this stuff. It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks all over my clothes!! The best part was I got to try it for free from a BzzAgent Campaign, but I would&#x27;ve bought it anyways because it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I liked this as alternative to the clinical strength products, which I normally have to use because of normal products not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I got this product sample for free from bzzagent.com Member name Babygirl46342. #Gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from BzzAgent for free to try and I have to say that I am very impressed. The deodorant goes on clear, dries fast so I know that I won&#x27;t leave streaks on my clothes. I know that when I go out for my daily workout I can come back and not be afraid of smelling bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never liked gel deodorants because the texture is so bizarre- a cold goo wiped all over your armpit? So after being a solid user for most of my life, I got to try the Outlast Clear Gel for free through a BzzAgent campaign. The feeling of putting it on is still a bit odd for me, but it dries quickly so it&#x27;s easy to get over. It didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes which was a great plus (especially since most of my wardrobe tends towards darker colors). I am eager to try the scent free version, though, as I generally can&#x27;t stand the perfumes in deodorants after a while. Or even better, an unscented clear solid??? Anyways, overall a solid gel deodorant!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is the best deodorant formula on the market! Not only does it go on clear and NOT leave white marks, but it also keeps you fresh as a daisy (the product smells amazing too!) and dry as the desert! If you want the perfect deo for that little black dress go for Secret Outlast Clear Gel! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I received a sample version of this as a Bzz agent. I was hesitant that I would like it because I typically HATE gel deodorants. However, I love a similar non-gel Secret deodorant so I wanted to try it. It turns out I love this! It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I think I&#x27;ve hated other gel deodorants because it doesn&#x27;t dry quickly. This works great, and lasts a long time. I actually prefer it to the other deodorant I was previously using.</li>
    <li> Only deodrant ever worked for me.</li>
    <li> Love the Secret Outlast! It is so liberating to not have any white marks. I can play outside all day with my kids and not have to worry about applying more to be dry. This goes on smooth, dries quickly, smells great, and offers long lasting results. #GotItFreefromSecret... I was able to try this product and I have been absolutely impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I have a really bad burn on my leg and am thus contrained to only sponge baths.  My Buzzkit arroved with my free sample of this and I finally feel like I am fresh smelling again!!!  Two thumbs up  million times over!!</li>
    <li> I usually use an invisible solid, because I hate the wet feeling of clear gels.  This was a pleasant surprise!  It went on clear, and with in about 30 seconds it was dry, I forgot I even had it on.  I like the scent as well, and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to reapply half way through the day.  Also, I have extremely sensitive skin, and react to many deodorants, but this was not one of them.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different deodorants that have failed to keep me dry. I never would have thought to try a gel, but this one worked and  dried very fast! I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort after shaving, and my skin is fairly sensitive. This product really did work at keeping me dry all day. I received a free deodorant for review, however the opinion is my own. I will be purchase this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast clear gel is the best working deodorant I have used. I am warm natured and have a hard time finding a deodorant that works well for me. I have used this deodorant everyday for the past five days and it has lasted the wholeday each day. Not even to mmention that there are no white deodorant marks on my shirt since it is clear. A win win all around. The clean scent is a fresh pleasant scent. This is the only deodorant I will be purchasing in the near future.</li>
    <li> I got this free to review from secret.  All in all, this is a decent product but one that I&#x27;m not sure I would buy.  Pros:  Goes on clear  protects for 48 hours  Is a brand that I generally trust and use  The click feature is cool  Dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all    Cons:  The smell is ok but not really for me. There are a couple of different scents. I received the clean scent.   It contains aluminum which I keep reading is not something you want in your products. This is probably the biggest reason I would hesitate to buy it in the future.    All in all it does exactly what it claims.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a believer in gel deodorant before I tried this.  I had tried gel deodorants in the past and they always had a smell, not even a scent, that I didn&#x27;t like.  I tried this the first day I got it...as a side note, it burned like heck after just shaving my pits.  After the burn wore off, within about 15 seconds, I didn&#x27;t smell it again, and it didn&#x27;t feel weird in my pits.  I&#x27;ve worn it for the last three or so days since receiving it and it doesn&#x27;t stink, I don&#x27;t stink, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  If you aren&#x27;t a believer in gel deodorant, give it a try, you too, might change your mind. I got this deodorant as a free offer from Secret.</li>
    <li> I am one of &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; women who normally use their husband&#x27;s deodorant because I have found in the past that the lady deodorants don&#x27;t seem to hold up for me, and no one wants to smell bad. I was given this product to try and was skeptical at first because not only is it a woman&#x27;s deodorant but it is a clear gel! Now, clear sounds wonderful and all but in my mind, it doesnt seem as strong. But, I was wrong and this stuff works! My husband is happy to hear it too, lol, so now he can have his deodorant back. If you are skeptical of a gel too, give this a try. They have come a long way and it&#x27;s really nice not having those pesky white marks all over my sweaters as well!</li>
    <li> I got Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free on BzzAgent.  I like it as much as one can like deodorant.  Goes on clear, smells refreshing and does the job.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product! It smells really clean and refreshing, without being too strong, perfume-y or overpowering.  It took a few clicks to get the gel to rise to the top, but once I got it started, it works well. Now it just takes one click, and a few swipes.  The gel isn&#x27;t sticky or tacky, like other gel products I have tried.  And best of all -- I wore a black satin blouse today and there is no mess at all on the blouse!  I definitely recommend this product.  Note: I am a BzzAgent and received a sample of this product, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I use Secret all the time, and this didn&#x27;t let me know.  I smelled fresh all day and felt nice and dry. The only CON, to me, is that I usually end up with gel on my clothes, inside, or it burps when I dial it up.  Other than that, I would recommend !!!  I got my product from BzzAgent, and I will purchase Secret again.</li>
    <li> secret outlast gel is really great its not sticky like you would think it leaves you dry and fresh for hours  I received mine as a bzz agent and I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it but I will defiantly be switching to this secret outlast because its fresh and dry and does its job  I recommend this to any woman who is very active or has a hot sweaty job you will be amazed</li>
    <li> Not going to lie. I was a little skeptical about trying a gel but omg! First gel ever to not sweat off!!! I totally recommend and would buy again! Fabulous job secret with getting a gel right!! * I got this product for free for the purpose of review via bzzagent*</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this from the company as a tester. It couldn&#x27;t have come at a better (read: more stressful) time of my life, so having the &amp;#34;no worry&amp;#34; protection against odor, wetness or white streaks is amazing. The dispensor is easy to control, it goes on and stays on clear and has a pleasant light scent that eliminates stench without being overwhelmingly perfumey. I did take off one star because it feels really wet when you first put it on (probably because of the gel consistency) and it reminds me of hair gel - just not sticky. Other than that this has been a really great product and its lasted a lot longer than other items I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;d definately recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical as I am a heavy sweater and I end up buying whatever is on sale for deodorant. While the antipersperant did not keep me dry, I still felt good and the deodorant seemed to work. The gel never left marks on my workout gear, even as I got a little wild applying or on long runs.  I received a free trial from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deodorant I have used that claims to be clear.  I was so enthusiastic about having a BzzCampaign on this product - one I desperately need.  I wear black tank tops under by sweaters almost every day, so I am familiar with the many brands who claim not to leave white marks on clothing.  There is nothing worse than having to discreetly check yourself before removing your outer layer of clothing.  Well that&#x27;s not an issue anymore!  You do not have to stand there and wait for it to dry, either before dressing.  And it&#x27;s not like being truly clear is the only positive trait that Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear has.  The Secret brand has never disappointed me when it comes to odor protection, and combined with the clean &amp; clear aspect?  You can&#x27;t lose!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent in order to try it out. It is awesome! It really is completely clear. No more white marks on clothing. It dries quickly and really works!  I usually steer clear of gels as they do take so long to dry, but not with this one. My current deodorant is a solid that leaves less white marks than usual, but with this one... there are none! The scent was not my favorite, but it also comes in unscented which I&#x27;ll purchase next time!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about the deodorant.  I received it as a free sample from BzzAgent but I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on.  I work out 6 days a week and this keeps me dry and odor free through my workouts.  I LOVE that it dries clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my black clothing. It also dries SUPER FAST! I stay clean and dry for hours.  I won&#x27;t be switching to anything else anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I use Secret brand deodorant on a daily basis; however, I typically use the invisible solid. As a stay-at-home-mom, when I had a chance to use the gel promising &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34; I was pretty excited. There have been far too many days where I&#x27;ve ran out of the house in a rush only to realize that I missed that extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression wasn&#x27;t a pleasant one. I typically put deodorant on immediately after leaving the shower. During that shower I, like most women, shave under my arms. The alcohol in the gel caused a burning sensation I was not excited about &amp;#34;getting used to&amp;#34;. I then decided to only use it on my &amp;#34;off days&amp;#34; (aka, the days I don&#x27;t get a shower in). Over the last month, I&#x27;ve used it probably a dozen times and have never made it to bed that night without the feeling of needing to re-apply and then waking up in a rush to the shower from smelling my own body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll stick with Secret... But with the invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have the gel in my car though, it&#x27;ll work as a backup for those forgetful days.</li>
    <li> I normally use invisible solid deodorants as those work great for me, but recently I had the chance to try this gel version as part of a Bzzagent campaign. I immediately fell in love with the fresh scent! Surprisingly the gel dries pretty quickly which is perfect. Once it dries it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky to the touch. I have used it to go for runs and work out at the gym and it gives me great protection, I don&#x27;t need to worry about bad odors during my work out sessions. I personally recommend this deodorant and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This product hits two high notes for a mom of four kids under 5 years old. Morning is the busiest time for me, with little time to get myself put together.  Even the little time I have is often interrupted.  That is why the clean clear gel is a lifesaver. It didn&#x27;t stain my clothes or leave white marks as I rushed to get ready.  And if I didn&#x27;t get a chance to swipe it on quickly or shower until noon, I didn&#x27;t offfend anyone with my smell!  Gross but true!  Having received the product from the company through Bss Agent was a bonus and I am certainly so glad I discovered a deodorant with a back up plan!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try a clear gel deodorant again, as the last time I did (probably a couple decades ago) I remember feeling sticky and unprotected.  However, I was so glad to be proven wrong!  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear not only dries fast and leaves no white marks, but it truly does protect me all day long!!  I think I may have just switched permanently back to a gel.  (I was provided a free sample of this product as part of a BzzCampaign, but my thoughts are my own.)</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent deodorant for free as a Bzzagent.  I used this for the 1st time while running around for my son&#x27;s school party. For some crazy reason, I decided to wear a white shirt that day not thinking that I would be sweating while coordinating the classroom party.  Not only did the deodorant keep me smelling nice but my armpits were dry.  I was concerned that my shirt would stain but it was still nice and white at the end of the school day.  The scent is not over powering and it dries really quickly once you put it on.</li>
    <li> I received a full sized sample of this deodorant to try out and review.  When I first started to use this deodorant, it was great!  It&#x27;s a clear gel, so it went on invisibly...no marks on my clothes which is what I want from any deodorant.  The applicator was easy to use and two clicks of the wheel gave me just the right amount of gel to give me full coverage under each arm.  I was able to get more than 24 hours worth of protection from wetness and odor from one application, which I loved.    I was able to use this product exclusively for about six weeks before my body chemistry started to outsmart the Outlast Gel.  This is a usual thing for me, unfortunately, and as a result I have to rotate the products I use.  When it wasn&#x27;t working for me, I rotated it with the other &#x27;clinical&#x27; level deodorant I have, and since then, it has been great.  That is the only reason I did not give this product five stars.    For those that do not have to resort to using &#x27;clinical&#x27; deodorants, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel will be a GREAT product for you.  Easy to apply, great scent options (I have been using the \\&quot;Completely Clean\\&quot; scent), no messy white marks...invisible coverage!  For those that are like me, it is a great invisible gel deodorant that can be subbed in for the stronger stuff when you need it (special occasions that require that little black dress, or headed to the pool with your great new dark colored bathing suit).    Bottom line-- try this product!</li>
    <li> I tried the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel deodorant as a free product from BzzAgent.  I hadn&#x27;t used gel in years after trying it as a teenager (so easily 20 years).  I remembered why I didn&#x27;t like gel after trying this product.  It makes me feel moist and sticky after applying it according to the package directions.  The scent was wonderful but that didn&#x27;t compensate for the gross underarm feeling.</li>
    <li> No white residue.... Love it!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is great!  It leaves absolutely no marks on your clothes, dries fast and lasts a long time!  I love the scent and the lightweight feel of it.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be switching to this brand going forward!</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Dove fan for years. I thought I would give this a try through a BzzCampaign. At first I really liked the gel, as I typically use a solid. I&#x27;ve been using it daily and my underarms are now sensitive to the gel. I didn&#x27;t know I had sensitive skin, and apparently it took a while to bother me, but I will be switching back to my old faithful deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not bad. The coverage is all day coverage, and you can tell, because anytime you start to perspire you can smell the deodorant again. The gel is cold, as it is kept in a tile bathroom, so it really helps wake me up in the morning! I like the design of the container.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will be a great product for many people, just not me.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I recently tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel and I was amazed how happy I was with this product! I was skeptical at first because all of the gel antiperspirants I have used in the past have taken forever to dry and left nasty stains on my clothes, not Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I was able to get dressed immediately after applying the product and my clothes were unharmed by the gel. The Completely Clean scent is very refreshing and not too overpowering. I thought that I would have to apply the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel after working out but it was strong enough that I didn&#x27;t have to reapply! I highly recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to any woman looking for a reliable and wonderful smelling antiperspirant!</li>
    <li> All day protection!  I like most women have tried many different kinds and brands of deodorant.  This Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel tops them all.  It goes on clear!  It dries fast!  It last all day and even longer. (I have had some really hectic days and just forgot to apply my Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I did not have any odor what so ever.).  I like the smell too, it has a really clean and fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free from Bzzagent however, the review is my own opinion.  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel really works!</li>
    <li> I got to sample Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I am in love with the scent of it. It smells very fresh and clean. It also gets kudos for being clear and fast drying. As far as wetness and odor protection it does a good job. After a good workout I can still smell some of the nice scent and I dont notice much sweat, but I naturally don&#x27;t sweat much. Overall I am happy with this product and would recommend it to friends and family. I tried this product for free thanks to BzzAgent and Secret.</li>
    <li> I was given the product to try by Secret, I sweat like crazy so I&#x27;m always looking for something to try to keep me dry.  I tested Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel over the last month while several stressful events were happening in my life, I must say that the product worked very well and the scent was nice and not overpowering.    I only gave 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t last 48 hours for me, while I did get through a full work day and evening, 48 hours would not have happened.    I will definitely buy this product in the future and recommend it  to anyone who sweats quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Got Secret as part of being a Bzz agent.  Although it took some getting used to with the cold gel, it works perfectly.  I even used it for an hour long personal training session and no real sweat under my arms.  Definitely would use again.</li>
    <li> Ugh, I got this free to try as part of a Buzz Agent kit.  I wanted to like it, really.  But it felt so sticky, I could only stand wearing it for a couple of hours and then had to wipe it off.  I did have my daughter try it and she seemed to like it.  But, I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.  I couldn&#x27;t get past the sicky feeling.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from BZZAgent to try it.  I typically use a solid instead of a gel.  I was impressed with this gel as it drys very quickly so no worries about white stains when putting your shirt on.  It has a soft scent which is good for me as strong scents bother me.  I work as a merchandiser so there can be days I&#x27;m doing a lot of lifting and moving of product in stores.  This deoderant does a good job in keeping you dry doing that type of physical work.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant for free through a Campaign with BzzAgent.  I love Secret&#x27;s &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent. I have used the Secret Outlast Invisible Solid for a long time and the scent is pleasantly fresh without being to perfumy or overpowering, the scent of the clear gel version is the same - fresh and unassuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the idea of a clear gel has always seems like the best way to apply deodorant, all the brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past, including Secrets Scent Expressions Clear Gel, have had issues for me. From a sticky unpleasant application (with an all natural brand), to an overpowering fragrance that irritated my sensitive skin to the point of causing a rash (Secret Scent Expression &amp; several others) or just a lack of true order protection (from sensitive skin formulas) that unfortunately left me smelly by the end of a stressful day, my search for a clear gel that works always ended with problems, until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Secret Outlast Clear Gel for over a month, I can confidently say I&#x27;ve found a gel deodorant that works! The &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; comes with a rotating dial at the bottom which you turn to push the gel up through the plastic top expelling it out through a bunch of holes, this design allows you to adjust how much gel comes out for a controlled application. If you turn the dial too much you can turn it back a bit pulling a small amount of the gel back down inside the stick, which is great in case you clicked the dial too much causing excess gel to come out. This helps eliminate any waste, especially on the first few applications while you get a feel for how the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; and the gel works. The formula goes on smooth and dries quickly when you apply the right amount - within 30 seconds in my warm bathroom - without feeling sticky or leaving an unpleasant residue. Note that if you apply a larger amount it does take longer to dry, so if I&#x27;m going to work out orneeding more protection, I&#x27;ll apply two thin &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; rather than applying a large amount of gel at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor protection of this formula lasts all day for me, through high-stress situations and even through an aerobic workout! Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant is an excellent product and I will continue to use it with confidence!</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of the secret outlast products. Without getting too personal, I usually sweat through most antiperspirants by the end of the day. It&#x27;s been a life long problem and even my husband makes jokes about it. It isn&#x27;t about the strength, antiperspirant just never lasts on me. That is, until I found this line. I have never had a particular problem with white streaks but there aren&#x27;t any with this gel. I like most of the scents and it goes on smoothly. I do remember having to get a bit used to the gel feeling until it dried but I got over that quickly because of the results. I recieved a free sample of the new Completely Clean from BzzAgent and I find it just as quality as the rest of the Outlast products.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast gel is a pretty good deodorant. I had no problems with smell or sweating in a 24 hour period, but did not try it out for a full 48 hours.  When applying it fells very thick and wet, but dries quickly. There is no stickiness to the deodorant after it dries like with some other gels. It does have a strong odor when first applied, very similar to hair spray, but as soon as it dries it is gone.  One complaint is that the amount that come out when you twist the bottom is never the same, I am often having to do a backwards click or a half one in order to get the right amount- there needs to be some consistency. Overall I enjoyed the product, but I will probably go back to an invisible solid after this one is gone.</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample of Secret Outlast from BzzAgent in order to road test it. I am skeptical of antiperspirant/deodorants because I don&#x27;t like that feeling of wetness when I roll on a gel substance under my arms.  I found that if I put just a dab on, it works perfectly. No sweating and no smelling.  Using less is better in this case.  It will also safe money if you are using less.  I really have always liked the SECRET brand, so I was excited about trying this new innovative product.  I am now convinced that Secret Outlast is one of the best deodorants on the market.  It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing or go thru and leave a wet spot, but keep in mind to use just a little bit.  The scent is very nice and subtle.  I can count on Secret Outlast to last all day long and protect me.  I recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for a great day with no worries about sweating, smelling or loosing confidence!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different brands of deodorant looking for one that keeps me dry and odor free all day long and also doesn’t leave ugly white marks on my clothing.  I would find one that would take care of one issue but never one that took care of all three issues effectively.  That was until I was lucky enough to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Antiperspirant/Deoderant.  I will say I was concerned on how wet it first went on but it dried completely within minutes of applying and I did not feel sticky.  And the best part was day in and day out that I have used Secret Outlast, I have not once had white residue left on my clothing.  I also really like the design of the container, it has a rotating dial that you turn to push the gel through the top, allowing you to decide how much gel you want to apply. Also, the fragrance was light and cleaning smelling (not perfumey at all).  I’m sensitive to some fragrances and I had no reaction to the scent of Secret Outlast.  I can apply Secret Outlast in the early morning, bundle up for the cold weather, get warm as the day goes on, run around doing errands or cleaning the house, walking dogs, hit the gym for a workout, and at the end of the day still feel dry and completely odor free.  I highly recommend Secret Outlast for all busy women out there who want to stay dry and odor free all day and not have embarrassing white marks on their clothing.  I for one am making Secret Outlast my new deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent, and one of the delightful perks is trying products products for free...and loving some of them so much I make the switch! Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is a keeper. I&#x27;ve used Secret before and really like the newest incarnation. The gel goes on easily, dries quickly, and leaves nothing behind...no white marks at all. And I appreciate the light scent it has. This new Secret lasts for 48 hrs. to control odor and wetness protection. That might come in handy one day when I&#x27;m in a hurry early in the morning! Secret Outlast does work: it&#x27;s still keeping me cool and dry throughout my day. This is one Secret I cannot keep to myself!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this deodorant! I was stuck on my oldest deodorant and nothing would sway me from that deodorant, but Secret Outlast Completely Clean has done the trick! I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean via bzzagent.com and Secret, and I am so glad I was given the opportunity. I stay dry, and it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my clothes. It&#x27;s a win, win in my book!</li>
    <li> I received this part of BzzAgent to review the product. I waited so long to see if i really would like this or not. The first initial days were good it leaves my pits dry but it dries it off too much that even after shower and after i dry myself i seemed to have an itchy armpit because of too much dryness.  Also the residue of dryness feeling is so hard to remove even in the shower it&#x27;s as if you have glue stuck in your armpit that you have to scrub the crap out of it to remove it. The scent is good but it tends to overpower after awhile and on hot days it smells more. Sorry i will not be buying this again and will go back to my previous deodorant. This will stay off my pits!</li>
    <li> Holds up for all day protection! As great as my Clinical deodorant with half the price!  I received mine  thanks to a bzzagent campaign, but bought more since the campaign started!</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted Secret brand deodorant user for several years, varying the scent as my mood strikes.  I recall using a gel many years ago but I don&#x27;t think it was Secret brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel goes on easily and no residue is left behind.  I know it&#x27;s 48-hour protection but I applied it daily, using one click instead of the 2-3 clicks noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of times using the gel I remembered why I don&#x27;t use a gel.  If you&#x27;ve nicked yourself while shaving (and there&#x27;s no way to tell in your armpit) it burns like crazy for a few seconds (until it&#x27;s dried).  So I&#x27;m in pain half of the time when I use this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from Secret #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I typically use Secret deodorant but this was the first time I tried the Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t choose a gel option for my deodorant but I was giving this one a try because I received this free from a Bzz Agent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say this is now my favorite deodorant.  The clear gel is only gooey upon first application.  By the time I walk from my bathroom to the closet the gel has completely dried.  I can immediately pull on a shirt and not worry about white streaks!  I was very impressed.  It last through the day as well, another great bonus!  Usually I have reapplied some deodorant during the work day as I keep another stick in my office desk, but with Secret Outlast, it truly does outlast the rest!  It&#x27;s fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this new deodorant that when I accidentally dropped it the other day and the top broke, I was quite distressed.  I didn&#x27;t have a great working deodorant and had to resort to the old backup.  Needless to say, I made a quick trip to pick up a new one.</li>
    <li> While I was very skeptical about trying a gel - they go on clear and somewhat thick, take forever to dry and irritate freshly shaved skin - because I received my sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free from BzzAgent for free, I decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;While I was sort of correct about irritating freshly shaved skin, it does tingle a bit when applying to freshly shaved skin, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; like other gels have and the sensation quickly dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this gel is that it really does last-- all day, and then some! You can even squeeze in a trip to the gym after work without reapplying. No matter how stressful the day was or how hot and humid it got in the office, this gel lasted and kept me odor-free. It didn&#x27;t live up to the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; promise all the time, but as long as it smells fresh, I can stay confident.&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that it really does not leave any white marks at all -- perfect for sleeveless outfits!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though, it took a considerable amount of time to dry after application (not a ridiculously long time, but certainly longer than stated on the promotional information.)&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the initial cold, clammy feeling, but you need a long-lasting, freshly scented deodorant, this clear gel is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have used Secret deodorants for a long time now so when I got a chance to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free I didnt want to lose the chance. It does feel wet when I initially used it but it dried out within seconds. It smelled so fresh and clean.  I smell nice and fresh even after a workout. It mostly lasts the whole day. The best thing is it doesn’t stain or bleach my dark clothes. I will definitely be switching to this product.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt that this product works well and the smell is very nice. However, I gave it 3 stars because I wasn&#x27;t fond of the wet feeling when I first applied it and it took a little while to dry. A lot longer to dry than I thought it would but once it did, it was great. The wetness though was enough for me not to want to use it again. It&#x27;s a feeling I cannot stand. If you are ok with that wet feeling under your arms at first then this might be a product you would want to use because, as I mentioned before, it worked quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> As a mom that&#x27;s often on the go, I can apppreciate a fast drying deodorant. We&#x27;ve all been in a rush and found ourselves with gooey wet spots on that cute shirt and we wait patiently for it to dry into an awful stain. boooo  It won&#x27;t happen with this stuff because it will be dry before you get that shirt on.  I&#x27;ve also tried other 48hr brands that had my pits looking as if they were foaming at the mouth. eeeew, right! But  no fizzy pits with the Secret Outlast because there won&#x27;t be any white marks. YAY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product was recieved for review purposes</li>
    <li> Years ago Secret made a soft solid that I loved.  You cant find that anymore.  Instead, they made this cold, sticky, wet gel that really takes forever to dry.  I&#x27;m not impressed.    Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this.  I got it free as a bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to be able to try this product via a promotion by the brand. My opinions are always my own and I have to say I liked that there was no white mess on my shirt when I first tried this product or any time afterward. That is my number one complaint. Number two: does it keep me dry? Yes this product keeps me dry. Yay! Last and important as well: do I like the scent? Absolutely. Give it a whirl if you&#x27;re looking for a good product.</li>
    <li> I feel like the Lone Ranger here and hate to be a BzzKill, but I could not get this product my BzzofApproval. I am a BzzAgent and I have been for several years. I love being able to try new products for free and provide my feedback. I jumped on the campaign for the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deoderant. I have had bad experiences with gel deodorants in the past and was completely open to a good one. I tried this deodorant for approximately one month and was left with the same results as the first day that I tried it. It was fabulously clear, provided great protection against odor and it left not even a hint of white on my dark clothes. My issue that has always been and remains with gel deodorants is that they take forever to dry and leave me with sticky underarms. I thought maybe my body chemistry needed to adjust from a solid to a gel, but to no avail. Ultimately, I was unable to get past the wet, sticky feeling the gel left me with and I have gone back to my solid.</li>
    <li> Not a product for me. BzzAgent sent this to me for testing, unfortunately I discovered my body is sensitive to the ingredients. I was sad, as I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with this brand in the past.</li>
    <li> I got this from bzzagent and I really liked it. It goes on clear and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It protects you from odor and wetness while staying on clear. I have a perspiration problem and most deodorants don&#x27;t do a good enough job but this one did-</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I was surprised at how well it really works. I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t need to apply it everyday. I have worn all colors of shirts and have no white marks, even on black! I am sold! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I really like the new Secret Outlast. It works really well; the gel dries fast &amp; there are no white marks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample through BzzAgent, but the review is completely my own.</li>
    <li> I was a part of a campaign to try and talk about Secret&#x27;s Outlast Gel. I&#x27;ve used Secret for years and typically use the Secret Outlast Powder Fresh Solid because it works so well. I like this product because it does last a long time and it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks. My complaints are that it goes on very wet and cold and would prefer to use my solid even if it leaves a little white. I also feel the solid works a little better and doesn&#x27;t fade like this (I would give the Secret Outlast Solid I use a 5). Even though it goes on a little wet and cold, it did dry pretty fast, which I was surprised because I wouldn&#x27;t use gel for the fact it made my clothes wet and didn&#x27;t stay on well. So a 4 is pretty good because it works well and does what it says.</li>
    <li> Secret outlast was something I&#x27;m not sure I would have bought in the store myself at first.  I received this deodorant as part of a bzzagent campaign to try.  I decided I would give it a week or two before I wrote a review to make sure it was accurate.  I usually go for stick deodorants but those leave white marks on my clothes but smell pretty good.  This product not only smells great but never once did I have any kind if residue on my clothes! It did not take the gel long to dry once applied and I smell great all day! I am a physical education teacher so I move ALL DAY and SWEAT all day as well! I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to stay dry and smell great all day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m another that received this in bzz kit.  I take my showers at night since the mornings are VERY busy and I&#x27;m not a morning person.  I can put this on after my shower and I&#x27;m good to go through the next day!  Love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t really smell it that much at all the next day as far as scent and I&#x27;m prone to headaches due to scents.  I have no problem with this one.  Love it.  Will definitely keep using this product.  It will probably become my new go to.</li>
    <li> I got this as a trial through BzzAgent...  I love the scent and I love the protection that Secret Outlast provides!  I wore this while walking a 60 mile, 3 day walk, and never did I feel smelly or overly sweaty.  That being said, I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like the feel of the gel when it&#x27;s first applied.  Once it&#x27;s dried it&#x27;s fine, but man, what a strange feeling when it&#x27;s wet!  Otherwise, love it!</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  Clean feel &amp; smell, consistent coverage all day.  I did get this product to try from BuzzAgent.com</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally gravitate toward gel deodorants because I&#x27;m too impatient to wait for them to dry before putting on a shirt. This, however, I was pleasantly surprised by. It doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry (although it&#x27;s not dry instantly), and the scent its rather nice (I&#x27;m usually really picky about deodorant scents). I don&#x27;t feel like my armpits stink by the end of the day, instead they still smell fresh! The antiperspirant works quite well also! I don&#x27;t feel like I sweat as much, and I can be a nervous sweater. Overall I think this is a pretty great product... dries pretty quickly, keeps me smelling nice, I don&#x27;t sweat, and no white marks to worry about!     *I did receive this product as part of a promotion from the brand, but all opinions are 100% my own and were not influenced by the brand or promotion.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with Secret Outlast.  I was part of the BzzAgent campaign and was able to try it free!  I have just ran out of the sample, if that tells you anything.  I felt clean and dry all day long which is a big deal in the kind of job I do each day.  I never felt the need to reapply or change clothes.  It lasts a long time which is very important.  I would definitely recommend this product to any woman.  I&#x27;m a fan and will continue to purchase this again and again.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  It did a great job of keeping me dry all day and didnt rub off or leave white marks on my black dress.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received a free Secret Outlast through Bzzagent.  I then put it aside and planned to use it when I was out of the deodorant I was currently using.  When I needed a new deodorant, I went to grab the Secret Outlast, only to find out it was half gone!  Turns out my husband, who had run out of deodorant before I had, decided to try it.  And he loves it!  He had no white marks on his shirt and he smelled great.  I loved how he smelled, I really did.  I tried it a few times myself and was impressed.  I admittedly only tried a few times, because my husband doesn&#x27;t want me to use it anymore.  It&#x27;s his!  Honestly now that I think about it, it&#x27;s kind of weird deodorants are so tied to the gender of the user.  That&#x27;s silly!  Anyone can use Secret.  It works well and smells nice.  What else do you need?</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear is great. I thought it wasn&#x27;t lasting as long as my solid but looks are deceiving. It works and keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day long!!! Would not hesitate to buy it. I did get it free but am so happy I did because I never would have purchased a gel otherwise!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a gel antiperspirant. I&#x27;m an on-the-go mom and I work out twice a week. I also do a lot of walking, so it makes me a bit nervous to try out new deodorants. I usually will stick with what works, but what I&#x27;m using now only blocks odor and does not protect me from sweating. I gave this antiperspirant a try and put it to the test at one of my slow motion strength training workouts. Not only did it protect me from sweat rings, but it kept me dry. It also does a great job at odor protection. I give it two thumbs up for sweat protect and odor protection. I didn&#x27;t have to drive home from my workout stinky and sweaty. This is the first time I did not need to jump in the shower after my workout. I would personally recommend this product. I received a sample from BuzzAgent.com and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
    <li> I received  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from secret and being a BzzAgent..  I am normally the aerosol can type of gal... Breathing in the fumes as I spray away and start my day.  When I received the secret deodorant i was skeptical about a gell working well- would it cover and seal in the wetness and stank  of a days work? Well when I first put it on it was cool to the touch and then the smell was real nice not overpowering as my aerosol was.  I could control the amount needed and with a few practices get the right amount down to use! Unlike solids the end of it won&#x27;t fall off or crumble under pressure!  I would recommend  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to use a little for those light days and a lot when your under pressure!!</li>
    <li> I usually try to stay away from clear gel because they never do what they claim to do. I wear tons of black and my biggest peeve is WHITE MARKS on my clothing.Gels always seem to streak. When I got this product as part of a promotion from the brand, I was skeptical. I can happily say that it has exceeded my expectations. No marks, dries super fast and keeps me odor free all day long.</li>
    <li> I received the new secret outlast least gel from bzzagent for free, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This stuff leaves no marks, I mean NONE! goes on smoothly and has a light refreshing clean feeling when applied. The protection this clear gel provides is amazing, I&#x27;m a nursing student and work long shifts doing clinicals and this stuff keeps me dry, and odor free for the entire duration, love it!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel from Bzzagent  for free to try out and review. I have always been a solid deodorant kind of girl. I always thought that gels didn&#x27;t dry fast enough or give me the odor protection I needed. I work a physical job and I get hot fast (especially in the summer). I need to make sure that I have the sweat and odor protection that will keep me dry and smelling sweet all day long. I have to say this deodorant does the trick and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the scent is great! It&#x27;s really, well, clean smelling and doesn&#x27;t really compete with any other scents I may wear. It&#x27;s not too strong but not so weak that it isn&#x27;t giving you the reassurance that you remembered to wear deodorant. Second, the gel dries super fast. Finally, it really gives long lasting protection. I feel good about wearing this deodorant and I don&#x27;t worry that I&#x27;m going to all of a sudden start smelling like sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I absolutely recommend this product. It gives great, long lasting protection in a gel. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have always used Secret, but never the Clear Gel, and when I received it free from bzzagent.com as part of a promotion from Sercret Outlast I was happily surprised how much I love this product. I have used gel&#x27;s in the past, and they make my armpits feel wet and slimey. Secret Outlast Gel drys SUPER quick and leaves you feeling dry. The scent is not too over powering, but makes you feel and smell fresh. Also, because it&#x27;s a gel and it drys almost instantly, you never have to worry about white marks on your clothes again! I have now swiched from Secret&#x27;s solid to the Secret Outlast!</li>
    <li> I recently received Secret Outlast as a Bzzagent free and I really enjoyed this product. I like a clear gel deodorant in that this brand lasted all day even through by workouts. I like that it does not leave a lot of marks all over my clothing. I find this to be a good product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzAgent to try out.  The scent is fantastic, very clean and pretty at the same time.  Each time I use it I have to turn the dial way too many times for the gel to come out though--I wish it was quicker.  I think for everyday protection it is really good.  I did want to test it out some more though so I put it on before a huge event I was going to where I would be doing a lot of dancing.  I do have to say that it did not stop my sweating and I could almost smell my sweat and that made me extra self conscious.</li>
    <li> Thank you to BzzAgent for a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Secret deodorant, but had always used the Invisible Solid type.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the Clear Gel!  I&#x27;ve always struggled with avoiding to have white stain marks on my clothes - but with the clear gel, that is one thing I don&#x27;t have to worry about!  You put it on, and it drys very quickly, so you can get on with getting ready without much worry.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the scent - it&#x27;s not too overpowering, which is a big plus in my book!  And I don&#x27;t have to worry about having any body odor come the end of the day - this deodorant does it job, and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Stay dry and white residue free with Secret Outlast. Long lasting, great smelling and very affective.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I was nervous to give it a try having used gel antiperspirants in the past. Those versions were sticky and made me feel all day like I was walking around wet, with no protection. Not so with Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. The gel goes on easily, smells great, and really lasts. I put it on each morning, but I am pretty sure I could skip a day and still be covered.</li>
    <li> Ok so when it comes to deodorant, I prefer the tried and true.  No one wants to be out with a sub par deodorant because they decided to try something new, but hey when you get to test a product for free, why not.  Especially if I can do so for the first time from the comfort of my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product had a lot to prove to me and that it did.  I have never been a fan of gels, mostly because putting them on made my underarms feel like a puddle.  With Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, this was not the case.  It was fast drying and lived up to its no white marks and wetness protection.  I love it.  The claim that it is 2 day protection is one that seems to live up as well.  I never went a full two days without reapplying because of my own hesitations, but definitely lasted me longer than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was not a fan of was that I seem to go through the gel quicker than my own regular solid deodorant.  Of course, if I were to only use it every 2 days, that might not be the case.  Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this product a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completed Clean Clear Gel Aniperspirant from Buzz Agent.  I have to say the product does what it says.  It goes on gel, protects you from oder and sweat, no white stains, smelled great (if you like scents), and easy to use too.  You decide how much to put on for the day with a turn of the fulcrom on the bottom of the product.  The one thing I will say is that I am used to a solid antiperspirant, so it was a bit of an adjustment.</li>
    <li> I recently received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant courtesy of the brand for the purpose of reviewing. I normally do not buy clear gel deodorant, I typically prefer a solid deodorant even though I hate the white marks it can leave behind. After trying this deodorant, I&#x27;m a believer!! It dries so fast and clear, I never had any of that wet/damp feeling I tupically associate with a clear gel. Instead Secret Outlast dries quickly and leaves my skin soft and smooth and smelling great. It holds up throughout my entire day, chasing after my toddler (who is always in the run). Now I have everything I want in a deodorant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a bit of a deodorant snob (if there is such a thing). Thanks for family genetics, I sweat a lot and often so finding a product that works is tricky. I loved how fast this gel dried as I didn&#x27;t have to walk around my house with my arms in the air playing the waiting game. The scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering and I felt well covered. I would highly recommend this product as it will definitely leave you dry. I recently got to try this product for free through BzzAgent (if you&#x27;re not a member, go! Tell them Ezzmarelda sent you!). However, my review is based on my experience and not that I got it for free. :)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Bzz Agent.  Kind of funny, as I don&#x27;t really wear deodorant or antiperspirant on a regular basis.  But I do own three different kinds for the times I feel like I should wear it. I had two clear solid sticks and one crystal stick for my clear clear.  I found that the crystal stick worked great unless it was a very stressful event, and then it was drippage everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very please with my results from Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.  It was easy to use, worked well, didn&#x27;t smell like a teenager and didn&#x27;t get chunky white stuff all over my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars?  I find that clicks are too much.  I need about .25 of a click per armpit. Maybe that&#x27;s as I&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t wear very much underarm product.  I felt I needed to walk about with my arm up flapping around until the think layer of gel dried.</li>
    <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Deodorant as a promotion- thanks to BzzAgent. I have hyperhydrosis, meaning my sweat glands are overactive. I was excited to try this deodorant, although I was skeptical that it would help. However after trying the deodorant, I can say that I feel more confident and dry. It drys in a matter of seconds, so there&#x27;s virtually no waiting to get dressed. Plus, I feel fresh all day. An added bonus- There&#x27;s also NO white marks on my shirts anymore. I work at a gym, so I&#x27;ve shared news of this product with members and fellow colleagues. I passed out a $1.00 off coupon to a few members and they&#x27;ve also tried it. One of our female members came up to me after a Zumba class and said she felt more fresh and dry than she had in years! She thanked me for suggesting Secret Outlast. This is a great product and I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got this free from Buzz Agent... and I really like it! It has a stronger scent than I&#x27;m use to so I thought it might give me a rash or become overpowering, but I didn&#x27;t break out at all and I grew to like the smell. I live in a hot, humid climate so I&#x27;m use to applying my deodorant a couple times a day. I did not have to do that with this product. I tested that 48 hour claim on a recent road trip and it actually kept me dry and smell free at least that long.&lt;br /&gt;While I prefer aluminum free deodorants, this one has me wanting to switch. It goes on quick, doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes and works for long amounts of time. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent and was disappointed as to how long it took for the gel to dry.  This was shocking as I currently use their clinical deodorant which I love and have had no problems.  But the gel version of the Outlast was less then stellar.  Although it did keep me dry once it actually dried and kept the odor away, but it was the sticky gel that turned me away.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best antiperspirant/deodorant that I have ever tried. I got it free from bzzagent. It really dries clear and that&#x27;s a surprise for a gel and it dries fast.  Over the years I have spent a lot of money looking for the right clear deodorant. I wouldn&#x27;t have ever tried this deodorant if I didn&#x27;t receive it free.  I&#x27;m so happy with the results, goes on dry smells good and lasts 48 hours what more do I want.  I have sensitive skin so I was skeptical but I&#x27;m telling all my friends this is the deodorant of the summer.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of the Bzzagent Campaign for free. However I do buy different deodorants  at different times of the year because I need to be fresh at all times. I mean what lady doesn&#x27;t ? My staple deodorant has been Dove and as far as I was concerned Secret was okay but just not enough and this probably wouldn&#x27;t be any different than the other versions of Secret I tried. I have to say this was a pleasant surprise. I&#x27;m not a gel deodorant type person because I don&#x27;t really like squishy feeling but that lasted for less than a minute and then left a nice fresh smell.  At my most stressful and trying time of the day this didn&#x27;t lose any of the odor control that it promised. If anything you kinda smell the scent of the deodorant a bit more (but no complaints with that). Had it not been for Bzzagent sending me this I would honestly have looked this over.  Will it be a keeper for all seasons for me? No.  But I am  thinking  of putting this in my rotation to replace a different brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had been using this deodorant before and this just solidifies that it&#x27;s my new go to deodorant.  It dries super fast and you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting a shirt on right after.  The scent is nice and clean and not overwhelming.  I tend to sweat a lot and am always particular about what color shirt I&#x27;m wearing but not anymore.  I&#x27;ve tried other deodorants that worked for a short time but this one has continued to work.  It&#x27;s great for active lifestyles too.  I run 25+ miles a week and it really keeps me dry and fresh smelling without feeling like the girl in the gym with too much scent on.  I don&#x27;t need to reapply more than once a day and could get away with every other.  I&#x27;ve never really been brand loyal when it comes to deodorant but this one changes my mind.  It&#x27;s that great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I received it as a promotion, so I reluctantly tried it.  I have a hard time finding an AP/Deo that works.  Previously, I have not liked gels, but this is different than your average gel.  This stuff goes on smooth, dries quickly and keeps me dry and fresh all day.  I will definitely purchase this again (and again)!</li>
    <li> I #gotitfree from Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;I like this deodorant because it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks. I am usually in a hurry when I get ready and end up with white marks all over. Not with this deodorant! The scent is good too.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons. It&#x27;s slimy when you put it on. I don&#x27;t like weird textures. When it dries, it is no longer slimy. It also does not protect against odor for 48 hours like it states. I put it on at the beginning of the day and by the end, I was smelling a little funky.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this deodorant unless I had a coupon.</li>
    <li> I have always use Secret brand , so when i was invited  by Bzzagent and Secret to try this new product i was on. I have to say that i wasnt sure i was gonna like it because it was gel. To my surprise since i started using this product i haven&#x27;t had any bad experience with it, nor any bad smell or sweaty underarms. It works like promise and the clean scent is great. I live in the tropics and we have hot weather and still the product works. There is no way i would stop using this deodorant. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> As long as you wait for it to completely dry, product is effective. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of rushing and not along time for it to air dry. I haven&#x27;t experience any issues thus far.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I received a stick of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel (whew that will be the only time I use that full name) for free as part of a promotion. Good thing too, because I have been using invisible solid deodorant (primarily Dove) for years now, operating under the assumption that it is superior to other deodorants. You know, strong yet gentle on underarm skin. As it turns out, Secret Outlast clear gel deo keeps me drier and drier longer than my old invisible solid. It is noticeable. And I am not just one of those ladies that gets a little dewy, I do actually sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, at first I was not into the scent; it&#x27;s a bit strong and a bit artificial. It has grown on me, not entirely sure. Secondly, I think the Secret Outlast Clear Gel does irritate my underarms once in a while, especially if I&#x27;ve shaved recently. I do worry a little about the ingredients in deodorant in general, but especially this one since it is so effective. What am I putting on my skin? Are these chemicals ultimately doing harm? This is pure speculation of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To wrap it up, Secret&#x27;s clear gel really surprised me--it does outlast other deodorants. Does it last 48 hours? I haven&#x27;t pushed it to that limit yet. I&#x27;ll have to let you know.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean clear gel has some outstanding quality like it&#x27;s fast drying, fast acting and leaves no white marks behind and gives you 48 hour order protection. I tried lots of other gel deodorants in the past but I can say that this is different and gives you results as they claim, I&#x27;m happy about the results and defiantly buy it again. Thanks buzzagent for giving me this free to try. It really works.</li>
    <li> I was talking to my friends, Krista, Angel and Reya about my new deodorant.  We like to play sports together, such as basketball and tennis.  I told them all about this new product that I got to try for free from BzzAgent.  I have to say, I am actually impressed with this product.  Normally I can find flaws in just about anything, but this deodorant doesn&#x27;t make the list.  For one, I love that when I sweat now, it actually smells good!  That&#x27;s kinda weird sounding, I know, but it&#x27;s true.  I will be walking around and wondering, what&#x27;s the really good smell I smell?  And I&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s my new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.  It&#x27;s a sweet, mild smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower the nose while it does overpower the B.O. aka bad odor.  It dries pretty darn quick, and I never worry about white marks with this gel.  It&#x27;s actually my new go-to deodorant!  I wear it for working out and such mostly, because it works so well.  I don&#x27;t typically sweat while doing every day stuff, but I&#x27;m sure it would work better than great then, too.  My friends each took a coupon and promised they would try it out for themselves, too!  Thanks to BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product for free!  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received a sample as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  I had recently purchased the clinical strength and was having success with it, so I figured this one would work pretty alright.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  It says that it gives you 48 hours of protection, but I was lucky to get 8 hours out of it.  I&#x27;m not normally a very sweaty person, nor do I have problems with excessive body odor, but apparently it&#x27;s still all a little too strong for Secret Outlast.  I did even try to test the 48 hour theory with going a day without showering.  Yeah...I shouldn&#x27;t do that anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I switched back to the Secret clinical strength gel, because I might as well rub baby powder on my pits to get the equivalent protection that this deodorant provides.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I do not like gel deodorants.  However, I decided to give this one a try and am I ever glad I did.  I tried the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel yesterday for the first time.  I expected it to be wet, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I expected it to be sticky, and it wasn&#x27;t.  I actually liked the way it felt and smelled.  I had a very busy Sunday and it kept up with me.  I still smelt like I just stepped out of the shower at eight last night.  Toady was even better!  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a long lasting, great feeling, refreshing deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to review and give my opinion from Secret.  The scent is very nice and Secret is a brand I trust.  It goes on light and smooth without staining clothing.  Overall I was pleased with Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree</li>
    <li> Typically, I am not a gel girl.  I tried it acouple times in high school when I was on the Sports team, and I hated using gel.  It left me feeling wet and sweaty.  I received a tube as a free sample, and it turned me into a believer!  I doubt I will be going back to solid!&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of outdoor sports, and this did the trick!  It dried almost instantly (contrary to what I remember from High School) and left no white marks.  It left me feeling protected all day long!  Such a pleasant surprise!  Thank you Secret!  You are not a Secret anymore!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant is a great choice. It provides great odor and sweat protection, and the clear gel doesn&#x27;t leave streak marks so you don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks getting on your clothes when you&#x27;re getting ready in a hurry. I am glad BzzAgent sent me this product so I could try it for free!</li>
    <li> I received this to try through BZZagent. I prefer this brand in deodorant and was excited to try this. I&#x27;m not a fan of the gel however it dried quickly and lasted long. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really did give this the 48 hour treatment. And it performed well. Although I didn&#x27;t do a lot of heavy sweating, I did, however, go shopping and did housework. This performed very well. I was really shocked because most \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried, and was currently using, won&#x27;t hold up and I have to reapply. Not with this one. I applied once and it last pretty much 48 hours, and it&#x27;s not even clinical strength. I&#x27;m glad that I was able to try this from bzzagent, I&#x27;ll definitely buy.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast works pretty well. The gel is a little strange at first but you get used to it.  The scent is nice and the packaging is attractive.  It works well in the deep South heat as well.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about using a grocery store deodorant, it has been since the 90&#x27;s since I have worn them. But this one will convert me back and save me money in the long run. No  chemical smell, no white marks, no sticky feeling, and no body odor smell. Two turns of the bottom and i&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret deodorant for years, but I usually go with the invisible solid, which can sometimes leave white marks on my clothes if I&#x27;m not careful. I received a free Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent (as a promotion from the brand), so I gave it a try, and I was very pleased. I&#x27;ve been avoiding gel deodorant because when I was younger I&#x27;d tried it and remember it being very thick and gloopy and not drying at all. But this was much better! It felt a little thick going on, but it dried pretty quickly, and it gave me the same protection I&#x27;m used to from the Secret invisible solid, only without the danger of white marks. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am a loyal Secret user of deodorants and this one does not disappoint.  I was lucky enough to be chosen to sample this courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret and I have nothing but a positive experience using this. It has kept me feeling fresh and dry all day. No pit stains too!! I recommend this to anyone who needs a good protection all day long!</li>
    <li> Winner in our book! My daughter tried this out because she is a middle schooler having a difficult time finding something that lasted throughout the day to keep her feeling and smelling fresh and clean. She wore it all day at school and even through 2 basketball open gym sessions and we were surprised at how well it worked and lasted through it all! Fresh and clean scent from beginning to end! Got it free and loved the results!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant. I got this product free as part of a promotion and I normally only use invisible solid and never use clear gel. So, I was looking forward to seeing if the clear gel could live up to its promise of drying in seconds and having 48 hr odor protection. When I first put it on, it was wet and sticky but within a few seconds it dried but remained sticky. I felt this slight stickiness all day. I&#x27;ll admit, I loved the fragrance of the deodorant. For the first few hours, I loved the way my underarms smelled. After several hours, I still felt sticky. I wasn&#x27;t sweaty but just a tad sticky which remained through the day. I may give the deodorant one more try but I have a strong feeling that I will go back to my invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is not the deodorant for me.</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent and received a sample of secret outlast. I am in love with the protection! I shower everyday so I am not worried about 48 hour protection but sometimes when I am busy at work or on a sunny day I tend to sweat,and other deodorants have failed me after six hours of busting butt at work or exercise in the sun, for example a bike ride or jog through town. Secret outlast amazed me! I can run, jog, do hot yoga, for hours and not worry about what I might smell like afterward, although I still shower after any workout, it is refreshing to know that while working out I can feel confident knowing the person next to me can&#x27;t smell me. I have yet to find any residue on my clothing... And at work I sometimes wear black tops. The smell of the deodorant is overpowering at first but diminishes after a while. I am thankful that I was given the chance to try this product and I will definitely try the other scents! Best protection I have experienced from a deodorant! This deodorant is a gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel deodorant, however, I&#x27;m really liking this one! The scent is wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like other gels. The only negative is, it doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as you think a &amp;#34;Fast drying formula&amp;#34; should. But, even with that one negative, I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Secret. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like it at first because of the gel but I was pleasantly surprised. It dries fast, smells great, and has great long lasting protection. And the best part of all: NO WHITE MARKS!  I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> I was given this product by BzzAgent as a free trial. I am usually not a fan of gel deodorants, but this one is an exception. I like that the product is clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting any white marks on my clothing. The product dries fairly quickly, and provides odor protection all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is clean and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try out a gel deodorant. In the past they have failed miserably not even an hour later. So I was happily surprised that  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel kept me dry all day of being outside in the beating sun. It dried super fast and even though I got some on my shirt no one was the wiser since it didn&#x27;t stain. After a long hot day I still smell fresh. I have been using an invisible solid for years since they were the only kind that worked but now I can move on to the new and improved Gel :D  #GotItFreefromSecret</li>
    <li> No white marks, clear gel, AND I don&#x27;t have to reapply through out my day! Finally! Thank you BzzAgent and Secret!</li>
    <li> I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel and I thought it worked great! I do a lot of cooking, cleaning, and chasing after my 2 year old all day so I tend to work up a sweat. This Antiperspirant did a fantastic job at keeping me dry and smelling fresh all day even after sweating. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes. The gel dries pretty quickly but it does feel awfully wet on my skin when I first apply it. I usually use invisible solids but I got the chance to try this gel for free from Secret and overall I think it is great! The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about it is how wet it feels at first but like I mentioned earlier, it dries quickly so it isn&#x27;t worth taking a star away for.</li>
    <li> I usually use solids but I tried this out and I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a buzz agent and received this product free to try out - so glad I did.  Im a fan of the clear gel which I honestly am surprised to say. I have tried clear gel deodorant products in the past and have been less than impressed. Finding them sticky, messy with minimal protection. I&#x27;ve tried this product for a few days and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. The gel goes on easy, and dries super quick, strong odor protection, keeps me dry, with no residue. It has a pleasant smell that I often smell the clean scent kick in throughout my hectic days running around with my 2 young kids. It has kept me feeling clean and dry all day in warmer temps too and love that its clear no mess when I&#x27;m hurrying to get ready and take my daughter to school. I am a super fan of degree products however I think they may have some competition now that I&#x27;ve tried this. Id give it an A if I had to grade it. I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks and give a final review but I&#x27;m feeling pretty confident my first impression will likely be a lasting one.</li>
    <li> I normally use a solid deodorant but I was able to try this for Free through a promotion from the vendor and I&#x27;m so glad I did! The protection from this deodorant is u beatable. Only a few swipes and I didn&#x27;t have to worry aboutvany unpleasant odors. I also love the scent which is light enough to not be overbearing yet strong enough to beat body odor. I highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to try the product. Growing up secret was the deodorant of choice. However throughout the years I&#x27;ve noticed there has been a change in the longevity of freshness. I was no longer fresh throughout the day. Had to reapply mid day. Over the inconsistency I moved on. Fast forward to 2014 big difference in secret outlast. Always preferred clear gel so the consistency is on point. Doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my clothing. I&#x27;m dry and fresh all day long. We&#x27;ve broken up now were back together again. I&#x27;m glad I was able to test this product out from bzzagent love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I recieved Secret Outlast through Bzzagent to try for free and review.  I must start out by saying that I have never had a lot of luck with Secret.  Prior to receiving Secret Outlast I was using another  gel deodorant, it was ok however I did have to worry about the oh to famous white marks on my clothes.  Also by the end of a busy warmer day I definitely  needed to refresh.&lt;br /&gt;I have been extremely  happy with Secret Outlast.  First thing I noticed is how fast it dried, I did not have a sticky feeling at all.  White marks are non exsistant.  I actually took a black shirt and dabbed under my arms after applying....there were NO white marks!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I stay fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this product</li>
    <li> I tried a sample as part of a promotional campaign and was amazed that it worked so well. Dry despite performance jitters and hot lights. My concert black stayed black without white steaks our crystalline glitter.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clean Scent as a promotion from the brand.  I liked the way it went on smooth, dries quickly and leaves no white marks.  Keeps me dry all day and has a pleasant scent.  You can control how much you use of the gel too.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone looking for a great new antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this deodorant.  I usually don&#x27;t sear clear gel deodorant because it doesn&#x27;t protected against wetness, feels sticky and takes for ever to dry. This deodorant is the total opposite.  I highly recommend if are like me and totally opposed gel deodorants. Plus, it has a great fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant as a promotional trial as a BZZAgent. It is the only deodorant I have used for a week now. To test the no white mark theory, I  have wore dark color clothing.  Not once has a white mark appeared. This antiperspirant is truly for on- the -go mom.I should know because I am one of them.</li>
    <li> I received this Secret Outlast Completely clean scent clear gel as a promotional item.  I was very unsure if it would work, and some deodorants make me itch.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It absorbed quickly, did not leave a residue, and most of all it does what it says!  Odor protection that outlasts all others.  Great job Secret!  I would definitely purchase again and again.  In fact, I have my daughters and their friends trying it out too!</li>
    <li> I will admit that I get unreasonably squeamish about certain sensory input (wet plastic, mouth noises, peanut butter in general, for example) that most people wouldn&#x27;t think twice about. So when I received this deodorant for free as part of a BzzAgent product campaign, I accepted it bravely, with the knowledge that I would soon be compelled to rub a gel on my skin and wear it. In my armpits, no less. I gave myself a little gold star just for thinking about it. My collection of carefully laundered dark work tops, however, delighted by the prospect of overcoming their chronic white-streaked humiliation, convinced me to give the stuff a shot. At worst, I would be temporarily grossed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yeah, I was super grossed out for all of five seconds, and then the gel dried and I got over it. Like, it REALLY dried. No slick or gooey feeling, no powdery weirdness, and as several black/navy/charcoal tank tops and sweaters can attest, no streaks, white or otherwise. And as a bonus prize, it smells good -- clean and fresh and slightly sweet. My tops and I are happy campers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using the gel deodorant, I&#x27;ve found that on top of being visually undetectable it does in fact live up to its all day odor and wetness protection promise as well. Sweet! I haven&#x27;t had occasion to test the 48 hour theory, so I&#x27;ll have to take Secret at its word on that one as I do enjoy a shower every day. The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered (and my reason for giving the product four stars rather than five) is that after several hours it starts to feel a little sticky. Not sticky like I&#x27;ve spread grape jelly under my arms or anything, but a dried-out kind of sticky, like my skin can&#x27;t breathe very well: a small price to pay for good-smelling, happy shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that my skin can be very sensitive (and not just because I&#x27;m neurotic), and there is always the lurking danger of any new product I try producing an undesirable result -- stinging, reddening, itching, etc. This deodorant had no such adverse effects on me, even after shaving. My regular invisible solid still sits dejectedly at the back of the medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> The Secret outlast completely clean and clear gel. Goes on smooth and has a nice clean smell. The odor and wetness protection is perfect. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about needing more&amp;#62; there was no white marks left on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lasts all day</li>
    <li> I got to sample this deodorant for free from BzzAgent. I was skeptical at first, seeing how I only use solid deodorant, because my experience in the past with gel was that it left me waiting for it to dry too long, and it always seemed too wet. I really like this clear gel, it dries fast and leaves no white marks on my shirts!! I will be buying this product after I run out for sure! I feel  confident that I will not sweat much when I wear this gel! It also protects me well from odor.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. It dries super fast, little needed for application and last super long!&lt;br /&gt;This scent is awesome as well, not too girlie but fresh at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample from Bzzagent to try it out and review it, I think they&#x27;ve recruited a new customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;Again, very impressed, not gross like other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve tried in the past, dries quickly!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. At my age, I do not shower daily but every other day  because of how it dries out my skin but I do apply deodorant daily. Just think how awesome it would be if the deodorant would last for 48 hours? Well, Now it will. Secret Clear Outlast Gel lasts for 48 hours and it goes on clear which means it will not leave any white marks on your clothing! The scent is also superior to any I have ever smelled. I love secret and I am in love with this new product and I know you will be too when you try this revolutionary deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free to test through BzzAgent. I was admittedly skeptical about trying a clear antiperspirant - I&#x27;ve NEVER had a good experience with them. Most I&#x27;ve tried end up with some combination of unpleasant side effects, from stickiness, to ineffective odor control, to making marks on clothing anyways, to skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast proved me wrong though -- I&#x27;m SO glad I got to try this, and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again! It dries very quickly, and the gel formula doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness behind. The formula is super effective as well, even after an intense workout. It also definitely delivers on being truly clear - so many supposed &#x27;clear&#x27; formulas still leave marks behind. My work dress code calls for all black clothing everyday, so this formula is a life-saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest benefit though? It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin! Even right after shaving, there is no pain or burning, no unpleasant rashes afterwards. This was the number one thing I hated about other clear formulas, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier to find one that is both gentle AND effective.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean to try for being a BzzAgent. I am impressed with this deodorant! It dries very quickly...it does not leave any white marks on your clothes...clean scent...and it worked all day with not having to reapply. Will definitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> We receive a full size free sample of secret outlast gel from BzzAgent, and so far it&#x27;s been great. Not really a gel fan, they usually leave you feeling wet and damp, but gave it a try. So far it hasn&#x27;t left with with that damp feeling and i&#x27;ve been pretty dry.  The fragrance we got is not my favorite, but its not horrible either, and it seems to be keeping me dry. It&#x27;s not completely hot, so we will have to wait and see how it works in warmer temperatures. If it continues to keep me dry all day, I may considered switching.</li>
    <li> I received one of these free as part of a brand promotion, but I am pleasantly surprised. I wish I could use a deodorant with more natural ingredients, but I just can&#x27;t find one that keeps the odor at bay. This really does work well. It&#x27;s completely clear, dries quickly after putting it on, and I even still smelled good the next morning, believe it or not.  I will definitely buy this kind of deodorant again.  I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel as part of my Buzz Kit.&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly as it promises.  Goes on clear, dries quickly and it truly works.  The Completely Clean scent is a nice fresh scent, not too flowery and won&#x27;t compete with your perfume.  All in all, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant from BuzzAgent and i&#x27;m shocked at how well this stuff is working so far.. it smells great, dried almost instantly, and no white chunks and marks!!! Also i noticed my shirt doesn&#x27;t have wet sweat marks like it did just the other day with my old solid deodorant ! It was easy to get the gel out at the top, with a quick click. Several hours later on a 80 degree day i still feel good about it!.</li>
    <li> Got to try this product for free. It is ok The smell of the deodorant is a little strong but its not bad smelling it just smells a little like a mans deodorant. I would defiantly buy it If I t were cheaper than my normal deodorant. I do like the fact that it does not lead white marks on my shirts I do wear a lot of black shirts so that&#x27;s a good thing :)</li>
    <li> Trying out this deodorant as a brand promoter and I love it.  Great Deodorant with all day long protection and no white streaks!!  I never use anything but Secret brand deodorant and this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is outstanding protection on long busy days.</li>
    <li> I applied this after drying off from coming out of the shower. It smells good, goes on smoothly and it dries fast. For being a gel, I was wondering if it would stay wet for a while - it didn&#x27;t. I put on a shirt with short sleeves and I did check it hours later - no white marks. It kept me dry and it smelling fresh and clean all day. I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;*I rec&#x27;d this product free from BzzAgent for free in return for my review.</li>
    <li> This works well, stops wetness &amp; order without the white color.  I like it. I did receive the product as a promotion from bzzagent &amp; pan to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product which I was able to try for free through a Secret promotion.  I&#x27;ve been a Dove user for many years but this product just works better than the invisible solids.  No more clumps, or wetness by the end of the day.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin!  I received this as a free product through BZZAgent and gave it a shot.  Upon putting it on my skin began to feel hot and itchy.  I proceeded to wash this stuff off as quickly as possible and decided this product was not for me.  My recommendation is to test a patch of skin first with anything topical to avoid the experience I had.</li>
    <li> First off, this product smells amazing. I am using the Completely Clean scent and enjoy taking a whiff every morning when I put it on. It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean scent but isn&#x27;t overpowering. Second, once I put it on, it dries within 60 seconds so I don&#x27;t get that sticky, wet feeling some clear gels have. I wore a black tank shirt yesterday and never once did I have to check a mirror to make sure my deodorant wasn&#x27;t smeared on my shirt. Not having to worry about this is wonderful. This deodorant keeps me dry and I typically sweat a lot due to a medication I take. I don&#x27;t smell body odor either. I haven&#x27;t use any other brand of clear gel in a while, because the last time I did, it was sticky and didn&#x27;t dry completely, therefore I gave up on it and dealt with the white sticks. Now that I have tried this Secret Outlast clear gel, I won&#x27;t be turning back. This is the deodorant for me.</li>
    <li> In my life I have used a few different types of deodorant. In the past I&#x27;ve used gel. Then, faced with cold bathrooms in the winter I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to apply a chilly gel to my pits any longer so I switched to a solid. But after suffering through outfit after outfit with the tell tale white smudge under the arm I switched yet again to a spray. The spray, while not as chilly as the gel or smudgy as the solid, also was lacking. It lacked actual protection in my opinion. Clearly I&#x27;ve been a frustrated deodorant user for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the BzzCampaign came along I was pretty skeptical, the memories of applying a cold goo to my armpits still fresh in my mind. But I gave the Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now. I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with it. It always gave me the level of protection from wetness and odor that I was looking for, without the white marks. I forgot how much better it was than the alternatives. So much so that I&#x27;ve decided a cold jolt to the pits in the AM was much more of a tolerable side effect than people moving away from me on the subway. Plus, i&#x27;ve done a little troubleshooting and I now give the stick a nice breath huff to warm it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add, I have been totally digging the scent I got too. I was sitting at my desk a few days ago and noticed a nice light scent that I couldn&#x27;t readily identify. After sniffing around I realized it was coming from under my sleeves. I must say, quite delightful indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product over solids and sprays.</li>
    <li> I recently got a free sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent and boy and I happy I did! I have previously only used 1 brand of deodorant until now. Every time I tried another it disappointed me leaving me sweaty by noon.  This product was amazing! First of all the Gel does not take long to dry or feel wet under your arms like other products. Second the product has a nice scent but nothing that smells like I sprayed perfume on my armpits. Lastly this product lasts, not until noon, not until 3, but all day! I come home from work and I still smell good! I can not say enough how great this is, I am permanently switching now!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean from Bzzagent for free to test and share my experience. I also received free coupons for Secret Clear Gel and Gillette Clear Gel, that I&#x27;m glad to use...because who doesn&#x27;t like to save a dollar? This product smells great! It goes on invisible so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing or car seats. I applied it at 5:00 am before work. By 3:00 pm I was still dry, but had to reapply for odor. I think that is pretty normal for deodorant after a hard day&#x27;s work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this new Secret Outlast for a few days now.  While i typically wear invisible solids this deodorant dries fast and keeps me dry all day long! The fresh scent is a bit overwhelming at first but I hardly notice it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a runner and this holds up mile after mile!</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a Bzzagent campaign and I was anxious to try it and I did for several days...here&#x27;s my review:  While I do feel completely protected after it&#x27;s on for awhile, it takes a little while for the \\&quot;wetness\\&quot; feel of the gel to go away and I&#x27;m not too crazy about that. I feel sticky for a little bit longer then their claims of it going away almost instantly...it doesn&#x27;t.  But once it does go away....I absolutely feel protected and noticed that it was even still on the next day because I could still smell it. So their claims of 48 hours seems to be quite true.</li>
    <li> I got to sample this for free on BzzAgent and I&#x27;m glad I got to try it. It goes on clear, drys quickly and sets my mind at ease about leaving marks on my shirt. Pretty happy with the outcome and generally I could do with out clear gel deodorants.</li>
    <li> Finally a gel that ACTUALLY WORKS! I was skeptical when I heard about this, but when I got a free product from buzzagent, I was excited to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that for the first time, there was actually a gel that kept me smelling fresh and sweating less, even when doing a pretty tough (Shred) workout. I am so relieved not to have to do the deodorant stain check every morning, followed by the frantic rubbing to get the stains off!#GotItFree</li>
    <li> This deodorant exceeded my expectations.  It is truly fast drying and leaves no white marks!  Even with a tank top on I had no residue!  Since I turned 40, I have had a problem with my old deodorant not being effective.  Well I have found my replacement.  This formula has great odor control!  I&#x27;m no longer self conscious at the end of a long hectic workday that my deodorant has given out.  Thank you Secret!  #GotItFree  #ClearlyBetter</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised with this deodorant because so many others have failed including clinical strength types.  After a warm day of running errands, getting in and out of a hot car and hoofing it across parking lots, I was sold.  My armpits were not damp or musky; they were fine.  It has a fresh scent when you first put it on but goes away later, which is great because there is no smell at all.  I will be buying again on Amazon.com because they have the lowest prices.</li>
    <li> First I must say that I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. My review: A trip to the gym, 3 showers, an hour in the pool, an 8 hour work day, fish for dinner, socializing well into the evening and I still smell great. Not a powdery or overly parfumed smell, just a good clean smell. Never wet or stick even on a humid day.</li>
    <li> No more white streaks!  I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean via Bzz Agent and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  I wear a lot of black and constantly struggle with white streaks when I&#x27;m rushing to get dressed in the morning.  Since trying this product for about the last week, I&#x27;ve had absolutely zero problems.  It also feels really nice going on - it&#x27;s got a smoothness to is that&#x27;s different from other deoderants, the scent is nice, and the odor/wetness control is of the high quality you&#x27;d expect from a Secret product.</li>
    <li> Overall I really like this deodorant. The smell is great! The deodorant has done a great job of keeping me protected. It will make your shirt wet if it hasn&#x27;t had enough time to dry before coming in contact. However, it doesn&#x27;t stain the clothing. Also, I don&#x27;t see the product lasting nearly as long as a solid deodorant. I&#x27;m saving it for my sleeveless shirt days! I received this deodorant for free from BZZ Agent to review.</li>
    <li> I got this to try for FREE from BzzAgnet as a campaign for them to promote the brand and I immediately didn&#x27;t like the feeling of a gel under my arm.  The good thing is I didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks but the gel was wet and cold and saturated my clothing with it. (no matter how much I used as the dispensing does give a lot for one application)  It has a nice not overpowering scent which I enjoyed compared to other leading deodorants.  It did keep me dry all day long and during my intense workout.  I didn&#x27;t notice any scents wafting during but it did keep me dry and from being too oderous. lol  Overall I would say its a good product and to give it a go if you like gel otherwise its not for me.</li>
    <li> The only Antiperspirant I use and sometimes it is hard to find...</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to try and review.  This is my honest opinion.  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave behind a clumpy mess on your underarm or your clothes.  No more white marks on you black clothing.  Also I sweat a lot.  This gave me protection of odor and sweating.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free with BzzAgent and I was impressed.  I normally use a solid and my experience with gels, even completely clear ones is that if you get the gel on clothes, it will leave a mark.  Not so with this product.  It dries quickly and clear.  I have worn black and gotten the product on the clothes.  Not a mark anywhere.  The odor protection is great.  My only negative is that 48 hour protection seems a little generous.  I reapply more than I do the Degree I normally use to keep feeling fresh, but it does last longer than most products.  I do feel like I use a little more product than with a solid, but we will see as I continue using it</li>
    <li> I received the clear gel to try as part of being a BzzAgent - I loved it, helped keep me dry, smelled great. Left me feeling confident, will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I work in a high activity job with dogs.  I recieved this as a free trail and thought it would be great since my job requires me to be on the move all day.  I put it on and no white marks! woo hoo!  i went through the day and was pleased i could lift my arms with out worry about sweat stain in my pits. it isn&#x27;t heavily scented like i have noticed with other brands.  the next day I tried not reapplying to see if it would go the distance and to my surprise it did. thank you bzzagent for sending this to me and allowing me to try it out.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m not usually a fan of gel deodorants; i find them to be annoyingly wet and sticky once they dry.  That being said, I was surprised by the Secret Outlast Xtend Clear Gel.  It dried much faster than many other products I have tried, and didn&#x27;t leave that yucky sticky feeling once it dried.  I also love that the pH of Secret Outlast® minimizes odor-causing bacteria for 48-hour odor protection (science is the best!).    My only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t as strong of an antiperspirant as I was hoping; I happen to be a bit of a sweater (not fun as a woman!), but it did the job for wintertime.  When it warms up i will likely try the solid version or switch back to my previous brand.  Overall, I was impressed and plan to buy Secret Outlast Xtend in the future (I received this one free to try).</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel was mailed to my home as a Free Sample from BzzAgent and this is the first time trying a Clear Gel. So easy to use and works all day for that extra 48 hour odor protection you need on those hots days especially in the summer months and Southwest Florida. It didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my black clothes, which was great since the current one does all the time.  Plus it&#x27;s fast drying especially when you are running out the door!  #GotItFree #ClearlyBetter #SecretOutlast</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel free from Bzzagent to review, but these opinions are all mine: I was surprisingly impressed with this deodorant! I typically switch between Secret Clear Solids and Dove as after a short time the scents start bugging m e and I feel they stop protecting me. However I haven&#x27;t had any of the uncomfortable dampness in my underarms. The scent hasn&#x27;t gone away and I&#x27;ve not at all noticed any streaks on my clothing. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this stuff is A-Okay in my book.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel  goes on without putting white streaks on my clothing, smells GREAT, and works better than any other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t pull on sensitive underarm skin!  I HIGHLY recommend this!!  I was lucky enough to #GotItFree from Secret and BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it because I am a creature of habit!  I received it FREE as a promotion from the brand and I am so glad that I did.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the wet, sticky feeling when I put it on, but LOVE this stuff!  Dries super fast!  Great smell and incredible protection!  I will be purchasing Secret Outlast Clean Scent going forward!  It is the best I have used!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant as a product test. It has GREAT odor protection, dried super quick and left NO white marks! I used this on my wedding day, which while beautiful and amazing was also stressful and very hectic and busy. Not only did it last through the entire day, it kept on working though the parties that night and I still smelled fresh and clean the next morning! I also had 0 lines,marks or residue left on my wedding dress. LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I think this deodorant its ok, but it is not the last coke! I wold like to be more protected during hot days!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as part of promotion for Secret. It worked really well for me. I normally use the white stick kind of deodorant so the gel feel was new to me. I used it for a whole week and I love it. The no white marks and clean scent are amazing. Plus I do feel fresh and dry all day and since I work outside in Texas this is very important. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest.  I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of clear gel deodorants.  They tend to take a while to dry, and make me feel dirty and clammy while I&#x27;m waiting.  They also tend to run, making me feel even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I was offered the opportunity by BzzAgent &amp; Secret to try out the new clear gel, I almost said no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am actually glad I decided to try this out.  Secret has always been my first choice in deodorant, and I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give them the benefit of the doubt.  And I do like the product.  It dries extremely fast.  Almost as soon as I&#x27;ve finished putting it on, it feels dry.  It doesn&#x27;t run, either, which is great.  I can put it on before getting dressed, or after I get dressed, and I don&#x27;t get spots on my clothes either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m going to permanently switch, but I&#x27;m fairly pleased with this product, and would definitely recommend it for people who frequently worry about deodorant spots on their clothing.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is just OK. I received a stick directly from Secret to try for free as part of a promotion. The gel gives me the creeps. It feels like a blob of wetness in my armpits until it dries. However; once it is dried, I do like it. It does seem to outlast my regular stick deodorant. About mid-day, I do not feel like I need to reapply my deodorant - in my stressful job, I seem to do a lot of sweating! This deodorant lasts the entire day.</li>
    <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast for free from the brand. I usually buy the regular stick deodorant, but was willing to give the gel a shot. I love how fast the gel dried on my underarms. I also love how I only have to apply the deodorant once. We all have those times where somehow we forget to put any deodorant on in the morning as we are rushing out the door- since we know it lasts 48 hours, i don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;sweat it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I was scheduled to receive a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant, but BzzAgent never sent it.  After reading about it on their site and on Amazon, I just had to try it since I had tried most of the other Secret products in the &#x27;Outlast&#x27; line and loved them all!  The Clear Gel is no exception.  No white marks, glides on easily, muted scent and best of all:  it works.  Plain and simple.  Honestly, you cannot go wrong with any Secret Outlast, but the clear gel is a great choice for no white lines.  Bravo (again!) Secret!</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from BzzAgent and I love it!  I was skeptical about the gel as I have had bad experiences in the past with it being sticky and leaving a residue.  This changed my mind.  It goes on quick and smooth, it dries fast, and leaves no residue.  Also it smells great!  It lasts all day through work and then through my workouts.  There is less sweat I and feel confident in the odor protection.</li>
    <li> So let&#x27;s be clear about Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel!  I would have never gave a gel antiperspirant a second thought because my first thought is a product that is just goupy, thick and me standing at the vanity flapping my arms like a bird to get the gel to dry.  This product is completely opposite of my first thoughts.  It goes on thin, dries fast without leaving any white residue on my skin or clothes and keeps my dry and ODOR FREE through out my busy day.  I&#x27;m sold on this product. You will never go back to any other antiperspirant I promise/</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I was able to try this product for free.  I don&#x27;t feel like this deodorant was any better than every other one on the market.  It didn&#x27;t seem to control odor very long and I am not a huge fan of the smell.  Would not purchase.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does a good job for daily sweating.  I have run errands and started to build up a sweat, but my underarms stay pretty dry.  The scent lingers just enough to cover any odor without being super overpowering.  It also really doesn&#x27;t leave the huge white marks some other deodorants do.  It&#x27;s not complete invisible if it gets on clothes so I would still be careful, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as a white solid.    If you&#x27;re planning to use this at the gym or if you are sweating intensely, I&#x27;m not sure it will be quite strong enough.  But for the day to day sweating, it&#x27;s a great buy!  I received my first stick for free from BzzAgent, but I plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have to start off my saying that I am a very big Secret user, I have used secret antiperspirant for several years now but I have never used the Gel Antiperspirant.  However, when I was given the opportunity to try the product for free thanks to BzzAgent and Secret I thought why not give it a try and change it up a little!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am not to happy, I like the smell, I like the easy use of the turn clicker at the bottom, but those are the only two things that I like.  I found that when I put it on it felt slimy and I wet for a long time after.  I even tried holding my arms up for a couple of minutes to let it dry but I still felt like I was slimy and it was cause wet spots on my cloths.  I could never see wet spots but I did feel like they were there.  I then found that after maybe two hours, I didn&#x27;t smell as fresh as I did at the very beginning of putting on the antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping to like this product but I&#x27;m not sold on it yet, I&#x27;m not giving up as I said I love the Secret brand so I will give it a couple more tries and see if something changes (crossing my fingers).</li>
    <li> Giving it four stars just because the wetness of the water based formula is kind of weird. But I will say that after working out and working up a good sweat, I still smelled really fresh and clean because of this deodorant!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample from the company (yay promotional samples!) and actually love it.  The clear gel goes on smoothly with sticking and I don&#x27;t need a lot of it (one click) to cover.  It also doesn&#x27;t burn when applied after shaving those pesky underarms, which let&#x27;s face it, most of us gotta do.  The clean smell is not over-powering but lasts all day and even during a busy day in the ER, I stay fresh and dry, which is a huge plus because smelling yucky halfway through my shift is a no-go for me. The scent is clean and light yet has enough staying power to make it through my day (or night on the days that I shower before bed).  I have been using it for about two weeks and have not noticed any deodorant stains or smudges on my clothes either. I have used Secret deodorant before (both the clear gel and the invisible solid types), but have to say I prefer the clear gel.  This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to; keep you clean and dry and has a nice scent to boost.  All around, a win.</li>
    <li> Upfront, I received my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel free to try. I normally only use the Secret Clinical Strength deodorant because I am a heavy sweater and my sweat has a strong odor when I am stressed. I was wary to try this as I did not want to have to be reapplying through out the day to help keep odor and sweat to a minimum. I applied thinking it was going to be cold and wet feeling. It did feel wet but was not cold, thank goodness! It dried very quickly to my surprise. I thought I would have to flap my arms like a chicken to get it to dry, lol... I was quickly surprised to find that it was not sticky or tacky and it dried in seconds. During a busy stressful day I was worried the deodorant was going to fail at the worst moment. I did not have to reapply it once! I normally have to carry my deodorant with me and reapply during the day. When I got home I did some further research and found the Secret Outlast Gel is tested to last 48 hours and is water based. I haven&#x27;t tested the 48 hour protection but it is good to know that if my day lasts longer than normal I am covered. I am also saving on laundry pre-treaters  as I am not having to soak and scrub at the white marks my former deodorant left on my dark clothing. This review is my honest opinion, I am not being paid to give my review and I do recommend you try this if you have problems with odor and heavy sweating.</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret brand deodorant since I first began using deodorant as a pre-teen. It has been a trusted name in protection against oder &amp; maintaining drieness. I recently received a free sample of the the outlast completely clean clear gel as part of a promotion from the brand, and I must say, this particular deoderant has taken Secret to a whole new level for me! Not only do I have the assurance of no white stains on my clothes, but the fresh scents keep me smelling clean all day, and I also stay dry, which keeps me feeling confident! I love this deodorant &amp; I have no doubt you will too!</li>
    <li> I love the protection again. And the AutoShip is amazing.  I have use this for years and love that it doesn&#x27;t work out my clothing as well.</li>
    <li> I really like Secret brand- don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I started using Secret roll-on back in the day.  I was very excited to be a part of this BzzAgent campaign because of my love for Secret brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon removing the foil from the top, I immediately noticed the scent.  It was not the powdery fresh smell that I have grown to love.  I have a sensitivity to scents so I have to be careful what I sniff!  This was a little overpowering for me, but I figured I would at least try it out for one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a gel is not my favorite (I am a solid deodorant kind of gal) so this was awkward for me- I did not like the wet feeling under my arms.  I felt like I had to flap like a chicken in order to get them dry.  As the morning went on, the scent really started to bother me.  So much, that I went into the bathroom at work and washed it off and applied my secret powder fresh solid on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully other women will have better luck with this product than I had.  I&#x27;ll stick to my secret powder fresh solid.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant EVER!!!  I have tried just about every deodorant from solid to gel.  Nothing was working for me anymore so I started using my husbands deodorant. I almost felt as though my body had become \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to all my usual brands.  I received a promotional sample of this.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work as I wasn&#x27;t having luck with any other types in the Secret line and I typically prefer unscented as I don&#x27;t like to smell a strong deodorant scent when I start to sweat (which I do a lot because I workout).  I was so pleasantly surprised.  The scent (completely clean) is not overwhelming and after a few minutes I can no longer smell it.  I was shocked this worked the entire day.  It was working so well that after a few days I decided to try out the \\&quot;48 hour\\&quot; claim.  To my shock after the 2nd day there was still no odor!!!!  Oh and there are no marks on my clothing AT ALL!  I don&#x27;t even have to wait for it to completely dry before I get dressed.  I am thrilled to have found this and highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> definitely a great product. love the clear dry formula.</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample from buzz agent and am reviewing this product having #gotitfree, The scent is very clean and it is easy to use with a knob on the bottom to apply just the right amount. This product does as it state and keeps you from stinking all day, however I do not think that it applies itself very dry. When applying this product it is wet and one has to keep arms up for a few moments to allow it to dry, however as long as one does this it does not stain clothes even fine silks. I would use this product again for its nice smell and long lasting protection.</li>
    <li> I got to try this as a bzzagent and I&#x27;m impressed!  It dried quickly and it&#x27;s keeping me dry and fresh.  I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy a clear gel but this clearly dries fast.  I definitely would buy this again! I also love that there are no white marks left on my clothes.</li>
    <li> This clear gel deodorant has been a life saver.  I went out this weekend (which happend to be both black &amp; sleeveless). I danced, sweated, and was in it for at least 5 hours. Well by the end of the night when I took off my dress it still smelled fresh and had NO WHITE STREAK MARKS! “What would I want to know before I get this product?” That it truly lasts 24 hours! Got this free from bzzagent.com to try and I am truly happy i did.</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida and I am an avid runner, so I&#x27;m in need of great protection year-round. I usually use invisible solids (which actually aren&#x27;t as invisible as they claim to be), but received this antiperspirant as a part of a Bzzagent campaign. It does feel very wet went first applied, but I found that a little goes a long way and it does dry fast. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming and the protection it offers is incredible!!! I will stick to using this and would definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product to test. I usually use the invisible solid deordant, so I was unsure if I would like the cold gel. After getting over the cold jolt in the morning, I was pleasantly suprised by this product. I have nothing but good things to say about it! I typically feel like I need to re-apply my deordant half thru the day but  not with the secret outlast. I feel fresh all day and even get a whif of its pleasant smell throughout the day. Added bonus of having no deordant marks to worry about on my clothes. Can&#x27;t wait to try this in the summer with warmer weather and tank tops. This product is a winner in my books!</li>
    <li> When wearing dark clothes I had seriously given up wearing any antiperspirant at all! I am amazed that the Secret Outlast really does work, it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on dark clothes at all! Finally, an antiperspirant that does what it says it does! Thank you Secret!&lt;br /&gt;-Stephanie Richey (clearly, my husband- who&#x27;s amazon account this is, does not wear Secret!)</li>
    <li> In the past, I&#x27;d tried other gel antiperspirant/deodorants.  EWWWWW.  I walked around all day with my sleeves stuck up into my underarm, trying to inconspicuously pry them out of my traumatized armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understandably, then, I was a bit skeptical when BzzAgent offered this as a product campaign especially well suited for me...I wasn&#x27;t particularly excited to have my sleeves stuck up into my pits again...and HEY!  I&#x27;m not that stinky (as far as they know!)  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take a chance though, since it&#x27;s a product by Secret - a brand that I&#x27;ve known and trusted for a long time.  I couldn&#x27;t be HAPPIER!  Not only does the gel dry super fast, it also does it&#x27;s job of keeping me dry and odor free.  And I purposely tested the 48 hour claim.  I can happily report - on behalf of my family, friends and coworkers - that Outlast lives up to it&#x27;s hype.  Put it on Monday morning, and it was still working hard Tuesday afternoon with no reapplication.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice bonus from my previous stick is that there aren&#x27;t any white streaks on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel...it&#x27;s one of the few products I&#x27;ve found lately that actually lives up to it&#x27;s promises.  FIVE STARS SECRET!</li>
    <li> I recently had the opportunity to try this as part of a BzzAgent Campaign.  I love the Secret brand and have used their invisible solid for years.  The Outlast Gel is another great product.  It&#x27;s strong enough that when I take a shower at night and apply it before bed, I don&#x27;t have to re-apply in the morning before work. It&#x27;s kept me clean and dry through long days full of stressful meetings and dealings with a difficult boss....  And  of course it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about streaks or white spots on my clothing.  I do find the scent to be a bit strong, but I am partial to the cocoa butter kiss and hawaii citrus breeze scents that come in the regular Secret invisible solid.</li>
    <li> From the beginning, I was extremely skeptical that I would like Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I have tried other clear gel antiperspirant/deodorant formulations from other brands and have never been impressed. Imagine my surprise when Secret Outlast actually worked for me. The gel dries very fast, has a pleasant scent, AND helps to minimize sweat and odors. And, while I&#x27;m still not a fan of the gel type antiperspirant/deodorant, I really do like Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. #ClearlyBetter #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I #gotitfree Secret Outlast from BzzAgent to try. Typically, I use a clinical strength antiperspirant due to very active sweat glands! I have been pleasantly surprised with Secret Outlast. It works great, just as good as clinical strength. It goes on clear with no white marks. It has an alcohol like smell at first, but dries to a pleasant scent that is not too strong. It dries very quickly, just put it on about a minute before dressing and it is all dry.The protection is great - it&#x27;s nice to not worry about armpit wetness throughout the day. I definitely recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel!</li>
    <li> I feel like I can finally go to the mall and try on dresses without worrying about getting white marks on the stores clothes and my own.  I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel as part of a promotion from Secret.  I will be purchasing it from now on.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It makes me feel confidant in my every day life. I am a teacher so I am on the move.....a lot!</li>
    <li> This deodorant was alright. It did work when it came to odor protection but I did not like the feeling it left on my armpits when I applied it. My armpits felt wet and slimy all day.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance with awesome protection!  #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with this product.  It keeps me fresh and dry, even after sweaty workouts! My husband if tried and he loved it too!!&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus it goes in completely clear and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes!!&lt;br /&gt;(I #gotitfree as a bzzagent!!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid cyclist and on especially hot days, I can get pretty sweaty during a ride:)  I&#x27;ve been using Secret brand deodorant for many years, but have always shied away from the gel versions, because they tend to go on wet and gooey.  I received Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant as a trial product from BzzAgent to use in place of my normal brand, which happened to be a Secret solid formula.  I am pleasantly surprised, as upon application it dries very quickly, leaving no wet feeling under your arms.  Also, the odor and wetness protection are quite remarkable.  Recently after a workout, I didn&#x27;t have time for a shower right away, so I just toweled off and swiped on the Secret Outlast.  I was able control the post workout sweat immediately and didn&#x27;t show any under arm wetness stains on my shirt after leaving the locker room.  I was able to go about my day feeling relatively fresh too, as the breezy clean scent of Outlast lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ll be switching to this gel formula in the future...Thanks Secret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; it on (it has a dial control, so you can decide how much you really want to use) and go.  It&#x27;s a clear gel formula, so it dries quickly and has a great scent.  It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothing either and since I wear a lot of black that&#x27;s a great perk.  It really works great, so if you want to try it, let me know and I&#x27;ll pass on a coupon I got with my trail deodorant.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent; previously I was using an expensive ($18!) deodorant that didn&#x27;t hold up well. Since using this I&#x27;m not self conscious about odor or wetness; it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive under arm area either. I exercise a fair amount and it works very well- I stay dry and there is no offensive odor. You can wear black clothing without worry about white marks whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product when I run out; it is rare to find a deodorant which isn&#x27;t caustic on sensitive skin yet works like a clinical brand. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from BzzAgent campaign Secret Outlast.  I really like this deodorant.  It goes on clean and clear with no white marks.  It dries quickly and lasts all day long.  I would definitely recommend using this deodorant!</li>
    <li> When I received this I was a little skeptical at all of the horns it was tooting  48 hour protection? Who is actually going to go 48 hours without taking some kind of shower or bath? So I don&#x27;t actually know if that is the case. I know that when I used it I did not smell so that was a good thing but at the same time it also toots that it goes on clear and stays clear. While that may be the case I don&#x27;t have time to wait for my deodorant to dry. I choose to use another brand usually or a solid because of this issue. I hate the feeling of sticky pits and that feeling I think does not leave you the rest of the day. So while you smell good and have no white marks you have sticky underarms. Not a good feeling. So I am giving it a 3 stars because while it does the job that it is is supposed to do it just is not the deodorant for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the product for free from Bzzagent. The review and thoughts are all my own.</li>
    <li> I have never come across a clear gel deodorant that I liked until now. I have been a solid deodorant user for years. I never liked that sticky, cold feeling of a clear gel. When I tried the Secret Outlast Completely Clean clear gel deodorant, my opinion had been changed. This deodorant does not leave white marks, does not leave you feeling sticky, and this deodorant really works for more than 24 hours! I&#x27;ve been converted! Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me the chance to try this product!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from the company and I was very surprised. I have always used a clear solid which seems like an oxymoron because it always ended up on my clothes. Solid deoderant has ruined so many of my shirts. I was hesitant about using a clear deoderant because of the wetness you have when you first apply it. I thought for sure it would also ruin clothes. However, it dries very quickly and once applied the scent of the deoderant is not at all overpowering like it can be with solids. I am actually quite surprised that receiving this to try has converted me. The protection is phenomenal, I am in the south and don&#x27;t do well in the hot weather but I stay dry and oder free with this deoderant.</li>
    <li> I have always been weary of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; deodorant because I am not a fan of wetness in my armpit, I mean isn&#x27;t that why we buy &amp;#34;anti&amp;#34;perspirants? I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean because I am a BzzAgent member.  I get to try free products and review them accordingly.  I am NOT compensated for my reviews, good or bad, so know that when I say I loved this product, I really did!  It actually dried much faster than I remember gels drying and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I had my husband do the &amp;#34;sniff test&amp;#34; and so far so good!  I haven&#x27;t tried it for the full 48 hours that it says it lasts, but I will say that it rocks 24hours solid..errrmm... gel.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying this in the future.  No white marks and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Edited for xtend version. I received secret outlast and secret outlast  xtend clear gel deodorant to try courtesy of Secret, but the review is my own. I was skeptical at first because gels I have used in the past left my armpits feeling wet and sticky. My usual deodorant was the solid powder, but of course there&#x27;s the issue with white residue on my clothes! So I decided to give this a try, and i was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve been using secret gel for a year now, and the xtend version for almost a month now, and each time I apply the wetness only lasts a couple of minutes. By the time I head out the door in the morning I am completely dry! I also love the scent, it&#x27;s a very subtle, refreshing smell. I can also attest to the deodorant really lasting close to 48 hours. One Sunday I stayed in my pajamas all day at home and never reapplied since last using it Saturday morning. I didn&#x27;t feel sweaty at all during the second day. While I don&#x27;t plan on skipping deodorant on most days, it&#x27;s nice to know this one really keeps me feeling fresh and clean! I definitely plan on this being my deodorant of choice going forward!</li>
    <li> I got this product from a Bzz campaign. I have always just gotten the original kind. I was beyond impressed with this when I got it... I can&#x27;t believe I always just passed the clear gel! I LOVE getting free stuff, But When I love the free stuff that&#x27;s a score.</li>
    <li> I love this brand because it goes on clear and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I also like it because it keeps the odar away</li>
    <li> I was recently using an invisible solid that wasn&#x27;t  invisible at all. All my blouses were white on the armpit area and running down my sides as well. I was scared to try something diferent until a got a free Secret Outlast clear gel. Thankfully I can eliminate one more problem from my life.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant. It has a pleasant scent that is not too strong, but it keeps me smelling fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;And from the container your are able to dispense just the amount you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;I received this from bzzagent.com. and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from BzzAgent and so far have been very pleased. I used it before going out dancing and it stayed strong and didn&#x27;t let me down. No Oder and wetness on my shirt. The gel has a nice light sent , nothing overpowering and I did not break out in any rash. I recommended this if you perspire a lot.</li>
    <li> I stopped using gel-type deodorants years ago because I hated the wet, sticky feeling they left.  Putting powder on afterwards was a mess, resulting in clumps.  I received this through a Bzz campaign, and was immediately impressed.  It does go on wet, but dries very quickly, and then you can get dressed.  The protection is amazing:  dry and feeling/smelling fresh all day.</li>
    <li> As I was raised their were certain things Women didn&#x27;t do and sweat was 1 of them! That is why I use Secret, smells amazing,  keeps you dry, and it&#x27;s our little Secret!  ;)</li>
    <li> I can go on a run and not feel any wetness after I complete it.  NICE!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to be able to try out secret outlast clear gel as a member of Bzz agent! After opening the package, was happy with the odor. Not too strong, but still with that benign clean smell. It was easy to apply although, for the first time use, it did take a while for the deodorant to reach the applicator to use. Unlike competitors, did not leave any white marks during the use and kept me drier then most products. It also did not leave any residual thick gel which to me is annoying. I did not need to &amp;#34;let it dry&amp;#34; before getting dressed to ensure it didn&#x27;t wet my clothes before the day even got started. The best part was the clear packaging so you know when you are getting close to completion and need to head to the store for a refill!</li>
    <li> I normally stay away from gel deodorants just because they tend to feel wet for longer than I would care for, this was not the case with Secret Outlast. It went on smooth and dried quickly. It does go on clear, another plus for the brand and the product. I hate residue and marks from other brands.The scent was great.It was strong and noticeable, but not over whelming. This does claim to be long lasting, which I do believe it was/is. I have since bought more of this product and would definitely recommend Secret Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recieve a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from One 2 One Network, however any and all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of gel deodorants but decided to try this because I was given this as a promotional trial. I tried it and it seemed to not dry quickly at all. Finally it dried and it did protect for a short amount of time but no where the amount of time it promises. Kinda disappointed ad it was a new product and something I expected to be better</li>
    <li> This product is great for everyday use and especially great for road trips or camping when a shower may not be available every morning.  I found that Secret Outlast never lets me down.  This product is clean and not greasy or messy like some other gel antiperspirants.  I&#x27;ve purchased the invisible solid version of this product in the past and received the Gel as a product promotion and will continue to purchase Secret Outlast.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast through BzzAgent in return for my opinion and I&#x27;ve been using the deodorant for over a week now.  I must say I am pleasantly surprised with how well it works.  I have tried gel deodorants in the past and the one thing I did not like about them was I always felt like my armpits were wet, they never seemed to dry.  So, I was a little hesitant to try the new Secret Outlast gel because I thought I would experience that same wetness feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the deodorant it had a very pleasing scent.  At first, it didn&#x27;t seem like the product was advancing in the&lt;br /&gt;tube, but I just had to turn the dial a bunch of times before the product came out the top of the dispenser.  After applying it for the first time it did feel wet, but it dried very quickly and left me feeling dry all day.  No wetness or sticky residue.  It leaves you feeling fresh and odor free.  I can definitely give it two arms up with confidence.</li>
    <li> I never liked gels, and never found a deodorant that I felt was \\&quot;mine.\\&quot; I bought whatever was on sale and a slopped it on.  I love it.  Dries fast, keeps me dry and I never have to stop and think, \\&quot;Did I put deodorant on?\\&quot;  because it&#x27;s not working. It works.  And, NO white stuff crumbled up in my arm pits. PLUS, I got it for free to try from Secret. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Secret outlast Xtend really does outlast your day! It&#x27;s 48 hour protection that&#x27;s unmatched. I&#x27;m a runner and busy mom of three and I swear by this stuff. It&#x27;s super fast drying and lasts the entire day! I&#x27;ve tried them all Dove, Ban, Degree -- this is the best. I was lucky to receive this product as a promotion by the brand but ever since I&#x27;ve been hooked!</li>
    <li> I have used the same brand of antiperspirant/deodorant for most of my life. I just lived with that embarrassing white streak on my clothes, and have tried to wipe it off with a damp cloth. BzzAgent in a promotion with Secret gave me an opportunity to try SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL. I have very sensitive skin and have had rash reactions in the past when I&#x27;ve tried to switch, but I gave it a shot. And this product is AMAZING! I have had no reactions, and I have worn it for the last several days. The gel applies easily and it has a fresh baby powder scent. The scent disappears fairly quickly and even as I sweat, it doesn&#x27;t over-power or compete with my favorite signature scent The gel is transparent and dries in under a minute (a little goes a long way, so apply thinly and it will dry quickly) with no streak, no filmy residue and more importantly, no stickiness. It keeps me dry and odor free, even on my most active yoga days, for at least 24 hours without having to re-apply. I shower everyday - so I cant comment on the 48 hour claim. This really is the perfect antiperspirant/deodorant and I am most definitely switching to SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL.</li>
    <li> As a bzzagent I have the opportunity to try out Secret Outlast Gel Antiperspirant. I have been using the Secret Outlast Gel for almost two weeks now. Previously I used a solid so this was a first time for me using a gel. Once I had been using the gel for a few days I was easily able to regulate the proper amount of clicks to get the right amount of gel out. I have tried it right after showing and also in the mornings when I get up. It does take a little while for it to dry so I can&#x27;t immediately get dressed. It also states that the Outlast will give you 48 hours of protection. I find that I am not even getting one day of dryness or odor free protection. I am finding that I need to reapply it later in the day if I have plans that night. I do really like the scent. It is clean and fresh. Also, it is not 100% white mark free. It is considerable less then a solid but not completely white mark free. If this Secret Clear were on sale and I had coupons I would purchase it but it would not be my top choice.</li>
    <li> I recently tried Secret Outlast and was not impressed.  Although i always use the Secret and normally love their products, this product did not live up to the hype.  It didn&#x27;t last all day like it said and it was too wet.</li>
    <li> I just revieved this and was skeptical being I always use a solid - wow sectet outlast surprised me - dried quickly and works great !!!</li>
    <li> I love this clear gel deodorant, it dries within seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave any nasty white marks.  I tested it on all sorts of dark clothing but not a single mark was to be seen. I have tried numerous deodorants in the past but none of them game me the protection I needed or they left ugly white marks. I am a HUGE fan and will definitely continue to use this deodorant. I received a sample of this product as part of a promotion, however my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I never really had a preference in deoderants until recently. I received this deodorant in a bzzagent kit to try free so that&#x27;s just what I did. At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. Then, after a crazy night at work (BTW, I&#x27;m a nurse), I was sweating everywhere except for two places - my arms pits were still dry and to my suprise, they still smelled great. This was such a wonderful surprise. Secret outlast gel deodorant passed my test, hands down. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this free from bzzzagent. I was hesitant because gels usually feel so sticky. But it dried fast and kept me dry. The scent is really strong though</li>
    <li> Normally I wear a solid deodorant that doesn&#x27;t last very long and I sweat no matter what!  I have never really liked gel as it usually doesn&#x27;t dry.  This deodorant has proved that all of my problems may not need to be problems any longer.  It dries very quickly.  It is not sticky.  There is no odor.  Oh, and did I forget to mention that I am a personal trainer, and moving/working out all day long?  That&#x27;s right.  This deodorant works for the active and not just the desk job workers!!  Try it out; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> No more white marks on my fave shirts!  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel really does go on clear and dries clear.  #ClearlyBetter #IGotItFree  I really like it and the scent is nice, light and clean.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical about trying a new deoderant.  I love Secret but have always used the invisible solid.  I have a very busy, active job and lately, I had noticed my deoderant was not holding up its end of the bargain by the end of the day and I needed to reapply.  I figured this was an awesome time to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use, I was impressed with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deoderant.  It went on clear and I didn&#x27;t worry about streaks on my black shirt.  Putting it on, it did feel a little different than the solid that I normally use...it was more wet (for lack of a better term), but it dried very quickly and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I wore this deoderant, I had a 14 hour day at work that was extremely busy.  I was constantly on the move.  It wasn&#x27;t until I got in my car to head home that I remembered the new deoderant that I had put on that day.  Of course I did what any normal person would do...I sniffed my armpit.  I was amazed that the deoderant had held up all day.  The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel doesn&#x27;t have a strong sent, but it smells clean...I could still smell that clean scent at the end of the day.  It definitely holds up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second test was the day that I forgot to put deoderant on in the morning.  It wasn&#x27;t until I got to work that I remembered.  I was about to reach for the stick that I keep in my desk, but I thought that I would see if the deoderant really held up (I had taken a shower the night before and applied deoderant afterwards) for multiple days.  While I don&#x27;t plan to forget deoderant regularly, it was nice to know that this would hold up for a really long time and keep me smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as part of the BzzAgent campaign, but the review is my own!  I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it after my complementary tube is gone!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent for free from BzzAgent.I &#x27;m not a stranger to the gel deodorants, but this is different. The gel has a lovely texture, smells terrific and blends right in as soon as you roll, without leaving a trace- no white marks on or around your armpits.I use in the morning right after shower and at night with same routine.It has a pleasant smell and keeps my underarms dry all day.The Secret Outlast is light and feminine.</li>
    <li> I received a full-size sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent as part of a promotion from Secret. I am brand loyal to Secret, anyway, because it is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it is also the best deodorant as far as staying fresh and dry all day no matter what I&#x27;m doing. The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is actually a step above other Secret deodorants. There is NO trace of deodorant when you put it on. It dries almost immediately, it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes, and I can raise my arms confidently knowing that there aren&#x27;t white deodorant balls gathered in my armpit. Not to mention, it smells fantastic and the smell stays for hours upon hours. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this deodorant as a part of a promotion from the brand and really liked it. I live in the South so it&#x27;s hot or warm most of the year. I am glad to find a deodorant that can hold up all day without having to worry about reapplying. I also like how I don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothes. Overall a great product, and now that I see that I can get it regularly shipped to me through Amazon for a great price I&#x27;ll be definitely be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> I am typically not a gel kind of girl bit I was eager to try the Secret Outlast clear gel. I got this product for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign. It was just as advertized...completely clean and clear. I typically wear black shirts to work and there was no mess or white streaks on my clothes. The scent was great too!    The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 was that I felt that it took a little long to dry after applying, but that may be just because I am not used to using a gel. That was not enough to take away from the product so I would still highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge fan of gel deodorant, but I really like this one. I have always been a fan of secret products, but your right I hate the white marks. I love the fact that this product does not leave the marks on my clothes. It also smells great. If I hade to say the only thing I don&#x27;t like is putting cold wet gel on in the mornings, but that is just personal preference. I definitely think I will continue to use this product even after the Buzzzzzzz campaign is finished.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS! Secret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel .I am a BzzAgent I and received samples and coupons free to test it. I tested the Completely Clean scent.It smells great. As great as it smells that&#x27;s how well it protects.Up to 48 hours of odor and wetness protection.I stayed dry all day till my next application The gel goes on smoothly and dries quickly and leaves behind no nasty  white marks on clothes. You should give it a try I think you will like it too!</li>
    <li> So I am not much for gel deordorant as they always seem to take forever to dry and also are quite irritating especially after shaving, that horrible burn feeling.  But I got to say Secret Outlast Completely Clean gel is amazing.  It has a nice clean scent and absorbs very well.  There are no white marks to worry about or any marks for that matter as it is clear.  The odor and sweat protection are amazing especially is you like to workout like me.  And even better is after shaving under my arms I can apply this right after and there is no burn or irritation!  I will be buying this from now on.  I got to try this product free through a promotion from Secret through Bzz Agent.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear gel does what it says-dries quick, no wetness and NO unslightly white marks. I&#x27;m a Bzz agent and received a sample product. Great product.</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from bzzagent.com.  I usually use a solid.  I like this and would recommend it to others.  It leaves no marks if it gets on your clothes and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was hesitant to try this because I have never been a fan of gel deodorants. I exclusively use Secret but have always used the invisible solid deodorant. I received this as a sample from Secret and BzzAgent. I used it and was pleasantly surprised and highly impressed at how well it works. Although rare there had been instances of getting a deodorant mark on my clothing after using the invisible solid. There is ZERO chance of that happening when using this. It does wake you up in the morning when first applying because it is cold and wet going on however that only lasts a fraction of a second and dries immediately.The completely clean scent is refreshing and not overwhelming what so ever. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it not lasting either. I put in on in the morning after showering and it keeps me fresh all day.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is excellent, has a rich aroma and leaves your skin soft and fragrant.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I received a free sample from BzzAgent to review and I was a little hesitant at first. I normally use an invisible solid and have stayed away from gels because they seem too wet! BUT...it dries pretty fast. It definitely protects all day from odor and wetness, and we&#x27;ve had some pretty hot days since I started using it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little wet and sticky when it first goes on, but once it dries (within minutes) that goes away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this deodorant so far. I received it free from the brand through Bzzagent. The deodorant dries quickly so there is no wait to put your shirt on. The wetness protection has been incredible. I always manage to get wetness throughout the day and this hasn&#x27;t happened since I started using this product. The smell is amazing, not overpowering, but just the right amount of clean. I hate powder scents so this is perfect in my book. The twist to release is perfect. One twist gives just the right amount for a pit (unless of course you&#x27;re my husband who layers his on like frosting). I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of another brand for years and I do believe I&#x27;ll be making the switch!</li>
    <li> I love the invisibility of this gel and the scents are really nice too.  I can not get over the feeling of the gel, since I have always been a solid girl.  I just feel &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; all day.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I love the secret outlast...its long lasting, keeps you fresh and feeling clean. I have went out and came back home over night and still no sweat or sweat beads under my arms! Thank you secret outlast! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail from Bzzagent to try the product out. I put some on before I was heading off to a Pitt Bull concert. I was dry the whole night, while dancing the night away at the concert. I was very impressed and no stains on my clothes. I was dry the whole night and not wet.  I will be using this again.</li>
    <li> Received this product through BzzAgent.  It went on clear, and evaporated quickly.  Loved that it&#x27;s water-based, and provides 48 hour protection from odor.  The best part, was that it did not leave any ugly, white, powdery marks on my clothing.  Very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I gave this deodorant a two week try out since I got it for free from BzzAgent.  I&#x27;m not used to gel deodorant since I&#x27;m usually a Clinical strength deodorant type of woman.  So this was entirely new to me. The feeling of gel against my skin wasn&#x27;t bad, just different.  I did feel like it didn&#x27;t completely dry after application. I liked the completely clean sent of it. No flowery smell was great. So I didn&#x27;t feel like every time I raised my arm everyone around me smelled a field of flowers growing in my armpit. Which is fabulous in my book! I wore a black sleeveless top one day and it didn&#x27;t leave ANY white marks on it! I loved that!  Overall, it&#x27;s a great product...as long as you don&#x27;t mind the gel feeling against your skin. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing because it&#x27;s really a great deodorant to switch off with when I use sleeveless tops.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant from BzzAgent and love it!  I usually stick with a solid stick deodorant because I&#x27;ve always felt they stayed on longer and worked better.  My experience with this product has changed my mind.  It went on nicely, smoothly, without white marks and left me feeling fresh all day.  I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product for free through BzzAgent.  I did not care for it at all.  My normal product is a Secret brand also, but with this one, while it worked OK during the day, I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.  Definitely not &amp;#34;48 hour protection.&amp;#34;  I will be switching back.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel has replaced my old antiperspirant!  I no longer need to reapply my antiperspirant in the middle of the day.  I love that there is no white residue on my clothes as well.  I received my Completely Clear Gel as part of a promotion from the brand and I am so glad I did!</li>
    <li> Love the new Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel! Been battling staining on my husband&#x27;s shirts for several years. I had been using an invisible stick, but after awhile I began getting ugly underarm stains on my light colored bras. When I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, I was hesitant about using a gel. I&#x27;ve tried them am feel cold and damp all day long. I applied the new Outlast Clear Gel, and I won&#x27;t lie, it felt damp, but by the time I brushed my teeth, it was dry! I was pleasantly surprised it kept me dry all day, and I even woke up feeling fresh in the morning. I think people who say it is wet all day, may need to apply it in a thinner layer. I use the applicator and rub it in well.  You don&#x27;t need a thick covering to stay dry all day. I am now switching to use this everyday, and I&#x27;m grabbing the men&#x27;s version for my husband to try. I think he will love it.</li>
    <li> Secret is a brand i trust. The outlast works pretty great for being a clear gel. I had tried other clear gels in the past and they have been less successful but this one works. The only issue I felt (which is 100% opinion) is that the scent could be better. It smells pretty mild and then when you out it on you can&#x27;t smell anything which is good, but if you have a super active day you are dry and not smelly but off I would say. Personally I always like the powdery scents. I love not worrying about white marks on my clothes since everything I wear is pretty much black. I also notices I am not breaking out. I live in Fla and it is HOT so you sweat and with other brands I tended to break out. Not with this one. Overall I give it an A. I am glad that Secret sent it to me to try for free because I buy it on the regular now!</li>
    <li> BzzAgent sent me this for free... thought to myself &amp;#34;deodorant. ..big deal&amp;#34; but now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks... I am hooked! No white, no stinky, a deodorant that actually does what it says it does! I work 12-16 hour shifts and leave feeling fresh I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast from BzzAgent in order to try it out.  I have tried many antiperspirant/deodorants in the past and usually need to use a Clinical Strength in order to feel secure on a hot or stressful day.  I am very impressed with Secret Outlast.  It works as well, if not better, than the clinical strength deodorants I have tried in the past.  It goes on clear with no white staining of your clothes.  It has a pleasant sporty scent that is not too strong.  It dries very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on clothing.  The protection is wonderful - it keeps me dry and smelling good all day long and then some!  I highly recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel!</li>
    <li> We live in Texas and I need a reliable, all day lasting deodorant to get through the extreme heats we have in the summertime. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is the one to get! It is super easy to apply, dries within seconds, smells fresh (and keeps that good smell the whole day), reduces the sweat and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes. What more can you ask for in a deodorant! I would definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Bzzagent and I got this product free.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant.  It kept me absolutely dry and there were no white marks.  I have a stressful job, and this deodorant worked until duress!  The bad news is that after 3 - 4 days of using it, I broke out in an itchy, red rash and had to stop using it.  I did apply it in the morning after showering and shaving and that probably did me in.  I was able to pass it on to my teenage daughter, and she LOVES it.  She has gym in school and she said it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent and I did receive this product to try for free.  This product does work even though I personally can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I was recently able to try the new Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel for free from Bzzagent and I absolutely love it! I am usually not a fan of the gels because they seem to make you feel sticky, but this brand is totally different. It goes on smooth and when it dries it does not leave a strange feeling of leftover gel under your arm. I also feel that it works very well for odor protection. I have used it at the beach on vacation, at cheerleading practice while coaching, and on a daily basis for regular use as well. The best part, however, is it leaves no white marks or streaks on your clothes! I wear a lot of black tops and hate that most deodorants leave those pesky white streaks, but this one absolutely does not. Try it out today!</li>
    <li> I received a full sized sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel and decided to try out the claim that it lasts 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Last weekend I showered Saturday mornning and applied Secret Outlast. The gel was smooth going on but it did feel a little sticky until it dried.&lt;br /&gt;We just moved so I spent the day unpacking. On Sunday, I wanted to put Secret to thetoughest test I could think of. The car buying experience. No shower.&lt;br /&gt;It was a warm day and my husband and I spent hours out looking and test driving until we found the right car. Then came the always fun negotiations.&lt;br /&gt;Two hours later we were done and I was sweat and odor free.&lt;br /&gt;If Secret Outlast can handle the hell that is car buying, then it can handle anything. I&#x27;ve found a new antiperspirant!&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I had laser hair removal under my arms a few years ago. Since then I have been dealing with underarm perspiration.  I have been thru several different brands that state they are clinical or that they last 24 hours.  Until now, I have had to apply in the morning, once in the afternoon and again before bedtime. Secret Outlast really lasts 24 hours.  I apply in the morning and I am good till tomorrow morning.  I don&#x27;t have to constantly check that I may have pit stains. My only complaint is I have to do the funky chicken to get my armpits to dry when I apply it.  But, very little goes a long way.  I only use one click, not 2-3 as recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of Clear Gel deodorants due to the fact I always felt like they were to sticky and took FOREVER to dry. I always hated the feeling like I was leaving a wet spot under my armpit in my clothes. I always steered clear of these when shopping for deodorant. So when I got the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a Bzzagent member and got it for free I thought great this will be a lost cause but I was very pleasantly surprised. The first thing it dried super quick and that was a biggie to me. No more walking around with my arms in the air hoping it would dry faster. It went on very smooth and came out of the container without any issues. It was still a little sticky but I think that is because its a gel and sometimes if its not completely dry it feels sticky. But it was much better than any other previous ones. So I give this a 4 out of 5 stars. If it had a half star it would be a 4.5 out of 5 for me.</li>
    <li> You stay clean and dry!! Smells great!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting deodorant this is it but I don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot. I gave it 3 stars because while it works great it has a chemically smell &amp; if you put it on right after you shower &amp; just shaved your underarms it burns a little.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a BzzAgent &amp; received this product free as a part of a promotion for the brand.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to try for free from BuzzAgent. I&#x27;ve tried other Secret products in the past and was excited to try this one as well. First off I loved the gel! Easy to apply and dries reasonably fast. I had no problems with white marks on my clothes which is a HUGE bonus to me! The clean scent is nice and not over powering, although I&#x27;d probably try a different scent next time. As for odor protection it was reasonable, for my regular activities it worked just fine - keeping me fresh and dry. However it didn&#x27;t seem to stand up to my more vigorous activities such as my workouts, I found I had to reapply, but for me that was no big deal. I will definitely buy this product, it stands up to the quality that the Secret Brand is known for.</li>
    <li> As a new BZZAgent I received a free full size Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel to trial.  I just completed my 3rd week of using the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. Having bought just about every brand of deodorant/anti-perspirant available on the shelves, I can honestly say this is my new favorite! I&#x27;ve almost always used the solid powders but always had to remember to wipe under my arms before putting a shirt on or I would have the white marks everywhere. I&#x27;ve tried other clear solids in the past but always went back to the powders. Not sure what the change is in the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel but it works great. My daughter has always had issues with excessive perspiration. I gave her a coupon for this new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel and she tells me it is working great. She is now wearing &amp;#34;any shirts&amp;#34;; because she isn&#x27;t showing any sweat marks anymore. The price point for the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is also less than other anti-perspirants&#x27; she has been using (and without as much success). The only thing I would change is to look for the scented version, if available.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Gel did provide great odor &amp; wetness protection.  I stayed dry all day long. I love the fresh, clean scent.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the gel was cold and it didn&#x27;t dry very fast after going on. That was my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free to try as a promotion from the brand (Secret), but all opinions are my own.     Sweating, odor, and embarrassment just aren&#x27;t my style. I mean, really -- who enjoys THAT? After my old deodorant brand failed me, I was super pumped to receive my Bzz Kit for Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. And the hype did not disappoint - every aspect of this quality product has proved to be true! 48 hours of superior odor protection keep this new mom stink-free through days of chasing my little one and nights up putting him back to sleep.    The product applies smoothly and the fragrance is clean and appealing without being overpowering. I love the comfort and confidence I feel now that my underarm wetness is gone, too. I live in the South and our hot summers are no joke, but thanks to this amazing gel, no one will ever see me sweat! Now that winter&#x27;s here, I won&#x27;t be smelly in my layered tops and sweaters, either! Plus, I love that I can count on Secret Outlast drying quickly, leaving no tell tale white marks on my clothing even on frazzled days when I have little time to dedicate to my appearance. In the past, I&#x27;ve had to apply deodorant and do the dreaded \\&quot;armpit chicken flap\\&quot; in an effort to dry it faster so I can get dressed - not with this product!    Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is a complete win in both my opinion and experience, and it&#x27;s something I have and will continue to recommend to my friends and family as the ONLY solution for odor and wetness protection!</li>
    <li> I received this to try for a promotional campaign from the brand and was so skeptical because I am strictly a solid kind of person. I do not like feeling wet and sticky which I knew that would happen once I tried it. Well, it did only because I was using too much. Believe it or not but there is a learning curve from going to solid to gel. You only need one or two clicks, don&#x27;t coat yourself with the stuff like I did at first. It goes on great and it dries quick. (By the time I brush my hair and put on my shirt, it is dry.) Even when I first started using a reasonable amount, it still felt cold and wet but after a week, I never noticed that feeling again. It may take some getting use to but I love it. When I undress for bed, it feels like I just put it on a few minutes ago unlike my solid which use to feel like it rubbed off  or worn off and I need to re-apply it. The scent is clean and don&#x27;t interfere with any of your perfumes. In fact, only time I really smell it is when I first put it on and when I undress so to be honest with you, the smell may be so light that no one can smell it even if you don&#x27;t wear any perfume but if they did, it is only a clean smell anyways. So I really hated this at first until I gave it a real honest try and believe me, no more solids for me.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be a BzzAgent and received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. If you are looking for a new deodorant that keeps you dry, give this one a try! We all sweat, me most than others lol, and this works great! It doesn&#x27;t smudge on my clothes like other deodorants. However, I did get it on my bra and it showed up. It might be the fabric of it. It was a more satin like fabric. But my shirts, never a trace.</li>
    <li> I really did not care for this product.  I liked the scent and that it did not leave any white residue on clothing, but it never felt dry! It went on wet and felt like it stayed that way all day. I received this as a free promotional offer and did try it for 2 weeks to make sure. Probably would not recommend it for every day use.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent to try. I really liked that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes. I have found that even though some of the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; solids will still leave white marks on your clothes even though they claim they won&#x27;t; however, Secret Completely Clean Gel doesn&#x27;t. It also keeps me dry all day, which of course is a must. The only negative for me about this antiperspirant is that it takes longer to dry than a solid. However, overall it is a great deodorant.</li>
    <li> I forgot to put deodorant on before I left for work this morning; how embarrassing!!!! Except that it&#x27;s NOT! So, I made it about a day and a half on one application and am just starting to feel a little perspiration in my pits, but no stink.  The nice scent from the deodorant is completely gone, but I don&#x27;t have body odor, either, so that is a complete pass. This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent to review, but I will definitely purchase it in the future and have been recommending it to friends and family members. It is super quick to dry, leaves very little residue and lasts a LONG time.I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use a gel deodorant/antiperspirant so when I received a sample of this product from Buzzagent, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I loved the scent and it really did keep me dry and smelling fresh all day!  It also kept my clothes free from any white marks and I wear a lot of black to work.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it wasn&#x27;t as fast-drying as I had hoped.  I would get out of the shower, put it on and have to walk around with my arms raised while it dried.  Not a huge deal but a little annoying.  If I didn&#x27;t do this, it would feel slimy in my underarms.  All-in-all, I would buy this product since it really kept me dry, I just don&#x27;t know if I would tout the fast-drying as much.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Never have to worry about your deodorant not making it all day! Used for 2 weeks on my vacation to the Caribbean and never once had to worry about sweating in 90 degree weather!</li>
    <li> I must confess that my guilty pleasure is high end department store perfumed deodorant. I justify the price because it lasts a long time and I feel scented even when I cant wear perfume. After using Secret for a week, I find it does just as good a job keeping me protected. It dries fast and no white marks on my dark clothes. I even had a stranger mention how good I smell. (no perfume)&lt;br /&gt;Since gel is not my norm, It took a while to get used to dispensing the correct amount, but it dries fast enough there is no delay in getting dressed.  I received this free as a promotion from Sceret.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a gel deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Secret Solid and Secret Spray for the past 20 years. I was never happy with the solid coming off on my clothes, and I know the spray are supposed to be harmful to your health.  I figured I had nothing to lose when the BzzCampaign came along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel for about 3 weeks now. I really like it overall. It keeps me dry and helps keeping me smelling fresh.  My only complaint is that as soon as I put it on, it sometimes feels a little sticky. But that feeling quickly goes away. I really like the way it dispenses as well.  I will definitely continue using this deodorant from now on. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> BzzAgent offered me a free trial of the Secret Outlast...I was a bit skeptical because I always feared gel deos...the Secret did not let me down. I have so many people ask me what kind of perfume I was wearing because I smell so fresh, when I tell them it is my deo, they are shocked. This will be my new deo forever!</li>
    <li> I was excited to test Secret Outlast for free compliments of BzzAgent.  I was a little skeptical at first because I have tried gel deodorants in the past and for 2 reasons I didn&#x27;t like them...they didn&#x27;t give me the protection I needed and also left my armpits feeling wet, sticky and never quite dry.  So I normally use solid deodorant, however the problem with that is the white marks that are left behind...they look gross and the residue never seems to wash out completely in the laundry.  I was pleasantly surprised that Secret Outlast Clear Gel solved all of the above mentioned problems.  The formula  (only a small amount needed) goes on smooth and evaporates quickly so your underarms don&#x27;t feel wet and sticky...after the formula dries, you wouldn&#x27;t even know you had deodorant on except for the fact that you will smell wonderful!  I am also thrilled that there is NO white residue whatsoever, not even a dusting.  I have to wear Black clothing to work, so it&#x27;s important to have a deodorant that wont be showing all over my dress...there&#x27;s nothing more unprofessional looking than nasty deodorant residue.  My job also involves doing a lot of running around and again I was pleasantly surprised that the product kept me dry and odor free.  This deodorant has definitely given me a confidence booster!  #GotItFree  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of gel deodorants before this product! I hated the wet feeling and wasn&#x27;t convinced that it kept me dry better than a solid deodorant did. I was skeptical when I first tried the Secret Outlast stick, but it didn&#x27;t take long to convince me that this really works! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. It dried quickly, and I didn&#x27;t feel sticky or gross while wearing it. It didn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes. It kept me feeling protected - even in the hot, humid Houston weather! My only criticism would be the amount it suggests to use. The directions say to click 2-3 times, as wanted, but I&#x27;ve found that one click&#x27;s worth of exposed gel is enough to keep me protected for 48 hours. All in all, a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect deodorant for me!  I got this through Bzzagent to try and I love it!  I even have my 11 year old daughter using it. Great odor protection and my clothes stay clean.  My daughter loves it because it doesn&#x27;t mess her clothes up and she can wear tank tops without worrying about white stains or bad odor.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of the BzzAgent campaign and I really liked it. I usually don&#x27;t use gels because I feel like they can be sticky and wet upon application, but this stuff dried fast. More importantly, no white marks on my clothing which happened often with my regular deodorant. It also keeps me dry and odor free throughout the day, even after a workout.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Secret in the past and liked it. I never really focused on what the product was or wasn&#x27;t doing for me. I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BuzzAgent to try out and comment on. I normally use unscented because I don&#x27;t enjoy a deodorant that overpowers my senses all day long.  I received the Completely Clean scent and decided it was worth it to continue with the review. The product is a gel, so it goes on wet, but not sticky. It doesn&#x27;t dry immediately, but within about 5 minutes or so I didn&#x27;t even know I had it on. I did not see this as a problem. The Completely Clean scent is light and does not linger, which I absolutely love.  I have been using the Secret Outlast Gel for over a week and have noticed that I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; ... ever.  I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; woman.  I&#x27;m a professional at a desk with moderate stress, but there are those days when you know you are perspiring (a lot).  This is just a great deodorant and antiperspirant. Of course, my biggest gripe with these products are the white marks they can leave when I slip on my shirt and the crazy marks under my arms at the end of the day.  There was NOTHING with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.  After a long, exhausting Halloween party, I took off my costume to reveal my black tank top.  Nothing.  Even the rat is in awe.  Great job Secret. I&#x27;ve changed my mind on using an unscented product and just can&#x27;t imagine going without this Clean Clear Gel. To me, it&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, usually I use Dove, and my 12 year old daughter has stolen it from me.  I have not used a gel before, and the wet feeling did take some getting used to.  But I feel like I have more odor protection and it truly lasts throughout the day!  I really love the smell too.  We are definitely switching deodorants in this family.</li>
    <li> Before receiving Secret Outlast - Completely Clean Gel Antiperspirant (FREE for review) from BzzAgent, I had never used Secret before. I&#x27;ve been pretty committed to Lady Speed Stick since my pubescent &amp;#34;Teen Spirit&amp;#34; years. I&#x27;m not sure why though because although it smells great and does its job, it lacks in the area of whites marks and wetness protection. Both of which were strengths with the Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does feel weird and different to apply gel antiperspirant...it actually feel wet for a few minutes while it drys. But once its dry, it stays dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells pretty nice and isn&#x27;t overwhelming, particularly to me--a person with significant nasal allergies.&lt;br /&gt;3. Its lasted for the promised 48 hours (I tried it).&lt;br /&gt;4. Had a generally positive experience using it and would happily use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why I never thought about using a gel, but now its on my must have lists for my little black dresses!</li>
    <li> Smells great and I like it, but I still seem to sweat through this!  It takes some time to dry but NO WHITE MARKS!!!!  I am a Bzz Agent so I got this for free.</li>
    <li> Secret outlast completely deodorant is the best. Afyer having twins my ph balance was all thrown off. But this product has changed my life! Seriously I feel more confident.</li>
    <li> As a member of BzzAgent, I received the opportunity to try this product for free.  I kinda wish they had sent me something else to try.  It does go on clear as indictated, but it did not dry quickly for me.  My underarms felt raw and goopy all day.  Also, the &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; scent was completely horrible to me.  Within the 4 days I tried it, the overbearingly medicinal scent triggered several migraines. While I&#x27;m normally a fan of Secret products, I would not recommend this one to anyone.</li>
    <li> Secret has been around for a long time so if anyone could do it, they could. And they did. Secret Outlast Clear Gel provided us, the consumer, with an easy to use and great smelling deodorant gel. This deodorant was wonderful in providing wetness protection to my underarms. It seemed that as time went on, I was sweating less often and could miss a day of applying deodorant even after showering. This product is well worth the money since I have found it for less than $5.00. There are similar products out there that can run upwards of $20.00.  The only problem you will have is trying to decide between the line of different scents to use. I received this as a tester sample product from Buzz Agents for my own honest opinion and review.</li>
    <li> I have something of a love/hate relationship with Secret. I&#x27;ve tried their deodorants before and haven&#x27;t really liked it, but then I tried this Completely Clean scent and I thought it was nice. I&#x27;m not sure how it works when the temperature rises, but it seems to do a good enough job keeping you smelling fresh and clean. I don&#x27;t like how the gel comes out in either tiny amounts with one click or a ton with two clicks. If you get too much on, it&#x27;s just a mess. Other than that, not a bad health and beauty product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree for review from #BZZAgent</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Secret outlast gel....still deciding if I like it....The gel takes a bit of time to dry between 30 and 42 seconds.... ‪#‎gotitfree‬</li>
    <li> This works just as well as my normal Degree underarm invisible solid, but man is it COLD! I think I&#x27;d be much more likely to use this during the summer months! Also, I usually got about 36 hours of coverage, where with the Degree I get 48+. However, in the summer when I really don&#x27; want white marks on my clothing, this is perfect. (Also, fwiw, I tried this product as part of a BuzzAgent campaign.)</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel from a bzzagent campaign,&lt;br /&gt;and to be totally honest I have been shopping around for Deodorant‎ &#x27;s for awhile bc I feel many were not affective.  I am super happy with Secret Outlast, went on smooth, no marks on clothes, dried quickly, stayed dry thru out the work day, even in warm situations with long sleeves on.&lt;br /&gt;When I did a full day smell test from 8 am to 7pm I was still smelling good!!! so far so good!!! think I may have found my brand and type for awhile!</li>
    <li> I usually do not get overly excited about deodorant, and for the most part I use secret, because that&#x27;s what I have been using from childhood.  I usually use the regular secret solid and recieved this product, the secret outlast as a promotion from the brand, so I was definitely curious to see if I would even like the gel.  First, the gel is very cold haha! I feel like I need to have it in a warmer like they have the goop they put the stuff for the ultrasound in.  But all jokes aside, this is really a great product.  I work out, a lot  and sweat pretty hard and with this, I worked out and I still smelled good which is a rare occasion when you workout 2 plus hours.  This deodorant has a very pleasant smell and is very long lasting, better than the regular solid, I would definitely recommend it and may switch to this permanently.</li>
    <li> not for me. I don&#x27;t usually care for gel deodorants anyway but got this free from the manufacture to rate. it made me feel sticky and goopy and unsure about my pits LOL.</li>
    <li> I tried this deodorant because I received it as a promotion from Secret, trying &amp; reviewing it for BzzAgent.  In the past, I have always been skeptical of clear deodorant. I was very pleasantly surprised after using this a few times (just to be sure)! I found my new favorite deodorant...I&#x27;m making the switch, no more stinky pits!    Pros:  The price is very reasonable.  The scent was fresh, not too weak or strong.  Wetness and odor protection was fabulous, lasted all day!  White marks and sweat stains have wrecked my clothes in the past, but this deodorant left no marks.    Cons:  Claims that this has \\&quot;48 hour odor free protection.\\&quot;  It lasted a very long time (maybe 24 hours?), but definitely not 48!  Making sure the deodorant dries...I don&#x27;t always have time to dry my pits for ~10 seconds!</li>
    <li> Best new deodorant I have tried in a long time. Works awesome!</li>
    <li> I received this deoderant curtosy of BzzAgent and Secret. I used to only use Secret Clinical Strength prior to trying Secret Outlast Clean and Clear Gel. I was nervous to try the gel as my past experience with gels were pretty bad. This one dries quickly and does not leave you feeling wet like other gels and the protection is fantastic. For everyday use, I did not have any issues. It is not as strong as the clinical strength, which I still use when I will be in situations where extra protection is needed, but for everyday use it is great. I have already purchased more from Costco so I trust it for my long term use. It does not leave any white residue and even when I put my clothes on right after, even black tops, there is no white residue.</li>
    <li> I tried my free Secret Outlast completely clean and clear deodorant for a week and a half and I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed. At first I was skeptical on it leaving my armpits too damp but to my surprise it dried quick with no marks or residue and leaves me feeling dry all day. I would recommend everyone giving it an honest try to see how much you will love it. And I received it through the amazing website BuzzAgent as part of a promotion for the brand. How cool is that.</li>
    <li> Keeps the white off my black.  Not only does this stuff keep me dry like the secret brand is reputed for, there is absolutely no white streaks on my clothing - this saves a ton in dry cleaning.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Scent like... fresh, clean, soap &amp; floral. Smells good all day. WORKS 48hours!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product stay clear with no white marks.</li>
    <li> I rarely use gel deodorants because I&#x27;m impatient with \\&quot;drying time\\&quot;, so I was very eager to get my free sample and put Secret 48 Hour Gel to the test!. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about a week now, and overall I am happy with the results. The \\&quot;drying time\\&quot; is minimal, so I can move about my routine with efficiency. The smell is nice and fresh, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day. The product says it lasts 48 hours for odor protection, but I couldn&#x27;t smell it at the end of the day (doing regular activities, not strenuous exercise). I do, however, love the fast drying time, wetness protection, and that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes like other deodorants. I just wish the odor protection and scent lasted longer and really did work for 48 hours like it claims.</li>
    <li> I almost always buy Secret Brand deodorant. I try and stay away from the gels because I feel like they leave a gross, sticky feeling. Sometimes I think I need to air them out and let them dry. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent does not have that normal gel after-application feel of stickiness. I feel dry all day long even in front of big presentations!</li>
    <li> i have never liked &amp;#34;gels&amp;#34; they were squishy.. but this one isn&#x27;t. If you rub it in enough.. which doesn&#x27;t take long, it doesn&#x27;t feel squishy or sticky.  just dry as a bone the whole day!!!  all through vacation fun and halloween festivals!!!  2 kids, in laws and a hubby can make me sweat.. secret helped me stay dry...</li>
    <li> I tried Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel and found it to be what i need to stay odor free through a hectic day. it is easy to aply, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on my cloths. great for sleavless outfits! i love the smell not over powering! i recieved this for a product review from BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product through bzzagent  as part of a promotion of the brand. I have recently found out that my medication causes me to sweat and have hot flashes so having a good protection from deodorant is very important. I wasn&#x27;t too sure how the gel would work imagined it would be wet feeling and icky, But to me it dried pretty quickly. My other deodorant that I use does not last for me. I feel like I have to continually apply it through the day to help with odor. And my armpits always felt wet. Using this i apply in the morning and don&#x27;t have to reapply it throughout the day. Helps with the odor and keeping me dry. I used the completely clean and it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to me and that I&#x27;m not used to that. I think I will try one of the other scents but that is just a personal preference. The only thing I have noticed after using for quite awhile is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the other deodorants do. I&#x27;ve followed the directions for how many clicks for each arm and it just seems to go quicker. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and will trying some of the other scents.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel in a BZZkit. After one week, I can tell you I love it. I stay odor free for two days with no sticky feeling found with most gels!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use gel deodorants because they usually leave my pits feeling wet and sticky for quite awhile after applying.  However, I was getting down to the last little bit of my previous deodorant, I was offered a chance at the Secret Outlast through a promotional offer from the brand and BzzAgent.  I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try again, especially when it&#x27;s free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.  We are having an unseasonably warm October, and my youngest brother is in the midst of his cross country season.  I went to one of his meets, and felt like I ran the 8 kilometers with him!  It was hot, but the deodorant held up.  In fact, later the same day, I met up with some friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in a long time - no need for a refresh, as I was still smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s been awhile since you&#x27;ve tried a Gel deodorant, it&#x27;s time to give it a try again.  You just may find yourself pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> Secret invisable solid was the only brand I used for years, then it stopped being as effective as I needed it to be so I switched to another brand.  I was hesitant to try the Outlast Clear gel but I gave it a go while I still had my typical brand so I could immediately switch back if it was a disappointing failure as I had suspected it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised after the first use! I typically don&#x27;t use gel because it feels sticky/slimy/wet after application, however this dries amazingly fast so I don&#x27;t have that feeling at all.  In addition it&#x27;s clear &amp; dries that way so there&#x27;s no white marks on my clothing either.  It kept me dry &amp; oderless for 24+ hours!! Overall I would recommend anyone to give the product a try &amp; I think you&#x27;ll agree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**My review is based on my own personal experience using this product. I received a sample for participating in a BzzAgent campaign.**</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this as a reviewer for BzzAgent.      This formula really works.  The 48 hours is no joke.  I work with a bunch of moms in my neighborhood to host an annual fundraising event in support of breast cancer research.  We work hard for days leading up to the event, and my Secret Outlast totally worked!!!  I put it on Thursday before Saturday&#x27;s event.  I took a shower before getting gussied up, of course, but it kept me dry the full two days prior!  No stinky pits for me!  :)    The only thing that I think would make this product better for use is if less product came out with each twist of the knob.  It&#x27;s pretty wet stuff and I have to let it dry before I feel comfortable again.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry but as a working mom with two kids who likes to volunteer, I don&#x27;t usually have five seconds to spare.    I really like the scent of this one and am looking forward to trying the Paris scent next.</li>
    <li> Usually I buy invisible solid deodorant, but I received this deodorant free through a BzzAgent Campaign so I gave it a try.  I liked the scent and how long it lasts keeping me fresh and dry.  I didn&#x27;t like that it takes a while for the gel to dry, so I can&#x27;t get dressed immediately after putting it on.  Also if you have just shaved your armpits, it burns and stings when you put it on.  I also don&#x27;t like that varying amounts of deodorant are dispensed with each click.  Sometimes too much comes out, sometimes none at all.</li>
    <li> Tried it last week and it is amazing. I live in the Caribbean so the heat is very, very strong and protection is needed at all times. It doesnt leave residue, feels like you are not wearing anything still feeling protected.</li>
    <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant for free from Bzz Agent.  I am not usually a fan of gel deodorants because I don&#x27;t like how long they take to dry.  I read that this one was supposed to be &amp;#34;fast drying,&amp;#34; but I did not find this to be true.  The scent is very strong, but not offensive.  It might cause a problem if you are allergic to strong smells.  Other than that, I liked the deodorant and it seemed to work well.</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant so far! I was given some as a sample to test and thus far it really does outlast the competition. It goes on clean, has a pleasant scent and definitely left my dark blue shirt completely clean. No marks at all! Also, I have sensitive skin and it has been totally fine on my skin, so it is nice to have another option for deodorant!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like gel deodorants because they do not dry fast enough for my busy life as I&#x27;m always in a hurry to get from point A to point B.  This stuff dries fast, does not leave those little balls under your arms, and does not stain your clothes not even the dark ones, nor does it leave that film on your clothes.  Where has this stuff been all my life!!  I love it and will not buy anything but Secret Outlast Completely Clean in the future.  I LOVE IT!  Thank you BzzzAgent!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel from BzzAgent to try and give my thoughts.  I tend to use the clinical versions of deodorants more so than the regular deodorants.  I decided to give this the ultimate test and use it before putting on a black top and doing a 2 hour workout at the gym.  I was surprised at how quickly it dried.  I put on my top within 5 mins of application and no white marks!  The next positive was the scent lasted throughout my workout and kept me dry.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering which is very important for me as strong scents trigger my migraines almost immediately.  I have no complaints and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing product.  I received a free full size sample of this product because I am a Bzzagent on the word of mouth website, www.bzzagent.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days I stopped using it.  The product goes on cler and stays clear but the benefits end there.  It stayed sticky all day and did not protect me from wetness or odor.  I work at a desk in an office all day so there is really no excuse for my antiperspirant/deodorant not to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quit disappointing as I am a huge fan of Secret--just not THIS version.</li>
    <li> As part of a marketing campaign, I was given this product to try out. It really is better than the solid I had been using. I like the clear gel because I feel like I know how much I am putting on. The gel dries quickly; less than a minute. There is no residue on my clothing. This &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent is good too. It smells like regular soap--clean. It does not have a fragrance or perfume smell to it at all. This is great if you like to use a scented body wash or other perfume. I will definitely buy this again. Not just for the reasons above, but also because it worked all day and into the next. I run, walk, and workout. This stood that test.</li>
    <li> I am glad I tried the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel because it is easy to apply and dries quickly.  It also protects me from odor and wetness the whole day so I feel completely confident when I am on my feet all the time.  I have been using it for weeks now and I am so happy that my favorite clothes are completely free from white marks that are usually left behind by other deodorants that I have tried.  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review this secret outlast. I was amazed how good it really is. I used it after I got out of the shower and it worked all day long and even the next day. I like the clear deodorant it doesnt cause white marks on your clothes. It also has a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I prefer gel. Solid gets on your clothes. Spray feels sticky to me. This stuff worked great for me. Kept me dry and smelling fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Secret recommends using this straight out of the shower, which I&#x27;ve been doing.  I have it in the scent &#x27;completely clean&#x27;, which actually smells really nice!  I haven&#x27;t had any (white) marks whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t know about 48-hour odor protection, since I shower every day, but it definitely keeps me dry and fresh for a day.  This was sent to me for free by Bzzagent, but I&#x27;m definitely going to stock up on it!</li>
    <li> Finally a gel deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my armpits just took a shower while I&#x27;m exercising at the gym or at work. Past gel base deodorants have such an unpleasant feel after I applied it on. It made me want to constantly check my armpits because it feels wet. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel glides on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave any stains on my shirt afterwards. Since the gel dries up quickly and absorbs sweat, it&#x27;s perfect for the gym and throughout the day. I received the product as part of a promotion from BzzAgent to try for free.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, more of a “rainforest fresh” or “clean soap” scent.  Not floral, fruity, herb-like, or powder fresh&lt;br /&gt;Fast drying, no holding your arms up forever to let the gel dry&lt;br /&gt;No white marks, seriously, no white marks on clothes&lt;br /&gt;Works.  Keeps you clean and dry.  No need for touch-up through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging.  As sleek and cool as deodorant packaging could be.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Some people like the flower-fruit stench&lt;br /&gt;Won’t last as long as a solid&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on working out or if it’s a very hot day, you likely will still sweat.  Use clinical strength for those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product  complimentary for consideration from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> This went on smooth and lasted all day long. Great feeling!!</li>
    <li> I tend to get \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to deodorants after a while. I am not sure if this will happen with this product, but it is lasting longer than others I have tried. Even if I do get resistant to it, I will be working it into my rotation, because it works it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I got this as part of a free review program call Bzz Agent, but it is worth it to purchase it. I will be buying it when I run out.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free from Bzzagent to try as a sample.  I loved it instantly. I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 2 weeks now and its officially my new deodorant.  It feels a little cool and wet when you apply it, but it dries within seconds.  It has a very pleasant fresh smell that even my husband complimented me on.  It didn&#x27;t leave any streak marks at all.  Most importantly, it did as it promised and kept me dry and odor free for 2 days despite my constant running around.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clear Gel from Secret for over a week now and am very satisfied.  It&#x27;s easy to use, fresh smelling, and lasts all day.  I only need one or two clicks of the product to have full coverage.  Definitely a good product that I will use again.  I got a free sample from BzzAgent and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I have been quite impressed actually with this new Gel. I usually don&#x27;t like scents but this one makes me smile every morning :) On days that I really have to push it and skip a shower I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;-free! What a relief! I accidentally managed to smear my shirt with it as well and then forgot about it til later that night. You couldn&#x27;t see it at all! Love it and will definitely be restocking when the free one I received from Bzzagent runs out.</li>
    <li> Received this free as a bzz agent  promotion. I have tried sprays, solids and gels and nothing has ever been able to keep me dry and odor free for more than a few hours. This secret outlast has defied the odds when it comes to odor protection keeping me odor free for the entire day. When it came to keeping me dry it lasted longer than any other I have ever tried but not the full day</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free as part of a promotion for Secret and I love it. It protects for at least 24 hours and even longer if I don&#x27;t shower (don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m not a slob, I just spend a of time at home!). It doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks. It keeps me dry. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Deodorant is one product that simply cannot let me down during my day.  I have used Secret brand deodorant most of my adult life. I recently had the opportunity to sample and review the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for a blog post and received a sample via my affiliation with BzzAgent.  Would I recommend Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the fragrance and the effectiveness of the product were acceptable.  I didn’t enjoy the feel of the product during application—but, I’ve used dry solid deodorants for years, and I think it’s a textural issue to which I could become accustomed. It took longer than a few seconds to dry--but, it did dry after about 10 minutes--and kept me feeling dry throughout the day. I do like the potential of an every-other-day deodorant application—I just look forward to a time when the product’s health and safety risks lower.  I would use it again—especially to get more than 24 hrs. of protection from one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product--but, all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> I like the new formula, transparent gel. It dries fast. No white marks. Now I can wear black clothes in fall without worrying. It smells good. Protects for 48 hours. I highly recommended to try this deodorant. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast. I got it free from BZZ Agent and the Secret company. I like that it is clear so that it does not get all over the place and on my work clothes. I have used it for an all day hiking trip with my family and it still smelled great when I got home. I like that it dries quickly and smells great. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I got to try Secret Outlast for free from being a BzzAgent but that doesn&#x27;t reflect my review.  I usually use the solid and was a little undecided on using a gel type.  I am a skeptic no more its very good at odor and wetness protection.  Leaves me feeling secure that I will not have those white lines or spots like solids leave and does it job keeping me fresh and clean smelling while making me feel dry.</li>
    <li> Received Secret Outlast as a part of the Bzz Agent campaign. I am a stick deodorant lover. I have never been a fan of the white marks they leave but never cared for the sticky feeling of a gel. I have been using the Secret Outlast for around 2 weeks and am amazed at how well it works. The stickiness goes away quickly and keeps me dry all day. I am impressed with the staying power of this product and will definitely switch to this for all future purchases. There are no stains or marks on my shirts from my deodorant . That&#x27;s a nice change. secret has a great product here.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try from Bzzagent and thought I got it for free this is my honest opinion.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this antiperspirant for over 1 weeks now and I must admit that it works amazingly. It keeps me dry and smelling fresh even after a long day at work. I don&#x27;t need to reapply midday so that&#x27;s a win for me plus I wear lots of black and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. I would of  giving my review sooner but I had to go buy 2 more since my 2 teenage daughters kept stealing it from me. So I guess If they took it it means they love it and that it works great for them too :-)</li>
    <li> Totally impressed with this product!  I used to like the feeling of &amp;#34;slickness&amp;#34; my other antiperspirant gave me -- now I enjoy the clean feeling from Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel!  One click and a swipe is all I need for 48 HOUR protection.  Yes, I said 48 hours.  And I go to the gym every day, and I am completely surprised at the odor and wetness protection this product gives you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, a gel is different than the white gunky stuff, but believe me, you will feel good, use less product, and smell just fine!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I hadn&#x27;t used a deodorant gel since I was in high school only because of how cold the gel would feel on my skin!  Thanks to the recent BzzAgent Campaign that I was a part of, I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel for free and truly like it!  If you have one little nick or have sensitive skin, be aware that the product may sting initially, but only for about 10-15 seconds (this is why I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5).  I love the scent and the fact that it works well with my body chemistry so I smell fresh and feel dry and am odor free for up to 48 hours!</li>
    <li> I recently was given this product to try out and write a review for free. I&#x27;m not one to usually use gel deodorant. I don&#x27;t like the wetness feel when first applied. After the gel dried, I liked that it kept me dry. I&#x27;ve been using dove solid stick deodorant for as long as I can remember. I think I just found my new deodorant. I also like the smell.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product as a promotion from the brand so that I could review it. All in all it&#x27;s a good product but I do agree with other reviewers that it is too wet and runny.  I love that it&#x27;s clear and I like the scent but I also noticed that it wasn&#x27;t perfectly effective in a stressful situation, nervous odor wasn&#x27;t 100 percent handled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Secret deodorants.  So I was very happy when I was given a chance to try this out as a promotion.  I had applied it Friday morning, and showered the next day without reapplying any deodorant.  That same day, I had ran a marathon and asked several people to sniff me.  Everyone had commented that I did not have any bad odor at all.  My family, whom are very straight forward and outspoken, also agreed.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorant for many reasons: it feels cold when you apply it, it has to dry before you can get dressed, it&#x27;s hard to put on last minute when you are already dressed and realize you forgot deodorant, the \\&quot;click\\&quot; never gives you the right amount of product, it dries flaky...you get the picture. However, when offered the chance to try the new Secret Outlast clear gel via BzzAgent, I decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it again. I was very skeptical the first time I tried it, but I have to say that I was pretty happy with it overall. I was a little disappointed to see that it still clicks up odd amounts of product, so you either have too much or too little, and it is still cold and wet feeling when first applied, but it dries much faster that other gel deodorants, so that feeling doesn&#x27;t last long, thank goodness! It also smells amazing all day long, does not leave unsightly white marks on my clothing, and keeps me feeling fresh! I apply deodorant every morning, so I cannot speak to its claims of 48 hour protection, but it certainly does work for the 24 hours I have it on! I am very happy with this deodorant/antiperspirant, and I will most likely be purchasing it when I run out :)</li>
    <li> I received this from Secret to try and to my surprise it works pretty good on this stressed out, sweaty mom of twin toddlers and preteen daughter! I have always had issues with deodorants running out of protection and not keeping the odor at bay, so to try this gel kind, I was uneasy. I run around all day and all evening until its shower time. After a long day of activity I was surprised to smell....nice. Still nice after all that activity all day. Wow. From a gel deodorant yet too! Its a great value!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel has, the deodorant has great odor protection and lasting power. One complaint, it dries a bit slow but once it is dry it&#x27;s fantastic. Don&#x27;t worry about white marks, because there aren&#x27;t any. It&#x27;s not irritating like standard antiperspirant can be after daily use, it even combats postpartum hormone fluctuations. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this deodorant so much since I #gotitfree from bzzagent and it costs a lot less then what I use now but it&#x27;s nothing like my Dove deodorant! The scent is pleasant but I felt as though I had to keep reapplying just doing house work. The clear gel formula was a nice change and almost cooling, and I loved I didn&#x27;t have to worry when slipping on my little black dress!</li>
    <li> Definitely lives up to its promise! I&#x27;ve worn it with a black tank top (the ultimate test) and left ZERO white marks. On top of that, its leaves me smelling fresh throughout the hot Miami days. Only downfall is that it takes quite a bit of twisting in order for the first application to come to the top, meaning it&#x27;s not full to begin with. Just a heads up for those who are more concerned about cost, though I did get mine for free through bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try Secret Outlast in the completely clean scent, courtesy of BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;When testing this product, I was looking for 4 things:&lt;br /&gt;1) Does it go on clear?&lt;br /&gt;  Absolutely. Goes on clear, dries pretty quickly, with zero residue or white marks. It is a little tacky feeling until it dries, though.&lt;br /&gt;2) How does it smell?&lt;br /&gt;  The &#x27;completely clean&#x27; scent is pretty mild, and doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume. That scent dissipates over the first 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;3) Does it keep me dry?&lt;br /&gt;  No. It didn&#x27;t make it through a grocery shopping trip. It didn&#x27;t make it through cleaning/organizing. I had a few days with very little going on and it certainly didn&#x27;t make it to the 48 hours it promised. My experience was that it had the same drawback other clear gels have - it just doesn&#x27;t have staying power.&lt;br /&gt;4) Does it keep body odor in check?&lt;br /&gt;  I did do a decent job at this, for the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current go to deodorant is a clinical protection line. I didn&#x27;t expect this to live up to that level of coverage and antiperspirant protection. I don&#x27;t feel like this product lived up to the claim of lasting for 48 hours. Other than that, it is a good deodorant. The antiperspirant aspect falls a bit short, though. I will keep it around, and probably use it, for one reason, it really does go on clear and stay clear.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new deodorant of choice! I received it as a bzzagent and now know it will get me through sweater season at work even when the heat goes on high and I&#x27;m running around like crazy! No sweat! If you love your sweaters but don&#x27;t love sweat, definitely choose Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!  It dries instantly, leaves no stains on your clothes, has clear packaging to show how much you have left, covers well, smells great (but lightly, not overpowering), and above all...works great!  I feel confident going about my day.  Not once have I worried about sweat or smell while using this.  The only time I feel the need to reapply that isn&#x27;t directly after my morning shower is after a challenging gym class.  The only con I (barely) see with this is that is seems to get used a bit quicker than solid sticks.  I&#x27;ve used mine for several weeks and am already halfway through it.  I got a free stick of this with buzzagent and I&#x27;m so glad I did, because I love it and I probably would never have switched from solid deodorant if I hadn&#x27;t.  Why would have probably not have switched?  I&#x27;m stuck in my ways I guess.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this new gel formula is that you never run the risk of those annoying white streaks lighting up your black clothing. Before I tried this product I had three choices when wearing black: ignore the streaks and go out looking like some sort of reverse negative zebra, execute contortions like a Russian gymnast when pulling the shirt over my head, or try and apply an adequate layer of deodorant on my underarms after I get dressed. No more! Thanks to BzzAgent I got to try the Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free, and I&#x27;m glad to have discovered it. I like the Secret brand in general, and it works pretty good for an average priced antiperspirant. The fragrance is nice, and it fades gradually and doesn&#x27;t overpower anything else I&#x27;m wearing. The gel dries very soon after applying. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s instantaneous, but if I put it on right after my shower by the time I start to get dressed it&#x27;s dry and not sticky. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the product burning my underarms, even after shaving, but I seldom have any reactions to products. It does contain alcohol, so maybe that&#x27;s doing it for some folks.&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of cons: I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t really last 48 hours if you&#x27;re working out or in a very warm room. It seems to last about 24 hours reliably, but I haven&#x27;t found this to be a problem since I shower daily and reapply the antiperspirant. Also, you don&#x27;t get as many applications out of the gel compared to the solid variety. Even though I&#x27;m just twisting the applicator once to get just enough to apply to my underarm, I&#x27;ve gone through this tube much faster than I go through the Secret solid.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, yes, I&#x27;ll be buying and using this product in the future. It works, it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes, and it smells nice. The price is about average for a good antiperspirant, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel  from BzzAgent .Typically, the clear gel does not work so well for me during Missouri&#x27;s ungodly humid summers but to my delightful surprise, this deodorant is phenomenal! Last week here was around 81F degrees.Also, as promised it does not leave any white marks behind and it absorbs quickly! This will be my &amp;#34;go-to summertime deodorant from now on!Of coure I will use it every day at work  and at the  fitness salon .Last day my coworker asked me what is that pleasant scent that I&#x27;m wearing.I smiled and I said:It is my &amp;#34;SECRET&amp;#34;Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent so I got this product for free. I must say, I love it and will BUY it in the near future. It dries quickly, and lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free as part of a promotion from Secret brand, but I&#x27;ve purchased it many, many times before. I love this product.  They aren&#x27;t kidding - there are no, and I mean NO white marks. Ever.  The feeling of the gel may take some getting used to for those people who are accustomed to stick deodorant - it&#x27;s cool and wet - but that lasts for just a minute after application. The wetness goes away within a few minutes, but I actually like the feeling! I think it&#x27;s refreshing. After that, the performance is what you would expect from Secret - protection all day and into the night. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with feeling unprotected, whether it&#x27;s at a work meeting or at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things to note:  every once in a blue moon, you will see a bottle of this at the store where some moisture has collected at the bottom on either side of the turning wheel. These are messy and likely defective, so I would avoid it / return it. Like I said, that&#x27;s really rare (happened twice in YEARS of using the stuff) and the bottle that I tried pursuant to this promotion did not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, regarding the scent.  Secret makes some scents that, while pleasant, they smell like they&#x27;d be more appropriate for a teenage girl. I have found that I just love this Completely Clean scent.  It&#x27;s not unscented by any means - it&#x27;s still very pleasant - but I have found it doesn&#x27;t clash with any of my perfumes or smell too sweet/fruity for a grown woman to be wearing.  It&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> Finally no more residue marks on shirts. This product was great. It smelled nice, long lasting and felt great all day and most important no white marks.</li>
    <li> I received this gel deodorant as a part of a BzzAgent Campaign. This deodorant gets an A+++ for not staining the clothes &amp; is a good product when it comes to long lasting part.It smells good when u put it on,Yay for no more marks on your clothes! Definitely going to try other scents too...</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant. I am so glad that I was able to try this product for free since I am a BZZAGENT. I like that this product has a light and refreshing scent. I like that this product effectively protects me from odor and wetness. I like that this product offers 48 hour odor protection and helps prevent odor-causing bacteria. In addition, I like that this product absorbs quickly and it does not leave any white marks on my clothes. This is an issue I have had with similar products. It is nice to not have to worry about getting stains on my clothes. The only disadvantage is that it is sometimes hard to control the amount of gel that comes out. I have noticed that sometimes too much comes out and I waste the product.  Overall, I would recommend the product since it offers relevant benefits and lives up to its claims.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised how fast Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel dried. Definitely will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of clear GEL deodorant&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different brands in the past and they just never made the cut. I was always always left feeling like I forgot to put deodorant on. Well I have to say that my feelings about clear gels have changed thanks to new  SECRET OUTLAST CLEAR GEL DEODORANT. It truly does a as it it says and keeps you protected from sweat and odor for 48 hours.I only needed one click under each arm for full coverage and of course the fact that it is clear and doesn&#x27;t leave me with those irritating white marks you get on your shirt especially if you put your deodorant on before your shirt without thinking as I sometimes do. I didn&#x27;t get that sticky feeling either. It&#x27;s water based and dries rather quickly so I didn&#x27;t have to wait 5minutes to get dressed, it was more like 15 seconds! The other good thing I noticed was it actually has slightly more deodorant than my usual large stick of Dove invisible solid. Dove has been the brand I&#x27;ve been using for a while but truly the invisible solid thing is not accurate. I still get those white marks on my shirt when I&#x27;m not careful and find myself having.g to scrub them off!  The only thing I would have liked would be a bit stronger of a scent. While it does have a nice clean scent, it isn&#x27;t all that strong which some people may appreciate but I would prefer it be stronger smelling. Overall I had a very positive experience with New Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I got to try it for free as part of a promotion from Secret and I will use it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with sweat and it&#x27;s really embarrassing!  I usually wear dark colors or layers just so a sweat stain isn&#x27;t obvious. The worst part of wearing dark colors, though, is the white streaks that you get from deodorant that kind of just ruin that outfit. I got this product as part of a promotion of the brand and so I had a weekend full of activities that was my trial run with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. The verdict?  NO SWEAT STAINS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really picky about smells and find myself using men&#x27;s deodorant more often because the smells aren&#x27;t as bad, but this one, the Completely Clean scent, actually isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s not overpowering and actually just smells clean which is nice - I like smelling clean, not like a floral shop. It dried really quickly once I put it on so my armpits didn&#x27;t feel all slimy which, I must say, is a very large perk.  The best one, though, is that I had no sweat stains after a day in the pumpkin patch and grocery shopping.  My true test, though, will be after a &#x27;Mommy and Me&#x27; gymnastics class in a few days, but I&#x27;m feeling pretty confident about it right now!</li>
    <li> This product smells fine and the scent is not noticeably strong after application. The product is sticky when being applied like most gel deodorants but dries fairly quick. I did not have any odor concerns after applying this product and worked in the yard for three hours without any odor issues. I think Secret has continued to add quality product to their line with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> Works well, lasts all day and without the white marks just as it claims.  Only complaint is that after applying I felt wet and slimey for probably 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Deodorant goes on smoothly and cleanly. Dries fairly quickly and does not leave embarrassing white marks on my clothes which I love. It definitely lasted all day for me and gave me a feeling of protection and did a great job of fighting that sweaty odor feeling. I&#x27;m quite pleased with it and it worked great for me, so I will be using this more in the future.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for free as a Bzzzz agent and I love it. Its not like the other gels I have tried in the past that only last a couple of hours or burns your underarms. It doesnt get on your clothes and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I received my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant to do a review for BzzAgent.  I&#x27;ve used gels for years because I hated the white marks left my solids.  I love the clean fresh scent and the gel dries fast and protects me for up to 48 hours.  Whether I&#x27;m shuttling the kids around, shopping, gardening or going into a board meeting, I know I&#x27;m protected.  This is my new Secret and I&#x27;m sharing it with you!</li>
    <li> I love it, the scent is amazing and its easy to apply after a shower!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free to try from Secret. I really like this deodorant. I don&#x27;t know how fast it dries because I put my shirt on right after I put it on. I can attest that it doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on my shirt at the end of the day. As far as 48 hours odor control, I don&#x27;t know about that because by the end of the day, I felt as though the deodorant failed. Overall, I feel that this is an okay deodorant.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast really does the job!  I was impressed first that it didnt leave the tell-tale white streaks on my shirt.  Second, it has a wonderfully fresh, clean scent that l love smelling throughout the say.  Third, this stuff really does WORK like it says it does.  I stayed dry and smelling great all day, all night and into the next day.  This is now my go-to product.  Im switching from my other deodorant Ive used for years.  LOVE IT! #gotitffreefromsecret</li>
    <li> It smells awesome! I couldnt wait to use it! Then I woke up and put it on. It went on smoothly and didnt leave any white or any marks at all :)  As far as how it works, it works great as well!!! I disclose that I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Love my secret outlast completely dry deodorant! Keeps me feeling fresh and dry thoughout the day even through a workout! It&#x27;s a must buy. Even strong enough for a man!</li>
    <li> I like that it drys clear but doesn&#x27;t dry quick enough for me. The smell is great and protection is awesome. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am used to using a solid deodorant daily but with this Outlast, I have only needed to apply it every other day! It is a definite change from my normal routine but I like it! It is different for someone going from solid to gel deodorant, but I think it is definitely something I can get used to. Over all, great protection!</li>
    <li> I received my Secret Outlast Completely Clean and Clear Gel for free from BizzAgent.  I used it for about a week now and it works wonders for me.  No more sweaty odors. I apply very little, because it is gel you do not even need more.  It dries out fast, may be not in few seconds, but is pretty quick enough for me.  It does not leave any white marks.  I just apply only once when I go out and it works all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy customer here and I am going to stick to it.</li>
    <li> I tried this and it WORKS just like it says, also there was no burning when applied after shaving.  Most I have tried my underarms burn.  Yes - I did do the 48 hour test and no smell/wetness.  Great Product! I got this product to try being a Bzz Agent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I came into trying this deodorant full of skeptisim. I&#x27;m not really a big fan of gels. But it may be the first deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in a long time that actually helps me with sweat.</li>
    <li> I received my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from being a bzzagent just in time to leave for my girl-trip/vacation in Vegas. Upon peeling off the protection strip from the top of my new Secret deodorant, I sniffed the contents to see how I liked the scent.  It smelled really good.  I used it every day of my vacation and loved the scent, the protection and that it was &#x27;clear&#x27; so no deodorant marks to clean off my clothes like one of my roommates who used the deodorant she brought. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from my deodorant.  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is definitely a winner in my book; or should I say in my bathroom next to my make-up, hairspray and all the essentials I need to get ready to face the day?</li>
    <li> I tried Secret Outlast for the first time a week ago. ..I absolutely loved it. It smells really fresh and gives long lasting results. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant free from BzzAgent to post my thoughts and review.  I shelved my usualy stick deodorant, and used the Secrest Outlast clear gel exclusively for 8 days.  Overall, I liked it.  When I first received my kit, I opened it, and smelled it. I liked the scent, as did my husband.  He accidentally tried out the &amp;#34;no white marks&amp;#34; claim for me within the first minute, as he had clicked some up to smell, then dropped it on his shirt.  That made this judegement easy, this stuff means what it says.  Nary a white mark ever appeared on his shirt, nor on my clothes when I was wearing it.  Definitely loved this part.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like a gel deodorant, and, honestly, it&#x27;s a little weird when applying.  Even this morning, on day 8, it feels weird to me, and wet and I become convinced it will not dry, but it does, in probably about a minute.  To use this, I&#x27;d recommend applying the deodorant, then all other clothes before putting on your shirt to allow time to dry.  I found it worked well as a dedorant and antiperspirant.  I had no issues at all with odor or wetness while using.  I will continue to use the sample I received, and will purchase again to use when I definitely need a &amp;#34;no white mark&amp;#34; deodorant.  I love my current deodorant, but it definitely falls short in that are, and Secret Outlast Clear gel stepped up in that area.  With having to wait a bit to dry, I will keep my usual stick around for those mornings when I have hit the snooze button one too many times and am in a rush to get to work.</li>
    <li> As a busy mom of 2 boys , between work , home and all of our after school activities I still feel confident Of going in public and not worrying that yes I just finished coaching my son soccer team and no I don&#x27;t smell like it lol. Secret keeps my mind off the little things so I can focus on my family ... now if we can find a cure for the puppy dog smell of my boys when they get done playing outside one step at a time lol</li>
    <li> Let me say, I am a Secret deodorant user and have been for several years. Prior to testing the Secret Outlast product, I was using the Secret Clinical Invisible Solid (which I love, by the way).  The transition in trying the new Secret Outlast was challenging because I already have a deodorant that I truly love. So, this product had tough competition (luckily, from the same company).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets Begin!!  The scent. I have a very keen sense of smell. Surprisingly, the Completely Clean fragrance wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all. As a matter of fact, it was almost too soft of a scent. If it were up to me, I would make the fragrance a tad bit more stronger so you can at least smell it when putting it on.  Then again, I would rather have a softer fragrance than an overpowering one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Gel: Awww, I have a love/hate relationship with the clear gel. Yes, it goes on clear and it doesn&#x27;t leave ANY white marks on clothes. They are definitely \\&quot;true to their word\\&quot; here. However... (here&#x27;s the bad), I had to flap my arms like a chicken for 5-7 minutes to dry that sticky, yucky feeling underneath my arms. I can&#x27;t stand that. So, no, the wetness doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;evaporate in seconds.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Protection: I have tested this product specifically to see if I sweat underneath my arms and give out any \\&quot;stinkys\\&quot; while walking the treadmill. The results? No stinkys crawled out from my underarms! I was still nice and dry. Secret Outlast won that battle!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it really offer 48 hr protection? For me, no, it didn&#x27;t. I had to re-apply the deodorant after 24 hours. Maybe they should have said \\&quot;Up to 48 hour protection\\&quot;? But hey, going 24 hours without having to re-apply your deodorant is pretty darn good, if I do say so myself.... especially after the treadmill challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I still love my Secret Clinical the best. But if I&#x27;m ever in a pinch and need to save money, Secret Outlast would be my 2nd choice, definitely. I priced this at Walmart and it&#x27;s only $2.97. That&#x27;s excellent compared to my favorite deodorant.  Kind of makes that annoying flapping action worth it.  (Wink, wink)</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d this product as part of promtoion from the brand.  I love it!  It smells clean and goes clear- what more can you ask for from a deodarant.  I would use this product again and on my own.  Secret- the Secret is that you always work.</li>
    <li> Totally amazed by how wonderful this worked! It lasted a very long time and left no \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; marks. I am a true believer in this deodorant. It lasts and lasts.  This is so worth the little that is costs! You will be  hooked! I got it free as a brand promotion.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a trial from Bzzagent. Here is what I found when using this product.  But first I must tell you I do not use gel or scented deodorant as I am sensitive to the smells it gives my a headache or makes me fell sick to my stomach so I was skeptical of even trying it. Well it turns out a winner. The gel does take about 5 -7 minutes to dry, so start flapping those arms. Once it dries it is dry and stays that way. As for the smell it is a nice smell, but at first it is pretty strong and then it evens out to be just fine. I don&#x27;t know about the 48 hour promise, but it does keep working for 24 hours so that&#x27;s darn good. All in all I like this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have used soft solid or solid deodorants for as long as I can remember. I received this deodorant to try (as a promotion from the company) and am quite impressed with it. It dries very quickly, there is absolutely no streaks of deodorant left behind, it smells good, and most importantly it keeps you dry. It&#x27;s not absolutely perfect with wetness protection but it works really well. I did feel a tiny bit of dampness today but considering how stressed I was today at work, it worked great.</li>
    <li> I have only used solid deodorants for the longest time, and the last time I used a gel deodorant, it felt so cold and gooey, I was grossed out and never used one again, but when I got a free sample from BzzAgent, I was willing to give gel a try again.  Just as a side note, I was turned off that one of the ingredients was aluminum, but then I realized that the supposedly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that I&#x27;ve been using a while also has contains aluminum.  It would be great if this product didn&#x27;t contain aluminum, but apparently it&#x27;s very hard to find a deodorant without it at a traditional store.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the performance of this deodorant, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  I usually have very noticeable white marks on my shirt underarm area, especially when I wear tank tops.  With this product, there was literally no white residue on the black tank that I wore the other day, it was amazing!  Also, the gel didn&#x27;t feel cold and gooey and it dried almost immediately!&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this deodorant but I&#x27;m not sure that I will purchase it again, I might try to find something that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.  If the aluminum doesn&#x27;t bother you (there is no clear evidence that aluminum in deodorant is a health risk), then this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous in all ways but one (which I will get to in a second).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell is lovely, it seems the more you sweat the more the smell comes out so you know it is working. It really puts my mind at ease that I am being protected like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing with a 5 month old, running a show on the las vegas strip, and just dealing with every day stresses the smell is a nice reminder that I am being protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also does not leave any white marks which is perfect since my wardrobe is all blacks for my job. Nothing worse then having white marks all over your blacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this brings me to the only bad thing. The gel never seems to dry! I feel like I am sweating even if I am just sitting in the rocking chair and reading a book. It never drys, which is horrible when all you want from a deodorant is to feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it (I got it for free for a promotion of the brand), probably not. I can&#x27;t stand feeling wet when all I want is to feel protected and dry.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast is a great product.  While sweating there are no sweat marks!  Best part no white marks!!!! Totaly recommend this deodorant!!!  #GotItFree  #bzzagent</li>
    <li> Normally I am not a fan of gel deodorant, but I was offered an opportunity to try this product free through BzzAgent so I went for it. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is much better than I expected and much better than other gel deodorants I have used in the past. First of all, it dries super fast! Other gels I have used in the past have taken much longer to dry or stay somewhat sticky all day, but not this one. It also leaves no marks on my clothes. The odor and wetness protection is great as well, no issues there. Kept me protected all day. I only gave it 4 stars because after using the deodorant for a week, half of it is already gone. Per the directions on the back, I am only using 2-3 clicks per application, so I&#x27;m not using an excessive amount. I&#x27;m concerned that it would not last as long as a regular stick deodorant and I would be buying this particular deodorant more often than I would a regular stick deodorant. So it&#x27;s great that it works and I love the product, but if it needs replacing twice as often I&#x27;m not sure I would switch as it would be costing me twice as much.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s a nice smooth feeling everytime keeps my clothing clean without and streaks of white marks. I dont sweat it anymore and its not a secret any more I use outlast. ..</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this deodorant.  I was hesitant before using due to bad experience with other gel deodorants but I thought this dried very quickly!  I was not left feeling sticky and wet!  And even better it works great!!!  you really can go 48 hours and be protected, I actually tried it!  And no white marks here, I wear black scrubs and I am usually wiping away white streaks in the morning, but not with this one!  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I am a Bzzagent so periodically I get to try products for free or at a reduced cost so that I can give my honest opinion on the product. I have to admit that I was a little hesitant at first when beginning to use this product, but I am happy to report that I love Secret Outlast. I love the clean scent, the great coverage, and the fact that it works. I have been cleaning and remodleing my home the past week and with my old antiperspirant/deoderant I could still feel the sweat and smell myself after a few hours of work. With Secret, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that at all. I can go out and grab a bite to eat and not have to worry about offending people while I do so. Then I can go back to work, and still feel fresh at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I received a free pack of this deodorant to try through BzzAgent.  I was not expecting much from it... I used gel deodorants in the past and grew out of them... they just didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective and I remember them being sticky and wet and taking forever to dry.  This is not the case with this formula.  It dries quicky and is not sticky.  It also is actually completely clear which is not something I can say about the clear stick formulas I have been using.  Also, the sticks I have been using have been a little less effective lately.  I think I just needed a change up and this did it!  I will definitely repurchase when I run out and may end up rotating it with other formulas.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean scent as a free sample through BzzAgent.  It has been nothing less than amazing!  I put it on in the morning after my shower, and wake up the next day early to go to the gym before showering again.. with no additional applications!  With any other deodorant/antiperspirant that I have tried I have stunk by bedtime never mind after the gym the next day!  It did take me a bit to get used to the application of a gel, but once it dries it fantastic!  I highly recommend this product and I will definitely be purchasing more once my free sample runs out!</li>
    <li> I was able to try a sample if this for free, here&#x27;s what I thought...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really leaves no white marks, none at all&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours like it said on the container&lt;br /&gt;Has a wet feeling for several minutes after applying&lt;br /&gt;Container lasted half the time of my solid</li>
    <li> So far, I am very impressed with Secret&#x27;s Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.  The first surprise I had with it was how quickly it dries.  I have used clear gels in the past that seem like they stay wet forever, or you would need to use a blow dryer under your arms before putting on a shirt.  This is completely different though-- every time I have used it, it has dried within a few seconds and leaves no sticky feel.  What I am liking most about the Completely Clean Clear Gel is that is leaves no residue under my arms.  I really don&#x27;t like using white stick deodorant because of the residue that builds up in my razor when I shave under my arms, and I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all with this gel deodorant.  I am impressed with the antiperspirant and deodorant aspect of this so far too.  I am usually a sweaty person, and have a hard time finding an antiperspirant and deodorant that helps with both perspiration and smell, but this has been working for me so far!  It is November, so I may need to update my review once I have used the product in the summer, but the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is working great right now!  I got to try this item for free as a BzzAgent, but I am impressed with it and sharing my true opinion of it.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I have received this product free through Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;I have had many other deodorants and this one stands up to the test of time. No white smudges, lovely smell, and best of all, great odor protection that lasts the whole day through! I honestly prefer secret clinical strength, but this works in a pinch!</li>
    <li> I NEVER use gel deodorant/antiperspirant because they are sticky, they crumble up, they never dry, they don&#x27;t protect me from odor and I still end up sweating under my arms anyways.This product is actually a bit different from other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I got to try the invisible solid as a sample and decided to try the gel version instead since I had had great luck with the invisible solid variation. The smell for one is really pleasant and CLEAN! Not only do I smell clean, but I didn&#x27;t get any crumbles or marks on my clothing. I didn&#x27;t have any wetness for the entire day and it lasted until my shower the next morning because I could still feel the product (though it washes off easily) so the claims up to 48-hour protection are actually reasonable and true. I stayed dry, it dried quickly after I put it on and I just smelled good all throughout this weird heat that Florida is having! You can smell the product start to kick in when you&#x27;re in moments of high activity or high stress! I would still pick the Invisible solid out of the two but if you prefer gels, then this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited when I received Secret Outlast for free courtesy of BzzAgent. I didn&#x27;t try it til the next day, while getting ready for work. My job is in a warehouse with no air conditioner or fans. It&#x27;s crucial you use a deodorant that works really well! I usually am dripping sweat for my whole 8 hour shift (it&#x27;s nasty!) I walk around all day carrying boxes and doing very physical work. I love Secret Outlast! It kept me smelling fresh the whole day. When I lifted my arms to lift boxes I could smell the scent of the deodorant all day! The gel goes on and feels cool on your skin, the scent smells so clean! I normally do not purchase gel deodorant, but now I like it better then other kinds. I recommend Secret Outlast to anyone that sweats a lot at their job or working out!</li>
    <li> Like many others who have tried gel deorderant in the past with the nasty feeling that follows, I was too skepitcal as to how the Secret Outlast was going to preform.  So when given the oppertunity to sample this through BzzAgent, I quickly jumped in.  I wanted a solution to the game of solid deorderant marking my tops.  Well, I can honestly tell you I found it here!  Such a surprise to what I was used to in the past!  Not only does it apply different but it also last forever...what a relief!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this item thanks to a Bzz Campaign and I was pleasantly surprised!  It went on smoothly and did not leave any marks on my clothes.  This is perfect for summer because who was to have clumps of deodorant on their underarms when wearing a cute tank or sleeveless dress.  Besides looking good it works.  It is nice to have on less thing to worry about.</li>
    <li> I recieved secret outlast gel complimentary to try for testing purposes from bzzagent and I&#x27;m super stoked I did! I love how it goes on and dried instantly, it left no white marks on my BLACK shirt which is a godsend I can&#x27;t tell you how many times other brands have left me walking around with baby wipes just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have streaks of deodorant on my clothes. This product smells great as well #gotitfree</li>
    <li> When I joined the Secret Outlast Completely Clean review on Bzz Agent I was afraid that the product would be sticky. I was so surprised to find that this deodorant is completely different. It had a light texture and its not sticky at all! Bonus! I wore it for 48 hrs and my underarms are still dry. When I put it on it dried so fast! I wore a shirt while I put it on and it did not get the shirt wet. The protection you get from this deodorant is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it on a busy and humid day. We did yard work on one acre on a humid hot 90F day. It definately works under pressure.  Its been a busy 48hrs but on purpose to really test it.  I feel fresh all day and I just love the scent it lasted the whole time. I even had people asking me what perfume I had on. I was delighted to tell them that it was Secret Outlast Completely Clean. That surprised them and they said there were going to try it. Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product saves money too as it lasts over two days. Love it, changing to Secret Outlast!</li>
    <li> I am a mom on the go and I reapply deodorant 2x a day. I tried this brand and I DIDN&#x27;T REAPPLY AT ALL, ALL DAY!!!!! Its hot and muggy outside and I&#x27;m wrangling the kids all day and I still smell fresh!!! Keeps working right with me all day long!!!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from bzzagent. Having an antipersperant that actually keeps me dry is very important to me because I sweat A LOT. I tried it all day yesterday (it was hot out and i had errands and no a/c) and it kept me dry all day! I&#x27;m pretty set in my ways and I normally use a different brand clinical gel, but after trying this kind for just one day, I am actually going to switch! I&#x27;m not normally into women&#x27;s scents of deodorant, but the &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; smell is actually very pleasant. It&#x27;s not easy for me to switch brands, but this was a no brainer!</li>
    <li> I personally am someone who sweats, and I also work out regularly, so having a deodorant that works - both for wetness and odor - is super important to me. I&#x27;ve used clear gel deodorants in the past and wasn&#x27;t impressed, but I gave this one a shot. Right away I didn&#x27;t like how the gel feels - sticky and wet when you apply it. I also wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell. The first day I used this, it worked fine, but I also didn&#x27;t do any strenuous activity, so I wanted to use it on a day that I worked out. Again, hated how it felt going on, and during the workday, I felt like it kept me reasonably dry, but when I went up 10 flights of stairs, I definitely had some wetness going on. I reapplied before I worked out in the evening and it definitely did not keep me dry. It may have covered up some of the sweaty smell, but it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me. I&#x27;m going to stick with Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength Stress Response Women&#x27;s Advanced Solid deodorant, which always has worked well for me in the past. As a full disclosure, I got this for free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast clear jell to try out for free thanks to Secret through bzzagent. Before trying it out I was already a big fan if the secret invisible solids so I was supper excited to try something ells from a trusted brand. I was not sure how I was going to like a gel deodorant I always imagined them leaving me feeling sticky. So after trying it out I was pleasantly surprised how fast it dried and how little of the product you need to use and it didn&#x27;t feel sticky at all. It has a nice scent a little strong but I like the scent if you are sensitive to scents you might want to try it in the scent free. After a full day running after a toddler spending part of my day outside in the Florida heat I am happy to say I am still smelling great at the end of the day and an added bonus it doesn&#x27;t leave funky white marks on my dark tank top.</li>
    <li> You know i Have used a zillion different types of deodorant/anti-perspirant. It always seems liek one works for a little while then its off to find a new one. Enter Secret Outlast. It goes on clear, with no cakeys white residue which is impossible to get off you, especially if you wear a lot of black like i do. When this BzzAgent campaign came along with a sample for me to try I was so stoked and it totally lived up to my expectations. It Outlasted everything!</li>
    <li> Secret is an excellent choice for antiperspirant/deodorant. The scent smells wonderful and fresh - not too overpowering! I prefer this scent because it is not powdery smelling like other bars. I like the gel, but from my experience you need to be careful it doesn&#x27;t get left somewhere (like in the car) that it can get hot, or it melts and leaks out making a mess. This deodorant is good value for the money because it lasts so long and you don&#x27;t need to worry about reapplying it even when working out and sweating. It protects and eliminates odor, so it&#x27;s perfect for summer. I&#x27;m so glad I got to get a free sample bar of Secret Outlast 48 hour deodorant from BzzAgent because I am constantly sweating at my job, in a warehouse, with no air conditioner! I am very busy working 2 jobs and being a student, so this is the perfect choice for me to have peace of mind so I feel confident! I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars because I&#x27;m one of the people advocating for natural ingredients. So, Secret, I would be much happier when you decide to use natural ingredients found in nature to come up with an all natural--preferably organic--formula instead of using added ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am loving this deodorant! I got a free sample from BzzAgent and can&#x27;t wait to buy more! It lasts all day,  even after chasing my two-year old son and 6-month old dog around! I also love the scent of it!  It is fresh and a great addition to my daily routine! #got it free #epic48 #life hack #momhack</li>
    <li> Secret is the only brand of deodorant I used. I typically use the clear gels, but I received a sample of Outlast Completely Clean and gave it a try. The scent is great and after a long day, there were no white gunk on my clothes. Kept me dry and smelling good even after being outside in the hot sun. My favorite deodorant by far.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample VIA Bzzagent to try and I&#x27;m 100% amazed with Secret Outlast Xtend Clear Gel..I&#x27;m already a big fan and user of secret clear gels but this one bar far is my favorite..I love that within seconds YES seconds it drys and you can&#x27;t even tell that you apply it...yes I did I made sure it was dry and didn&#x27;t even feel that it was on,love that it fights odors because I sweat very badly and I always have to keep applying over and over but with secret Outlast 48 hr protection I didn&#x27;t have too even the next day I didn&#x27;t even wear it because it was still working and I wanted to see if it really lasted the 48hrs and it did honestly and I&#x27;m not just saying that it really does work and last as labeled..The best part is sometimes I forget to apply my deodorant after I put my tank tops on or shirts or which ever it may be and I&#x27;ll apply it before and I always get white marks on my clothes with this deodorant it doesn&#x27;t put white marks on my tank tops so NO worries there and I love that...so thanks to secret for letting me try this deodorant out and thanks to Bzzagent for sending it to me,I have made the switch to Secret Outlast Clear Gel my epic48</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Secret but have never used a clear gel before. The scent was pleasant, it dried on the skin very quickly and I never once noticed any odors after physical exertion. Not leaving white marks is just icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Secret for allowing me to try out this product for free.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear #GotItFree from BzzAgent. I tried it and it works great for no white marks on my clothing, however I did find the need to reapply it because it didn&#x27;t last as long as it should. All in all I say its a decent deodorant for no white marks but not a very long lasting one.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent in order to review it. I used it when I went on vacation with my family. We went on a 3 mile hike on one of the days. It really worked well. I never experienced wetness or any odor although the rest of me was dripping in sweat. It made me very happy to finally find a deodorant that works the way that actually worked for me and gave me confidence to wear light colors when I hike. I would definitely recommend this deodorant to any woman that has problems with deodorants that promises wetness control but fails!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent and Secret, I got to try this product free. So I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant today, and I must say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I put it on in the morning, and the gel went on smooth, dried fast, and left no white residue. I did all my housework, all my errands, in the heat I might add, and I stayed dry all day. At the end of the day I got my workout in and Secret Outlast was still working. Through an intense workout , it helped with wetness and odor, it still smelled good after. Impressive.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! No white marks u feel dry and refreshed and still manage to stay refreshed even the next day! The smell of this product is just right not overbearing and great in the skin! I received this free from Bzz agent This is a product I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Got a free sample of Secret Outlast clear gel from BzzAgent and I was impressed.  As a person who normally uses solids, I am not hooked on this clear gel.  It isn&#x27;t sticky, it smells great, and it is long lasting.  After running a few miles, or even chasing after the kids, I still smell great.  With my solid, I would have been stinky halfway through my run.  This will not be my deodorant of choice.  It does have a strong fragrance, so if you aren&#x27;t huge into scents or are bothered my perfume flower scents, then this product may not be for you.  Personally, I think it smells great!</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free from Bzzagent. I was definitely disappointed in the size of container sent. I was expecting a regular, full-size deodorant. Aside from that, I think the product is wonderful. It has a clean, just showered kind of smell to it which is very invigorating. I&#x27;m normally a solid deodorant kind of girl, but after using this product I may just need to switch to gel. It wasn&#x27;t messy like I had anticipated it to be. It applied very smoothly and clean, no mess. It&#x27;s been in the upper 80&#x27;s here lately and very humid so needless to say, I&#x27;ve been worried about sweating. This deodorant kept me dry and smelling nice all day long. And the best part.....no white marks!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel works great! One of my friends questioned the gel doubting that it would work for 48 hours.  I told her it was a gem and worked great.  The only negative thing I could say was that it went on wet and it was cold.  On the other hand, it dried super fast and didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing.  When I first opened it, I was glad to see that it was sealed and sanitary.  After a few spins and clicks it was ready to use!  Give it a whirl and you won&#x27;t be sorry!  I got this product to review for free and the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Secret through BzzAgent to test their new Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant. In my eyes, there are some pros and cons but overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product and in the summer months I may convert from my usual invisible solid deodorant to this new product. I can&#x27;t express enough how awesome it is to NOT have white marks on my clothes. Almost everyday I am wiping those annoying streaks from my tank tops or shirts with my typical invisible solid. With Secret&#x27;s new gel deodorant you do not have this problem as well as not having those disgusting clumps of white deodorant in your pits. Also the scent is really fresh and nice smelling. Even after working out I still had a clean and fresh smell. Before trying this product I was somewhat against the gel deodorant bc I am not a fan the feeling of having wet pits after application. As for the cons of the product, in my opinion it took longer than a few seconds to completely dry. I also had to reapply before 24 hrs, let alone their 48 hour wetness and odor protection guarantee, on one of the days I tested the product. But I do that with my invisible solid deodorant right now so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. For me, the fact there is no white marks or clumps trumps all my cons I stated. Definitely worth it to test it for yourself!</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like it the gels they break me out!!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Secret&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to try a FREE Secret Outlast clear deodorant gel. I have to say I loved it, is the first deodorant gel that I like and I definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> I did not enjoy this product.  It takes forever to dry after applying.  This even left a stain on my clothes.  I must say it did smell great.</li>
    <li> I got to tryan Secret Outlast Completely Clean free through BzzAgent. It came with a free stick of deodorant to try. I think this product definitely delivers what it says it does- long lasting protection, keeps you dry and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks or streaks. I love that this clear gel formula absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a layer of product under your arms. Unlike most deodrant I&#x27;ve never felt an invisible type of protection from the deodorant and another drawback has also been the marks you get on your skin when the deodorant starts to dryad clump and gets on your clothes. I didn&#x27;t expect to like this deodorant since it is a gel formula but I love it and love that it feels like I am not using a deodorant at all. I definitely plan to switch from powder to gel formula.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all, but maybe not worth switching brands for. I received this to try for free as a BzzAgent campaign, and while I normally use a different variety of Secret, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I was impressed that it is not sticky, as I don&#x27;t usually wear a gel deodorant, and the scent is light and just fresh, not perfumey. I didn&#x27;t find it worked any better than my regular deodorant though. One of the biggest features they proclaim is &amp;#34;no white marks&amp;#34;, but I didn&#x27;t have much opportunity to test that theory as I have to wear white for work every day. It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for something new, but I didn&#x27;t experience anything so revolutionary as to change brands/types.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free with my bzzagent and I am impressed! It keeps me smelling fresh all day. I would love to see this in a clinical protection kind of option as I do sweat a bit more than the average girl. Even with that said, I would still buy this. The gel formula doesn&#x27;t cake onto my clothes making the odor stick to my shirts. Its fast drying and feels nice! I would recommend this deodorant to all of you.</li>
    <li> I really love this Secret Outlast ! It gave me the best protection ever! I got it free to try from #bzzagent and can&#x27;t wait to get my full size one!!</li>
    <li> I received the deodorant for free from a bzzagent campaign. I used it on a 5 hour motorcycle ride in 90+ degree weather and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with how well it held up! It goes on smooth and dries quickly, it did not leave any white residue on my black tank top i was wearing which is a major plus!! The scent was the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars! it is a fresh powdery scent which is fine, but i much prefer fruity or floral scents to the powder scent. Other than that there is nothing i could possibly complain about! I will definitely purchase this deodorant in the future. As for my daily use of the product, i was very pleased with that as well! after 10 hours at work, i can come home and still feel fresh and dry!</li>
    <li> In general I really like Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant. I have had no issues with white marks or residue since using it. It is nice to have that kind of confidence in a product as you are rushing to get ready in the morning with a husband, a toddler and 3 dogs. The Completely Clean scent is refreshing - not too floral-y or prefume-y. While Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant seems to provide good odor and wetness protection for the whole day, I&#x27;m hesitant to say that it provides 48-hour protection. I definitely noticed the need to reapply on one particularly busy day chasing around my daughter. So in that way, it is average in the length of time it provides protection of any deodorant I have tried but, after trying it free this time, I would actually purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I received this Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant free through Bzz Agent. I have tried gel antiperspirant&#x27;s before and I&#x27;ll be honest I never really liked them.Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I didn&#x27;t really seem to have that problem! Which was great! You have to let it dry for only a few seconds before you are good to go! And the best part? No white marks are on my shirt at the end of the day! The Lavender scent is great too, because it&#x27;s not overpowering but it makes for a very nice scent as well. Never needed to reapply :-) .Secret products are fantastic. They work great and are a great price. I found the outlast gel to do as promised- no white marks and great scent.</li>
    <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and got the product for free from Secret to try. I really am glad I got it. I have used several different deodorants and non seemed to work that well. I figured it was because I live in gulf coast Texas and it is always hot and humid. Well I was greatly surprised. The first day I wore it only under one arm and the other arm I used the deodorant I had been using. When I got home from work I was shocked. The product I normally use was hot and sweaty and the Secret Outlast was completely dry. I was so thrilled and excited. The only negative I have is after a few days of wearing it regularly I have broken out in a rash. I still recommend it to everyone because I do have sensitive skin but that is me. I will still wear it for special occasions. I just can&#x27;t wear it every day apparently.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and was totally surprised. Secret Outlast Clear Gel is perfect for 48-hour protection and goes on clear which means no white marks! I spent the day at Six Flags and used this deodorant and was totally shocked about how well it worked. It was super hot that day and plus I had been at the water park. It was the perfect set up to stink! Haha. I smelled pretty dang good by the end of the day! This is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this from the company. I was really skeptical - I usually hate the way gels feel, plus I&#x27;m a really sweaty person (gross, I know). Right not my town is in the middle of an unusually sweltering summer, and I have no A/C. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my pleasant surprise, this stuff lives up to the advertising. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks. Every morning I wake up with my entire body damp with sweat - except my armpits. I&#x27;ll put this on first thing in the morning after a shower, and when I wake up the next day it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ve used prescription strength products in the past, and they don&#x27;t always work that well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the way the gel feels on my skin. It absorbs pretty quickly so there&#x27;s none of that greasy feeling you get when you swipe on a thick layer of solid deodorant. It&#x27;s super easy to control how much you use too, since you click it up rather than wiping a bar directly on your skin. I think I use a lot less of this than I use with solids. Better yet - no white marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the smell. I got the completely clean scent, and it&#x27;s clean and refreshing but not overpowering. If I had to describe it, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s kind of like those &amp;#34;linen&amp;#34; scented room sprays, with maybe just a hint of citrus. It smells really nice going on but once it&#x27;s on I don&#x27;t notice it competing with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different deodorants, and I&#x27;ve been loyal to a certain brand for a couple years now. But I think this takes the cake. WHen my sample runs out, I&#x27;m going to buy another stick of this.</li>
    <li> I received this from Bzzagent to sample for free and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  I sweat A LOT, and we are having a heat wave in Washington, so I thought I was doomed to spend the summer with sweat marks, always checking to make sure I smelled ok.  I was so skeptical that any deodorant, let alone a gel, could keep my dry.  I had bad memories of putting on gel deodorant when I was younger, the kind that never dried and just never worked.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I put this product on and it dried almost immediately.  No matter what I did in the intense heat (walking, playing with my son, working out, etc...), I was dry and had no body odor.  It has a nice, pleasant smell to top everything off.  I am a convert and will switch my current brand of deodorant with Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret and Bzzagent.com I got to try a product I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy. Back in High School I used to only use clear gel and it was terrible, I had stains on all my clothes and it never lasted throughout, so once I moved to invisible solids I stuck with it. After trying Outlast Completely Clear it made me a believer again! No stains and it last all day long. I&#x27;m very happy I got to try this one and give it a chance. Guaranteed, if you try it you too will become a believer in gels again!</li>
    <li> I have used many deodorants over the years, but I have usually stuck with an invisible solid type because the gel deodorants were so cold and messy feeling. Needless to say, when the opportunity arose for me to sample this product for free through Bzzagent, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give it another try. I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with this brands gel deodorant! It is not sticky or messy, it is clear and really gives long lasting protection. I was so impressed that I shared all about it with my Zumba Fitness classmates.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Bzzagent for the opportunity to try this product, and to Secret for making the product so great! I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of unscented deodorant, but when I got the opportunity to test out Secret&#x27;s Outlast Clean Gel for free, I decided to give it a try again. I really like that the protection last thoughtout the whole day. Being a mom of two young children I am always running. And doing so in the very HOT Florida sun you need a good,  long lasting deodorant! This issue great one.  This is going to be my new favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Secret Outlast Invisible Solid deodorant user for quite a few years so when I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel* (for free, thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent), I was a little hesitant.  It had taken me so long to find the absolute right deodorant that worked consistently for me.  But, in the spirit of trying new things, I gave it a shot.  My biggest issue with clear gels previously has been dry time.  They always seemed to take forever to dry and I often felt &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and I hated putting clothes on when my underarms felt that way.  After my first application of the Secret Outlast Clear Gel (just 2 clicks!), I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the gel dried!  I didn&#x27;t have to wave my hands underneath my armpits to speed the drying process along at all!  I was able to apply and get dressed immediately.  I was also impressed with the scent (I was sent the Completely Clean scent)...it wasn&#x27;t too strong.  I can&#x27;t stand a deodorant that&#x27;s extra strong all day long.  While I don&#x27;t want to smell like B.O., I also don&#x27;t want to have a strong deodorant smell about me, either.  The next issue I&#x27;ve always had with clear gels is that they seemed to not work for me long term.  By the end of the day, I would be extra sweaty and a little stinky.  I am a baker and own a bakery, so I am around hot ovens every day.  Along with the heat, humidity is pretty high, so staying dry and odor free throughout the day is very important to me.  The day I first tried the Clear Gel, it was a very full, busy and extremely hot day in the bakery.  As I finished up for the day, I noticed that not only was a odor-free but I was actually drier than even the Invisible Solid left me after a nasty day in the bakery!  Overall, I was incredible impressed with the Clear Gel and because it seems to protect me better than my current Invisible Solid, I will be converting to this different formula!  I will probably try the Protecting Powder scent (my go-to scent) butit will definitely be the Clear Gel formula next time I buy deodorant!  *I received a complimentary sample size of Secret Outlast Clear Gel for testing and review purposes.  All opinions of the product in the review are my own and was not compensated for them.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent and Secret.  I was skeptical because I am not a huge fan of clear deodorants.  I did not like the way it felt after applying.  It feels wet.  However, after it dried, it does offer great protection and smells great.  I did like that it does not leave a residue on clothes.  I would recommend this others.</li>
    <li> Great &amp; reliable product as always with Secret! Lasted all day and kept me wet free even in 90 degree weather! So glad I got to try it free courtesy BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> When I first go the Secret Outlast I was immediately  turned off by the smell of it. Not sure if there are other scent options but this one is not very appealing.  That being said the deodorant worked great. I am a mom of 5 kids and am always  on the go. The deodorant  worked great! I even took a trip to an amusement park on a super hot day and felt completely  protected. I would have given 5 starts if I would have liked the scent of it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I received a free sample to try from BzzAgent thanks to Secret. What better place to try out the effectiveness of a deodorant than while on vacation at the beach! I have never been a fan of gel deodorant because I&#x27;m trying to avoid wet, sticky underarms but was pleasantly surprised with Secret Outlast Gel Deodorant. It dried quickly and didn&#x27;t make my underarms feel sticky. I am a repeat offender of ending up with the pesky white marks from some of my deodorant and was very pleased of not having to worry about that with this deodorant. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it kept the white marks away and kept me dry for the duration of the day but to say that it has 48-hour protection is a bit of a stretch, at least it was for me.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;-Dries quickly, leaving nice satin-y feel&lt;br /&gt;-No white marks or other stains (But only time will tell, ey?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Though it works great as a deodorant, it fails miserably as an antiperspirant. Granted, I&#x27;m not a very smelly person AAAAND nothing has ever worked for me including &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; products so my experience is probably atypical (I probably have hyperhidrosis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the hunt continues, but I do like this product enough to continue using it in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got a free sample of this from Secret through BzzAgent. Bzz Bzzz.</li>
    <li> The summer is hot and this product is pretty good smelling.  I am not a huge fan of gel deodorants, but it&#x27;s fast drying and works to an epic 48 hours.  That&#x27;s a pretty great deal!  A summer day and night never has to end with that protection!  I got this product free from BzzAgent to try and give my honest opinion.  I like, but I&#x27;ll stick with white solid</li>
    <li> Love Secret Outlast Gel deodorant! 48 hr clear protection against wetness and fights odor with a clean smelling fragrance! Very pleased with this product and how well it works. I am currently testing out this product for free thabks to Secret.!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free as part of a promotion through bzzagent. I absolutely love this deodorant. The completely clean scent smells wonderful, the 48 hour protection is REAL. I have to vouch for that because I have worn it for 3 days and have sweated profusely over those 3 days (gross, I know) but this product truly withheld it&#x27;s own and aced my test. It dries quickly for me and truly leaves no white marks because of the gel. The gel is not sticky and the feeling of the product goes away after a few seconds of drying and you wouldn&#x27;t even know you put it on. When you sweat, I felt that this deodorant didn&#x27;t become &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; or anything, it just did its job, again, without me noticing besides me not smelling bad. It&#x27;s really a great product and especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I am really picky about my deoderant! I will only use the clear gel. The Secret Outlast® Clear Gel does a great job at controlling sweat and odor. I love the fresh scent that it has. The clear gel formula means no unsightly deoderant marks! I am a happy camper, and so are those that have to be around me hahaha!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Secret and BzzAgent for sending me a free sample of this product!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean has provided a pleasant surprise. I have tried gel antiperspirants in the past, and was a bit put off by the wet, cold, gooey feeling that usually lasts for a while after applying. Secret has perfected the quick drying clear gel. This product goes on smoothly, and dries really quickly. Within seconds on applying, this stuff is dry and ready to provide protection from wetness and odor for around 48 hours. This stuff really works. In the beginning the smell is a bit strong, hence only four stars. After a while of wear the scent softens and becomes quite pleasant. Considering this is the only complaint I have, I am really impressed with this product. Thanks to BzzAgent and Secret for giving me the opportunity to try it for free.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product thanks to Secret, but all opinions are my own based on my personal use of the product.  I&#x27;m a sweater.  I don&#x27;t know why, I just am.  Always have been.  So I was excited to try out the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant.  It has been extremely hot where I live (high 90&#x27;s), so I thought it was perfect timing to try this out.  There aren&#x27;t many deodorant&#x27;s that I&#x27;m impressed with.  Most deodorant&#x27;s may stop me from smelling, but only for part of the day.  The first day that I wore this, it was extremely hot outside, and at the end of the day, I was sitting on the couch and I smelled really good, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was smelling so good on me.  I didn&#x27;t have on perfume or lotion or anything, so I kept sniffing around.  It was the Secret deodorant!!  It didn&#x27;t smell okay, it actually smelled great at the end of the day!  I smelled pleasant.  That was a pleasant surprise to me.  Also, it is very long lasting.  I know that it has 48 hour protection, but I&#x27;m not sure if that lasts through bathing or showering.  I haven&#x27;t been brave enough not to put on deodorant the next day as well, so I still use daily (every 24 hours).  Overall, I would definitely recommend this deodorant.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of new Secret Outlast clear gel in the &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent courtesy of a BzzAgent campaign.  It claims to have up to 48 hour protection, dry super fast, and not leave any white marks on clothes.  Pretty much the same as every other deodorant/antiperspirant that is on the market, so I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations.  I have been using Degree Motion Sense for quite a while now which pretty much claims the same thing but lets me down in a couple of those areas.  I actually put this product to the test by accident! Lol.  Here&#x27;s how:  So I shower the other night, and I put my deodorant/antiperspirant like I always do, only this time I put the Secret Outlast on.  First off, it smells awesome!  So clean and pretty without smelling fruity or sweet or flowery...just clean.  Secondly, I accidentally turned it too far, so a ton of it came out of the top, and I was NOT going to waste my free sample, so I put the drying factor to the test.  And the answer is yes.  It dries really, really fast.  It doesn&#x27;t leave that  moist wet sticky feeling by the time you put your arms down which is why I usually stick to invisible solid instead of gel.  Now on to the 48 hour protection and the accidental test I mentioned earlier.  I went to bed wearing my new Secret Outlast.  I woke up the next morning, late of course, so I threw my clothes on and threw all three of my kids together and managed to brush my teeth on the way out the door.  After already dropping two kids off, it hit me.  I forgot to put deodorant on before I left the house.  Crap!  No time.  I&#x27;m already running late, and weather says it&#x27;s going to be 101-103 with 100% humidity factor, but the good old heat index will make it feel like 105-107!  That&#x27;s just great.  Of all the days to forget the deo!! I have work to do and a ton of errands in and out of the car and different buildings.  I&#x27;m gonna smell like a gym by less than halfway through the day.  Needless to say, I was so shocked and truly impressed when I realized about halfway through the day that I hadn&#x27;t really sweat at all (under my arms that is).  After I took notice, I started really paying attention.  I swear I did not sweat under my arms for the entire day, and I had virtually no odor when I did the sniff check at the end of the day!  I&#x27;m not planning on putting it to the 48 hour test; that&#x27;s just asking a little too much in the East Texas 100 % humidity factor, 103 degrees dog days of summer!  If you&#x27;ve never been through a deep Southeast Texas summer, it&#x27;s like a fever--a fever that spikes just before it breaks.  And we&#x27;re not even at the spike yet!  SoI can certainly vouch for staying dry and neutral for 24 hours, which is more than I can say for my other brand that doesn&#x27;t even compare.  I&#x27;m wondering if I can just put Secret Outlast all over my freaking body and maybe I won&#x27;t sweat so bad in this fever we call summer. Lol.  Pretty average pricing too, so affordable at the same time as effective.  Only one negative, and I don&#x27;t really see it as a negative, because EVERY other deodorant/antiperspirant does the same:  it left some white smudges on my black night shirt.  I still give it five stars, and I like it so much that I went and bought myself two bottles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant that BzzAgent sent me for free to try. It glides on clear, dries clear, and has an amazingly clean smell that doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day. My underarms stay fresh the whole day without any worry! I am definitely making the switch from my old deodorant to Secret Outlast Gel in Completely Clean.</li>
    <li> My mother lives in Puerto Rico so every now and then I give her a ring and she ask me about the latest products since she knows am a blogger. We recently spoke about Secret Outlast Xtend with 48-hour odor protection. I gave her my honest opinion and also told her this was a product I received free for testing and review purposes threw bzzagent.com. I told her that I honestly had mixed emotions on this product for quite a few reasons. One being that although it smelled great in my case it did not last 48 hours, as a matter of fact it did not even last me 24 hours. I am not really an active person but I still workout and move around about my day to do things and honestly within a few hours the scent was gone and another not so pleasant smell would come out. I honestly felt like I sweated more in my pits and reeked a more! Every ones body is different and reacts different to different products so i will not fully knock it. I told my mother that the smell was very nice, it applied easy and for the most part did keep me fresh for a little while, but as mentioned did need to be applied often in my case. My mother was still very interested and mentioned she may pick one up and keep me updated on how it worked out for her. #epic48 #GotItFree 48-hour protection goes on dry  no white marks that is what I am talking about! lol I am loving this I can go about my day worry free no streaks marks and or unwanted smelly moments! Loving my secret Outlast.</li>
    <li> i have tried many different deodrants over the years. i recently recieved this one complimentary through bzzagent for testing and reviewing purpose. i love how this outlasts many others. i would highly recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Secret. I&#x27;m glad it was free, because I wasn&#x27;t especially impressed. Clear gel has never really been my thing, and this was no exception. The clear gel took too long to dry, I definitely don&#x27;t like standing around with my arms out like a chicken waiting for my armpits to dry in the morning while I&#x27;m getting ready for work! In terms of protection, it worked like a charm. It kept me stink-free for most of the day, but perhaps by the time I got home from work, in the hot Texas summer, it was definitely time for a shower. This works great for everyday use, but don&#x27;t go thinking it&#x27;ll take you through your workout! Even though it had a nice scent and worked relatively well at keeping my dry during my work day, it wasn&#x27;t AMAZING and I didn&#x27;t like the formulation. If you&#x27;re into clear gel, give this a try, but if you&#x27;re more of an invisible solid gal like me, stick with what you love!</li>
    <li> Recently, I took a trip to Las Vegas and decided to give my new deodorant a try after receiving an invite from Secret to review a sample.   I&#x27;m used to sticking to a solid white deodorant but thought I would try this new Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant sample. Upon receiving my sample, I noticed that it took quite a few twists to crank out some clear gel. It was applied smoothly and dried rather quickly. Putting on my little black dress for my anniversary was the ultimate test for this deodorant as my normal deodorant usually marks up my nice clothes. After a night of walking, dancing, gambling, and general shenanigans, I looked to my pits to notice... dun dun dun.... NO WET, WHITE MESS! I was impressed. Not only did this deodorant smell decent, but it does what it says it should. There were no marks on my little black dress at the end of the night. I did, however, continue to sweat but I do sweat a lot. Now, I didn&#x27;t give it the 48 hour protection test because I like my showers, but it worked well for 12 hours. I will surely be using this deodorant to keep my clothes dry and free of stains in the future! Bring on the next Vegas trip!</li>
    <li> love this product drys quick and keeps fresh allday no matter what the tempature ! It did not irritate my skin at all ,left my shirt stain free ! would recomend to anyone want to stay fresh and dry! I tried this product for thanks to Secret but the opions are my own</li>
    <li> Used this deodorant while on vacation in the mountains of Colorado. I used it when I went hiking at Pike&#x27;s Peak and it really held up. It didn&#x27;t put white marks on my shirt when I went to dinner the next night with my husband, which was a big plus. Thanks to Secret, I got to try this product out for free and I really like it.</li>
    <li> I work as a cook at a restaurant, and sometimes the back room reaches about one hundred degrees. Add to that all the running around I do, and you can imagine how much I sweat back there. I have tried pretty much every deodorant out there and still haven&#x27;t found one that works the way I want it to. Until I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I received it to try for free from BzzAgent, and I loved it.  This is, hands down, the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. It does everything I need it to. It lasts through twelve hour shifts. It dries quickly after putting it on. I usually prefer solid deodorant, because I hate feeling wet under my arms, but it dries so fast that it&#x27;s a non issue. There is no residue or stains.  I smell fresh and clean all day. I couldn&#x27;t think of a better test to put this deodorant to than a long, sweaty shift at work, and it passed every test. With flying colors!</li>
    <li> So, I went into this knowing I had sensitive skin but willing to try something new as I have used similar products before. Man do I regret that. I think I  have chemical burns under my arms and the fragrance is haunting my nostrils. Within seconds of my first application my underarms started to burn, which I thought would pass...but it didn&#x27;t. I ended up running into my bathroom to take a shower to remove the, as promised, already dry &amp;#34;fast drying&amp;#34; gel. That part they didn&#x27;t lie about, I think this stuff dried in seconds and merged with the cells in my armpits! I ended up washing under my arms several times with soothing body wash until at least the immediate burn was gone. However, even after 3 washes I still reeked of the fragrance of this deodorant. While I am pretty sure I removed all of the actual product it seemed to have tattooed me with its smell, even lingering into the next day....which I guess was the one part of this product that really did &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; my expectations. I am not sure if it is just my sensitive skin that caused the painful reaction or if this product works by scarring your sweat glands so badly you cannot sweat anymore, but either way I am not into that sorta &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34; mentality so this is a giant NO for me. The fragrance however was nice, just really overpowering and didn&#x27;t go away. No way could I have worn my own perfume with this without a major clashing of smells. Secret really needs to make their products gentler and pull back a little on the &amp;#34;french shower&amp;#34; methodology of odor control...smelling like perfume with an undertone of B.O is still smelling like B.O, so really no need for that level of fragrance! I did receive this item for free from Secret to review, but all opinions are my own honest opinions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel type of deodarents, and so I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with it. I also didn&#x27;t like the way it made my pits feel.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free promo/test from Secret and BzzAgent and was eager to try it, albeit a little skeptical to put goo on rather than a standard solid deordorant. I found that it died quickly, smells great and I remained fresh throughout the day, longer than my usual deordorant, but definitely not the 48hrs it claims. I did wear it with black and had no issues with streaks or white marks.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I recently had the opportunity to test this Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free from Secret. I was excited about the chance to try out this product because I have been using solid deodorant for years and I wanted to see how a gel deodorant compared. After a few weeks of using this product, I can say that I am loving it! First of all, the product applies very easily and dries in seconds. One of my initial hesitations about using a gel deodorant was that the product would feel gooey and uncomfortable after being applied under my arms, but that is absolutely not a problem here. The gel dries quickly, and I love the scent as well! I can smell the scent throughout the day, and it is just right - not too strong of a scent. The product also goes on clear and leaves no white marks. I wear a lot of dark-colored shirts, and it has always annoyed me when my shirts end up with white streaks under the arm area, so the gel deodorant has a definite advantage there.  As I stated earlier, the deodorant has a very pleasant scent, which masks any odor throughout my day. It also keeps my underarms dry. I can&#x27;t speak for the lasting for forty-eight hours claim, as I don&#x27;t keep on the product that long, but it has kept me dry during my entire workday (about twelve hours long from start to finish of my day) with no noticeable dampness under my arms. These last few weeks have been extremely hot and humid, and even after my daily walks, I remained dry, which was a pleasant surprise. In the past, when using my usual solid deodorant, I would be a little damp under my arms after my walks, but not with this Secret gel deodorant. Needless to say, I am very happy with this product so far, as it leaves no white marks on my clothes and leaves me feeling dry and smelling fresh throughout my day. Next time I am out of deodorant, I will be picking up Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant!</li>
    <li> I got to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free thanks to Secret and BzzAgent.  I usually go with invisible solid and I haven&#x27;t used clear gel in a while because of the sticky feeling you usually get while it dries.  That was no problem with this one since it dries within seconds.  It&#x27;&#x27;s great for people like me who wear a lot of dark shirts since you don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks.  I have only tried it for everyday activities and the protection it provides is as good as any other product out there.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it does have a strong scent.  I usually go with more subtle scents because strong ones give me headaches.  But I did notice an uncented option that I would definitely try.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a deodorant that lasted all day, smelled great, and didn&#x27;t make a mess of my clothes. I&#x27;ve purchased at least six different types over the past few months. I was thrilled to get a chance to try this one from BzzAgent. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much since I have had no luck lately. This one really worked for me. I don&#x27;t have to re-apply before bed like I had with all of the other brands, it was still working! It does not make any stains or leave any residue in my clothing either. I can&#x27;t say it would work for a full 48 hours as I never go more than 24 without a shower. I have very sensitive skin and it did sting a tiny bit for about 5 seconds, the first two days I used it but that was it. I use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t sting a bit. I am really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I normally stay away from scented deodorant but this won me over.  It has a clean pleasant scent which isn&#x27;t overpowering. And it works! It kept me dry all day and no white marks on my clothes. I received a free sample from Secret and Bzzagent but will be buying this product from now on instead of my old brand.</li>
    <li> Boy was I excited to try this product through a bzzagent campaign.  I suffer from underarm odor and struggle to find something that actually works (beyond a couple hours).  I even don&#x27;t care about the white streaks (which is saying something because my wardrobe is typically black) as long as it works.  So, first day - success!  it lasted until the wee hours of the evening.  Yay.&lt;br /&gt;Although the first day was a success, the following days not so great.  Its still better than most other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;m still looking.  Clear gel means no white streaks - which is an added benefit.</li>
    <li> Normally I stay away from gel antiperspirants because they never seem to lose that sticky feeling.  I tried the Secret Outlast in the Completely Clean scent and was pleasantly surprised that within a few minutes it had dried completely and was not sticky at all. I was dry and comfortable throughout the day both indoors and outdoors and even through my evening workout.  The scent was pleasant and not over-powering.  The best part was I did not have to worry about white marks on my clothing as it is completely clear.</li>
    <li> I Love this product it keeps me very dry, No white marks at all and the odor control is Amazing I got to try this free from Secret and bzzfeed I will most definitely keep buying this and using it I haven&#x27;t had any luck with any other brands so this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> thanks to bzz agent I Finally found a deoderant that doesnt leave white marks on my dark clothes and doesnt discolor my colored bra&#x27;s. Goes on easy and lasts all day with no additional applications, smells great and offers protection as good as other \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; otc antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> So this is clearly an upgrade from the Secret I used to try.  I used to use this back in high school and found that it just didn&#x27;t keep me dry enough. I was able to sample this as part of a promotion and I was skeptical. I&#x27;m a heavy sweater, so it worked, but it didn&#x27;t keep me as dry as I would have liked. Would be really good for a day you know you won&#x27;t really be doing too much activity. Overall, it&#x27;s okay, but I need more of a heavy hitter.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel was provided to me as part of a promotion being done by Secret through Bzzagent. I was worried at first with it being cold and wet. I have been using it now for over a week and I love it. It dries quickly and has a very nice light scent. The best part is there are absolutely no white marks left behind on you clothes!</li>
    <li> I have used the solid for years but I really liked the way the gel went on and dried very quickly.  I was also happy with wearing a dark shirt and not finding white marks anymore.</li>
    <li> I received this free as a test for BzzAgent. So far I love it. It keeps me dry and smells nice. It glides on pretty easy but I sometimes forget that it&#x27;s gel and tend to use too much. One click of the dial is all you need so I find myself going through it quickly. The other downside is that when you first put it on its a little sticky and that last for a bit but by the end of the day it feels fine. You really only need to apply every 48 hours but I am not bold enough to try that yet. I would definitely consider buying this once this &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; is used up. I might try one of the other two fragrances to see how those are as well.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a promotion from the Company.  When I first saw it, I was a bit skeptical seeing as how I have been using invisible solids for several years.  In the past, when I would try to use a clear gel, it had the smell of pure rubbing alcohol and burned the skin under my arms if I had shaved beforehand in the shower.  This has a very pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t burn.  Also, with other clear gel antiperspirants, I would apply it and walk around flapping my wings like a little baby bird learning how to fly.  This product does go on a little wet, but it dries a lot faster than the others I have tried.  I would say it takes about 30 seconds or so to fully dry, but I have noticed that I stay dry and refreshed feeling.  I found a new favorite!</li>
    <li> Went on clear and stays that way, smells great, lasts all day. It held up to a busy day of running errands in the 85 degree Georgia heat!</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a promotion to try the product for free.  I would say it does an amazing job of preventing odors.  I sweated a lot, and while it did not keep me dry, there was no odor.  There also wasn&#x27;t any white marks, but I have yet to find a clear gel that leaves white marks.  I can&#x27;t really comment about the 48 hour protection claim, as I haven&#x27;t gone that long without bathing and reapplying deodorant.</li>
    <li> I was giving a full size sample of this product to try for free as part of a promotion from the brand. and I am very impressed with it. It does give all day long protection from odor and wetness. I work at a dry cleaners where it is always hot and humid in the building and this product held up well.  I will caution that when they say use \\&quot;1 click\\&quot; it truly is enough. If you use too much (like I did the first day) you will be left feeling very wet and sticky in the armpit. It is nice not to see white streaks on my clothes or the little white balls clinging that are visible if wearing a blouse or shirt without sleeves.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel Antiperspirant. I especially love that it dries fast &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes! It keeps me dry and comfy until my next shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this deodorant as part of a product promotion campaign and am a big fan of it!  It is strong, with a nice scent and it works like a charm.  No stains on my clothing and better yet, no sweating.  Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> OK, but not perfect. I tend to use clinical strength antiperspirant. This particular product lasted about 1/2 of the day-until about 3:00. I tended to be more wet at that time. I like that it was clear and didn&#x27;t show up on my clothes. I liked that it was cool when applied. I liked the smell as well. For those that are not very active, or only need protection for 8 hours, you would be good.</li>
    <li> I received a free full size sample of this product because I am a Bzzagent on the word of mouth website, www.bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part I really liked not having to worry about white marks on my dark tops and dresses. It does take some time to get used to the gel, and learning to work &amp;#34;drying time&amp;#34; into my morning. Great for work days but not as good as solids for workout days. For dressing up nights and work I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Deodorant through a bzzcampaign for free. I was excited to get to try a deodorant that offered 48 hour protection, instant drying, no white lines on clothes, and a fresh scent. It really lived up to it&#x27;s expectations. I hate white marks deodorant leaves on clothes, and this did not leave any marks. I don&#x27;t think it dried instantly like it says but it was reasonably quick, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to put more on after working out or at any point throughout the day. The gel does seem to disappear a lot faster than the solid deodorants though. Great buy though, especially if you hate white marks on clothes as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I usually use an invisible solid but was given a free sample to try out &amp; to review. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product. The gel applies wet &amp; thick but takes less than a minute to dry. I really like the scent, its fresh but not its too obvious I&#x27;m wearing it because its not overpowering &amp; doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume. It&#x27;s also quite long lasting and i don&#x27;t need to reapply it.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about trying a gel deodorant. Thinking it would leave my underarm wet. My underarm usually sweats. I was using my regular deodorant one day and my underarm was sweating really bad. So I said let me try the Secret Outlast. My underarm dried once I put the deodorant on. I went on to try the deodorant the next day. The deodorant worked well. I will be using Secret Outlast from now on. If you are looking for a deodorant that will keep you dry all day. Then give Secret Outlast a try. #secretoutlast #secret #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Wow. I mean, just...wow. I am so impressed and amazed by this product! Secret Outlast, you have stolen my heart and my wallet! I will never again turn to those cheap, subpar, horrifying chalky sticks again! I have been living in a cage, fearful of wearing dark colors to avoid those dreaded white streaks darting from your pits to your hips! But no longer! No longer am I slave to light colored shirts! This deodorant not only eliminates those horrifyingly embarrassing marks, but it also works. And works. And works. And I mean even after those dripping with sweat, panting and begging for mercy workouts. The kind where you are positive even your dog would turn their nose up at your stink afterwards. But Secret Outlast kept me completely dry, odor-free and oh-so-happy! I can make it through the day without lifting for a sniff and never have to worry about fanning myself before dressing. It&#x27;s almost insta-dry! Perfect for my on-the-go, work-fulltime, never-know-when-I-get-to-shower Mommy lifestyle! #gotitfree #bzzagentrocks</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel for free as a promotion from bzzagent.  I am not normally one to wear gel deodorant as I had preconceived thoughts that it might be gooey or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am glad that I received this free product to try.  The secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear gel works and feels great!  It dries quickly after application and smells fresh.  The dryness lasts as advertised (although I have not tried to go 48 hours hours without showering.....I may be brave enough to try that some camping weekend) and it does stay completely clear.  I have had no white residue rub off on my clothing like I do with my regularly used solids.  I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I was impressed with how quickly the gel dried and how well the product worked. No white streaks, no odor, no wetness-as promised. Officially switching brands!</li>
    <li> I got this product from BzzAgent &amp; must say that I&#x27;m now addicted! This stuff is great! It leaves no white marks on your clothes and lasts a really long time. Even if you somehow forget to put it on one day, you&#x27;re still covered since it lasts 48 hours. This gel is not wet &amp; slimy like so many in the past. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I usually like  invisible solid. I had the chance to try this out for free through bzzagent. I was so excited to try it out. The last time I used a Clear Gel I found it to be sticky and it would sting after you shaved so I did not have very high hopes for this deodorant. I was so wrong I loved it It lasts all day I do not have to reapply it. It is not sticky and it does not sting after I shave I for sure will be buying this again. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally buy or ENJOY gel deodorants but this one was a huge surprise.  I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Secret Platinum and for some reason it just stopped working for me.  I was so excited to get to try this Secret Outlast for free through bzzagent.  I actually LOVE it.  It keeps me smelling great and dryer than other antiperspirants.  This stuff even works in the sweltering heat of Mexico so I have tested it to its limits !! :)  Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I got this free of charge as part of the current BzzAgent campaign, and didn&#x27;t think much of it at first, but it ended up being an unexpectedly great deodorant. If you&#x27;re like me and only wear black clothing, this is the deodorant for you. It does not leave white marks, and the smell will not overpower your perfume. It is the best deodorant I have used in a while, and actually keeps you dry throughout the whole day, even if you have long 12 hour days and are running around.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant is perfect if you don&#x27;t mind deodorizing before dressing! I am not a fan of doing so. I have always gotten dressed and then put on deodorant. This, however, because it requires a few seconds to dry, I have to apply it before I get dressed and I&#x27; just not fond of that. I did try it courtesy of BzzAgent, though, and it does have 48 hours odor protection and it does NOT leave white marks whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Same Odor and Wetness Protection you can count on from Secret but includes the Fast Drying, Clean and Clear application that is head and shoulders (or armpits) above others.</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Outlast for 10 days now and I can say that it does give me all day and into the night protection. I don&#x27;t worry about rolling over and throwing my arm up in bed anymore. Secret Outlast has that covered. The only drawback for me is that it goes on so wet. But honestly, I can deal with a little extra time to dry in the morning if I don&#x27;t have to think about deodorant protection for the rest of the day.I received the free sample andwill now continue to be user long after the freebie is gone!</li>
    <li> Got this for free and I love this product!! Keeps you dry and fresh all day long! Did I mention you don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks?</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.  I have been using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for over two weeks now. I absolutely love it! It really does provide 48 hour protection! The clear gel dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes.  I love the completely clean smell, not overpowering like some deodorants are. Also it did not irritate my skin like some deodorants have. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been testing this deodorant in a variety of situations where staying fresh is very important.  I think I sweat a normal amount and can have body odor when over exerting, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have problems with either.  I normally use stick deodorants because I&#x27;m not a fan of waiting for gels to dry, nor do I enjoy the gel worms that come up from my deodorant if it gets twisted up while in my suitcase/gym bag, but I got the opportunity to try it as part of a BzzCampaign so why not.    I&#x27;ve worn this on a 20+ hour flight, dancing for hours straight at a concert, running, with a fancy dress at a wedding, and even camping and it holds up pretty well.  On an overseas flight where you may not have a opportunity to bathe, it&#x27;s pretty important to smell fresh so you don&#x27;t offend the people sitting next to you, but also to your friends and family who are meeting you at your destination.  I can say that this deodorant did keep me from smelling foul, but it didn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s freshly applied scent the entire time.  The fragrance faded by the end of the trip, but I didn&#x27;t smell anything bad either.  When I wore it to the concert and dancing and worked up a sweat, the deodorant didn&#x27;t keep me bone dry, but it did keep me from stinking under my armpits. When wearing it to the wedding with my little black dress, I was worried that I would eventually see some deodorant on my dress, but I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t.  Sometimes, even the clear gels, do end up with some residue but this one was residue free.  It did take some time to dry after application in my experience, so I did wait until it was dry before I put on my dress so maybe that helped a little.  When I wore it camping, again like the flight, the fragrance did disappear after some time, but I never did seem to smell under there.  If this deodorant kept me bone dry and dried faster upon application, I think I would have given five stars, despite the lack of staying power of the fragrance.  To me, having no smell, isstill better than covering a smell with perfume.</li>
    <li> As much as I try to avoid it, I am often rushed when I get dressed and used to get white marks on my clothes.  That is no longer a problem with Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  I&#x27;m thankful I was introduced to this product by being a BzzAgent.  It goes on clear and stays clear and it works and feels great.  I used to use a solid and although the odor protection was there, I occassionally got white marks and had to scrub the product off each day in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love it! I usually use a solid but when I&#x27;m wearing a tank top or a little black dress I don&#x27;t want to risk white marks all over my clothes.  Stays completely clear. It says it gives 48 hour protection but I haven&#x27;t put it to the test...I&#x27;m not one too skip a day! This dries quickly as well. I was worried about having to wait a while for it to dry before I get dressed but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem. I got this free from BzzAgent and I definitely plan to buy more when it runs out! I like that you can put on just enough of it by twisting up the dial so it seems to last longer, you don&#x27;t wate extra product you don&#x27;t need. I love the fresh scent, not overpowering but smells clean. I would say this is a good value product at a good price, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Oh happy day! A gel that dries pretty quickly! Gel is my preferred method of antiperspirant delivery, but there is always that wait time for the gel to dry. I actually had to change a shirt one time because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough and the gel I was using at the time left big wet looking marks that looked dark even when dry! UGH. So happy to discover a quick drying gel that hasn&#x27;t left a white mark either. The protection is unbeatable, too - ran in a 5K not long after I got this product from Bzz Agent to try and review, and it worked like a champ. Definitely a repeat purchase in my future...</li>
    <li> I love Secret Deodorant as a routine, so trying out Secret Outlast Completely Clean in the gel. The 48 hour promise really piqued my interest. After wearing it for at least 3 weeks (and I still have plenty left) I can say that it does protect, leaves no stain, and I like the gel format. I use a solid regularly so I worried about it drying fast and/or staining my clothes. It didn&#x27;t, so I loved it! Im glad I got this free as a BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would say I like a gel deodorant.  Any I have tried have been icky, sticky, smelly, and streaky.  Can&#x27;t say that with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent.  It smells wonderful, glides on and dries instantly and leaves no marks on my clothes. This is a product that I will continue to use for a long time.</li>
    <li> I usually use secret but never tried this one.  Thanks to BzzAgent and this campaign I had the chance to try it free.  I tried it and I love the fact there is no white marks, and its fast drying!  This product works all day even on the most stressful of days.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have used different deodorants and have found one that I FINALLY LOVE!  Finding the product was sooo easy!  I don&#x27;t like to hunt around to find stuff.  It was easy to take the cap off and use. It went on dry and the 48 hour protection was awesome!!  It is hard to find one that works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are no white marks.  Other deodorants would leave marks on my cloths. Trying to get them clean was so challenging.  Finally found one that actually works is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i got this product from bzzagent I was excited to try it. I have been looking for a new deodorant.  This opportunity to test their product was very good timing!</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant free, as part of a bzz campaign. I was very skeptical because I usually don&#x27;t like gel deodorants, but after using it for a couple of weeks I have decided to switch to Secret completely clean gel. It really works. It dries fast, and leaves no white marks. Most important, it protects me and keeps me dry. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it out, you definitely should.</li>
    <li> I love that secret outlast gel works well for long periods. It smells fresh and leaves no resides (and dries quickly). My problem with it is that it contains aluminum, a known toxin. For that reason I won&#x27;t be using it long term, though it does work very well. I would love to try one that is aluminum free, though! :)</li>
    <li> I was asked to try this deodorant as part of a Buzz campaign, so i recieved it for free. Twenty five years ago, all I used was Secret and it quit working for me so I was very skeptical about trying this new stuff. Two years ago while I was pregnant, it seemed like NO deodorant would work ~ probably a hormonal thing ~ but then I fell in love Degree. It was/is wonderful! And then I tried this new Secret Outlast. Cons: it does take a while to dry, but I speed up the drying process with my blow dryer. Pros: it absolutely works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in years and years. I stay dry, I don&#x27;t start smelling funny toward the end of the day. In fact, it keeps working AT LEAST 48 hours. I never thought I&#x27;d switch from Degree...but I have. Secret Outlast gets 4 stars because it takes a while to dry. If they could fix that, it would be 5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> I will only buy this deodorant from now on!!! It puts other clear gels to shame. It not only goes on smooth, but it dries much quicker than the other brands on the market I have used. I was able to get dressed much quicker instead of waiting for my deodorant to dry. And 8 hours after I had been at work, it was still working. I was very impressed because most gels don&#x27;t last very long at all. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to wear only the best clear gel on the market.</li>
    <li> Got this free to try from a bzz campaign. I love it and intend to get it. It really did hold up for me with no odors, no white marks, and I love in Texas so it is hot right now, and worked truck with this on at my store. I do intend on getting more I was that impressed with it, usually I do not ever change my brands and was really skeptical about doing this as I thought my old deodrant was just fine as it was clinical strength and while I do still like that one, if this one can do what that one does why spend the extra money, I am totally impressed by this one/</li>
    <li> This product works really well. It does go on clear like it says. It does dry fast. I never really liked gel deodorant because it took forever to dry and left residue on my clothes. This definitely does not do that. It is a major plus that this gives me 48 hours protection. I am a busy mother of three and I am always on the go. There have been days where I have completely forgotten to put on deodorant. Using this all this all the time gives me a piece of mind if I ever do forget again. I also like all the different smells. I was able to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free to try out from BzzAgent as a promotion from Secret. So I live in sunny, hot South Florida. And I&#x27;ve tried out this new deodarant a couple of times now. It smells good and dries faster than other gel deodarants I&#x27;ve used. So in these two aspects I like it. However, for me, it does not hold up very well for long periods of time. Just driving around South Florida will get you kind of sweaty, so if I wanted to use this one I&#x27;d have to reapply. Therefore, I would recommend you to try it out, but I likely wouldn&#x27;t buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I was sent a free sample of this product from Secret and have been using it for a few weeks now and I love it! I used to use the powder solid kind but I am really liking the clear gel! It is very refreshing and last all day, just like it says. I will be purchasing this again soon as my sample size its running out! I went on vacation and brought this with me and it lasted all day long, even while sweating it out at the beach. I highly recommend this deodorant to everyone!</li>
    <li> I got Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant as a promotion from BzzAgent.  I would say it eh, probably a 5/10 from me.  I do wish it dried faster because being sticky and slimy isn&#x27;t very conducive to getting ready quickly.  I live in florida and it would probably work better if it wasn&#x27;t so gooey and stuff.  It worked a little better the first few days, but then I think I got more used to it and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I personally love the secret clear gel- I received the product sample from the company through buzzagent.com While I love the product.... I do not love the price. I would never pay that much for deodorant no matter whether it last long and doesn&#x27;t have any white residue. I give this product three stars because the price but personally I think if you really really dont want white residue on your clothing then be my guest and pay the high price.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity as a Bzzagent member to try a free sample of Secret Outlast deodorant thanks to Secret. It kept me clean, fresh and dry all day long. It goes on clear and leaves no residue on my clothes. I have made the switch to Secret Outlast deodorant is my new #1 choice.</li>
    <li> The only brand I use in my household is Secret  so I was excited to try my free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clear from Bzzagent. I&#x27;ve never tried any gel deodorant because I sweat a lot especially on a hot humid Louisiana day. It was just ok to me. Nothing special. I personally didn&#x27;t like the wet cold feeling under my arms and the smell was kind of strong when I first applied it. It also didn&#x27;t last as long as the solid and I just didn&#x27;t feel confident that I was fresh all day. The only pro I had was that there were no white streaks on my black shirt! I am still a fan of Secret but I will stick with my old faithful solid from now on!</li>
    <li> I prefer Gels and sprays over the solid deodorants, because they don&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing. So I was super exited to try this outlast Secret Clear Gel. I am pretty impressed, the scent is nice and fresh and it dries out pretty quickly after applying. The only thing that it didn&#x27;t protect me the whole day, I had to reapply after 7 hours. I mean I had a really busy day, but still I expected to work for 48 hours. Anyway overall I am pretty happy and didn&#x27;t notice any marks or residue on my clothing which is very Important to me. I am  trying the product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
    <li> I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent, after receiving a travel size sample from BzzAgent on behalf of Secret. It claims to work 48 hours, and I did not believe that was going to happen. I was pleasantly surprised to find it lasted as long as it claimed. Please keep in mind that each person is different, and sweats a different amount, or has different kinds of scents in response to heat and activity. I live in a hot humid environment, so I feel that this antiperspirant was put to the test. I usually use a solid that goes on clear. I liked that this gel dried fast, it had a pleasant scent that appears unisex, as I felt it smelled nice for a girl to wear and my husband thought it was manly. So pleasing to both sides. Recap: This deodorant smells great, dries quick, lasts 48 hours, feels clean (from drying quickly and keeping you dry) and feels fresh (from the nice scent). I find that I can use this deodorant once in heavy activity, where I have to use my old deodorant a few times. So I prefer this one.</li>
    <li> When I received this simple from BzzAgent, I was expecting to hate this deodorant. I hate a lot of deodorants and I&#x27;ve tried most of them. If you can deal with the cold feeling of applying it, you&#x27;re home free. It stops the smell from sweat (and I&#x27;m a heavy sweater...was using degree before this). It leaves ZERO white residue in my shirts. That is huge for me. I like this product enough that I bought more before my sample ran out!</li>
    <li> I am using the Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I live in the very humid state of Kansas. I love the gel! I still sweat but not fromy armpits and I have no odors.  I do a lot of garden work and play with my kids outside. The only thing that I have had a problem with is that my nose is very sensitive and I don&#x27;t care for the smell of the original scent gel. Other than that I like the gel. I am trying this product free from Secret!</li>
    <li> Scent Name: UnscentedSize: Pack of 1&lt;br /&gt;I received Secret Outlast gel for free through BzzAgent , and overall I am pleased with it. This gel went on smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on clothes because it is clear, and dries relatively  fast.</li>
    <li> Every now and then I go back to a gel deodorant. I was able to try this product for free thanks to Secret! While I truly appreciate the free sample, this deodorant just didn&#x27;t work that great for me. It didn&#x27;t prevent odors and I was able to smell myself a few hours after applying it (even if I was not doing any physical activity where I would sweat more). However, it DID go on clear and stay clear, which was really nice. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about lifting my arm up and seeing creases of deodorant.</li>
    <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel free from BuzzAgent. I am in love with this deodorant. It is a gel and glides on smooth and dries very quickly. I have tested it to see if it would come off on my clothes and leave a white mark and it doesn&#x27;t. One thing I love is that it has a really nice smell. I love the smell. I will move and catch a whiff of it and it is great. Nice, fresh, clean scent to it. It definitely seems to hold up to workouts and the heat. It keeps odor and wetness at bay. My underarms definitely feel better using this. I have two kids and I run around all day taking care of them and this stuff really holds up. I am so glad I was able to try this. It has become my new favorite. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I got a free sample of this from Secret to try, and it kind of lived up to the hype. It&#x27;s true, the gel is clear and does not leave any white marks. It was also an effective antiperspirant and kept me from being smelly in the middle of the summer. The downsides are that it takes forever to dry, and even when it does it&#x27;s a little sticky. Wetness protection wasn&#x27;t the greatest, and little blobs of it would form and embarrassingly fall off. So if your main concern is getting white marks on your clothes, this is for you. But if that&#x27;s not a priority, I would go with other products.</li>
    <li> I received a deluxe sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent and Secret and I am so glad I did; I loved the product!! I was able to use the sample for a week and never felt more confident that my deodorant/antiperspirant were actually working all day long. I normally use Secret Clinical Strength, so I was skeptical of how long this product would actually last in keeping me dry and smelling fresh. I was pleasantly surprised when it went above and beyond my expectations and contended with the Clinical Strength. I am also usually geared towards solids, but this gel has changed my mind. It was an easy application and most importantly dried quickly. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting product on my shirt or dress when getting ready of a morning. The extra 30 seconds each day checking the mirror for deodorant marks on my outfit are long gone! I strongly recommend this product for long lasting protection and for aiding in long lasting confidence!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed trying this deodorant. First thing I noticed was the great scent it had. When I applied it though I did notice that I would wind it once &amp; more deodorant came out than I would like. I had to master using the twist at the bottom to make sure I didn&#x27;t end up with too much product. But other than that, I liked that it went on easy &amp; clear. I could immediately smell the deodorant which made me feel fresh. I&#x27;ve been trying this out for several weeks now &amp; I only had to reapply later in the day maybe 3 times within that time span. This product has surprisingly worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;*I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.*</li>
    <li> I am a long-time Dove Original user, but I&#x27;m never to afraid to try something different. I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean gel deodorant through BzzAgent for free, and I was excited to try. Unfortunately, the deodorant failed in only one work day...9 hours. At the end of the day, I felt sticky, as if I hadn&#x27;t put anything on my underarms at all that morning. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t SMELL like I didn&#x27;t have anything on my armpits, but I didn&#x27;t smell very fresh either. It smelled like Day 2 of my Dove Original with a run included. Overall, I&#x27;m not a fan of this deodorant. The smell is decent at first, and if you have good luck with gel deodorants, you might really like it. The price and sales/promotions are good. I wish I could take the Dove Original and get the Secret Outlast promotions!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant free from a bzzz campaign to try out and review. I am definitely not a fan. It claims to provide odor and wetness protection but it goes on very wet and takes a long time to get &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. Once it dries, it is a bit sticky. I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34;48-hour&amp;#34; aspect as I shower daily and would never let my deodorant sit for more then a few hours :-/ I simply do not like this deodorant and generally do not like gel type deodorants as I perspire a ton and like to feel clean and dry when I apply my deodorant. I do use a roll on but it is not thick or sticky and dries very quickly. This deodorant attempts to simply mask the smell of heavy perspiration with a strong perfumey scent. I would not recommend this if you know you will be engaging in anything that will cause you to sweat. I may be the exception to the rule as I perspire when I&#x27;m nervous.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite. It feels very cold and gloppy when I put it on and it takes forever to dry. It also takes a few turns before any comes out.  It does work well and smell nice. It just depends on if you like a cold, gloppy feeling under your arms. I got it free from bzzagent. I love trying new things, but this just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a big fan of gels. I just really don&#x27;t like that wet, gooey feeling that you&#x27;re left with after applying. It&#x27;s made worse but immediately covering it with a shirt, but they take forever to dry! Luckily, that is not the case with Secret Outlast! The gel goes on and dries so quickly, I can&#x27;t even feel it by the time I get my shirt on. The Completely Clean scent gives you a nice fresh smell without being too overpowering. I started using this about a week before Texas had a week long triple digit heatwave. It held up nicely under regular temperatures, but I honestly had my doubts about extreme heat. I was wrong. I was dry and smelling fresh from morning until night! I can&#x27;t say that it lasts for 48 hours, because I&#x27;ve never gone that long without showering, but I was just as fresh smelling after 18 hours as I was just after applying. Even better, no white spots! Secret has made a believer out of me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was generously given this product to try free from Secret through Bzz Agent.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product for FREE From Secret thru BZZAgent.  I&#x27;m really not impressed with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deoderant! First, while applying it, it constantly felt sticky under my arms, like my arm was sticking to the side of my chest in the armpit area. It was a relief when I wiped it off!  Second, the odor protection did not protect me at all. With my aggressive fitness program, I swear a lot. Again, my armpit would feel sticky after sweating and the odor would only be masked by the Deoderant scent, only to make your body odor apparently worse and embarrassing. I will not recommend this to anyone, especially those in the fitness/athletics world.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, I use it daily and it&#x27;s perfect for on the go! Since I tend to sweat alot this deodorant I&#x27;d perfect for me. I carry it in my purse all the time. It&#x27;s keeps me fresh and smelling great no matter where I&#x27;m at!</li>
    <li> I got to try this deodorant free thanks to Secret and I was very impressed with it. It feels like it is working from the moment you put it on. Glides on smooth, leaves no white marks, and has a clean scent. I definitely recommend it and definitely will buy this deodorant again!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample o this product and it was nothing like I had expected it would be. The name made the product sound so great and it was far from that. I actually feel like this product made me sweat more than if I had used no deodorant at all. I personally have never like Gel Deodorant but this one just reminded me that I am not a fan! I would not buy this if I were you. Sorry to disappoint but I say STOP .... NO ... DON&#x27;T!</li>
    <li> Loved being able to review this product for free thanks to Secret. It felt weird being put on at first because of the gel, it feels kind of wet, but that feeling goes away immediately and you&#x27;re good to go for the rest of the day!</li>
    <li> Thanks to secret and bzz agent I got to try this deodorant for free. It smells great and comes on clear! It&#x27;s perfect for those hot days where u feel completely protected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great especially for it to work for 48 hours, it&#x27;s worth a try especially for the price. This gel is different because it leaves no residue or has a smell that let&#x27;s people know you wear strong deodorant. Gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s not clinical strength for 48 hours, though it will last for 12 hours If you usually use clinical strength which really is good especially for the price. Secret outlast completely clear gel works and it&#x27;s amazing because it&#x27;s not goopy, so don&#x27;t be afraid because it says gel because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it at all. Got in my bzzkit and was really excited to try it out, it works, it&#x27;s amazing and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> Thanks to secret for the sample! I don&#x27;t normally like gel deodorants because they take forever to dry and sometimes I get a reacting to them. This one was different.  As soon as I put it on it dried. I didn&#x27;t have that sticky wet feeling. I didn&#x27;t even feel like I had anything on! There were no wet or white marks on my clothes and it doesn&#x27;t stain shirts like other gels. I do not sweat very much but it seemed to keep me dry and smelling wonderful through out the day. I liked this product so much that I might be switching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free thanks to Secret and BzzAgent and I have to say it is my new favorite deodorant to use. I live in South Florida and GREAT deodorant is a must. This deodorant dries as fast you apply it so you don&#x27;t have a wet under arm feeling. I hate gel deodorant just for the wet feeling but take my word for it, this deodorant dries fast! Also, the fresh scent lasts all day long. I usually always carry deodorant in my purse because face it, sometimes you need to reapply your deodorant to stay fresh. Secret Clear Gel lasted all day. I was very, very impressed. Another thing I liked about this product is that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my shirts which is amazing. Two thumbs up for Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> I got this to try for free from the great folks at BzzAgent. I was super impressed at how well it it glided on. I hate when it rubs my skin the wrong way but this one is awesome, no nasty white residue marks either. I am always on the move as a mom of 4 and 3 of my kids are special needs so they require so heavy work sometimes. Secret Outlast kept me dry all day! That&#x27;s a tough job and Secret is so up to task. Love it and a great price too!</li>
    <li> For a gel deodorant, this one is definitely great. I usually use a powder dove stick.. but the smell of this one is great. I sampled it during a BzzCampain with BzzAgent and really glad I did. I would purchase again, and it definitely last&#x27;s all day long.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this deodorant as part of a promotion through Secret and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so happy that I did! I&#x27;ve been using powder deodorants (my favorite used to be the Dove brand) for a while now, because the gel ones used to make my armpits feel wet, but Outlast dries really quickly, and it smells amazing. It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on your clothing either. I live in Florida so it&#x27;s very hot this time of year, and even if I&#x27;m sweating I can still smell it working and my armpits are totally dry. The smell and protection last me all day long, throughout school, work, walking my dog, etc. It finally starts to break down while I&#x27;m working out, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a deodorant out there right now that could outlast that! It only takes one small click on each arm to get enough for the day, which means one tube is going to last you a while! I will definitely be buying this deodorant from now on.</li>
    <li> Smells great and never fails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been super picky about my deodorants, I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve always been shy to use gel deodorants for several reasons. I thought they would leave my pits feeling wet, and slippery and that&#x27;s not a good feeling. Being a gel, I also worried it would leave my clothes feeling wet on the under arm and ruining my clothes. If that were to happen then I&#x27;d worry about the amount of time I had before I started to smell again. Naturally I was hesitant when the BzzAgent Campaign asked me to try the Secret Outlast Gel 48 hour protection deodorant for free. I agreed though, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last couple days now, and I have to say NO WET SPOTS! It doesn&#x27;t feel weird, the only feeling it leaves me with is confidence that I&#x27;ll smell good all day long. Even with the 90 degree weather we&#x27;ve had here, I still smell some of the deodorant when I go to reapply it the next morning. I haven&#x27;t had any itching, or burning with using this either which is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly keep this brand, and product in mind for the future when purchasing deodorant.</li>
    <li> Loving this product!! Keeps you fresh and dry all day!! Got this product free from Secret!!</li>
    <li> I recently received this product for free from BzzAgent and Secret to review. This product is fantastic at it&#x27;s odor and wetness protection. I am a female who tends to sweat a lot and this has definitely helped keep me dry and fresh. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t a fan of was the scent, it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me. I would suggest smelling them at your local retailer prior to buying, or just stick with the unscented one. I was a bit leary of trying this product immediately after I shaved because some that I have tried in the past stung a bit, but I did not find this an issue with this product. Another big plus of this product is that you will not have unsightly white marks. I work in a salon and majority of my clothing is black, so it&#x27;s nice to not have to do a white mark spot check prior to leaving the house. Give this product a shot!</li>
    <li> love the easy glide and smoothness and he over all protection. Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> I am not usually a fan of clear gel deodorants, but I was pleasantly surprised with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant.  I received a sample for free as a BzzAgent.  I am now on day two with this new deodorant and I have been surprised at how clean it went on and how dry I have been throughout my work day.  I do a lot of running around for my job during the day and I usually end up feeling a little wet and stinky by the end of the day (I&#x27;m a sweaty person), but so far I am dry and fresh!  I believe that Secret has won me over on this one and I will definitely share the news with my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent. After trying this deodorant for a few days I was very impressed. Secret outlast lasts all day. It kept me nice and dry and I could smell deodorant at the end if the day instead of sweat.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive when I saw this was a clear gel. In the past, others I had tried felt wet after applying and because of that I never felt fresh and confident. I gave this product a try because of it&#x27;s claims to provide 48 hour protection. I am a stay at home mom to 2 active boys, and sometimes it&#x27;s a miracle if I remember to make sure I look good before going out. This is my 2nd day after applying it once. I haven&#x27;t even showered yet but am pretty surprised that I&#x27;m not only dry, but the light summery scent is still there. And I took the boys outside in 90° heat yesterday. I may have sweat some, but the deodorant worked like a gem. I also love how it&#x27;s not cakey like solid deodorants can be and I won&#x27;t have to worry about going sleeveless because clear gel&#x3D;no white marks. I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from BzzAgents in return for a review. I am a big fan of the Secret Clinical Strength line and have found it works great for me. I was worried about making the change from clinical strength to regular. But boy does Secret Outlast not only outlast odor and wetness, it also outlasts the clinical strength! Gone were my worries of embarssing sweat stains, ordor, ruined tanktops and needing a mid-day &#x27;touch up&#x27; of dedorant and in came just one swipe each day for each arm pit. The smell is great too, not over powering but enough that you know it is there and working. As someone commuting on crowded subway trains in the summer, I wish everyone would make the switch to Secret Outlast!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I received a trial size of this for free from a Bzz Campaign (thanks, Secret!). It does seem to work well but the problem to me is, when I first put it on, the clear gel makes me feel wet, which is kind of the opposite of how you want your underarms to feel. Also, I feel like one click brings up TOO MUCH of the product. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this in the future</li>
    <li> This gel deodorant is the best I have tried! I got to try it for free thanks to Secret, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. It really does go on clear with no white marks. It keeps me dry all day and into the night, too. Any deodorant that can keep me dry and fresh in the heat of the summer while chasing after three kids outside is a winner! It has a pleasant scent and is gentle on my skin. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deodorant. I highly recommend Secret Outlast gel deodorant!</li>
    <li> After using solid deodorant for years, I will have to say using the secret outlast gel is even better then what I thought it would be. I like how it dries quickly, the smell is kind of over powering at first, but it lasts all day and keeps you smelling fresh. I chase kiddos around all day in my in-home daycare, so I need to have something on. It also does not leave any stains, which is another great bonus! Using solid deodorant i have had problems with them leaving a residue on my shirts and having a terrible time trying  to get the stains out. This deodorant I don&#x27;t have that problem!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is awesome!  I got a free sample from BzzAgent and i would definitely be buying more!No deodorant stains when you wear your dress! Very quick to dry! Love it! #epic48 and #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the The Secret Outlast clear gel  and I tried in my most active days and with this sumer season i have to tell that the other Secret products are so much better than this, i want to be honest and said that really don&#x27;t last enough ,i like the smell but doesn&#x27;t made me feel fresh all day ,it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about this product when I received it to test for free. I remember the clear gel deodorants of the past and was not sure I would like it at all. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I love it. The fragrance is perfect, not too strong but nice and clean. I also love how you get the perfect amount with each click of the dial. It drys quickly, which was always the issue I hated with clear gel deodorants in the past. I have used it while exercising along with being outside the 100 + heat index temps. In both cases, I have still been completely fresh afterwards. Also, no white marks on my clothes. I would highly recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast clear gel provides amazing long lasting protection, keeps you dry and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks or streaks. It provides an amazing 48 hour odor and wetness protection and smells beyond GREAT!  I love that this clear gel formula absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a layer of product under your arms. Unlike most deodrant I&#x27;ve never felt an invisible type of protection from the deodorant and another drawback has also been the marks you get on your skin when the deodorant starts to dryad clump and gets on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect to like this deodorant since it is a gel formula but I love it and love that it feels like I am not using a deodorant at all. I definitely plan to switch from powder to gel formula. I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone needing great odor/wetness control and anyone physically active. No more white streaks and it dries immediately. The value is also great. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all my family and friends and even my bf is using it. I received Secret Outlast complimentary from Bzz Agent for testing and review purposes and opinions are my own. :-)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from a BzzAgent campaign for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel and was hesitant on participating as I have very sensitive skin.  I signed up and  received a sample of the Completely Clean scent. I used this for the first time knowing I will be out in the southern heat all day. The gel did not leave any marks on my shirt and kept me dry all day. To top it off, I had absolutely no reaction! I will be buying this in the future.  Thanks Secret and BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It dries super fast and seriously lasts all day. I live in the humid midwest and even through the 95% humidity days, this stuff holds up. Smells good, but not overpowering. Doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothes. I&#x27;ve tried the clinical stuff and this is definitely the best. Well worth it. I was able to try this product free thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> First of all, Secret is the only product that I will use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the BzzCampaign came along I was excited to try the outlast since I have not tried it before.  I have been using the Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel for about a week now. I&#x27;m happy with it. It always gave me the level of protection from wetness and odor that I was looking for, without the white marks. I forgot how much better it was than the alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add, I have been enjoying the scent too.  I must say, quite delightful indeed.  Thanks BzzAgent and Secret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product over solids and sprays.</li>
    <li> I am not a stinky sweaty person but when i do work in my yard i sweat alot an my underarms will stink my husband says i dont stink but i smell it. i have tried many products an i have to say this is like most after a LONG days work i didn&#x27;t feel like it lived up to its name #Epic48 cause i was only outside 12 hours an i was stink an sweat in my arm pits. This was a free sample an everything is my own opinion an i do encourage all to try for themselves as we all are different.</li>
    <li> It has been quite some time since I have used a gel deodorant, and my previous experience was not a pleasant one. It frequently left my underarms feeling sticky and gross, and never lasted more than a few hours.  I was excited to get a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent and Secret, as I was curious to see if there have been any advancements with gel deodorants.  I must say, I am quite impressed, and may even switch to this permanently.  The Completely Clean scent is very pleasant and not overpowering.  Once applied, the gel dries within a couple of seconds.  It really dries, and fast!  I felt no sticky residue or anything!  I immediately shoved a black top onto my freshly applied deodorant, and sow no white marks to speak of. Happy-face, happy-dance, and all that!  On the most active of my days testing this stuff out (moving with the summer sun beating down), it kept me mostly dry, better than most (not all) solid deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried. I have not tried testing the claim of 48-hour protection, as I have been reapplying daily to maintain the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased, and will be checking for additional scents to buy!</li>
    <li> Being a busy mom of 4 kids I am always on the move and I try to keep myself active in and out of the gym. I always had a hard time finding a deodorant that would keep my dry and odor free. I was excited when I got to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free. I usually stay away from gels because It always left wet marks on my clothes and took too long to dry. I was surprised that this dried quickly enough that I Could put my shirt on right away without the wet marks and of course since it&#x27;s a gel I didn&#x27;t get any white marks either. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t happy about was when I put it on it really burned. I use it after showering and shaving so that could be the reason. It also left red marks on my underarms. It did work really well at keeping me dry and odor free. My family and friends took a road trip to the WaterPark capital of the world this weekend and we were in and out of the parks all day and I did not feel like I needed to reapply it at all. It worked wonderfully and I felt confident all day!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Bzzagent, I got a sample sized Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent to try. At first I was ehh, it&#x27;s a gel, do I want to use it? I&#x27;m glad that I did. It really does dry quick and didn&#x27;t leave a mark on my shirts after I put my shirt on. I also love how long it lasted. I put it on in the morning, did my normal thing and then worked in the yard and the garden after dinner time. My deodorant outlasted me! I was ready to quit working but my deodorant kept going!</li>
    <li> I (Matthew&#x27;s wife, but we only have one Amazon account) received this product free to try from BzzAgent.  I was a little apprehensive at first since my past experiences with gel deodorants were no good (sticky, took forever to dry, didn&#x27;t really work well).  I can say I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  While it did go on wet, it dried very quickly (I think the trick is to only use one click, maybe two of the deodorant.  Much more and it probably will take forever to dry).  After it dried there were no white marks, and my underarms felt smooth and soft, like I wasn&#x27;t even wearing deodorant.  Plus it does the job of keeping me dry.  I have been using it for the past few days (while chasing my toddler around in 80 degree weather, and I have stayed dried.  If you are looking to try a new deodorant I suggest this.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, so if I will probably try to find a different one to buy.</li>
    <li> Received this product free as part of a testing/review promotion from Secret.  I like that it applies clear, it also dries very quickly so my armpits don&#x27;t feel wet after application.  As far as my experience the odor protection claim is spot on, but the wetness claim not so much.  I tend to sweat a lot and it&#x27;s now summer here in Texas so I was really hoping that Secret Outlast would hold up a little better than it does.  If I don&#x27;t reapply 2-3 times through the day I will sweat right through my shirt which is on par with other products I&#x27;ve used.  Also, there is a scent.  I didn&#x27;t deduct a star for that even though I prefer an *actual* scent and scented vs unscented is a personal preference; but there is definitely an antiperspirant type of scent to the product.  Bottom line: I would purchase this product if I found it on sale, but it&#x27;s not the miracle product I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
    <li> I received a free stick of this deodorant complements of Secret, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it otherwise.  I am not a huge fan of the gel deodorant because it seems to burn when I put it on and feels wet and sticky forever.  However, this stuff is this only deodorant I&#x27;ve ever had that goes on and stays clear!  I put on a black shirt this morning and for the first time...no white streaks!  The scent is good, and not overpowering and the I feel fresh and clean all day.  Pretty impressive in my book!</li>
    <li> Great product. Goes on smooth and dries just as fast. Leaves no white marks and lasts all day. Got a free trial on Bzzagent. A great product!</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I got to try this free through Bzz Agent. This deodorant smells nice and leaves no white residue. It does last quite a while...not sure about 48 hours. In comparison to using plain old baking soda, I think I will just stick to the baking soda, as it does not irritate my armpit and lasts a LONG time. The baking soda literally takes the smell away. This deodorant irritated my skin...turned it red with slight burning sensation. Secret Outlast does prevent perspiration, while the baking soda does not, so if you do not have sensitive skin as I do, you may want to give this a try.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is not something I would buy in the future. It works well, but the scent is overpowering and not very pleasant. This works well and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes. It also is just too wet when applying. If you like gel deodorant this would work well for you.I got this deodorant free from Secret.</li>
    <li> I received a sample as a part of a campaign from BzzAgent. I was very excited to try out Secret Outlast as it&#x27;s been a while since I had used any Secret products but I found that it just didn&#x27;t work well for me. It goes on smoothly and I like that clear and the scent isn&#x27;t bad. The downside is that it does leave white marks, at least it did for me. It also doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I found myself having to reapply every few hours, granted it&#x27;s been a bit hotter than normal here but I really thought it would be long lasting. Overall, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Secret products. I like that Secret Outlast offers 48-hour protection and has a great scent. This works great even when I&#x27;ve worked all day and hit the gym in the evening. Also works all day in the summer heat, plus it doesn&#x27;t show up on my clothes if I accidentally get it on my shirt when I put it on. I really like is and will be using it from now on. I got to try this for free thanks to Secret.</li>
    <li> Been using my free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel for almost a week now, and here are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive or sour, just not a scent I would choose. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used a gel, and I still don&#x27;t like the feeling of it going on wet. I feel the need to stand in front of a fan or window with my arms raised over my head for about 3 minutes, until it feels completely dry. And as far as lasting 48 hours goes... forget it. Just being in the office where I volunteer I felt the need to reapply after about 6 hours. I was sweating like crazy, and the office isn&#x27;t that warm.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, they are absolutely right about the product leaving no residue on clothes. I even rubbed my shirt on the stick to test it, and nothing showed up. I also feel like the odor protection lasted longer than I stayed dry; even after I felt myself sweating, I didn&#x27;t feel like I smelled of sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not loving it so far, but I&#x27;m going to use it until the sample is gone in order to give it a fair shot.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free thanks to Bzzagents and Secret and although I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed it did score points with me in some aspects.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it dries almost immediately after application and can&#x27;t feel it after it dries; plesent scent; overall good-beter than average wetness protection.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: scent is a little strong at first but quickly dissipates (around 1-2 hrs.) and with it the odor protection starts to fade as the day goes on as well (albeit at a slower rate) so in that aspect it doesn&#x27;t last the 48 hrs., probably not even 24 hrs. on most days, but to be honest very few deodorants actually do. Overall I think it rates a little bit above average.</li>
    <li> I got the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant free as a part of a campaign from the company. I normally shy away from gel deodorant, but I must say that this one is pretty exciting! It has a very clean smell, just like fresh air, nothing cliche or in the floral category (which lets face it, is just gross for your armpits). It is not overpowering at all, and really you can only smell it off the stick, which is nice. The application is pretty straight forward, the gel comes out smoothly without any goopiness or issues with the tiny holes getting plugged. As promised, it does dry almost instantly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend throwing your shirt on right after, but even if you do there are no white marks on your shirt which is pretty awesome. And as gross as it is, I did go the whole 48 hours to see how it worked. As promised, there was no stench or sweat! If I could only explain how amazing this really is. I am a chronic sweater, I am one of the people who have to be careful with what color shirt they purchase because the sweat pits will be more visible. I am happy to say, this was not an issue. Finally!!! So why the 4 stars? I am an avid runner and was less than impressed with the secret outlast combating exercising sweat. I waited 5 minutes for it to dry, like always and the result was a gross mess. The gel became very sticky and wet. I had a 4 inch diameter of sticky grossness all the way around my armpit that remained even after the sweat had dried. This is quite sad too, because it did a great job at fighting the stench of exercise. So for day to day use this is amazing! I would recommend it to everyone, especially those ladies who battle issues with sweat &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> When bzzagent got a hold of me for this free trial offer from Secret, I was a little skeptical. I&#x27;ve tried so many deodorants before and found that Degree performs best for me. Now, I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance and tried this new product! I haven&#x27;t made it more than about 32 hours in between showering, so  I can&#x27;t attest to the fact that it works for 48 hours, but wholey great product! I have yet to see one white mark on my clothing (I wear a lot of black/dark colors) and the odor protection is unbeatable! I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the scent they sent me, but I&#x27;m excited to go buy/find a scent I do like in this. It&#x27;s also boyfriend approved! He loves it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of Secrets Outlast completely clear deodorant and brought it with me on vacation in Thailand - I really put it to the test in the hot and humid weather here. I was able to spend all day out in the hot and sticky weather and not worry about pesky pit stains and stinking. It was great!</li>
    <li> Received the trial size as part of the company promotion. It is true to its description that leaves a clean feeling, but as for the out last by the night I felt the need to re apply. For a busy day in the morning is great, would recommend keeping on hand if will busy thru the night.</li>
    <li> Completely in love with this deodorant! A definite must have purchase. Works great and smells so amazing you&#x27;ll have no problem and be worry free when wearing in these hot summer days! I received this sample item for free through BzzAgent but I will be repurchasing this product definitely! So far my favorite deodorant!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this..... For the most part, it&#x27;s ok. Does it really last 48 hours? I&#x27;m not sure, and I don&#x27;t think I want to find out. Showers are our friends.... 12 hours-yes! It&#x27;s does great for at least 12 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is too overwhelming for me. I don&#x27;t want people to smell me coming from a mile away. I prefer something a little more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it does not dry quickly. At least not quick enough for my liking. I feel like I&#x27;m going to get it all over my clothes no matter how long I wait. It&#x27;s been about 10 years since I used a gel deodorant and I hoped they had improved, but I&#x27;m still not impressed by gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will still like this product, but it is just not for me (due to reasons stated above). I got to try this product for free thanks to BzzAgent, but ALL opinions are completely my own.</li>
    <li> I received the product free from Bzzagent. After using it for a week, I can say it smells great, goes on clear, and keeps you dry all day long! My only complaint is that when you first apply it, it&#x27;s gives you a sticky feeling and burns my underarms when I apply it. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s been extremely humid in California lately and it has keep me more fresh than my regular deodorant. With Secret Outlast clear gel clean scent I only have to apply once a day!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel deodorant, but I do like Secret and the Outlast Invisible Solid so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I got it for free. I had that same wet feeling in my armpits that I&#x27;ve had with any other gel deodorant. I felt like I needed to reapply the deodorant several times throughout the day. I did like the scent of it, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with white marks on my clothing with it. I plan to stick with the invisible solid version of this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product through Bzz Agent and i was pleasantly surprised, I have never been a fan of the clear gels. but this one is my new go to deodorant! Drys quickly, lasts throughout the day and smells great! My new favorite product!</li>
    <li> I really like the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel!  It has a very nice fresh scent to it.  I was given a sample by buzzagent to try.  I was a little leary of putting a gel on my armpits.  I had tired gels many years ago but never really like them.  I can say that this gel was great for me.  It kept me dry and fresh feeling all day.  I really loved that it went on clear and there were not white streaks or marks!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Loved this deodorant! Got to try it free and went out to buy more the next week! It goes on clear and stays all day. You still smell fresh even after a long hot day! You can wear any color and not worry about marks too!</li>
    <li> I got this for free through BzzAgent and was skeptical at first. I have tried gel deodorants in the past and did not like them. This actually worked, and I sweat a lot! We just moved to a very hot and humid climate in Kansas so I was excited to try this out. It smells good and works great! No need to reapply even in this heat!</li>
    <li> I am trying this product for free thanks to Secret and BZZAgent, but I wouldn&#x27;t give a good review unless I really liked the product. I normally don&#x27;t like gel type deodorant products because they always leave me feeling wet and sticky under the arms! Gross, I know! The Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel didn&#x27;t do that. It went on clear, stayed clear, and dried almost instantly and kept me feeling fresh all day! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish they had a version without aluminum, however, I would still repurchase this for days when you need that extra protection that natural deodorants just can&#x27;t give.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel! I live in Florida and am always outside in the humidity and heat at a park, fishing, or at the beach so I need a clear deodorant that will work all day.  I have been using this deodorant for a few weeks now and it has done a great job of keeping me protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample for testing a review purposes from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I got this sample size free to try &amp; thought it was wonderful!! I love that it&#x27;s clear gel &amp; there are no streaks on my clothes, because that is a big problem for me. I also love that I can go all day to outdoor events like concerts &amp; festivals &amp; it doesn&#x27;t fade out, it keeps me protected even in the hottest of summer days.  I am very active outside a lot going to outdoor events, hiking,&amp; riding my bike so I don&#x27;t need streaks or deodorant that won&#x27;t last all day in the heat. Secret outlast completely clear fits my active lifestyle incredibly well. I will definitely be re-uping on my clear gel.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is wonderful. I didn&#x27;t expect much because the last time I used a clear gel, it was less than effective.  I decided to give this a shot, though after receiving it from BzzAgent. I am so glad that I did. I brought it with me to D.C. and Michigan when I went on a recent vacation. The humidity was unbearable and it was hot the whole time I was on vacation. Using Secret Outlast, though, I didn&#x27;t worry once about feeling fresh. This deodorant works and was perfect for every outfit (I had to be dressed for a wedding and several family get togethers and didn&#x27;t worry a bit about marks on my dark clothing).  Definitely a fan of this!</li>
    <li> My whole deodorant-wearing life I was all about the &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid...but I constantly had deodorant smears all over my clothing. I would then attempt to wipe them off with a damp towel and walk around with wet spots on my shirt later to dry back into deodorant smears. I am plagued by this embarrassment no longer! Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent, I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel and I am in love. I do not worry about deodorant smears on my clothing any longer. I also find the gel&#x27;s coolness refreshing as I apply it on hot summer days. Once my sample is used up, I will be purchasing this gel in the future.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this deodorant at first. Once, I put it on and it lasted all day, I loved it. It does feel cold and wet, but that only lasts a minute. I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t break me out! It didn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my shirts, which is a plus. It&#x27;s hard for me to find deodorant that works well. This worked, so I&#x27;ll be buying some. My review is from a free sample I received from Bzzagent. This is my honest opinion about this deodorant.</li>
    <li> This secret outlast it works so good. Better then my regular deodorant. I definitely will be buying this product from now on!! Leaves no white spots and after applied, dries quick. Its long lasting as well! Thanks To BZZ Agent I got to try the product free!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel thanks to Secret and even though I&#x27;m not a fan of gel deodorants, I gave it a whirl. When I first put it on, it was the goopy gel feeling that I knew and hated. I have to say that once it dried, you didn&#x27;t feel any unpleasant wetness like most gel deodorants. As usual though, the product is a mess when applying - pushing gel through those tiny holes always end up with deodorant all over the place. It would be a much better product if it was dispensed as a gel solid, like Axe deodorant. The first say I wore  Secret Outlast® Clear Gel, it did a pretty good job of keeping me dry (even in 90 degree heat). That being said, it does not offer 48 hour protection like the advertising boasts (not that I think any deodorant really can) because I was a sweaty Betty by the next morning. Also, it still left white streaks on my shirt so I will not be converting in the future.</li>
    <li> Got a free sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent and loved it. I work in a pretty hot area and I also go fishing in the Florida heat a lot. Must say this deodorant works pretty awesome. It doesn&#x27;t really leave behind that annoying residue like some other deodorants and it doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks on my shirts.</li>
    <li> This has replaced my long time solid deodorant. The Secret Outlast Gel is more effective than any other deo I have tried. This will really save your skin as there is no build up to scrub off everyday... in fact there is no build up at all. No residue either. Just your nice smelling skin. Simple as that. You dont have to worry about this deodorant failing you. Its very effective and long lasting. Even on the hottest of days I am very confident in the way I smell wearing this. There are also a few different scents of this available on the market so you can find your perfect scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No residue on your or your clothing&lt;br /&gt;Cost: Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;Availability: Can be purchased at drugstores and big box stores like Target, Walmart ect.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Very fresh but not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free thanks to BzzAgent and Secret to test and review. The reviews are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I tried this product complimentary from Secret as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I haven&#x27;t had good luck with Secret Solids in the past, but this Clear Gel is absolutely amazing! My main problem with antiperspirants is that they gunk up on my skin and are incredibly hard to wash off in the shower, but the Secret Outlast Clear Gel feels like nothing on, dries quickly, protects well against odor and wetness, and washes off without any trouble whatsoever. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my shirts, a huge plus. I don&#x27;t think it quite protects for 48 hours, but it does keep me fresh for at least 24, which is all I&#x27;m asking for in an antiperspirant. The Completely Clean scent is fresh, a bit sharp and musky, but it&#x27;s not so strong as to clash with my perfume during the day. Overall, I&#x27;m really liking this deodorant, and I would absolutely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant and have been very happy with the results. I love that it promises a 48 hour protection and it lives up to it. The scent is amazing. And I love that it goes on clear and stays clear. I was able to try this deodorant out for free, thanks to Secret.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free from Secret! I love secret products! Secret is the only kind of deodorant I use. I am not usually a fan of gel deodorants. Surprisingly this gel did dry very fast and did not leave me feeling wet like most gels do. It smelled really good too! It definitely did not last 48 hours though! Within a few hours I already felt like I needed to put more deodorant on! My secret invisible solid (which is much cheaper) keeps me feeling dry for longer than the secret outlast did. I have pretty sensitive skin but did not experience the rash many others complained about. I am glad i was able to try this deoderant for free but I would not purchase this product. I will stick with my secret invisible solid!</li>
    <li> I am trying the product for free thanks to Secret and Bzzagent. I waited a few weeks to really give this product a try before I wrote my review. so the likes:  I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks or residue. I wore this on a regular work day in an air conditioned office and outside in the sun gardening.  The no so likes:  During my work I day I could smell the fragrance.. not sure I was liking it so much maybe it was the fragrance mixed with a little sweat I didn&#x27;t like. When I was outside I needed to reapply a lot through out the day. Would I purchase this for myself no.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent deodorant is an awesome product! It glides on smoothly. The scent is gently and not over-powering! Plus it works! I stayed dry and fresh all day!</li>
    <li> I am a buzzagent I was given a sample of this with the intent that I would write a review.  I have used my whole sample size I went camping for 3 days. The kind of camping where there&#x27;s no toliet or showers. My friends were using a dry other name brand deodorant.  By the third day I was still smelling halfway descent.  If you can get over the initial cold wetness ( it drys really fast) it works great. I can wear it all day and I don&#x27;t need to reapply before crossfit in the morning ( I took a chance one day and was suprised!)</li>
    <li> I received a sample from bzz agent to try for free. I have an issue with sweating through my shirts in the armpit area. With 3 kids I need a deodorant that dries right after being put on, and keeps me smelling fresh all day. I was not too impressed. After wearing this deodorant for a cpl hours, while being active, I started sweating a lot through my shirt and started stinking. I love the Secret brand of deodorants, but I would not buy this particular deodorant on my own.</li>
    <li> I received secret outlast clear gel deodorant as a free sample to test and review and I definitely recommend Secret outlast clear gel deodorant to everyone! With its 48-hour odor protection it keeps you feeling fresh all day. It Helps stop odor before it ever starts! There&#x27;s no question this Completely Clean Scent keeps you feeling clean and fresh all day! Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant Goes on clear and Stays on clear which means no more of those pesky white marks!</li>
    <li> Secret has outdone themselves again. I am a huge secret deodorant fan usually with the solid version, but this new Outlast is awesome. I went on vacation in 90+ degree heat for a week. My shirts were not stained and they did not get the usual wet spots. I am super excited to try the scented versions. The original did not have a strong smell and I like the ones with a stronger smell. This is perfect for those of you that have issues with smells. I received a free sample from Bzzagent but that is what samples are for to try an item .</li>
    <li> I really think this deodorant is great! It dries super quick and lasts/works all day, no problem. It has a very light scent, which I think is also a nice touch. Everything I&#x27;ve worn has been left clean and without any marks. It&#x27;s really nice that I don&#x27;t have to think twice about white marks on my shirts! Pulling a long day is no problem.  It works even till my shower the next morning. Love this stuff! Also, I tried this product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret solid for years. I have used a wet deodorant before and hated it. I felt wet all day.  I love how Secret Outlast makes me feel. It drys so fast and lasts all day with a wonderful scent. I was shocked!  It doesn&#x27;t leave any traces and I don&#x27;t have to worry that it will leave any white residue on my clothes. Thanks to Bzzzzagent I was able to try this Deodorant. I was excited to try it!</li>
    <li> I had received a sample size to try out for free from Bzzagent. I was not looking to change my deodorant but this deodorant worked great for all day wear with sweating.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this to try via BzzAgent, and I was pretty excited about it. I usually use Clinical Strength deodorant, mostly because my work environment tends to be hot and muggy, plus it involves physical exertion, so I&#x27;m paranoid about smell. This stuff says it&#x27;s supposed to last 48 hours, and maybe it does, but I was too nervous to not reapply it every day. It seemed to work just fine, I didn&#x27;t notice any smell coming from my armpits other than the somewhat overwhelming &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent. My biggest issue is the same that I have with most gel deodorants - it feels sticky and gross when I put it on. I hate that, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m going to stick to the solids I usually use.</li>
    <li> As a member of BzzAgent, I received a free sample size of this product to try and review.  I have used it for nearly 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;scent isn&#x27;t too over-powering&lt;br /&gt;scent if fresh, clean, not too floral&lt;br /&gt;good odor control&lt;br /&gt;washes off easily in shower, leaves no residue&lt;br /&gt;dries quickly once applied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;leaves some white marks on clothes (despite stating it doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;will not work for 48 hours, that&#x27;s bogus&lt;br /&gt;need to reapply if you are sweating a lot or it loses efficacy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL RATING:&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad product, I like that it goes on smoothly and dries fast and isn&#x27;t a pain to wash off.  However, it will still leave white marks on clothes.  Not as badly as other deodorants, but they do still exist.  I don&#x27;t think this is the best product for me in the summer months, but in winter it may be adequate.  I&#x27;m a sweater, so I need a product that will keep body odor at bay.</li>
    <li> I received this as a product promotion from Secret and I must say it smells refreshing. The gel is a little slimier than the other push up deodorant&#x27;s I&#x27;m used to but odor protection is great. Its s a little hard to control how much comes out at first but not a deal breaker, really. I normally use Suave clinical strength in a vanilla verbena but I think it was discontinued so tried this one I got. I probably will purchase in the future. Love that it goes on clear!!! No worrying about the white marks on shirts and other clothing.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to try a sample from Secret through BzzAgent. When I was offered this as a trial I was a bit skeptical. In the past I have had horrible experiences with clear gel deodorant. My armpits would always feel wet, it stained my clothes and I just never felt protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied Secret Outlast Completely Clean I knew this gel deodorant was like no other. The deodorant really is clear, I did not leave any embarrassing white residue on my shirt, it went on easily and dried immediately. I tested this product on a hot summer day at the amusement park, I even brought it with me in case I had to reapply which I never had to because this product outlasted the park. This product is awesome for gel deodorant users and I highly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Loving this product.  I got it from Bzzagent as a free sample. I had a moment the other week where I went to the gym and realized I hadn&#x27;t put deodorant on since the afternoon before when I had showered.  It lasted me through my workout!  I was so happy to have it in my arsenal of beauty items.</li>
    <li> Thanks to bzzagent and secret love this product it works great it smells great and it keeps me fresh all day it&#x27;s a must for me now and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore because this is the best out there thanks to secret I&#x27;m getting to try this for free</li>
    <li> I actually recently got this deodorant for free (thanks to Secret and BzzAgent), but I have been using the Secret brand of deodorants for as long as I can remember. They always put out great products, but this is my favorite by far. It works EXTREMELY well and they have great scents. Long lasting protection which is greatly needed in the summer months! It dries really fast and it does not leave any residue on your clothing. 10 out of 10. I have not found a better deodorant than this so I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I did like this deodorant. It smells clean and fresh. My boyfriend REALLY liked the smell because he&#x27;d tell me every day when I wear it that he likes it. I think it did well for keeping me dry and feeling clean under my arms. I received this free for testing purposes via BzzAgent but that has no merit on my review. I was glad to try it out and pleased enough that when I run out of the deodorants that I have now, I will purchase  this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant! It&#x27;s fresh but not baby powder like in scent. It works splendidly. I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better deodorant. I got this product free to sample but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRAND! I&#x27;m pretty picky about my deodorant. I hate it when it streaks on my clothes or when I feel sticky all day long. These past few weeks I&#x27;ve been even more picky than usual because I&#x27;m on crutches and I HATE the feeling of the crutches slipping under my arms right after I&#x27;ve used deodorant. However the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel dries the fastest out of the different kinds I&#x27;ve tried. Less slipping for me! It also it wonderful because I don&#x27;t get deodorant all over my crutches. This brand has been a god send these past few weeks. Though usually I use their lavender scent, I received this kind as a free sample and really enjoy this scent as well. And since it&#x27;s harder for me to move around, it&#x27;s great that it works for so long so that I don&#x27;t have to get up to keep reapplying. I think in the future I&#x27;ll use this kind when I know I&#x27;ll be  in the hot weather all day, but regularly I still adore the lavender scent. Wish they would make Outlast Lavender!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Light and fresh feeling that lasts.  I was given this product free to sample and now I&#x27;m hooked!  I felt protected all day, from work to chasing 2 little ones, all the while I didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothes.  I honestly can say I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different secret fragrances before and I must say this one is the one that lasts the most and I love it! It also lasts longer than other deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried before. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong but I love the subtle smell.</li>
    <li> Received this product free as a Bzzagent thanks to Secret and I love it. It goes on clear and dries so quickly. It doesn&#x27;t transfer to dark clothing like the regular solid alternatives so it&#x27;s great on the go. My underarms stay fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited that I got sent this free product from BzzAgent. It&#x27;s literally the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m definitely sticking to this one. It smells good and clean. Lasts up to 48 hours. Clear gel that dries up quickly. No white marks! I love it. It works great even after you workout no wetness and you smell good too.</li>
    <li> I got a trial size from Secret and BuzzFeed to try for free!  I am a die hard Mitchum user, and won&#x27;t likely switch over to this 100%, however this will be my go to when Mitchum is out of stock (which, by the way, it is always out of stock).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have personally always struggled with deodorant.  When I was a teenager I got prescription &amp;#34;pads for hyperhidrosis&amp;#34; (really sweaty pits)...they were these wipe things that were saturated in something...i would unwrap the individual packets and wipe my pits then walk around for 10 minutes with my arms in the air waiting for them to dry.  They left a white chalky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I grew out of that but still need something strong for wetness and odor.  I have used Mitchum for years and it is great.  I was skeptical that anything else would work.  I have tried a lot of other brands over the years and nothing seems to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant WORKS.  My personal preference is for a clear solid, and this particualr one from secret is the clicky-dial kind that pushed the deoderant up through little holes.  For whatever reason I don&#x27;t like that, but it has no bearing on the actual effectiveness.  This worked as well as my regular brand, did not flake and dried QUICKLY!  No elbows in the air all morning waiting for your pits to dry.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample through buzz agent and Secret and to be honest it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have always had issues finding a deodorant that helps me with odor though, so I can see that it could work for others, but not for me. I am also pregnant my hormones could be affecting the lack of smell protection. Secret outlast is supposed to work for 48 hours odor control and it lasted about four hours for me. Positives: the initial smell is really nice and clean and it dries extremely quickly and doesn&#x27;t get on clothes. Negatives: the odor protection only lasted four hours.</li>
    <li> i have been using roll ons and body sprays but i was not as satisfied as either the stain was staying on my clothes and sometimes i was not satisfied with the duration of the sprays but  Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel really helped me a lot as i am sweating a lot and sometimes it stinks too &#x3D;s and then i received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel from @bzzagent as sample product to try for free i am very satisfied with it and i will definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I tried this deoderant as a free sample from bzzagent and instantly fell in love. It smells so good and keeps me feeling fresh all day opposed to other brands that wear off after a few hours. I have two small boys and I needed a deodorant that could keep up with me as I keep up with them, and this is definitely the one I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
    <li> I got this for a buzzfeed campaign. I like this deodorant for all the hot days I&#x27;ve been experiencing. The gel texture doesn&#x27;t stain clothes and I&#x27;m not left feeling like I can lift my arms when I go anywhere without worrying about large sweat stains or a not so great smell.</li>
    <li> I give Secret Outlast a 4/5 ONLY because I feel it could&#x27;ve smelled a little fresher and better. However, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s only downfall! I had no fear of white marks on my blouses with this deodorant because it&#x27;s a CLEAR gel that goes on easy and dries in less than 10 seconds. It definitely lasted through out my work day, which is super important to me because the last thing I want is to be the stinky lady at work LOL! This experience was possible thru a free sample I got, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier I got it!</li>
    <li> I last used Secret deodorant today. I love the fresh scent of clean linen that comes out of it. I feel fresh, no sticky feeling, no wet feeling no stain on my clothes, no unwell unsafe feelings. I received a Bzzagent sample, and I can&#x27;t stop saying that this product I recomend the awesome product because I liked a lot the everlasting scent that is brings.&lt;br /&gt;It is clean, fresh everlasting Deodorant Secret that I love!</li>
    <li> Got a free sample from bzzagent.com and I am glad I did!  I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gel deodorant because I never feel like it works...  I&#x27;m happy to say secret outlast does work!!  No &amp;#34;onion&amp;#34; scented moist sticky feeling armpits and no ugly marks on my shirt!  Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of secret outlast xtend gel  from my buzz agent campaign and absolutely loved it. I had not had good experiences with clear gel in the past. But this exceeded my expectations and worked well with my active lifestyle. It left no residue and gave me a full day of protection. I highly recommend this to anyone who need to do it to keep up with their busy lifestyle. It&#x27;s definitely a five-star anti-perspirant. I love the twist feature because you always get the perfect amount.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free through a brand promotion. I was very pleased with the odor protection. (It truly lasted all day!). It also left no white marks on my clothing, which is awesome. I however was not s huge fan of the wet feeling it gave me underneath my arms, which lasted longer than I would have expected. I&#x27;ve noticed this is fairly common with gel deodorants, so this just may be the price you pay for this type of deodorant. Other than that, the scent is nice and the coverage is great.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! Keeps me smelling great without any white marks. It held up to my test of a two week vaycay with temps over 90 degrees!</li>
    <li> I think that the smell is amazing. I wonder if that is wrong? It does smell good.I t does last long. Whether you are active or just your everyday life. I love this Secret Outlast Xtend. I put some on in the morning in the afternoon after my workout I still smell fresh.You also still need to take a shower. hahaha. I&#x27;m a fan. I can see myself buying more I just have to master not getting white marks on my clothes. I&#x27;m getting the hang of it. I usually use the dry sprays but this smell is great and it last longer.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is hands down my MVP!!! BzzAgent introduced me to this gem when they sent me a free sample for testing and review purposes. This product is amazing! There are absolutely NO white marks on my clothing or on me, and it dries 100% clear (even little black dresses are safe from white marks here!) The scent is clean and light. When I use this I have absolutely no body odor and it really does live up live up to the 48-hour claim! I often have 3-hour long dance classes and I smell clean and fresh thanks to this product! Since receiving this deodorant I officially switched to Secret Outlast Clear Gel and never looked back!</li>
    <li> Thanks BzzAgent for giving me a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try for a review. I love the clear gel that leaves no white marks and goes on dry. I must say, the first time I wore it, I couldn&#x27;t help smelling my pits. I really liked the smell of this and kept getting whiffs of it throughout the day. This is my go to deoderant for when I&#x27;m out for the day in the sun. I tested it and it works!</li>
    <li> I received a sample courtesy of @BzzAgent. It has a nice scent and the best thing is that there are no white smears on my clothes after using this product. Its easy to use and lasts all day long. ‪#‎epic48‬</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant. I usually use a solid because in my mind solids work better than gels. I get this sample and read about it and it says 48 hour protection and my first thought was there is no way. I put in on one morning after my shower and was impressed on how smooth it went on and how quickly it dried. I found myself constantly checking myself throughout the day just to make sure it was still working. I didn&#x27;t want my coworkers to shun me because my deodorant quit working and I was a little stinky. I was happy that every time I checked I still smelled pretty good. By the end of the day it was still working and I was surprised since I had then assumption that gel didn&#x27;t work as well as solids. I know it says it protects for 48 hours but honestly I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to try it that long. I reapplied it the next morning after a shower. So I can say that it works for 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to LOVE Secret Outlast Completely clean.. but, it was just okay. I received this as part of Bzzcampaign and started using it the next day. At first, the scent BEFORE applying, was fairly nice, Clean and fresh. But, that immediately changed once I actually applied it. The scent was too strong. Almost overwhelmingly sweet. It made me a little self-conscious because I thought it was too much! What I did really like about it, was that it did in fact go ON completely clean and dry. It wasn&#x27;t sticky. It wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;. I also chose to wear one of my favorite black tops on this day and it dried WITHOUT any white marks. Not a single one! I loved that. I wear a lot of black dresses to work and unfortunately, my current deodorant always left me with white residue. Secret Outlast is GREAT if you&#x27;re looking for something that will leave NO unsightly marks!! One other thing I really liked was that Secret Outlast really controlled my perspiration. At work, I&#x27;m constantly moving. It can get a little hectic but, I never had an issue with sweat while wearing Secret Outlast. It did leave me feeling dry, comfortable. I even chose to wear it on a few days where I worked out in 90+ degree heat. It still held up quite well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Secret Outlast Completely Clean has the potential to be a really GREAT deodorant/antiperspirant. The only major downside to me, really was the scent. I wish it had more of a powder scent. Something light, fresh. One of my co-workers even commented that it was really strong for a deodorant. After a few hours of wear, it did become better, less noticeable. I would still wear it on occasion. Mainly on days where I wear black because it really is great in all other aspects aside from the scent.</li>
    <li> I am a busy mom and always on the go.  I need a deodorant I can count on and not worry about how I smell as I&#x27;m out and about.  Ever since having kids it has been difficult to find something that works well and doesn&#x27;t make me feel self conscious.  I am not typically a fan of gel, however I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel from BzzAgent for the purpose of my review and was super impressed.  The gel goes on easily without much mess (something I typically don&#x27;t like about gel).  It also has a great clean and fresh scent.  The best part about Secret Outlast gel is that it works!!!  I was so impressed that not once during the day did I worry about not smelling fresh because I could still smell the scent of the gel.  My husband also noticed how well it works.  I will continue using Secret Outlast gel and am thankful I found it!  The opinions expressed here are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opinions expressed here are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Secret I got to try this for free!! I am not a big gel deodorant person but i do have to say i love this. It did last almost 48 hours and that is with going to the gym and sweating a lot. I will be buying this in the future and do recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was given a FREE trial size to test out as a BzzAgent and I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  I like how the gel keeps me dry and doesn&#x27;t create any pesky wet spots under my arms.  The fresh scent also lasts and lasts throughout even the hottest and busiest of days.  The one thing I did not like was the sticky feeling that this left.  That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; and give it 5 stars.  I think this is a great product and worth buying if you have wet spot issues or are very active.  I plan to keep some of this on hand for days when I know I&#x27;m going to sweat a bit more, but it won&#x27;t replace my regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> When your on the go this fast drying no mark deodorant is the only way to go. It keeps you feeling dry and fresh all day long</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I will never go back to the &amp;#34;Invisible Solid&#x27;s&amp;#34; again. This new product now dries faster after being applied, and also keeps you dry for hours. I have totally forgotten to put deodorant on one morning before leaving to go to work, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry because I knew that I had applied it yesterday, and it would protect me for another 24 hours!!! I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t do this in the beginning!</li>
    <li> Received Secret Clear Gel Deodorant from Bzzagent.com for free. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a little over a week and I&#x27;m loving it. No white marks and I smell great even after a sweaty workout. The only downside is that the gel is awfully slimy and will leak out to the sides of my armpits. Overall I&#x27;m loving it and would buy it again</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from BzzAgent and was so glad I did. This product is amazing!  It keeps my dry through the whole work day and even short workouts during lunch. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, no white streaks or breakouts to speak of either.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this product after trying it free with BzzAgent.  When I initially tried this product, I loved.  Secret Outlast Completely Clear is completely clear, whether it is your arms, your clothes, whatever.  It does on clear and dries clear.  Invisible solids go on your skin clear, but on your clothes they can leave white marks.  Not this product!  My compliant is that it does not last 48 hours.  It is not as if I have ever tried, but what I know is that I need to reapply this deodorant long before my traditional invisible solid, which is also supposed to last 48 hours.  I also feel like I am using more of the Secret Outlast than I do my normal product to get the same result.  Finally the gel get on the outside of the container when you apply the product, which is not unusual for a deodorant, but if you do not wipe it off right away, it gets impossibly sticky and hard to handle.  So while the product is great on whiteness, it does not deliver all it promises.</li>
    <li> I have used Invisible solids for years, so I was eager to give Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel a try and was glad that BzzAgent had a campaign for me to try it out. I used the gel after showering. I made sure my underarms were dry first and applied 2 clicks as the product suggested to use 2-3 clicks. The product didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry in seconds&amp;#34; like it said it would. It actually took about 10 minutes for the gel to dry. I figured this was because I put my arm down and the gel wasn&#x27;t exposed to the air, but when I applied the gel a few days later, I left my arm up in the air and it still took about 2 minutes for the gel to completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product says that it can last up to 48 hours, so I put this to the test. I went 48 hours without applying more gel and to my surprise, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with odor! I really loved this about the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. What I didn&#x27;t really like was that toward the end of day one, I was in the kitchen baking dinner and I did feel some wetness under my arms. I didn&#x27;t have any odor issues, but the wet feeling just made me uncomfortable and self-conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel like I&#x27;m going to stick with my invisible solid for now, but I was definitely impressed by the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel&#x27;s odor protection.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It really does offer 48 hr. odor protection . I like that it dries really fast when u put it on so that it does rub off on your clothes when you put them on. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my dark blouses either which is a plus. The only negative for me is the smell wouldn&#x27;t mind something a little different than the medicinal smell from this product other than that it is great.</li>

    <li> I received this deodorant free through one of BzzAgents campaigns.  (great site by the way!)  I have often used secret brand but am usually picky about the scent and how long I have to wait to get dressed after applying.  This particular clear gel is wonderful for drying quick - so no marks on the clothing!  And it smells great too!  Even after working a full 8 hour day and a quick workout!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was thoroughly surprised by this product. Now understand that the secret brand has been a favorite of mine for years, but never a clear gel (I always felt like they took too long to dry) and most of the scents were too overwhelming for me. But this product has literally changed my views on that forever. After years of being stuck wearing the same unscented solid I have moved on the clear gel protection that actually works and does an impressive job and keeping me dry well into multiple days. This is the best. I did receive this product as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I had used Secret deodorant in the past and was a bit skeptical about this one, but when I was given the opportunity to try it in a BzzAgent campaing I decided to give it a try and see if it was in fact better than before (or better than the one I was using at the time).  I received the product to try for free but I must say the opinions expresses are my own and I express my true feelings about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product, I will admit it took a while for the gel to reach the top, I might not remember exactly but it was well over 20 turns before I finally saw anything coming out of it.  It does not affect the product, just thought I mentioned that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overwhelming, you can go on with your day and not feel like it interferes with your perfume, lotion or whatever other scent you might have going on.  It is a huge deal for me because I have used deodorants before that are so strong and you end up smelling like you tried every perfume on.  It will protect you but you won&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t go the 48 hours without showering or reapplying deodorant so I don&#x27;t know whether it will protect you for that long.  I did applied in the morning and had no issues going through my whole day without the need to reapply and I feel very protected and clean.  No unpleasant smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel dries up in seconds, I was very impressed to be quite honest.  No need to keep your arms up in the air for who knows how long, waiting for it to dry (like old times).  Just apply and you can move on to something else right away.  Also, no white stains or stains of any kind were noticed by me when I used this deodorant.  The instructions state to apply 2-3 clicks but sometimes one is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product a 4 star is because one morning I had walked out to the library (about 2 blocks away) and even though I was walking incredibly slow, it was a windy but sunny day and on my way back I was already perspiring and I could feel my shirt wet.  Maybe I need Clinical Strength, who knows.wet.  Maybe I need Clinical Strength, who knows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of gel type deodorants, they&#x27;re aways freezing cold! However, I can deal with the momentary pit discomfort for this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full time job as well as an active 10 year old son so my morning routine is best described as chaotic. Between dragging him out of bed to get ready while trying to get myself ready I don&#x27;t have time to put on deodorant and casually meander through my closet thoughtfully choosing an outfit while my armpits dry. Most of my wardrobe is mix and match black and grey which means I grab what&#x27;s clean and shimmy into it quickly. Many times this has led to me jogging out the door with a damp towel attempting to scrub white marks off my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully that problem is a thing of the past now that I&#x27;ve found Secret Outlast Gel. I&#x27;ve worn probably every shade of grey as well as black and never had even a hint of a white streak. This stuff really is invisible.</li>
    <li> As a part time stay at home mom, let&#x27;s face it, there are days when your kids are cleaner than you! I received this as part of a Bzzagent campaign and I had to chuckle a little bit since my husband teases me for showering every other day. (It&#x27;s good for your hair anyways!) I was very skeptical about a \\&quot;48 hour\\&quot; clear gel, but I have to say, I was very impressed! On Mondays and Tuesdays every week I am home with my kids, and incidentally it usually coincides with my \\&quot;no make up\\&quot; and likely, \\&quot;no shower\\&quot; day (Don&#x27;t judge!) I used one of these two days as my tester days of trying out this new clear gel and I will say I stayed as fresh as could be allowed with a frequently spitty baby! I don&#x27;t normally wear clear gels because I don&#x27;t like how long they take to dry. However, this formula dries quickly. In addition, after I would shave clear gels would often sting and leave red bumps. This was not the case with this clear gel either! Congrats Secret, this has changed my mind about using clear gels! The only downfall is that these bottles do not seem to last as long as the standard solid deodorant.  I give this gel a thumbs up! :-)</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product to review. I enjoyed using this deodorant but didn&#x27;t feel that it worked for me the way it claimed. I was impressed that it left no residue on me or my clothes. it was a little awkward to put on as I always put deodorant on after I get dressed first. It did offer good wetness and odor protection but not for 48 hours that the product claimed. I did like the fact as how fast it dried though and it did not feel like it was dripping down my arms after i put it on. Overall, i feel that it was a good product but not good enough that I will change from what i currently use.</li>
    <li> I received this Gel Antiperspirant as part of a promotion of Secret.  I&#x27;m very particular about the scent of my antiperspirant. Secret Outlast has a very light clean smell.  Its not overpowering and not too noticeable.  I&#x27;m left just smelling and feeling fresh.  The clear gel is a true clear gel.  It doesn&#x27;t mark up my clothes when getting dressed.  The gel easily slides on and stays on. When I wear Secret Outlast I feel protected against odor and wetness.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant as part of a free sample trial.  I am very pleased with this deodorant.  I like that it is a clear gel.  Now when I put on my clothes  after applying Secret Outlast I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting white deodorant stains all over my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;The gel dries pretty fast and I believe a little goes a long way.  I received the free trial of the Secret Outlast in the Fall.  I do wish I had received it during the hotter months.  I feel that it does keep me dry and odor free, but it would have helped even more if it was Summer.  I would get a real good idea how it works then.  I will keep using this however, and will know the answer by next summer.</li>
    <li> I been using the Secret Outlast for a month now. It smells great and offers complete protection, great for using when you go to the gym. I got it from BzzCampain website, but definatly buying one when its run out.</li>
    <li> I got a the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear deodorant through BzzAgent.com. It smells great and really keeps me dry all day long! Does not leave any white marks. I love the scents. Much better than any other deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received the Clean Clear Gel thru BzzAgent to try this product and share how I thought it worked. I received the gel at the beginning of November and it was just in time for fall weather, sweaters and the multiple on/offs we do inside-outside! I LOVED how there were no white marks on ANY of my sweaters! Even worked all the way thru date night and about 4-5 outfit changes to get ready! It does take a week or so to get used to the cold and wet feeling rather than dry deodorant. I felt dry, clean and ready to make it my permanent antiperspirant.... but then the bumps appeared and non-stop itchiness(about 2 weeks of using it on a regular basis). After 2 weeks straight, apparently my sensitive skin could not take the super strength of this antiperspirant. A few days of using my prior deodorant and all was well. So, my recommendation, if you do not have sensitive skin BUY THIS ONE!! If you&#x27;re a little more on the sensitive side, I&#x27;d say the occasional use would be fine. Perfect for a day of shopping at the mall and trying on ALL those cute sweater dresses without worrying about marking them up!</li>
    <li> I received this from Bzzagent to try and review.  Had used Secret in the past but this new formula is awesome! Just as promised, it goes on clear dries fast and leaves NO white residue.  As always keeps you dry and odor free, but the no &amp;#34;deodorant spots&amp;#34; is important!!  This will be in my bathroom from now on!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from BzzAgent, and I was curious. I&#x27;ve used it several times, and it&#x27;s done its job in some sweaty situations. I used it before hiking and after the hike still smelled fresh. It has a nice clean scent that smells good but is not too girly. It works great, and the only downfall is getting used to the gel. It goes on a little wet and though it dries quickly, it definitely feels weird at first. It takes a while to get used to, but it does the job well.</li>
    <li> I tried the Secret Outlast t Completely Clean scent women&#x27;s clear gel deodrant and I really liked it it works great for those strong odors and lasts all day long I would recommend this to anyone I tried it from BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast through Bzzagent.com.  I was very skeptical because I have tried other gel deodorants only to find that they would not dry fast enough leaving a wet mark on the pits of my shirts and I would end up reapplying throughout the day.  When I first applied Secret Outlast, I expected to flap my arms as usual to try and get it dry before getting dressed, but to my surprise it dried very quickly and lasted ALL day long.  Great price, fast drying, and all day protection.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I have been trying out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for a few weeks now from the sample that I got for free from Bzzagent. I already use Secret deodorant, but typically use an invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used gel deodorant in the distant past but never quite liked it because of that goopy feeling you get when you put it on, but I decided to give this another chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some definite pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No white marks on clothes or residue under arms like can happen with the invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;It dries fast so while you still do get that wet feeling it goes away in less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;Wetness protection is very good as I tried it out even in some places that were very hot and crowded where I&#x27;d usually start to get sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This didn&#x27;t bother me but I know for some the scent may be an issue. I don&#x27;t mind it but after just applying the deodorant my husband asked me if I had just brushed my teeth with my daughter&#x27;s bubblegum flavored toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It is more drying than the invisible solid and by the end of the day it sometimes leaves me with itchy armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing really holding me back from making this my full-time deodorant is the itchy dry skin thing. I probably right now am 50/50 using this deodorant and my old one. But I think in the summertime when its hotter, or I&#x27;m wearing sleeveless clothes, or any time I&#x27;m more concerned about white marks I&#x27;m going to use this clear gel.</li>
    <li> Secret outlast completely Clean keeps you dry  It goes on clear without the wetness that other clear deodorants leave on clothes.  No matter if you are working out or just a day at the office this antiperspirant will keep you dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many deodorants, many claiming to be clinical strength. In fact, I have a drawer full. None worked like they said they would.&lt;br /&gt;Now see, I&#x27;m a busy, stressed mom and wife. Its extremely important that I&#x27;m not walking around with white, wet spots under my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;Just when I thought I had to resign myself to the horror of white and wet, along comes Secret Outlast from BzzAgent. And wow! Finally, I&#x27;m not wet, I&#x27;m not stinky, and no white spots on my beautiful black clothes!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works. Its smells lightly, but beautifully. It kept working for 2 days, yes, I forgot to reapply one day, and this stuff just kept on going. It kept going through 2 days of bathing 3 kids, cooking dinner for the family, scrubbing floors and cleaning house,. I even stayed dry dealing with my Inlaws! Us moms are busy, and this helped make my life a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Secret Outlast! Now I can finally throw away the other deodorants! All I need in my drawer now is you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when a deodorant product promises a full 24-hour protection, so I was doubly skeptical when I got the BzzAgent notice I was going to be participating in this campaign.&lt;br /&gt;I did not get 48 hours of protection, but I did get a full 24 hours of protection, which is pretty impressive in my opinion. It didn&#x27;t dry as quick as it said, but there were no white marks or smudges on my clothes which is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> I received a free Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel Antiperspirant to try out from BzzAgent.com.  The truth is that I am usually pretty happy with the Products I try out, but sometimes not so much.  This was one of the times where I tried and tried to like the product, but the truth is that I don&#x27;t really care for the gel type antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, even this one has that wet sticky feeling when you put it on and I just don&#x27;t like it. It takes a minute to dry, even if you use a hair dryer (which I don&#x27;t recommend because then it kind of never feels truly dry.  Can&#x27;t explain that.)  I just don&#x27;t care for the feeling.  My husband uses clear gels, but I prefer my solid.  I love Secret solid and thought that I might like this too, but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I never had any problems with it transferring to my clothing so that is good and the scent is very mild, so I am okay with that part.  It&#x27;s just that overall, I much prefer the solid to the gel.  I would use it if it was all I had, but I would not choose it if I had the choice between this and solid.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  It kept me dry all day at work.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast has a clean Fresh feeling, doesnt leave your armpits feeling wet, and it doesnt leave white marks. I got this product as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is pretty amazing. I was given a sample through BzzAgent and love it. I have always used Secret brand deodorant but still had trouble every now and then with white residue on black shirts. The Secret Outlast glides on quickly and dries almost immediately leaving absolutely no white. I was shocked at how well it worked throughout a 1-hr spin class, shower and the rest of the day and night. No sweating (from my armpits at least). I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used Secret deodorant for many years, however I was skeptical about changing from white solid to clear gel. Although I still prefer my white solid, the clear gel did worm really well and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. It had great staying power and kept me feeling fresh throughout the day.    I received a free sample from BzzAgent to try and review. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> Super fresh! I got this product from BzzAgnt for free to try and to rate. It is overall a great product that has lasting protection. I tested the 48 hour protection (by putting on the deodorant one day and the next going without) and it worked! I was pleasantly surprised (as well as others I am sure). I would recommend using this product at the gym. It isn&#x27;t to over powering (smell) but it keeps the nasty smells at bay! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used Secret for many years and this is another quality product.  The only thing that I do not like about is that it&#x27;s a bit sticky when first applied.  It does dry quickly and I think the benefits are worth it.  If you are very active and sweaty, this is a great product for you.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received the invitation to participate in a BzzAgent campaign for this product. Secret has provided the product, free of charge, so I could try it out and give my opinion of it as a method of advertising through word-of-mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret is my brand; I&#x27;ve used it the most since I started wearing deodorant some 35 years ago.  Yes, I&#x27;ve tried others and been disappointed to a Degree, but nothing prepared me for the literal pain and mental anguish I would experience with this.  Why, oh why, Secret, would you release a product that burns like fire (remember Eddie Murphy&#x27;s stand-up about the first time he shaved, using after shave not only on his face, but...yeah) on freshly shaved skin?  We&#x27;re talking an extended burn - one that has you hopping from foot to foot, with a yowl (YEE-OUCH!).  Initially, I commmented that perhaps I needed to change the blade on my razor, but that didn&#x27;t help one iota.  I think I was quite brave (or simply foolish?) to try it a few more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that while it wasn&#x27;t my favorite product, it&#x27;s not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t pass it on to my worst enemy.  Now if I can figure out how to slip it into her bathroom...</li>
    <li> I tried this product, I usually prefer solid but this gel is quick drying. It smells great and I&#x27;m dry all day! #GotItFree It didn&#x27;t quite protect me for 48 hours as advertised but it worked great on day 1.</li>
    <li> I just love this deodorant!  I have always been a Secret customer, but have traditionally used the Secret solid in the fresh breeze scent.  However, I struggled almost daily with the dreaded &amp;#34;white marks&amp;#34; on my clothing.  I tried gels in the past and have never been a fan.  They seemed to always go on kind of sticky and I really did not like the scent.  Secret changed all of that with this product.  Goes on clear, is definitely NOT sticky, and lasts all day long.  I would definitely recommend this product to other users.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use gel deodorant but this one was pretty good. It does exactly what it says. I work with kids and we are extra active and this keeps me smelling fresh and clean. I also don&#x27;t have any complaints when it comes to the clear part, my black shirts stay black. My tank tops don&#x27;t have any additional marks when I put them on. I will be buying more. Thanks bzzagent for adding me to this campaign.</li>
    <li> This product kept me clean and clear on my recent Hawaii vacation.  I hiked volcanoes, ran in the morning, and hula danced on stage.  At the end of every activity, I still felt and smelled fresh.  Love it!  I always smelled fresh and never had to worry about white marks.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Secret allowed me to try this product for free. I normally use Secret Clinical,  which has been my go to deodorant for years. The only downside of it is the white marks I get on my clothing occasionally. I was very excited to try this product. In the past, I&#x27;ve found that gel deodorants didn&#x27;t work well for me. I would still develop some body odor and get the dreaded wet sweat stains in my arm pits. This product is a huge step in the right direction for gel deodorants. I would say 90% of the time no odor develops within 24 hours. I still notice some body odor every now and then. It does prevent sweating to a certain degree,  but it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as Secret Clinical. I think Secret Outlast is perfect for days when you won&#x27;t be sweating a lot and need to  prevent white marks on your clothing. Secret Clinical is still my go to deodorant because it prevents body odor 100% of the time and still offers the best protection against sweating.</li>
    <li> I received secret outlast from brand in order to try out. I normally don&#x27;t use gel deodorants.  I am more of a fan of the invisible solids, but was excited to try this and see if its claims were true.  The product claims to leave no white marks or residue on clothing because it’s rub-off resistant.  It goes on clear, stays on clear. It has fast drying ingredients that evaporate in seconds and will protect you from odor and wetness for 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;  As soon as I applied it, it dried, which I really wasn&#x27;t expecting from a gel.  I have used gels before and have always had to flap my arms up and down and wait for it to dry which is why I never liked them.  I had to do the black t-shirt test to really prove that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks. I’m so happy for that.&lt;br /&gt;  The fragrance is fresh. I tested it eighteen hours. No problems with odor or wetness at all.  So, I’m in love for this product.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you love having zero white marks like I do, check out some secret Outlast Clear Gel in your life!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, I will consider buying it in the future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time lately with excessive perspiration and the unfortunate body odor that accompanies it. I received a full size sample of Secret Outlast as a participant a Buzz Campaign. The product doesn&#x27;t leave a film or residue when applied. The scent is not too overwhelming. Overall, I have noticed less embarrassing wetness and odor with the product. I will continue to use it as long as I see results</li>
    <li> Ireceived the product as part of a promotion from the brand, but my opinions are my own...  Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel deodorant.  After trying this deodorant, I have been swayed...for certain occasions.  Let me start with my cons:  1.  The wet and cold application.  While this could be a pro in the hot summer, not so much in the colder weather.  2.  I found there to be a delay when you turned the knob for the product to come out, resulting in too much coming out.  Not only is it wasteful, but you end up putting too much on one side- you can&#x27;t disperse it.  3.  If you just shaved prior to application, it burns when you put it on.  There were just as many pros:  1.  Obviously, no marking on clothes.  It was nice not to have any white spots that even invisible solids leave behind.  2.  I tested the 48hr protection claim...It works! Still smelled fresh after 48hrs.  3.  The scent was pleasant...I had the completely clean scent.    I&#x27;m not planning on switching to a clear gel full time, but I plan on having this on hand for my sleeveless days!</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is .y new favorite deodorant.  It does not leave any wet, white, or sticky residue on your clothes. It is very fast drying.  It may seem very wet when you first put it on but it dries within seconds.  The smell is clean and protects you all day from any sweat or smell. I will.now be usinf gel deodorant from this day forward. Thanks to Sexret and Bzzagent for letting me try it free.</li>
    <li> I tried this product free as a promotion from Secret.  I loved that it dried quickly, so you are not left with a sticky feeling.  I don&#x27;t feel like it lived up to the 48hrs of protection, though.  There were days I had to apply deoderAnt twice to make it thru the day</li>
    <li> I love how our this dries, leaves no white marks and I still get the great odor and wetness control I expect from this brand.  I received a free sample from bzzagent but the opinions are my own and I have already purchased more of it!!!  Great new product.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried gel deodorants before, and I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with them. Most leave a sticky feeling and don&#x27;t do all that much to protect you from grossness. Still, when I got a free review unit, I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. I&#x27;ve had good luck with Secret products in the past, so it seemed worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did Secret&#x27;s Clear Gel provide good protection, it didn&#x27;t smear or get white residue on shirts like some clear deodorants manage to do. As someone who goes to the gym regularly and spends a lot of time in dark tank tops, this is great. It&#x27;s even better when I&#x27;m at circus school, since the clear gel doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on the aerial silks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only hesitation about this deodorant is that I&#x27;m not sure how it will perform in warmer weather. I received it in the fall and I&#x27;ve used it through recent wintery weather, but summer can be a completely different story, especially in humid areas. It seems on par with other non-clear offerings, though,so I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a solid deodorant person because I didn&#x27;t like the wet feeling gels leave behind but Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is dramatically different from others I have tried.  It dries nearly immediately and does not leave a sticky feeling throughout the day.  I would say the protection lasts as long as others I have tried, I&#x27;m not sure it could hold out for a full 48 hours.  I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as a free trial from a Bzz campaign.  The scent was pleasant and not over powering and the product lasted a long time, good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample of SECRET OUTLAST® to try.  I liked the smell of the clear gel.  I also liked how long the deodorant actually lasted. It really did last a long time, I&#x27;m talking a few days!  I didn&#x27;t have to apply deodorant everyday. It goes on completely clear and I did not have to worry about it showing up on my black shirts either.  It goes on wet and dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the SECRET OUTLAST® clear gel was how cold it felt when I was applying it. Im used to solid deodorant and when applying the gel it kind of gives you the chills at first. But I would not say that&#x27;s a bad thing just something that I personally don&#x27;t like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all the SECRET OUTLAST® was a great deodorant and I would highly recommend it for anyone who needs long lasting protection that smells good and helps you feel better knowing you deodorant will last as long as you do.</li>
    <li> I am a Buzzagent and received a free sample and coupons for this product.  I&#x27;ve used many different products throughout the years, and am always faced with those white streaks and after sometime an unpleasant scent.  Because of that I sometimes choose not use deodorant.  I&#x27;m not active and I have a desk job, and I turn on the air conditioner.  But living in Hawaii, it does get hot outside.  After receiving my free sample, I found that it is true, not white streaks.  Also, I&#x27;m happy to report that there is no unpleasant scent after a long day, instead I can still smell the fresh scent of this product.  Additionally, I do not put so much on as, that would of course make it feel icky.  The only thing I worry about is because it is a little liquidy, I worry that it will run out quickly.  But I&#x27;m careful to make sure there is just a little to apply when it comes out so I don&#x27;t waste.  All in all, I will continue to use this product.  Oh and another thing I&#x27;d like to share is that when I&#x27;m out and about there is no wet feeling from the perspiration when using this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clear Clean Scent from BzzAgent to try. I am so impressed with Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel deodorant. It left no white marks and kept me protected all night long. I borrowed a very expensive dress from my good friend for a fancy event. I felt like Cinderella in the dress and I knew that I had to return it at midnight. I was so worried about what deodorant I was going to use because I didn&#x27;t want to leave any white marks on her dress. I used Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel and it left no residue on the dress or me. It drys faster than any other deodorant I have used in the past. I was very happy and anxiety free at the event.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and have been lucky enough to receive this product as a promotional offer and I must say that it&#x27;s definitely one I recommend. It offers protection for the entire day without having to worry about having to reapply later on. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks or that sticky feeling you get with the other powder deodorants. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I found the scent a little overwhelming. If I were to purchase this product in the future, I would probably get the unscented one.</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant free from BzzAgent to try and review. I was very skeptical initially because I do not like gel deodorants. I was really surprised by the Secret Outlast. It dried quickly and clear. No residue whatsoever. Secret Outlast did not feel sticky and wet. I would have given it 5 stars, but my preference is an invisible solid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to gels that are mushy and take forever to dry.  That is not the case at all with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel. It really dries super fast.  I still don&#x27;t love the feeling of the gel, but it is better than any other gel formula I&#x27;ve tried.  It works pretty well, if I have a day of heavy sweating I may have to reapply once throughout the day. If its a cold day like the ones we have been having lately, it lasts all day with no problem.  It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave nay white marks on your clothes which is a definite plus. I received a sample of this product as part of a promotion with Bzzagent, but it in no way affected my review of the product.</li>
    <li> As part of a BzzAgent campaign (www.bzzagent.com), I received a stick of Secret Outlast Clear Gel in the &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent (for free), and have been using the product for over a month now.  Prior to this I had used Degree Invisible Solid in &amp;#34;Shower Clean&amp;#34; almost exclusively for a decade, but may switch to Secret permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the Secret Outlast Clear Gel was that it smells great.  The &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; is named well - it truly is a clean, light scent; it is noticeable without being overly fragrant.  I don&#x27;t like unscented antiperspirants, but I also don&#x27;t like those that are floral or perfume-y/cologne-y smelling.  Although I did not test out Secret&#x27;s &amp;#34;48-hour odor protection&amp;#34; claim, I found that the odor protection lasted quite a long time - longer than any other antiperspirant I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel took a little getting used to.  It&#x27;s definitely cool when first applied, which can be a bit startling on a cold morning.  The Secret campaign claims that the gel is fast drying and will &amp;#34;evaporate in seconds&amp;#34; – I find that it usually takes about 30 seconds (while fanning) for it to dry completely, which is a bit longer than I would have expected based on this claim.  What makes this all worth it: the clear gel never leaves any white marks or residue on my clothes, which was a daily problem for me with Degree (despite being labeled an &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find the antiperspirant as good as I would have hoped.  I definitely sweat through the clear gel faster than the solids I have used, but this might not be a problem for others.  Plus, Secret Clear Gel&#x27;s odor protection is so good that this has not been enough of an inconvenience to cause me to switch back to Degree.  Overall, I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to try and give my honest opinion of.  I always use stick deodorant but was very excited to give this a try.  First, I do not like the scent AT ALL.  It gives me a headache.  The other scent might be better, I don&#x27;t know.  Secondly, it does not dry quickly for me at all.  It feels wet and sticky for several minutes and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to me.  I do not think it provides adequate odor protection either - late in the day I notice it is wearing off.  That never happens with my current inexpensive stick deodorant and I expected much more from this product since it claims to last for 48 hours.  I guess the only plus is the no white residue.  As for me, I am going back to my cheap stick deodorant after this is gone - I do not think this is worth what it costs nor is it effective.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does exactly what it says. It smells good, goes on clear and stays cool and dry all day! We went to a wedding and it left no marks on my black dress and kept me smelling great all night long!</li>
    <li> I love the new secret outlast it lasted all day and night and kept me smelling good! I also love that it didn&#x27;t leave white marks and I never felt wet under my arms like with other gel deodorant! Got it free from secret!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use clear gel...but I received this from BzzAgent as a sample and I fell in love with it! I will definitely be buying more when my sample is done!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast from BzzAgent and this review is 100% of my own. I absolutely love Secret Outlast. The smell is wonderful. The fact that I stay dry all day is great and there are no more streaks on my clothes. I recently used another deodarant and within 1 hour I was wet and sticky...( I threw it away). I will definately be using Secret Outlasst everyday from now on.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample and coupons for this product, because I am a bzz agent. It kept me dry all day. I was also working outside in the sun doing landscaping and never once did it fail me.  It left no white residue on my clothing and no gunky buildup on the inside if my shirt. The only issue I had was I am not a perfume type person, and this product does have a scent. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s a wonderful scent, but I prefer the unscented kind. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> clear goes no with outlasting coverage. I really like this one though the price is was clearly out of my expectation as I refuse to pay more than $2.50 for a deodorant. This particular one I noticed that not only scents and coverage last long and also product itself lasted longer than regular secret deodorant. I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of the product and the scents as well. I would get another one and I would always look for a coupon so I can pay less as well.</li>
    <li> I received my Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a product review and used it IMMEDIATELY! I was actually moving furniture when the mail came with my product, so I definitely needed it! ;)    PACKAGING - The packaging is great! Would definitely stand out on a shelf with other brands. Easy to open and twist to dispense gel. The color of the bottle is pretty! Also, easy to pull sticker over are where the gel dispenses. Lid secures on tight.    FRAGRANCE - It smells amazing! The Completely Clean makes you feel like you just got out of the shower. Very Fresh smell! Worked fast too! Any odor or wetness I was experiencing was gone within minutes!    TIME - I found myself feeling clean and protected until the next morning! I didn&#x27;t have to reapply multiple times, which was wonderful to know that I was protected from odor and wetness.    I thought I would feel a great amount of wetness with using the Gel. It dried a lot faster than I expected, which made me confident that I would have no wetness marks on my shirt under my arms. And there is the amazing bonus of NO White Marks! A wonderful plus!    My favorite thing about this product over the others I used in the past is how fast it works! I felt clean and fresh in just minutes after applying!    The next time I&#x27;m shopping for deodorant - this will definitely be on my list!</li>
    <li> I have always chosen to use the white antiperspirant deodorants because I thought that they worked better.  I hated the sticky feeling of most clear roll-on gels until I tried this Secret product.  There is no apparent stickiness to the gel and it controlled perspiration through a rigorous workout on the treadmill.  I am loving this new product.  I did receive this product as a promotional item through Secret and Buzzagent</li>
    <li> I got this as a part of the BzzAgent product sample test. I have used secret in the past. I can say that this worked but I didn&#x27;t care for the clear gel part as it felt wet putting on and just didn&#x27;t feel good to me. It did dry (though for me felt it took awhile) but I think I will stay with the other Secret products.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast.  It lasts longer than other deodorants that I have used in the past.  It smells good.  A bonus is that it is clear so I do not have to worry about white marks on my clothes.  I also like the fact that it does not irritate my skin.  A lot of other deodorants irritate my sensitive skin.  Highly recommended.  I was able to try this product for free and I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample of this through a BzzAgent campaign.  I was overly susrpised on how much I liked this product.  It does what it says it was going to do.  No white marks.  My underarms were dry even when the rest of me was not.  I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this as I have tried clear gels before and loved the fact that it dried fast and did not feel sticky once it was dried.  The very clean scent that was not overpowering was fantastic.  If you give this a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.  Goes on smooth with no white residue! Keeps you dry and fresh ALL Day long! This is a must have for those tank tops and formal evening gowns!  Ladies you have to check this out...</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean to try out.  I usually use the invisible solid variety of Secret to avoid white marks on my clothing.  The Secret Outlast claims 48 hour protection from odor and wetness, and while I didn&#x27;t go 48 hours without washing it off and reapplying, I totally believe this claim!  This stuff is pretty incredible.  It is wet and gel like going on, but dries completely clear.  I stayed dry and odor free all day long, even on some very stressful busy days, during which I would normally feel like my deodorant wasn&#x27;t going to protect me.  I never once had to worry about embarrassing wet spots or odor while I was wearing Secret Outlast.  The Completely Clean fragrance is very fresh and didn&#x27;t compete with my fragrance, a pleasant bonus.  I would definitely recommend this product, and I will now be purchasing this as my usual deodorant.</li>
    <li> As a member of BzzAgent.com, I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for free as part of a promotional campaign. I am very familiar with the Secret brand, as I&#x27;ve purchased it many times before. I have always loved the fact that this brand never leaves those dreaded white marks and keeps you fresh and clean all day. It really is a great brand! Now, what I am not familiar with is the gel style deodorant. Personally, I&#x27;ve always liked the invisible solid the best. The feeling of the gel is going to take some getting accustomed to. It&#x27;s cold, wet and slippery. Luckily, that lasts for just a minute after application. The wetness goes away and the gel dries. After getting used to the slick feeling, the performance is what you would expect from Secret. Clean and dry protection all day and into the night! But this gel stick claims that it will keep you going strong for 48 hours. Do I dare? I did. The following day was decent. Not &amp;#34;just applied fresh&amp;#34; but protected none the less! Overall, I am pleased. I will continue using this deodorant every day, just not every other. But it is nice to know if I should forget - Secret has my back!</li>
    <li> Love it! no white deodorant stains on my daughters cheer uniform. I received this as part of a bzzagent review and I am so happy I did. I am definitely switching to Secret Outlast clear Gel.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how great this worked! I got a chance to try it through a promotion Secret was doing. I&#x27;m used to the Secret Outlast Invisible Solid and was hesitant to try the gel but it works just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue at all.  Plus, no white marks- like at all.  If my invisible solid hit my shirt first, there would be a white mark but with the gel it&#x27;s impossible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel antiperspirant has totally changed my mind.</li>
    <li> I received the Secret Outlast to try from a BzzzAgent and Secret the other day and I must say, they have done it again. I have always been a secret user and this one is just great. The wetness protection and odor protection are just what I had expected from a secret product. The no white marks... an added bonus!! This stuff works great and I will continue to be a secret user.</li>
    <li> Secret is my all time favorite deodorant it absolutely does the job and keeps me feeling fresh. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent.  It seems like there&#x27;s always a new deodorant/antiperspirant on the market claiming that it&#x27;s the best ever, so I didn&#x27;t get my hopes up too high before trying Secret Outlast.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now though, and I am pleased to report that it is living up to its claims.  It dries pretty quickly (although I wouldn&#x27;t say instantly), it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks, and it is keeping me dry and odorless.  This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for this first time this week (I was given a free product to try out).  I just had a baby last week, and my hormones are crazy, so I felt that right now might be a good time to try a new deodorant.  All you need are two clicks of the gel to get great coverage.  It dries fairly quickly, and i did not see any marks left onto my black tank tops.  It has a nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Since my hormones are crazy right now, I wouldn&#x27;t say that its coverage lasts for a 24 hour period, but it does stay on and keeps you dry for a good length of time.  I think in the future, if I notice this brand on sale or if the price is comparable to other brands, I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of the gel deodorant, because I don&#x27;t like the feeling of the gel. But the Secret Outlast did great, it was fast drying, smelled pleasant, and did great on protecting. I&#x27;m more of a solid kind of girl and can&#x27;t wait to try the solid! But I did like how the gel kept the \\&quot;stinky&#x27;s\\&quot; gone, and stayed completely clear. So, from a solid kind of girl... Great job Gel! Glad I got to try this free from Secret Outlast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a stay at home mom of three wonderful kids. My youngest son is 8 years with autism, my middle daughter is 9 with ODD, and my oldest daughter is 17 and suffers from severe teenage distress. During the week I also keep my nephew of 4 years, and my great niece of 2 years. Everyday is work, I get up, get the school aged kids off to school, make breakfast, start laundry, make beds, clean rooms, make lunch, do dishes, clean kitchen, sweep, vaccuum, finish laundry, help kids with homework, start dinner, feed kids and husband, bath kids, clean dishes again, and hope that I don&#x27;t fall asleep in the shower. Make it to bed and wake up, and repeat. I sweat on a daily basis, but Secret Outlast helped tremendously cutting down the sweat! So I&#x27;m pleased to say that I give Secret Outlast two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I got this product from BzzAgent for free to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I normally don&#x27;t buy gels because they tend to make my pits feel wet. I have to say that with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant didn&#x27;t do that for me. I like the smell that it has and the fact that it is a 48 hr protection is nice. I as a busy mother and wife try and find something that works and works well so I don&#x27;t feel like I have to repeatedly  have to put it on during the day and with this I do not feel like I have to.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time as a free sample. I love it and will be purchasing this from now on. It dried very quickly after applying and the scent was noticeable but subtle. It lasted all day and I could still smell it after a workout at the gym! I liked that it didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my shirts.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I normally use the solid deodorants.  I have never been a fan of gel.  I got an opportunity to try the gel in a campaign. I am a mom of four boys and I have to say it lasted through all the cooking, cleaning and baseball games. The product works.  I only have it 3 stars because I am not a fan of the gel.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free as a promotonal offer. Goes on clear, dries fast so you no longer have to worry about white marks. It has a great clean scent, unlike competing clear gels I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I have used Secret gels before, and this one is a good one. Goes on clear (no more white streaks!), dries quickly, smells good, and provides good protection most of the day. I knocked off a star because I feel that the Clinical Strength types provide better protection and nicer scents, but I would use this again as a second choice!</li>
    <li> Whenever I think of gel deodorants, I think of messy, greasy armpits, so when I received the Secret Completely Clean Gel to try for free from BzzAgent as part of a campaign, I was (admitingly) nervous. Being a true sport, I put it on the first thing after my shower and was surprised with how fast the gel actually dried! At the end of my day of running errands with a grumpy child, I was extremely happy with how clean and fresh smelling I still was. The best thing that I have found though is that there isn&#x27;t any white mark residue! Woohoo, finally a deodorant I can depend on.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use Secret deodorant because there products don&#x27;t work on me, but I received the outlast from buzzagent and was pleasantly surprised. The product kept me dry and smelling fresh. I am not huge fan of gels because it takes so long for it to dry but I do like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes. I give it a four out of five stars since it takes awhile for the gel to dry.</li>
    <li> I received the secret deodorant as part of a BZZZAgent reviewer. Does as it says. No white marks, no sweat and most important no smelly underarms. I love this deodorant</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product (it&#x27;s just very fresh and clean), and the gel goes on clear and dries fast.  It feels very cool and refreshing.  My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t live up to the claim of 48 hours of odor protection...I definitely had to reapply after one day, and I feel that it didn&#x27;t really control my toughest sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer:  I received a sample of this product as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this Secret Outlast product as a BzzAgent &amp; have to say I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite.  I work in a very physical job that requires me to work long hours before I&#x27;m able to take any type of brakes.  The Secret Outlast gives me the protection I need &amp; doesn&#x27;t give up on me throughout the day.  The only downside is that it does take a bit to dry once first applied.</li>
    <li> Through BzzAgent and Secret, I was able to try the Secret Outlast Xtend for free. I’ve been using the gel deodorant since last month. Here are my thoughts about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning on a positive note, there were a lot of things to like about this gel deodorant. The first two being the scent and texture. Why? Because it has a very clean fragrance and it absorbs into my skin quickly. It simply makes me feel as though I’m not actually wearing a deodorant. Plus, it didn’t stain my clothes. This is where the good ends and the bad begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this deodorant is long-lasting, it doesn’t last 24 hours or more. I’ve been testing it daily. So far, it has lasted between 12 to 14 hours without reapplication. Obviously, this will vary according to your lifestyle. In my case, I’m highly active during the weekdays and that very likely played a big role in my results. Nevertheless, this wasn’t a huge issue for me because it protects me when I need it the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I’m satisfied with the gel deodorant. It works well for the most part and it outperforms other brands I’ve used. So, is it worth buying? Yes, but only if your lifestyle isn’t extremely active. If you’re more active than usual, you should probably go for something that works better. As for me, I’ll keep this one on my shopping list because it meets my standards—nice smell, no stickiness, and clean shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This review was edited on Feb. 4, 2016.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. Originally I was hesitant about using a gel deodorant since I usually stick with the solid variety. I am also very picky since I have very sensitive skin. I was very pleased with the results of this product and it turns out that I had no reason to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret has always been a brand that I have trusted. But I&#x27;ve never really experienced using a clear deodorant. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I prefer the clear over the solid. It left me with a clean feeling that I don&#x27;t experience with the solid. And I did not have to worry about white marks on my clothes which has always been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a fabulous scent that lasts throughout the day. I love that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but clean and fresh instead. I am also loving that it doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky when applied. Kudos to you, Secret for another excellent product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant!  It goes on clear and without a mess. It has a great clean smell! Not to mention it doesnt leave any white marks on your clothing! I would say its little black dress approved! #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I received this as a free item from BzzAgent. I was previously a white solid deodorant user, because I have always found clear solids to be slimy and sticky. I&#x27;m very impressed with Secret&#x27;s Outlast. It literally took seconds to dry, had a light clean fragrance, and kept me dry and stink free all day! Not to mention,  no white marks! Big fan.</li>
    <li> I have had the chance to try this product free thanks to BzzAgent! Absolutely wonderful. No white marks, no odor, no worries! Now that is a deodorant doing its job. Outlast is a gel that comes out in perfect little doses for your underarms. Its great because you know your using it to it capacity and getting every penny&#x27;s worth. It stops odor and wetness just like you hope it would and no white streaks is like the cherry on top.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I tried it for the first time and was impressed with how fast it dried. The only negative I can find is that I typically enjoy a deodorant with a scent that lasts all day. I can&#x27;t detect any scent at all. But it does its job and keeps me dry all day. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I, unlike most reviews, like this product I do like the clear and its called moderation a little goes a long way. So many complaints, this is deodorant not paint, you apply as comfortable and I have no issues with the product. It goes on easily as it is water based. It is not meant to be a glue and it is not meant to be sticky. It stays on all day and comes in many scents depending on your choice. Secret always has consumer in mind and comes out with new products all the time, maybe this one is not for some. i have been using secret for many years and it just seems to get better with age. this clear gels comes out easily and smoothly. it leaves no residue on your clothes or cake-i-ness under your arms. it washes off as easily as it applies. it leaves me fresh and comfortable the whole day through. ifeel it would be perfect for any age ** as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.**</li>
    <li> goes on clear, smells great &amp; my skin is softer. perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I had tried gel deodorants years ago and found that I didn&#x27;t like the wet feeling when applying it. I decided to give Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel a try when I was offered a sample as part of a BzzCampaign. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m still not a fan of the cold/wet feeling when applying this antiperspirant. I think it works to keep me smelling fresh, but my enjoyment of it pretty much stops there. I feel like invisible solids last longer and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;eww&amp;#34; factor when applying. I will continue to give it a fair shot until this tube is gone, but I most likely will be changing back to an invisible solid.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Free from BzzAgent. I usually use a solid stick, but occasionally use gels.  I liked the scent of this product and the faster than average dry time.  I did not feel that it provided protection that lasted longer than other varieties of Secret, however it did meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from bzzagent.com. I have the secret outlast unscented gel. I recently moved from a cooler climate to a hot and humid climate. Also, I&#x27;m extremely active and run at least 5 days a week. I love this deodorant, but miss having a nice scent that pairs with that protection. I think next time I&#x27;ll try the scented Secret outlast. Overall, I felt confident that I was odor free.</li>
    <li> Have to say I love it. Normally I don&#x27;t buy the gel because of the cold wet feeling. This one dries quickly so you&#x27;re not walking around all morning feeling uncomfortable. As a SAHM my days are long and busy. So far so good. This new secret outlast has kept up with me and my kids. Also impressed with 0 white marks. I&#x27;m often wearing layers because of where we live going out into the cold back into the heat and repeat. Usually I take off my sweater and find white marks on my nursing tank. Not anymore. Its nice to look and feel more put together at mom-meet ups.</li>
    <li> Goes on clear, dries quickly, leaves no wet marks, and offers superior wetness protection...what more could you ask for?  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> This great deodorant is great for 48 hour protection and drys quick. I tried it as a promotional campaign from BzzAgent and loved it. No more white marks, works as well or better than clinical deodorants. Also has a great floral note smell.</li>
    <li> the 48 hour protection is amazing, and the scent is nice.  i received this as a promotion from the brand, and was very excited to try it out.  on the day it arrived, i was wearing a tube top, so popped some on as soon as i opened the box.  i think i must have used too much, because it stayed sticky for the rest of the day.  now, after trying it with only *2* twists of the tube, i&#x27;m much happier!  i used some with a silk blouse to go out to dinner last night as a test, and it kept me dry and fresh all evening ... with none of the rubbing off that my usual powder-fresh stick does.</li>
    <li> I received this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Women&#x27;s Clear Gel through a product promotion from BzzAgent. #GotItFree  I vaguely remember trying a clear gel deodorant many years ago, and not being impressed.  Nowadays, I find that since having children and reaching 40 years old, I need to use something stronger.  Regular deodorants tend to fade before my day is through... and this mama ain&#x27;t got time for that! ;)  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to try this deodorant for free, and it was an added bonus that it was Secret brand, since that is what I&#x27;ve been using for more than 20 years!  So, without further ado, here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last 10 days, I have been using Secret Outlast and it has protected me well.  My days are quite long (up at 7am and often going to bed at 1am) but Secret Outlast did not give up on me.  As promised, I did not have any issues with white streaks on my clothing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two issues I have with Secret Outlast, and the reason why I gave it 4 stars- is that when I apply the clear gel, it takes a long time to dry. Admittedly, I always seem to be running out of time in the morning when I am getting ready, so every second counts.  It seems like a really long time before I can put my shirt on without having to worry about it getting wet.  Also, I don&#x27;t really like how the gel feels on my skin.  That being said, it is a very good product and does what it is advertised to do.  I will definitely be finishing up what I have left, but will be returning back to the Secret Clinical Strength solid that I have been using for years.  The gel is just not for me.</li>
    <li> I actually love it since it does work for 48 hours and definitelyno white marks!  I just wished there were a slight scent.</li>
    <li> Es un buen producto. No deja manchas, seca rápido y tiene muy buen olor . Máxima protección y dura bastante. A mi me encanta.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.  It goes on as clear gel and it dries fast.  It did not leave any white residue on my black shirt or stain any of my shirts like some gels have in the past. It kept me feeling dry and fresh throughout the day.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the Secret Brand Clear Gel Outlast Deodorant.  It is not just a deodorant, but an antiperspirant as well.  It is so easy to apply.  I love the way you turn the bottom and the gel comes through the holes at the top, evenly distributed to cover every area of your underarm.  It has a pleasant and clean scent that is not too strong or overpowering.  It also dried very quickly which is so convenient in the morning when you are rushing to get out the door.  It dried completely and left no stains, streaks or whit marks. I felt comfortable and protected all day, even sweating in a classroom.  It does stand true to his name.  I would like to try the other scents available as I ca trust the Secret name. #BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Works as a deodorant but the sticky, clammy feel is almost the opposite of the expected dryness with an antiperspirant. Not having a white residue looks nice from outside but it still leaves an invisible layer that stiffens the underarms of the shirts. The fragrance is to my liking, but then again, fragrance is a matter of individual taste. I got to try this free as part of a promotion, and it&#x27;s hard not to like a free item.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I received a free sample as part of a promotional campaign and I could not be happier.  It has a fresh clean smell that is not overpowering like some deodorants I have tried in the past.  I also like that it is a clear gel that dries fast so there is no worry about leaving white streaks on my clothes.  It also lasts a long time and I do not have to reapply it through the day which is important because I am always on the go.  Overall, I am very pleased with this deodorant.</li>
    <li> It really outloasts! Secret Outlast Completely Clean goes on smooth, dries quickly and the smell is great. This gel keeps me dry and comfortable all day long and leaves no residue on my clothes. I&#x27;m thinking this would make a great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> It smells great, leaves no white marks, and works.  This was sent to me by bzzagent for free to review.  So glad I did.  I usually go for the invisible solid version, so I probably would have not tried the gel version.  After using a gel deodorant in the past, I was not expecting much more than a watery mess.  But, this is not like that at all.  I really love it and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use gel deodorant, but I tried this one as a free sample and overall I have good feelings. It smells really nice and is long lasting, 24 hours or so. The downside is that it can be cold when you apply it, and it can feel a little sticky. Perhaps I can just use less of it to eliminate the stickiness.</li>
    <li> I am typically a solid stick deodorant user and having been using this gel deodorant I am impressed with the improvement being made to the application and effectiveness. I give this deodorant only four stars because it definitely does not last 48 hours, if I&#x27;m really stressing my underarms/shirt gets wet and it still feels weird how after application my underarms are wet for about 1 minute until the gel dries. I also noticed the gel does not last as long in the container compared to a solid deodorant, it seems like before I know it the gel deodorant is all used while with a stick it can last me many months. From a day-to-day usage the gel is effective but overall not sure if I would be purchasing anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a promotion from BzzAgent and Secret, the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from a promotion and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the gel before because I always felt sticky. But this one dries super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave that still wet feeling.</li>
    <li> I received a free sick of the secret outlast completely clean gel deodorant as part of a promotion from the brand. I hadn&#x27;t realized I had used before.  I have a complex where I always think I smell,  so the idea of a 48 hour deodorant is ideal.  On days where the temperature is moderate and I don&#x27;t do too much this works like a dream.  However,  it definitely doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours,  and On hotter days and days I&#x27;m running around a lot I think it could do a better job.</li>
    <li> This did not irritate my skin at all like some other deodorants.  I am familiar with the Secret brand and it is one of my go to products.&lt;br /&gt;I like the gel much more than the solid, as I do feel it protects me longer and better than the solid did.&lt;br /&gt;This product sells at most retail stores around the $4 range.  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Bzzagent.  Regardless, I always provide my honest opinion on all products, and only recommend products or services I truly would use or recommend for myself to my readers.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try as part of a promotion.  Although wet when you first put it on it dries much more quickly than other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  There were no white marks on my top, it has a fresh scent that&#x27;s not overpowering and kept me dry and odor free all day.  I would recommend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> So I belong to a website that sends me products to review for free, and this was my latest product. I was less than thrilled to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this deodorant was just strange to be honest. I had a hard time getting it to come out of the stick since it&#x27;s gel, and it kept spurting everywhere! Now that I have used it for nearly a week I still have this problem! Maybe mine was just not packaged well, I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of scent, it&#x27;s a little on the heavy side. I like my deodorant to be a little less with the perfumes, all while smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for odor/wetness protection. The wetness protection was great, didn&#x27;t have to worry about sweating at all! As for odor - I&#x27;m not a smelly girl normally, but I found myself having a funk at the end of each day! I sit at a desk, so again, it&#x27;s not like I am super active, so this was a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I work out while wearing this deodorant? The odor BLASTS through! I would do some circuit training for only 30 minutes, and be grateful I was planning to shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for no white marks - of course that happened, it&#x27;s a gel, but not worth it in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had this experience with any other deodorant, so I was surprised to say the least.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this deodorant for a promotional campaign.  Prior to use, I was a little uneasy about using a clear gel again, as past experiences I have found them to be sticky and never dry.  This deodorant is so much different!  It dries fast upon application, you don&#x27;t need a lot (so the entire tube of deodorant lasts a long time), and isn&#x27;t sticky.  In terms of how long it lasts/protects, I would say it is among the top that I have tried.  I will definitely purchase more of this type in the future.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I have never been a big fan of gel deodorant. I&#x27;ve used them in the past and would hate the feel of the wetness under my arms. But with secret outlast clear gel it dries so fast I was really impressed. It also gave me great  odor production and left no white marks. I highly recommend this deodorant. I received a free sample through the company and was not paid for my opinion.</li>
    <li> I thought gel was not for me. I received a free sample through Buzzagent and tried it out.  It has a clean smell and keeps me odor free on my long busy days.  I will say the gel is a little chilly in the cooler months, but that&#x27;s expected.  It does dry pretty fast and leaves no residue on your shirt.  It you are into gel deodorants I&#x27;d recommend this one!</li>
    <li> #gotitforfree #bzzagent  Pretty good product.  It&#x27;s a little gimick-y with the 48 hour protection.  It lasted long but not THAT long.  It does go on clear and it dries quickly.  I still love stick deoderant but this is nice option if it is on sale.  I would try it again even if it was not free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse  at the hospital and I busy taking care of postoperative surgery patients.  During my 12 hour shift I&#x27;m constantly  running up and down the hallway. Secret Outlast holds up during my 12 shift, it prevents  odor when I start to sweat. It applies on smooth and dries within  seconds, no mess on your clothes.I received  a free sample.</li>
    <li> It goes on wet, but dried quickly.  It had a great smell and even after a heavy workout, it kept me smelling fresh!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of clothes that have white and yellow underarm stains that won&#x27;t come out in the wash. I love the clear gel of the Secret Outlast. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my pull over shirts after use and it doesn&#x27;t leave permanent stains on my clothes. I also like the smell. It is very mild and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent. I don&#x27;t like deodorants with s strong smell so I was excited that the Secret did not leave a smell. Just a small turn of the dial leaves the exact amount of product needed for each arm. Secret Outlast works well for wetness protection. The only downside I found with Secret Outlast is that it does go on wet. I don&#x27;t like to put my clothes on until it dries. I found the best time to apply it is when I am blow drying my hair then with a quick swipe of the blow dryer, I can get the product to completely dry. I would rather not have to use a blow dryer to get the gel to dry but I also don&#x27;t like waiting. Still, I like it better than the product I have been using. Thanks to Secret and BzzAgent for the free sample.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product free for review. After a few weeks of using this product, I am now happy to say that I have a better feeling about it. It continues to go on clear, with no white marks. It lasts throughout the day like I hoped, and it really makes my underarms feels smooth. Thankfully I gave this longer than I normally do for a product with an initial bad feeling, but it has made a believer out of me now!</li>
    <li> Great scent. Not white marks. Dries super fast. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free from bzzagent and I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about it. I currently use a roll on deodorant because years ago when I was trying to find something that didn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing (I love to wear black and I absolutely must have deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave marks) the roll on was the best I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant lives up to its description. It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks and best of all, it lasts all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even busy days where I sweat a lot and have to reapply my roll on, I haven&#x27;t had to reapply this deodorant. Second to white marks, I hate body odor at the end of the day and with Secret Outlast I haven&#x27;t had any trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to make sure, I rotated using my usual roll on and this new secret deodorant every other day for a week and this deodorant provides way better odor control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product and plan to purchase this as my regular deodorant from now on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant. It is the only clear deodorant that has worked in my lifetime. It works as well as prescription deodorant and no more worries about white marks. Thanks Secret!</li>
    <li> The one thing that I absolutely love about this product is that it leaves no marks on my clothing.  I can even apply the deodorant before I put my shirt on.  I am also a runner and this products holds up for miles.  I would recommend! (was given product by company as a promotional review)</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this out through BzzAgent. I always use Secret so I knew that the odor protection would be excellent. As soon as I got my sample, I tried it out. I&#x27;ve never used a gel deodorant before, so I was surprised at how quickly it dried. It was almost instantly dry to the touch and I even tried running a black shirt across my armpit to test out the &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; claim and it worked! Not a single mark on the shirt! 48 hours later, it was still going strong. Still dry and still smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;I had one major problem with it though. It burned every time I tried it. The first time I tried it was after just shaving at the sink, so I thought maybe my underarms were too dried out. That night I tried it again after shower, and it burned again. I thought it may have still been because of the quick shave that morning. I tried one last time the next night after a shower and it once again burned.&lt;br /&gt;While causing great odor and wetness protection, as well as not making any white marks, the burning will keep me from ever buying this product on my own.</li>
    <li> I received my Secret Outlast through a BzzAgent campaign, and I was definitely skeptical. I have not had much luck finding a gel deodorant that did a very good job. This product definitely defied my previous ideas. The odor protection did a great job, and it definitely dried clear, leaving no marks on clothing. My main complaint is that there is a bit of stickiness that remains after applying the deodorant. I never felt it completely dried. Overall I would recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of Secret in the past, so they already had a great track record with me, but I really like this deodorant. Sometimes, with other solids, I do have to reapply deodorant or sometimes wonder if I even applied any because I don&#x27;t notice it there or working at all. So, I can say that it does it&#x27;s job and since I did work like I was running a 48 hour marathon this past week, I would have to say that this solid does work well under pressure. It dries quickly and forms a barrier of protection in my armpits that I know is there because I can actually feel it. It did keep me well-protected and with my busy schedule, moving around town, it stood up to my schedule.</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as a promotional offer from Secret to try and I loved it! It worked really well and felt light and not sticky. Didn&#x27;t have an overwhelming perfume smell which I appreciated. Id recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from bzzagent.com to try and write a review. I have been wearing it daily for several weeks now and like it a lot.  I feel like it provides me with protection throughout the day and I never have that sticky feeling. I have noticed that it still can leave some white marks on clothes if you aren&#x27;t careful but it hasn&#x27;t been a huge deal. When choosing a deodorant, I typically choose ones with a strong floral scent but this one has a clean smell to it. Overall I would recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this deodorant for free when the brand was running a promotion, and I decided to give it a shot on a day that my friend and I had planned a long hike. I put this on right before I got dressed. It was a little warm in the room, so my sports bra was a little tough to get on, but despite my struggles I didn&#x27;t notice any residue. Plus, by the time I slipped into my t-shirt, the deodorant was completely dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a full day of hiking, I only had a light odor when I did a quick &amp;#34;sniff check&amp;#34; (if you&#x27;re anything like me, this becomes a normal part of your behavior as your test out new deodorants and you try to find subtle ways to check your armpits without looking like Mary Catharine Gallagher from Superstar). This was impressive: most normal white stick deodorants will perform this well, but I rarely see (err...smell?) this kind of performance from a clear gel. I&#x27;ve tried non-stick deodorants over the years, and have almost never been impressed by one, but this one was half decent. Ok, maybe it was 3/4ths decent...I wouldn&#x27;t say that the odor protection was AS good as a white stick deodorant, however, if you need something that keeps odors at bay while not ruining your favorite black dress (or maroon sports bra) I&#x27;d say this one is a pretty good choice!</li>
    <li> Love this!!  This will be my go to brand for now on</li>
    <li> I got this product for free as a trial from BzzAgent. And I wanted to share my experience with other people who are planning on purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this product has a great scent. I really like the light fragrant smell. It was not overpowering to the point where I&#x27;d get a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using clear gel, I&#x27;ve always got the solid white deodorants. The first time I put on the clear gel, it was wet. I didn&#x27;t really like the feeling and I have to wait for it to dry before putting on my shirt. The good thing is that it&#x27;s clear so you won&#x27;t have to worry about those white marks on your shirt (especially if you&#x27;re wearing dark colored clothes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product out during a wedding that I attended recently and checked how long it really lasted. I put the deodorant on in the early afternoon and it lasted for about 9 hours.  I did sweat a little bit from the weather but it didn&#x27;t smell because the Secret Outlast protected it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting used to the wetness when I first apply the deodorant. But other than that the product works well. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love Secret Outlast!!! I stay dry and still smell great no matter what I&#x27;m doing. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other deodorant again. I did receive this product free from Secret as a promotion.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel! It drys in seconds, leaves no white marks, and lasts. I was able to try a sample of this thanks to Secret and BzzAgent. I am so glad they allowed me to try it, because I might not have bought it and given it a try. I no longer have to worry about my underarms leaving marks on my dark colored clothes. I am able to do anything and everything with out worrying about odor and wetness showing up at the wrong time. Thanks Secret!</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant.  The clear gel is so soothing to freshly shaved arm pits!  It feels good going on and dries quickly so you don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling.  Best of all, there are no white marks left after getting dressed!  It works all day long and no need to reapply.  I was able to try this deodorant by Secret for free from bzzagent.com!  I gave it 4 stars because I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this scent.  I would prefer a scent-free line instead.</li>
