### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I love it!!!  </li>
      <li>Very stylish!</li>
      <li>received a sample for review, but was genuinely impressed with the styling and fit of this three-way poncho.</li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderful and comfortable product.  </li>
      <li>After this poncho was recommended by one of my favorite YouTube bloggers, I was happy to find it in stock at a not-so-local Walgreen&#x27;s store.</li>
      <li>Love It!</li>
      <li>Not the best quality, but a fun, go to top.</li>
      <li>The material turned out to be very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>the fit is kind of off</li>
      <li>You cannot pull them up; I&#x27;m wondering how Suzanne was able to do it in the photo.  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought this top..</li>
      <li>I plan to continue to purchase more.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I kept my receipt.</li>
      <li>Love the material and have worn to work and out.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this because it seemed so attractive in the ad.  </li>
      <li>Sexy too.</li>
      <li>Not as nice as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s okay, and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this garment.</li>
      <li>one of the most comfortable I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
      <li>but it does wrinkle and it wrinkles easy</li>
      <li>This is such a great top, I wore it with confidence...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and breathable yet roomy and generously sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can wear the s-l and fits great, especially length.  </li>
      <li>the off one shoulder style looked great as did the regular cowl neck</li>
      <li>Cheap material.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everything was extremely comfortable, the sleeves and the body were stretchy and fit generously</li>
      <li>The neck is so large that I can&#x27;t wear it without a tank top underneath for the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; look they show on the box, but overall it is comfortable and attractive on me.  </li>
      <li>the body of the top is very tent like and hangs in an unflattering way.  </li>
      <li>My favorite fabric is modal because it is so soft, forgiving, and stretchy.</li>
      <li>The overall look of this top is cheap.  </li>
      <li>just love how soft the fabric is, too.</li>
      <li>and the shoulders don&#x27;t sit right -</li>
      <li>good thing was the large was an actual large sleeves are.</li>
      <li>As a new mom, I was really excited about a three-way outfit that seemed flattering on a variety of body styles and forgiving on that mommy tummy.</li>
      <li>In my experience, this product is cheap and a sure waste of money (and time laundering).</li>
      <li>I hesitated to order this top, most of the reviews were negative and they were spot on.</li>
      <li>The plus size is very long, small size is perfect length.  </li>
      <li>Fabric is very light and not high quality.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s stretchy, and super soft.</li>
      <li>Runs large.  </li>
      <li>I really, really wanted to like this.</li>
      <li>In fact, it would have made a great nursing cover if I&#x27;d only purchased it a few months back.</li>
      <li>I picked this up at my local CVS this week, and I&#x27;m wearing it right now with gold-colored jeggings.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised when I put it on and found the arms way too snug for comfort.  </li>
      <li>Though I am not a big Suzanne Somers fan, in this case, she totally got it right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a large gal, I weigh 130 pounds and stand 5&#x27; 5, and I don&#x27;t have particularly large arms.  </li>
      <li>Black is my signature color and the design &amp;#34;appeared&amp;#34; promising.</li>

<li> Since clothes run so small now a days I ordered an extra large and it was to big</li>
<li> (I don&#x27;t have a long torso, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1&amp;#34;.)  </li>
<li> The length covered my butt so you can wear it with leggings, however if you have a long torso this may not be the case for you.  </li>
<li> so I won&#x27;t dry it.</li>
<li> poor quality - also I&#x27;ve seen it at Rite Aide for HALF the price I paid here - serves me right!</li>
<li> and I got the Ex LG I think, but could go down to a LG on my next one i buy.  </li>
<li> Very surprised about negative comments.  </li>
<li> It was a huge disappointment to find that after laundering (according to directions), it is no longer wearable.</li>
<li> but my arms are not beefy.  </li>
<li> It then dried on a flat drying screen.</li>
<li> Next, I saw a small hole in the fabric on an area that shows through to the skin.</li>
<li> There are other issues with this garment . . .</li>
<li> The fabric is also very thin, which can be a plus if you get hot flashes</li>
<li> Dress it up or dress it down.  </li>
<li> whether up or down.  </li>
<li> While the hoodie style didn&#x27;t work for me ( the hoodie portion kept falling down)</li>
<li> A little tight</li>
<li> (I am a size 12 and purchased the smaller one and still have plenty of room for it to have that loose, casual look).</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my hard earned money on this product.  </li>
<li> Why on earth would they sew the arms so small?  </li>
<li> After one delicate cycle wash, it has pills all over the garment.</li>
<li> and I am afraid to wash it due to it shrinking away.</li>
<li> (torn) just after 1 washing on the delicate cycle!  </li>
<li> Such a disappointment!</li>
<li> The rayon fabric is extremely poor quality.</li>
<li> The material is a relatively thin, drape-y synthetic.  </li>
<li> Its thin</li>
<li> /&gt;After ONE wear, I laundered the poncho in a delicate cycle, cold water wash.</li>
<li> Vendor sent me the wrong size.</li>
<li> Not too crazy about this.  </li>
<li> so it wrinkles something awful.</li>

    <li> Not too crazy about this.  It&#x27;s not as universal as it seems - the hoodie would be a STRETCH as a style... literally.  You have to pull it up and over your head along w/the rest of the shirt, so the neck seam is basically floating at the nape of your neck, and the shirt looks ridiclous.  (I don&#x27;t have a long torso, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1&amp;#34;.)  Also, definitely going to have to employ the use of a belt or something with this, otherwise it looks like maternity wear.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for fabric - it&#x27;s stretchy, and super soft.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought this top.. it&#x27;s not only fashionable but also one of the most comfortable I&#x27;ve worn. Sexy too. (;</li>
    <li> This is such a great top, I wore it with confidence...  I wish it hadn&#x27;t fallen apart (torn) just after 1 washing on the delicate cycle!  I didn&#x27;t even put it in the dryer!  The material turned out to be very cheaply made.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my hard earned money on this product.  Such a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I hesitated to order this top, most of the reviews were negative and they were spot on. The sleeves are for mutants with childlike arms and I am afraid to wash it due to it shrinking away. Ms. Somers should be ashamed that this product has her face on  it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this garment. Very stylish!</li>
    <li> Fabric is very light and not high quality.  Vendor sent me the wrong size.</li>
    <li> As a new mom, I was really excited about a three-way outfit that seemed flattering on a variety of body styles and forgiving on that mommy tummy. This poncho didn&#x27;t disappoint. While the hoodie style didn&#x27;t work for me ( the hoodie portion kept falling down) the off one shoulder style looked great as did the regular cowl neck style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was extremely comfortable, the sleeves and the body were stretchy and fit generously (I am a size 12 and purchased the smaller one and still have plenty of room for it to have that loose, casual look). In fact, it would have made a great nursing cover if I&#x27;d only purchased it a few months back. It&#x27;s light and breathable yet roomy and generously sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love how soft the fabric is, too. My favorite fabric is modal because it is so soft, forgiving, and stretchy. Though this is made of viscose, it feels like modal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review, but was genuinely impressed with the styling and fit of this three-way poncho. Though I am not a big Suzanne Somers fan, in this case, she totally got it right. I am rocking this poncho.</li>
    <li> I love it but it does wrinkle and it wrinkles easy</li>
    <li> Not as nice as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s okay, and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Cheap material. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It does what it advertises.  It hides the troublesome areas.  Not the best quality, but a fun, go to top.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  Comfy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a size 6 and I got the Ex LG I think, but could go down to a LG on my next one i buy.  I want the beige color.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like this. Black is my signature color and the design &amp;#34;appeared&amp;#34; promising. After this poncho was recommended by one of my favorite YouTube bloggers, I was happy to find it in stock at a not-so-local Walgreen&#x27;s store. Now, hoping I&#x27;ve still got the receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric on this product is inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ONE wear, I laundered the poncho in a delicate cycle, cold water wash. It then dried on a flat drying screen. It was a huge disappointment to find that after laundering (according to directions), it is no longer wearable. The rayon fabric is extremely poor quality. After one delicate cycle wash, it has pills all over the garment. Next, I saw a small hole in the fabric on an area that shows through to the skin. In my experience, this product is cheap and a sure waste of money (and time laundering). The cost of 19.95 is a high-cost per wear as it is no longer presentable after one washing. If you decide to purchase, ensure that you save the receipt and have the option to return it if necessary.</li>
    <li> Ripped in two places on shoulder seams</li>
    <li> poor quality - also I&#x27;ve seen it at Rite Aide for HALF the price I paid here - serves me right!</li>
    <li> the fit is kind of off and the shoulders don&#x27;t sit right - whether up or down.  Side seam rotates toward the front or back rather than staying to the side</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful and comfortable product.  Runs large.  I can wear the s-l and fits great, especially length.  The plus size is very long, small size is perfect length.  Love the material and have worn to work and out.  Dress it up or dress it down.  Very surprised about negative comments.  Fits like a dream.  I plan to continue to purchase more.  Love It!</li>
    <li> I bought this item today from my local Walgreens for $19.99.  You would think an item meant to &amp;#34;hide your extra weight and bumps and bulges&amp;#34; would be designed for a larger body.  Why on earth would they sew the arms so small?  I&#x27;m not a large gal, I weigh 130 pounds and stand 5&#x27; 5, and I don&#x27;t have particularly large arms.  I&#x27;m not toothpick lady but my arms are not beefy.  I was surprised when I put it on and found the arms way too snug for comfort.  You cannot pull them up; I&#x27;m wondering how Suzanne was able to do it in the photo.  There are other issues with this garment . . . the body of the top is very tent like and hangs in an unflattering way.  The fabric is also very thin, which can be a plus if you get hot flashes but the problem is it has no weight to it so it wrinkles something awful. The length covered my butt so you can wear it with leggings, however if you have a long torso this may not be the case for you.  I have a short waist so things will hang differently on me.  The overall look of this top is cheap.  I really wanted to like this because it seemed so attractive in the ad.  I&#x27;m glad I kept my receipt.</li>
    <li> Its thin but I didn&#x27;t mind .the good thing was the large was an actual large sleeves are. A little tight so I won&#x27;t dry it. Since clothes run so small now a days I ordered an extra large and it was to big had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought &amp; it wrinkles a lot,wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at my local CVS this week, and I&#x27;m wearing it right now with gold-colored jeggings.  The material is a relatively thin, drape-y synthetic.  The neck is so large that I can&#x27;t wear it without a tank top underneath for the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; look they show on the box, but overall it is comfortable and attractive on me.  I experimented and I can do both the one-shoulder and off-shoulder look, but I&#x27;d need different undergarments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to see this in red, and I&#x27;d like to find the taupe color they show on the box.</li>
