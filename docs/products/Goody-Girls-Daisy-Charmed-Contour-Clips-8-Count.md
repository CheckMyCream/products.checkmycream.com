      <li>They look cute and come in neat colors.  </li>
      <li>These are probably best suited to infants with little to no hair.</li>
      <li>They work okay, and are pretty, so</li>
      <li>I use these clips for my little Maltese dog and they work great, cute too.</li>
      <li>free (super saver)\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Super cute but warning, these are really really tiny!</li>
      <li>These are perfect to pull back a few of my bangs that are growing out.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something super small &amp; bright &amp;</li>
      <li>I like their simplicity and standard colors - not overtly girly like so many girl-specific things.  </li>
      <li>(Would have liked pink.)  </li>
      <li>These would be great though for a small baby who doesn&#x27;t have much hair and doesn&#x27;t have the means to grab the clip out of her hair.</li>
      <li>bigger size will be better</li>
      <li>They are tiny so large hands may not be able to snap them with ease.  </li>
      <li>These are fine and get the job done, but I kinda screwed up because there is no pink in them.</li>
      <li>I know there is big bold print saying they are a choking hazard but its true.</li>
      <li>Had to buy the regular large size version which are fine.</li>
      <li>I will re-purchase these in a big size for my 1 year old because I LOVE snap clips for babies...</li>
      <li>These are cute and exactly as described, but these are TINY and totally swallow-able--absolutely not something you want for kids&#x27; hair if you have any LO&#x27;s under 3.</li>
      <li>They are high quality and gentle on the hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay for so tiny hair only...</li>
      <li>these oftentimes tend to flip back out &amp; fall off or can&#x27;t be clipped on if more than a tiny strand of hair is clipped to it.</li>
      <li>My 2yr old has very fine hair and while these are perfect for her hair they are terrible from safety perspective.</li>
      <li>I had really high hopes for these.  </li>
      <li>Great for small baby dolls and maybe extra fine little girls hair.</li>
      <li>Based on the amount of my hair that they hold, these clips wouldn&#x27;t even be useful for a pre-teen or teen, and would maybe hold a newborn&#x27;s hair, but who would give a choking hazard to a newborn?</li>
      <li>My one-year old has a fair amount of hair, and each clip would only hold a very little bit.  </li>
      <li>These are absolutely adorable, but they are *really* small.  </li>
      <li>I bought them for my 1 year old and I can&#x27;t use them (choking hzard!)</li>
      <li>These snap clips are far superior to any other hair clip in my humble opinion.  </li>
      <li>I have looked far and wide for tiny secure clips that will keep \\&quot;wild bang hair\\&quot; out of my Maltese&#x27;s eyes.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these for my 16 month old daughter.  </li>
      <li>Not returning because they are fine, just feel compelled to warn how small they are.</li>
      <li>I usually pay 3.00 or more for packs of contour hair clips, and was looking for some of smaller size for my toddler.  </li>
      <li>I bought them for my one year old whose hair is finally long enough to get into her eyes, but really they are a choke hazard.</li>
      <li>Purchased these clips after getting a short haircut thinking that they were about a third or half the size of normal clips (maybe ~ 1&amp;#34;) and instead they are the length of a thumbnail!</li>

<li> These are so small that they would hardly fit on a Barbie, much less a child.  </li>
<li> They will only hold a small amount of hair, and the choking hazard for smaller kids due to their tiny-ness is definitely real.  </li>
<li> My LO was born with a lot of hair and when it became too long for the faux hawk we needed something to keep it out of her eyes.  </li>
<li> These are mini-mini clips - about 1.5cm long.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re almost too small to even use (especially for my husband&#x27;s fingers), and they take several to hold back any of my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
<li> The big ones work well, but sometimes are a little too big for her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Smaller clips, same price as I usually get them, shipped for</li>
<li> And $10 for 3 of these is really not a bargain.</li>
<li> Also, her daycare didnt like her to wear them, since they considered them a choking hazard due to their size.</li>
<li> these seem to fit the bill except that the painted color enamels are so thick that they make clipping these on difficult...</li>
<li> I would typically use about 3 clips to keep the hair out of her face.  </li>
<li> Because of the small size, I have a hard time snapping it because my skinny fingers are still too big.  </li>
<li> Not sure who the intended market is for these clips</li>
<li> but t&#x27;s iso small..</li>
<li> Small is, well, an understatement.  </li>
<li> Maybe on a small baby.</li>
<li> Too small for our use.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re really tiny, they don&#x27;t hold any hair at all and they&#x27;re dangerous for small kids.</li>
<li> so you can see what I mean.  </li>
<li> They are very small.</li>

They work okay, and are pretty, so I gave them 3 stars, a good rating.  But they&#x27;re just standard hair clips, of a super-small size.  I&#x27;ll post a user pic here so you can see what I mean.  The card that they are on is all of 4.5\\&quot; tall.</li>
    <li> Great for small baby dolls and maybe extra fine little girls hair. These are tiny.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use in American Girl dolls&#x27; hair. They work great and are the perfect size for dolls. I don&#x27;t know if these would work in human hair. Maybe on a small baby.</li>
    <li> they are tiny! I bought them for my 1 year old and I can&#x27;t use them (choking hzard!)</li>
    <li> I know there is big bold print saying they are a choking hazard but its true. My 2yr old has very fine hair and while these are perfect for her hair they are terrible from safety perspective. She&#x27;s no longer eating things but goes to childcare with infants and I can&#x27;t send these in her hair.  Had to buy the regular large size version which are fine.</li>
    <li> These are mini-mini clips - about 1.5cm long.  They will only hold a small amount of hair, and the choking hazard for smaller kids due to their tiny-ness is definitely real.  Buy these if you have no smaller kids.</li>
    <li> Too small for our use.  We returned it.</li>

    <li> These snap clips are far superior to any other hair clip in my humble opinion.  My LO was born with a lot of hair and when it became too long for the faux hawk we needed something to keep it out of her eyes.  She had a tiny head though so I wanted something proportionate.  Voila!  I like their simplicity and standard colors - not overtly girly like so many girl-specific things.  They are tiny so large hands may not be able to snap them with ease.  I found no issues however.  She eventually outgrew these though so I had to find replacements.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Love love THEM!!!!! Oh did I say I LOVE THEM!!!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for these.  I was looking for something super small &amp; bright &amp; these seem to fit the bill except that the painted color enamels are so thick that they make clipping these on difficult...these oftentimes tend to flip back out &amp; fall off or can&#x27;t be clipped on if more than a tiny strand of hair is clipped to it.</li>

    <li> the Looks and colors are good .. but t&#x27;s iso small.. it&#x27;s okay for so tiny hair only... bigger size will be better</li>
    <li> These are so much smaller than I thought they would be, even after reading the size description.  They look cute and come in neat colors.  (Would have liked pink.)  Because of the small size, I have a hard time snapping it because my skinny fingers are still too big.  I purchased these for my 16 month old daughter.  Not returning because they are fine, just feel compelled to warn how small they are.</li>
    <li> I am using the hair clips to keep threads from unwinding.  Not the intended purpose I know.  These clips are very cute.</li>
    <li> I use these clips for my little Maltese dog and they work great, cute too. Wonderful for fine hair and they stay in place.</li>
    <li> They are very small. They are perfect for my yorkie who doesn&#x27;t like bows &amp; are so cute on her.</li>
    <li> I have looked far and wide for tiny secure clips that will keep \\&quot;wild bang hair\\&quot; out of my Maltese&#x27;s eyes.  Our groomer introduced them to me 3 yrs ago and I use them every day to match her outfits.  And best of all, they look like her eyebrows.  I can change them to give her different \\&quot;expressions\\&quot;. Thank goodness for Goody&#x27;s Girls on the Run Tiny Snap Clips.</li>
    <li> These are so small that they would hardly fit on a Barbie, much less a child.  Unless you are working with miniatures, don&#x27;t get these.</li>
    <li> These are cute and exactly as described, but these are TINY and totally swallow-able--absolutely not something you want for kids&#x27; hair if you have any LO&#x27;s under 3. The clips even look really delicious and have a soft \\&quot;chewy\\&quot; appearance to them. I will re-purchase these in a big size for my 1 year old because I LOVE snap clips for babies...keep making more styles!</li>
    <li> Purchased these clips after getting a short haircut thinking that they were about a third or half the size of normal clips (maybe ~ 1&amp;#34;) and instead they are the length of a thumbnail! Based on the amount of my hair that they hold, these clips wouldn&#x27;t even be useful for a pre-teen or teen, and would maybe hold a newborn&#x27;s hair, but who would give a choking hazard to a newborn? Not sure who the intended market is for these clips but obviously it&#x27;s not me.</li>
    <li> I had no idea when I bought these, just how tiny these were.  These are probably best suited to infants with little to no hair. I bought them for my one year old whose hair is finally long enough to get into her eyes, but really they are a choke hazard. These would be great though for a small baby who doesn&#x27;t have much hair and doesn&#x27;t have the means to grab the clip out of her hair.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really tiny, they don&#x27;t hold any hair at all and they&#x27;re dangerous for small kids. I would buy a bigger size</li>
    <li> Super cute but warning, these are really really tiny!</li>
    <li> These clips are built quite nicely.  They are high quality and gentle on the hair. Two thumbs up! I would buy them again.</li>
