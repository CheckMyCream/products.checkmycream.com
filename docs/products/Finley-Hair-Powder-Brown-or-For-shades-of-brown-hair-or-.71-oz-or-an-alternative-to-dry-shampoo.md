### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a GREAT product!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pleasant smelling, and not overpowering at all.  </li>
      <li>The good news is it smells WONDERFUL!  </li>
      <li>This product does a great job on soaking up the grease if you don&#x27;t want to wash it again.</li>
      <li>It also smells great, which is a plus.</li>
      <li>It smells nice too!</li>
      <li>There are no tips or good instructions for use.</li>
      <li>Not so good: I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say it makes my hair gorgeous</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>It also smells great and leaves a nice scent in my hair.</li>
      <li>You will LOVE Finely Hair Powder!!!</li>
      <li>Now I won&#x27;t have to refer to myself as \\&quot;Plastic Head\\&quot; any more, lol.</li>
      <li>The scent is amazing as well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good color for someone with medium to light shades of brown hair.    </li>
      <li>The smell is GREAT to me and smells like freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>I just use the powder and carry on my day with people close to me actually commenting on how nice my hair smells and what kind of shampoo I use!!</li>
      <li>I was hoping to love this product but it is just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The smell is lovely though.</li>
      <li>Also, I love that it matches my hair color.</li>
      <li>But, the \\&quot;brown\\&quot; powder is too light for most brunettes.  </li>
      <li>Finley by far is a great product for my hair.</li>
      <li>What I absolutely ADORE is that I am able to go out to the bar with nice hair, come home, sleep, wake up in the morning and NOT wash my hair to get rid of the smokey bar smell that somehow decided to leave the bar with me.</li>
      <li>No longer...a couple shakes of the powder makes my hair looks good as new.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and gives your hair instant lift.</li>
      <li>I tried the blonde powder for the first time, and just loved it.</li>
      <li>I workout daily and use Finely for in between washes to keep my hair looking clean and full of body.</li>
      <li>Not good for covering gray, but good for refreshing in between shampoos.</li>
      <li>Please be aware of this when you order -- I would not have ordered</li>
      <li>I have short hair and haven&#x27;t been able to skip washings like I did when I had longer hair and could just put it in a ponytail.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to everyone that works out and wants to keep their hair looking like the first day they washed it.</li>
      <li>and then too much comes out, often getting in my ears.</li>
      <li>It gave her back that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; she was searching for daily by washing her hair and more importantly it gave us back our valued time together!</li>
      <li>But it truthfully helps me from having to wash my hair everyday and it also gives me the volume i need.</li>
      <li>but they leave a huge mess in the bathroom and give me strangely-textured hair that looks like it&#x27;s made out of plastic.</li>
      <li>Using this product frees me from frequently washing my hair and allows to go an extra day or two without anyone noticing how greasy my hair really is.</li>
      <li>My roots get very oily by the second day</li>
      <li>It makes me paranoid that I smell like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as dark as the picture, but more a cross between the brown and blonde shade picture.  </li>
      <li>The brown works very well for me on that 2nd or 3rd day.</li>
      <li>The last thing I want to do is wash my hair everyday and luckily Finley saves me that extra time.</li>
      <li>I have used the bumble and bumble hair powder spray before, and this product is much easier to travel with, and it is \\&quot;less heavy\\&quot; on your scalp than the bumble spray.</li>

<li> how much I put on or how hard I worked it in...</li>
<li> I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone wanting to reduce scalp oils, unless maybe you wash your hair every other day...</li>
<li> After the first use, and the product stayed all over my daughter&#x27;s scalp for awhile, even after brushing &amp; it was annoying; but we&#x27;ve resolved to try it a few more times.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit the bottle is a bit small, but using it on my entire head barely used up any powder at all.</li>
<li> As you can imagine, this began to affect both of us as it took away from the already limited time we had together.  </li>
<li> I have dark, THICK hair that takes a long time and much aggravation to blow dry every time I wash it.</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this to friends who do not want to wash their hair everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m definitely excited to have found this product to extend the time between expensive hair coloring appointments!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t give that hairspray choking smell or leaves dark wet spots on my head either.</li>
<li> The only reason I did not give this item five stars is because it is a little messy.</li>
<li> After complaining to my hair stylist about my thin and oily hair she introduced me to one of my new necessities to life: Finley Hair Powder.</li>
<li> This product saves me a lot of time by not having to blow dry and straighten my hair everyday.</li>
<li> What I truly like about this product is that it is not an aerosol like other dark hair powders on the market.</li>
<li> The bottle IS small - a little bigger than a tube of lipgloss -</li>
<li> and before I knew it, my nails would be disgustingly dark.</li>
<li> but you have to repeatedly turn the bottle upside down</li>
<li> I got the black powder and used it once and have been hooked since.</li>
<li> Not cool.    </li>
<li> had I known how little I was getting.</li>
<li> It helps to use a fluffy make-up brush to apply it.</li>
<li> I have extremely thin, dry hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also very messy!  </li>
<li> I am having a difficult time using the product without making a mess and/ or getting it evenly distributed in my hair.</li>
<li> If you have thin hair PLEASE try this, I wish I&#x27;d known about this stuff years ago.</li>
<li> No more nasty brown powder mess in the bathroom!</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
<li> It is difficult to apply...</li>
<li> I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from thin and oily hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been told not to wash it every day but this would leave it looking dirty AND even thinner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have short hair and haven&#x27;t been able to skip washings like I did when I had longer hair and could just put it in a ponytail. My roots get very oily by the second day and I got this to help. The bottle IS small - a little bigger than a tube of lipgloss - but I find that you don&#x27;t need a lot (I use my fingers and run them through my bangs and along my part). The smell is GREAT to me and smells like freshly washed hair. I won&#x27;t say it makes my hair gorgeous but it definitely helps soaking up any oil and making my hair drier/fluffier on those days between washings.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and not only is it messy, but it did absolutely nothing to reduce my scalp oils. It didn&#x27;t make a difference how much I put on or how hard I worked it in...in fact my hair almost felt greasier after using it. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone wanting to reduce scalp oils, unless maybe you wash your hair every other day...</li>
    <li> Good: It does the job. Color options.  Not so good: I don&#x27;t like the smell. I wish it was odor-free. It makes me paranoid that I smell like an old lady&#x27;s perfume. I even avoided getting too close to my husband.  Bad: It stains the nails. Of course you can wash your nails after application but the product made my scalp itchy so I had to scratch unconsciously and before I knew it, my nails would be disgustingly dark. Not cool.    I only used this product once, it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll use it again. I think I&#x27;ll stick with baby powder.</li>
    <li> This hair powder isn&#x27;t like others that I have used before. I use it a couple times a week and my hair doesn&#x27;t even feel grimy afterwards. This product saves me a lot of time by not having to blow dry and straighten my hair everyday. It also smells great and leaves a nice scent in my hair. Also, I love that it matches my hair color. I would recommend this product to all women.</li>
    <li> I have dark, THICK hair that takes a long time and much aggravation to blow dry every time I wash it.

    <li> My girlfriend was suffering from from oily hair and it was requiring her to wash it on an almost daily basis.  As you can imagine, this began to affect both of us as it took away from the already limited time we had together.  After mentioning this predicament to a friend at work, she suggested we try out this \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; she had been using called Finley Hair Powder.  I bought some for my girlfriend and upon trying it one time, she was hooked.  It gave her back that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; she was searching for daily by washing her hair and more importantly it gave us back our valued time together!</li>
    <li> After complaining to my hair stylist about my thin and oily hair she introduced me to one of my new necessities to life: Finley Hair Powder.

I just shake a little on top of my hair and massage it into my scalp or you can put it on your fingers and do the same, however it may tend to get a little messy.

    <li> Finley by far is a great product for my hair. I workout daily and use Finely for in between washes to keep my hair looking clean and full of body. The last thing I want to do is wash my hair everyday and luckily Finley saves me that extra time. I would recommend this product to everyone that works out and wants to keep their hair looking like the first day they washed it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to love this product but it is just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  It is difficult to apply...the powder puffs out of the bottle but you have to repeatedly turn the bottle upside down and then too much comes out, often getting in my ears. Then I am stuck q-tipping brown powder out of my ears.     As for removing greasiness, it is again, just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  It helps but doesn&#x27;t do any miracles.  The smell is lovely though. That part I do like.</li>
    <li> The good news is it smells WONDERFUL!  It&#x27;s very pleasant smelling, and not overpowering at all.  But, the \\&quot;brown\\&quot; powder is too light for most brunettes.  It&#x27;s not as dark as the picture, but more a cross between the brown and blonde shade picture.  It&#x27;s a good color for someone with medium to light shades of brown hair.    It&#x27;s also very messy!  The powder goes everywhere and does not stay in your hair after you brush or style it.      Not good for covering gray, but good for refreshing in between shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin, dry hair. I&#x27;ve been told not to wash it every day but this would leave it looking dirty AND even thinner. I&#x27;ve tried spray hair powders but they leave a huge mess in the bathroom and give me strangely-textured hair that looks like it&#x27;s made out of plastic. With Finley Hair Powder you just shake it onto the thinner-looking parts of your hair close to the scalp and massage it in. No more nasty brown powder mess in the bathroom! I&#x27;ll admit the bottle is a bit small, but using it on my entire head barely used up any powder at all. The spray brands only gave me 3 to 4 uses before the entire can was used up. It smells nice too! Now I won&#x27;t have to refer to myself as \\&quot;Plastic Head\\&quot; any more, lol. If you have thin hair PLEASE try this, I wish I&#x27;d known about this stuff years ago.</li>
    <li> I recieved the bottle today and its TINY!  Looks like a sample size bottle that you would get from a department store. I have not tried the product yet, but the size of the bottle really left me steaming -- what a rip off. For the price, I think they could have made it larger. Please be aware of this when you order -- I would not have ordered had I known how little I was getting.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job on soaking up the grease if you don&#x27;t want to wash it again. It smells great and gives your hair instant lift. It&#x27;s very different from B&amp;B hair powder though, its finer and doesn&#x27;t spary on. It doesn&#x27;t alter the texture the B&amp;B hair powder does. If you&#x27;re only looking to soak up the grease, this is the one!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product!  My roots would be greasy after just one wash.  No longer...a couple shakes of the powder makes my hair looks good as new.  The scent is amazing as well.  I would recommend this to any woman looking to extend time between washes.</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give this item five stars is because it is a little messy. I would definitely recommend this to friends who do not want to wash their hair everyday.</li>
    <li> I tried the blonde powder for the first time, and just loved it. I have used the bumble and bumble hair powder spray before, and this product is much easier to travel with, and it is \\&quot;less heavy\\&quot; on your scalp than the bumble spray. It also smells great, which is a plus. I&#x27;m definitely excited to have found this product to extend the time between expensive hair coloring appointments!</li>

    <li> The brown works very well for me on that 2nd or 3rd day. It also enhances my color a bit. It helps to use a fluffy make-up brush to apply it.</li>
