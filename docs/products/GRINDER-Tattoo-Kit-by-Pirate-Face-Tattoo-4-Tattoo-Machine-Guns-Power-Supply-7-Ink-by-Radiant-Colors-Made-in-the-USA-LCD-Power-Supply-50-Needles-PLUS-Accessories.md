<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GRINDER Tattoo Kit by Pirate Face Tattoo / 4 Tattoo Machine Guns - Power... - I received different looking foot pedal  and power supply,  not the same in the picture description. There is no instruction manual on how to set-up tattoo machines and power supply. The book is worthless. I&#x27;m satisfied with shipping speed and the kit itself, but because all these reasons above only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I got my kit in the mail yesterday and had my guns tuned within an hour of getting it. The guns run great and smooth. The quality of the power supply is a good starter supply and I will have to get a new one sometime but it works perfect for a begginer or a travel tattoo kit. The pedal is not the pedal that was pictured but on that note after reading the other reviews the pedal I got is alot better. The pedal is built well and seems to be made to last. The quality of the ink is not great but it set in my first tattoo well and saturated it great.  In all I give this kit a 5 star rating because the guns are well made and run great. The other issues other people had seems to have been fixed because I received a better quality pedal and power supply.  Great item and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a friend and he is having a blast with it. My buddies now have tattoos of their band logo on their ass. Comical, and disturbing. He only had trouble learning how to adjust the ampage/voltage so that it wouldn&#x27;t cut out on him. The fake skin wasn&#x27;t the best, so we used an orange instead (works just the same).</li>
    <li> I just received my kit, everything was a mess inside the box. Some of the bags were ripped so a lot of bands were loose. It came with ever color EXCEPT BLACK. The one color you use the most. The CD came with horrible stencils on it. I&#x27;d buy a different kit.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this kit. It came with everything that it said it would. The only thing I dislike is the ink that came with it. Some of them barely if at all show up but other than that this is great for a beginner or pro! And it arrived not even a week after I made my purchase! (:</li>
    <li> This tattoo gun is great! I&#x27;ve already done great tattoos with it. I baught a tattoo kit before and it was nothing compared to this one.</li>
    <li> Perfect for starters. The textbook that&#x27;s included breaks this down to a science and easy to understand not to mention what they supply with the kit is all you need except for the sanitary stuff which is understandable because you want to be the one who chooses what you need for sanitizing your work areas.</li>
    <li> i recieved my kit, and well it had everything in it. Truely great and fast shipping, everything was packaged and sealed, ie no inks were busted open etc...  understand that when reading these reviews you are not reading proffessional tattoo artists reviews, i myself am no pro artist but i am aspiring to be one. everyone starts somewhere and although most artists will agree kits are not the way to go i will say you get the best bang for your buck. True tattoo supply stores will only sell to pro artists so kits are the easiest way for normal ppl to get started. I would purchase this kit again if i had a redo i am very impressed with the fact that nothing was busted or unsealed and everything was included! 5 of 5 stars to this seller! Also the book it comes with is very helpful and has already taught my buddies and me alot. Also i am always interested to hear from other artists out there that are beginning or even experienced artists as this is something i have a passion and deep appreciation for my email is lifelesslogic@hotmail.com</li>
    <li> Machines are great! Power supply not the best I ended up buying a new one after two uses. The ink is so so .. the lime green I received was s*** it didn&#x27;t stay in the skin so I ended up buying better ink the black fades to Brown yellow and red is great the blue I love it&#x27;s not dark kinda a sky blue when healed... The Orange I have not used yet. And the white is iffy also. It&#x27;s a great practice ink but I don&#x27;t use it on people except the yellow red and blue. I used all the black on myself. Deff need to buy a new power supply and make sure all your extras are there mine was missing a small metal ring forgot what they are called.</li>
    <li> i love it , this kit have everything for a beginner, a receive it complete ,and the speed of delivery is awesome  thank you</li>
    <li> Well we got this kit about 3 weeks ago and after using it once and turning it off the power supply doesnt work at all any more. Dont expect alot out of the ppower its self.</li>
    <li> the tattoo kit is not a bad starter kit i got it this morning of course its not all thebest but it does the job to teach im pretty stoked to check everything out machines are a little heavy but hell it was only 109$ what do you expect..</li>
    <li> Great starter kit I&#x27;ve waited to write this to see how good it is and I&#x27;ve had mine almost two years now still pushing ink it&#x27;s good fir the beginner or a pro fir a backup or travel kit</li>
    <li> I did not receive everything as stated. I got a box with 1 machine and a few odds and end items.... Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Received item on time. I am satisfied with it so far. The book &amp; DVD only goes so far which I can see as how they push apprenticeship &amp; to sell more product.</li>
    <li> The Grinder tattoo kit is awesome! It includes everything you need to get started and the company has a wicked name: Pirate Face Tattoo</li>
    <li> for what you get in this kit ,I&#x27;m sure you would have to pay else where.I mean i just got mine a week ago and started practicing and everything works great plus the book that comes along with the kit is like a golden bonus! Your getting your money worth with product and a little 101 basics .Plus everything was neatly package and it arrived earlier then expected ,if it came down to it I&#x27;d order from here again!</li>
    <li> arrived early kit was just as described pictures here are accurate.book and dvd&#x27;s are useless. ink in package made in china ink wont flow or stay in the skin...order better ink when you get the kit. starbrite or mom&#x27;s work best. after tuning tat machines work fine. power supply is decent and pedal is solid . also order disposable grips/tubes . kit comes with nice aluminum grips . also order extra liner needles. i only got 4 with my kit and they are gone now.already done 2 tats with machines . overall a good kit</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good starter kit..u get what u pay for. U shouldn&#x27;t expect the best of out it..i really did like the power supplier the machines not so much..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for fathers day (2015) he hasn&#x27;t used it yet but everything came nicely packaged. No inks leaked. The storage box was a little warped on the silver part from where the booked was shoved in but no biggy. We did order more ink from a better company. The practice skin is small but I ordered more of it. So far he loves the book that comes with the kit. He wants to read it before using the machines. We received it quickly. Hopefully it&#x27;s as good as others have said.</li>
    <li> great starter kit couldn&#x27;t ask for any better fast delivery  great condition works well cant wait to use it so lets get busy</li>
    <li> I got the tattoo kit fast, which was nice. Being a beginer and all, I wasn&#x27;t clear on the liners and shaders. once i figured it out, all went well. The only set back with the kit for me was the power supply. It could have been much better to keep up with the guns. It kind of petered out half way through a few tattoos. 3-4 of them. So i had to let it catch up, kind of disappointed in power supply. other than that everything is doing what is supposed to and nothing is broke yet :) i&#x27;ll keep scratchin.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason being a 3 star review is because hard to give anyone a tattoo without the power supply slacking half way through. Nice kit for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Eric.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit! Got it for my girl as a gift and she&#x27;s already done 4 great tattoos including my own. Came with everything in the picture. At first one of the machines didn&#x27;t work, but it was just something simple we didn&#x27;t notice. It works now. I would definitely reccommend this kit to anyone who wants to start tattooing. The book is very helpful and makes the kit worth the price. If you are considering buying a starter kit, don&#x27;t think about getting any other one besides this one!</li>
    <li> The damn s*** ain&#x27;t worth buying, the 3rd time I tried to use it the power supply wouldn&#x27;t work so don&#x27;t buy one of these by grinder.....</li>
    <li> Great product, better than I anticipated!</li>
    <li> the gun itself and the rest of the product is fair but the ink that it comes with is beyond HORRIBLE!! it doesn&#x27;t hold at all-thinking that it was me I tried it on someone else (I know stupid move) but nope its just poor quality ink! the black outline ink turned out to be this pathetic grayish ghost of a color and the colors are not pigmented at all. ended up scarring myself by desperately trying to make it work!! fair price on the equipment but DON&#x27;T USE THE INK!!&lt;br /&gt;went and got some Starbrite ink-going to see if I can try and salvage the work that I have done.</li>
    <li> One gun is missing. the silver one to be exact,  and the power box and pedal do not match what the picture has. the inks are runny and suck. Buyer beware!!!! i&#x27;d rather pay 29 bucks more and get a nicers set. not to mention i can&#x27;t reach the seller.</li>
    <li> I just got my tattoo kit in it came on time very good kit had everything with the kit plus more I am very happy with this kit ..well worth the money if you are in to doing tattoo&#x27;s the way Iam this is the kit for you look no more...</li>
    <li> Great kit waiting for it to ship out now</li>
    <li> Very nice kit and good for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Well built. Im happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say this is a pretty good kit. Mine came in the mail right on time. There wasn&#x27;t anything missing in the kit, although the inks that I&#x27;ve used so far all have cracked caps. I don&#x27;t really care though since its not a high quality ink and I&#x27;m only using this ink for practice anyways. All together I&#x27;m very pleased. My own tattoo artist uses a kit like this and makes real good quality tattoos with it.</li>
    <li> Came with everything you&#x27;ll need to start tattooing on your own. Fake skin and a better instruction guide would&#x27;ve been great, but it came with a bunch of stuff. I especially love the case it comes in!</li>
    <li> Everything works, but read the other reviews about the ink!</li>
    <li> Everything was great. The guns were great quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best tattooing starter kit I&#x27;ve come across! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone starting out!</li>
    <li> Bought for my friend to learn to tattoo and it&#x27;s really a impressive little machine. Great starter setup</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a beginner tattoo artist (scratcher lol) and he loves it! He said the quality of the materials were above his expectations.. he also said he wishes there were more transfer paper and practice skin.. and he appreciated the book but didn&#x27;t really care for the dvd..</li>
    <li> This is a great deal it came very fast and everything works great the machines are a good starters and the power supply works good the inks are ok you should buy some starbrite for the best color I recommend this you can&#x27;t beat  the price !!!</li>
    <li> I recieved my Kit very quickly. It has everything except, alcohol swabs, gloves, A &amp; D ointment and the practice skin and transfer paper were not in my kit. Other than those minor things I was really happy with the purchase. In addition to the kit I bought practice skins, transfer paper, Starbrite basic color set and Intenze Tattoo colors, a sketch pad and some tattoo books. I have done quite a few tattoos on the practice skins (with the ink from the kit), and have completed 2 tattoo outlines on myself (with the Starbrite Black). The liner is great, but you have to work with the power supply to get the setting just right. The shader, is going to take me some time to figure out. Also, there is NO INFO in the kit. Learn about the needles and their uses and go to Youtube to learn about setting up the machines to get the correct depth. Overall I think it was worth it, I will be buying more expensice machines in the future once I get more confident in my abilities! If you like your black outline super dark get Kuro Sumi. Got it yesterday and it is awesmoe!</li>
    <li> First off, the power supply did NOT work. I took it apart, fixed the 2 wires inside that were not connected. The ink bottles are cheap and leaked all over the inside of the case. The foot pedal is way too narrow. The machines are well made though. If nothing else, you pay 100 bucks for 4 machines. You can buy them for $8 a piece. If you are serious about tattooing, don&#x27;t waste the money on this kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit a few months ago and it worked fine the first month. By the second month one of the guns quit working and by the third month the power supply has quit. I am not happy about this at all!!!!! I have several tattoos lined up to do and now I have to tell them I can&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> So far so good I&#x27;m beginning my journey with many supporters behind me on this I draw so I am lucky to have them let me work on them this is only the beginning I plan to achieve an apprenticeship because I knew a few artist in my area so I&#x27;m working on a portfolio since the 17th I&#x27;ve done 6 tattoos and 2 touchups in excited to make a side career of this</li>
    <li> seems fine bought for a friend</li>
    <li> Everything in this set is nice except the ink. I would not recommend using the ink in this set and go buy some nice ink. It&#x27;s really not worth using the ink it comes with, you should just suck it up and spend some money on some real ink. Other than that, pretty much everything else is good, the set comes with a bunch of stuff</li>
    <li> It was way more than I expected and it was easy to put together. The only thing that I would change is o wish the practice skin was a little bigger or there was more than one.</li>
    <li> Bought this tattoo kit for Christmas and so far it has held up and I have done some great tattoos with the equipment provided.  The ink by radiant is awesome and I only use this brand for my tattoos now.  I can&#x27;t be more happy with this tattoo kit and would highly recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This item was a good purchase. It has put alot of smiles on many faces. A very nice set. lots of tattooing going on around here.</li>
    <li> the kit came on time and ive been using i ever since it got here. so far i am highly impressed. i do not see any problems with the equiptment. one of the seals on the white tattoo ink was cracked but it did not leak because of the plug inside the ink cap.  if anyone ask for a better deal for this price you wont find one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, who just started tattooing and he loves it. It came with more stuff than described, just about everything you need. Light weight and easy to handle machines. We highly recommend this kit!</li>
    <li> Some bulls*** product if your main source of power doesn&#x27;t work. Gave it 2 star for how quickly it arrived. The power box doesn&#x27;t work .</li>
    <li> this kit came with everything i needed to start tattooing. i dont know much about the equipment yet, but for the price this is definitely worth it. especially if you are starting from ground zero</li>
    <li> For a kit this is really good. Everything was packaged nicely. Nice solid foot board. The book is great too.</li>
    <li> Ink was leaked out everywhere. Not amazons fault, but they refused to replace this. I would go somewhere else. Amazon was helpful just not the company I bought it from. This was a gift for a friend. When they opened the box it came in, ink got all over her table and her clothes.</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for a  beginner tattoo artist and he loves it.  He has no complaints and all the machines and components that came with it work great.  Arrived on time with no damage from the shipper.</li>
    <li> I was really taken away from this tattoo kit. It&#x27;s work great and got here on time.Awesome price for a great product!</li>
    <li> well everything cam with it the pedal was different then the picture and the guns dont come labeled with which is a liner or shader and one of the black guns burned out on me already after about 2 or 3 hours of use i mean the colors they come with or cheap chinese ink the only color that turns out welland goes in decent is the black ink but im still leary about the ink giving people infections and wat not if you buy this get disposable tube better needles and better ink</li>
    <li> First of all, I was pretty excited about learning how to tattoo. It has been something I&#x27;ve wanted to do for a while but could never find a decent kit with a reasonable price. So right off the bat, This kit was perfect. It had a lot of material and had some really good reviews. So I ordered it. It arrived in 2 days (which is what I asked for) and looked properly packaged. It was a smaller box inside of a large box with TONS of over sized bubble wrap. So as I was opening the actual kit, I noticed some ink spillage...So I opened the kit and BOOM. Ink was EVERYWHERE. I was extremely mad at this point. I took what seemed to be the source of the ink spillage and removed it from the case (of course, it was the plastic bag with the ink bottles in it). One by one, I was pulling them out and the only way I could distinguish the colors was by looking at the actual ink. Another thing that had me extremely ticked was the fact that half of my ink bottles were cracked. Now..how in the world does PLASTIC bottles crack in \\&quot;proper packaging\\&quot;? Also, The colors that were listed in the description were NOT the colors I received. I received Black, white, 3 blues (Turquoise, sky, Royal), 2 Greens, 3 browns (Dark, light, And an ugly burnt orangy brown), Red, Pink, Yellow, Orange and Violet. I mean, yeah it&#x27;s still 15 colors, but the fact that It didn&#x27;t come as described is really irritating. I also didn&#x27;t receive 8 stainless steel tips. I only received 4. Other than that, Everything was alright. It took quite a while to get my machines to work, and they still don&#x27;t cooperate at times. But maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a newbie. Then again, I&#x27;m not stupid and I practically grew up in a tattoo shop. So overall, I&#x27;m a little satisfied, but extremely irate. If you would like to contact me, my email is akeagle94@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I just ordered this kit for my son. Everything is great so far but there is only one problem. The teaching dvd doesn&#x27;t work.The kit was delivered early and was in great shape.....no spills and neatly packaged....I hope everything else goes well. [[ASIN:B004ZNH4YS GRINDER Tattoo Kit by Pirate Face Tattoo / 4 Tattoo Machine Guns - Power Supplies / 15 INK / LCD Power Supply / 50 Needles / PLUS Accessories]]</li>
    <li> I bought one of these kits as it appeared to have all I need to begin tattooing and when it got to my house I was more than pleased with the kit. Excellent quality machines, power supply, needles, etc. I liked it so much that I bought another one for my girlfriend. We are both very pleased with the kits. We are however not pleased with the ink. It is supposed to come with radiant ink. Radiant ink being a quality brand we thought that we couldn&#x27;t go wrong but upon using the ink we noticed that it was extremely runny and not characteristic of such a quality ink so we compared it to other radiant ink not included in the kit. Well unless radiant completely redid their process of making ink then I am certain that while the bottles read radiant ink the ink inside of the bottles is not radiant. It has a very poor consistency and runs like water. I can only hope that the knock off ink inside of the radiant bottles is atleast an American made ink and not from china. Great kit but the ink is garbage compared to actual radiant ink.</li>
    <li> This startup kit had basically everything I needed to begin my tattoo ventures. I still feel comfortable using each machine, and for the price was well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> if your just starting out or want to experiment with tattooing then this is a good start for you to use</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my brother for Christmas. He&#x27;s very artistic, so I figured maybe he&#x27;d like to learn how to do tattoos. The kit came with everything described. Everything was individually wrapped. It came with a book and a DVD to get him started with learning the basics. All together in watching him practice, I would say this is a perfect starter tattoo set. I would definitely recommend this kit to beginners who really want to learn the principles of the tattoo art.</li>
    <li> Of course everything wasn&#x27;t amazing, but for the price and the quality that it was, I&#x27;d defiantly recommend. Everything was there and ready to use, no trouble what so ever.</li>
    <li> ink was opened when I received it so it was returned I guess you get what you pay for but open ink is not a good thing</li>
    <li> In the advertisement they have a ying yang pedal. I received just a black one. I contacted them to see if they could switch them. But I got no answer back. Other then that . My order was very useful!</li>
    <li> This is a good starter kit. It comes with good machines. You have to fix the machines before you use them though so you have to know what you&#x27;re doing to make sure it works fine. After you fix it the right way they work perfectly. They are all shaders though, it didn&#x27;t come with any liners. The inks aren&#x27;t good quality to do tattoos on real clients, but they are good enough to practice on fake skin</li>
    <li> The ink was awful. The kit is awful. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Packaging was awfull. Machines awful. Save and buy a real machine.</li>
    <li> Everything fine except the inks leaked... the bag they came in filled with a rainbow of colors all over.  Big mess.  Didnt leak out the bag but the inks are useless now</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my baby brother who is a beginner in tatting. A must have for as I was going through the case that it came in which alone was a great piece, I was pleased to see that this tattoo equipment works for beginners and pro&#x27;s so I am truly sure I made a great choice.</li>
    <li> This is the best beginners set you could ask for! I&#x27;m so happy with this and can&#x27;t wait to start tattooing</li>
    <li> great product very easy to use. My son is really enjoying his new tattoo gun. I also went and order two</li>
    <li> WOW! what a deal this kit is loaded with a lot of equipment . Great bang for the buck , and all 4 guns  works perfect . I am fairly well tattooed up and wanted this for touch up. I have been to several Tattoo shops through out and a few recently . I pay close attention and ask questions . In most cases I have noticed that the machines being used are not the real expensive ones but are the same type as in this kit. I will say I just went over some of my color that needed touch up and it took about two hours , and saved my self an appointment and about four hundred bucks . Note I got this kit for this reason and not to Tattoo other people . So I give this kit a two thumbs up and do recommend .</li>
    <li> This came with every thing i needed to get started. Works like a charm. I did have to tune the machines at first but that is expected. BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertised. This is a great kit for any beginner. Inks are great, good saturation and great colors.</li>
    <li> Good product, excellent book included - well worth the price, though the machine&#x27;s aren&#x27;t professional enough for me to tattoo without some heavy techinical adjustment.  But everything worked out the box, and you can get practicing instantly on the practice flesh provided.  Plus, you can tear apart one or two machines to get a good understanding of the coil system.</li>
    <li> The book alone is worth the price. the machines are sleek and easy to learn to put together. Perfect for a beginner. As soon as I can - I&#x27;m upgrading my inks and power supply.</li>
    <li> great set comes with everything you need, in order to mess up you and your friends body&#x27;s permently.  I loved it, recommend .</li>
    <li> Well the kit did come on time, although one of the machines had chipped &amp; peeling paint, already..still in the manufacturers packaging. The power supply is truly awful. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cord clip or box or both, however it cut out constantly during the first tattoo. I tried it on another machine, same issue. The inks are complete garbage. While they&#x27;re decent if you intend on using them for practice only, do not use them on any human beings. All in all, everything did come on time and what was supposed to be in the kit, was actually there but the quality was extremely disappointing and frustrating.</li>
    <li> WARNING!!! The power supply worked for all of 5 minutes...then it sparked and stopped working!!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND this product!</li>
    <li> This kit works very well, but you have to be able to know how to use it because the DVD does not tell you anything or the book, so if you don&#x27;t know how just look it up on youtube or any other site they are very helpful for beginners.</li>
    <li> This kit is great. I&#x27;m new to tattooing and this seemed like the most bang for the buck and has a lot that other kits don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m very happy withmy purchase and the shipping speed was crazy fast. Will do business with again! A+++</li>
    <li> All the equipment was Fantastic except the ink! The ink is ok quality but leaked pretty bad! The book is awesome and gives you most of the information you need!</li>
    <li> The kit was as advertised. But one of the guns had a piece broken and my power supply cord was broken.</li>
    <li> I Got this to get back into my tattooing hobby. I&#x27;ve done eight pieces on my legs and so far the machines work great. Like other reviews, I didn&#x27;t like the ink and got top shelf brand. I will buy another setup from them again.</li>
    <li> Case had a small dent and one of the connectors was stipped so it would not fit right, but all around a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Good;satisfactory number of guns, the  range of colored ink ;&lt;br /&gt;However needed more black ink.&lt;br /&gt;packaging and delivery acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the affordable prices offered.</li>
    <li> Came in good time and pleased so far</li>
    <li> The kit it nice, I like the machines and the extra items but that has to be the worst tattoo ink possible. The ink does not stay it fade very quickly its consistency is terrible,  if it wasn&#x27;t for the ink I would rate it a 5, because it is a great beginners kit.</li>
    <li> It came with everything and it works great The absolute only complain. the red ink was cracked and had a couple of drops on the other ink bottles. But other than that, fantastic set.</li>
    <li> My fiance&#x27; LOVES it! I got it for him as a birthday present. He&#x27;s already started on doing my tattoo. The only complaint was the fake skin. It is more like a rubber material, very difficult to practice tattooing on because of the texture.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price or all the things you get in the kit! Looking forward to getting inked up! Awesome</li>
    <li> URGENT!  FDA has recalled items in this link that I bought from this item!  Posdibly Fatal bacterial infection!!!  Check the fda recall for tattoo ink!</li>
    <li> I bought this one because I am a complete beginner and for the money, it gave me everything I needed to get started. The guns were really nice, and it came with a ton of ink. However, the power supply quit working after the first time I used it. Also, the ink bottles leak horribly once they are opened. Completely ruined the table I was using. If the power supply would have continued working, I would have kept it and just got new ink because I liked the kit. Amazon completely refunded my money and emailed me a return lable promptly. I would recommend it because I think/hope the power source issue was a fluke but I would recommend ordering other ink.</li>
    <li> The machine does it&#x27;s job just fine. It was delivered quickly however the ink was all spilled when I received the package. Also what was left of the ink was garbage and completely unusable</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who wants to be a tattoo artist someday. He absoutley LOVED this kit. It comes with a variety of everything, from needles, guns, to ink colors. Deffinality worth the money. It&#x27;s a great way to get started!</li>
    <li> I like it but the inks came in different amount in each bottle.Some of it came dirty outside becausethe ink turned out.</li>
    <li> it had everything in it that it was supposed to some of the machines were hard to teak to make them work right but for the price they were decent machines. I was surprised at the needles and grips and tips that were provides they were no the best quality but they got the ink in. I was not as happy with the ink the darker colors were ok but I do not like the white ... it stings and burns when It goes in, the pink was more of a red and the red faded really bad but the other colors were ok... the book provided was very helpful but the cd was not very useful  I was not impressed (but that may just be my opinion). the foam that was provided with the kit did not even fit any of the items in the kit... so it just got thrown away... but over all I really liked this kit and it has got me doing some pretty good tattoos!!!</li>
    <li> The machines run pretty well. Only problem I had was with the delivery. UPS threw it at my door and when I opened the package I had a leak in one of the ink bottles.</li>
    <li> Great value, great for the beginner artist. Ink is of okay quality. I like the black. Did a few pieces on my leg and the black is surprisingly very dark. Power supply is not the one that&#x27;s pictured but it&#x27;s of good quality.</li>
    <li> You get a ton of stuff for a good price. Ink is not the greatest but if your just practicing thats ok.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for a friend of mine who is an artist. He had never tattooed before, but this kit came with everything he needed to get started. The book was very informal, and gave him all the basic information he needed to know before tattooing. He&#x27;s done quite a few tattoos so far and they all look great. Everything works perfectly, and the kit came in perfect condition. Unless you&#x27;re heavily into tattoos like I am, you wont noticed that the ink quality could be a little better. If the kit included an ink like Star Brite, it&#x27;d be the hottest kit on the market. Definitely the best bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> Great kit especially if you&#x27;re just learning. One of the machines stopped working after a couple uses, but my mentor fixed it. He was against me ordering a kit online, but was actually impressed with what this kit included &amp; the quality. The book is really well written also, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to view the DVD yet though. The needles included were good, none of them were bent and packaged well. It has everything you need to get started! All you need to order with this kit is some practice skin &amp; you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
    <li> The power box broke in two days</li>
    <li> Everything can in quick &amp; just what I was expecting. I&#x27;m no pro but so far this has been great for me with starting out.</li>
    <li> Great caul for the price!</li>
    <li> amazing guns they look awesome and high quality in real than in those pics .. awesome power supply works awesome...inks are alright ..money well spent ... i got it very fast and already did 3 tats</li>
    <li> Everything that came was legit and brand new. This is a great starter kit for apprenticeships. Not the greatest quality but you get more that what you pay for</li>
    <li> The tattoo machines are great ,I have had a lot of guns,these work very well,ink is good ,I like the tubes,all in all a great starter kit .</li>
    <li> Absolutely no issues with this product or seller. I would certainly use again and recommend. I like the book and YouTube video that helps describe the use.</li>
    <li> Great deal @ a great price!!!  Machines &amp; power supply are working wonderfully thus far.  Only critique so far was that the foot pedal was a plain design versus the yin yang design shown in the ad picture.</li>
    <li> This kit is worth the money. Everything in it is pretty good overall. The ink is bright and doesn&#x27;t make you itch so that&#x27;s a plus. The guns are very light weight. The digital power supply is another plus although it is not the same one in the picture, it looks to have been maybe an updated version? The foot pedal is decent but once again, it is not the one in the picture. I received the basic black flat square foot pedal.The clips are decent but they sometimes get hung up so I had to constantly adjust them. Over all, it&#x27;s a nice kit and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an early X-Mas present awhile ago, and the first night, the cable that plugs the power supply into the wall messed up and the power wouldn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it since then now that I&#x27;m using a new cord. About a week, week and a half ago, the clip cord decided to start messing up, too! I have to have it at a weird angle for it to work or it&#x27;ll stop working. The inks are okay, the machines are great... The practice skin drove me crazy, I couldn&#x27;t ever get the excess ink 100% off, so I&#x27;ve been practicing on oranges. I give it a B.</li>
    <li> this kit really does have it all. the book alone included in this kit is amazing, the inks are sub-par (i wasnt expecting much from the inks anyways) the machines are excellent and well built, you will need to upgrade your power supply in the near future but that is only a minor complaint...all in all this kit will get you started, its completely up to you to have the commitment, skill, and attitude to be a good, even great tattooist</li>
    <li> This is an awesome setup. Its prefect for everyone who is just starting out or is thinking about starting to tattoo. I will definitly be reccomending this to others.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be some really cheap merchandise but for the price you can&#x27;t get anything better.  Product was great the instructions good and it was easy to set up. I am a tattoo enthusiast and I love it. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a starter kit</li>
    <li> The kit was poorly wraped. The needles that came with it was open......Not good...The ink is trash.. Spend your money on better stuff..</li>
    <li> I have just received my gringer tattoo kit and extras yesterday was very happy with how quick i got my order. I opened and glad how everything looked well put together,good quality except the ink is very low quality. Otherwise the tattoo machines quick easy set up good healthy running easy to tune. Good starter kit for any. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> bought this fo my husband so he could learn to tattoo. he loves the guns and the book that came with it is very helpful.</li>
    <li> This came very fast and nicely packaged,I am somewhat new to tattooing so I went cheap,but if you are artistic and have a passion for art not are not just trying to be cool you can do some beautiful things with this machine.Have already impressed some tattoo shop owners and artists.If you are new to tattooing or even experienced I would recommend this.Get tattooing and have some fun.</li>
    <li> love everything about this set il let u know how good the ink takes when my new tatt heals so far so good</li>
    <li> My name is Lisa Gambrel, an I purchased this kit for my husband for his birthday. He was very happy with this product as well as I. The order was at a great price an the delivery was here when it was suppose to be that was great. The only thing we had a problem with was the orange ink bottle had busted an they was ink all in the bag, but other than that we was satisfied with our order an will be back for more. We have told all our friends an family to check u all out.</li>
    <li> Foot pedal slowly became useless after a few practice tattoos, not to mention its not the same in the picture description. Nor was the Power Supply. I also received different looking machines. Stainless steel tubes are ok, but as for the tips they were useless, burs that were not removed when they were made, makes it almost impossible to tattoo with out the needles getting caught up an damaging them. Rubber bands was almost all broke, but who cares its a easy replaced item. Inks are not too bad, although I wouldn&#x27;t really use them on a person, maybe to practice with on fake skin. You get what you pay for an these machines will work although I would invest in a much better machine made with quality parts. 6 month warranty is available if things act up with your kit an want to get it replaced.</li>
    <li> I ordered last Monday I got it today so shipping wasn&#x27;t horribly slow. The kit is a lot nicer than one of the other kits I had gotten. These machines feel nice not too heavy but not air light either, the grips are a nice fit to my hand, even though I use disposable. The ink is trash except for fruit pigskin. But my overall opinion is this is the best kit on Amazon</li>
    <li> Great product very satisfied with shipping speed the machines itself are amazing and glide so smooth across skin once again im very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> I started with this kit 3 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a shop now.&lt;br /&gt;This kit will get you familiar with tattooing.&lt;br /&gt;Upgrade everything once you&#x27;re familiar.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t get the highest quality buying in kits.</li>
    <li> This tattoo kit is a good start for beginners who want to get into tattooing but dont want to make a big investment, or for those who just dont have a lot of cash to do so. Overall I was pretty happy with this kit. However it was missing some of the needles, the foot pedal I received was not the one featured in the picture and the kit was missing the black ink... Could have been a little better but overall not to bad... Thanks.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit for the price</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT started kit for someone who is starting to do tattoos, like myself.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with everything described by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come with everything you need to tattoo though (warning for beginners).&lt;br /&gt;I ordered separately green soap, stencil paper (only comes with 1 sheet), vaseline, the liquid to transfer stencils on to the skin (I use speed stick deodorant, works the same only it&#x27;s cheaper than the liquid), bigger bottle of black ink, gloves (only comes with 1 pair), distilled water (to dilute the green soap), and the spray bottle for the diluted green soap. Umm I think that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re a beginner, this is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> As far as kits go, this is a pretty good one that includes just about everything you&#x27;ll need.  We did however spend another +$100 on stuff like green soap, more variety of needles and grips and INKS.  Knowing that kits dont always come with the top quality things we didnt want to risk taking the time and effort and not having top quality inks.  That said, one of the top quality inks wouldnt take so we used the kits ink and it took great!  The guns are great and that with the power supply in itself is worth the purchase price.  We struggled with the stencil paper - I suggest getting a pack of quality stencil paper because the hours of frustration re-doing them will make you cuss yourself for not doing so in the first place.  The cord that connects to the guns is very temperamental and needs a piece of foam inserted btwn the probes to force them apart to get a good connection.  I&#x27;ve ordered a new cord and new stencil paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and packaging were above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This tattoo kit comes with everything you need and more.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 months now and everything works great.  The equipment seems like it will last a long time.  Great Kit</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Everything came as described. Machines are pretty good. The ink included is not all that good. The power supply and clip cord appear to be on the cheaper side, this can be used as a back up one. The fake skin that comes with the kit is nothing like tattooing for real, it is very rubbery.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit for a bigginer the power supply sucks tho you get what you get for the price :)</li>
    <li> What great value at such a short price.  I just got mine last nite and I&#x27;m amazed at the quality and the quantity. Everything was there in a neat lil package. Make sure you order the kit that comes with book. That really increases the value so much more. I&#x27;m a beginner but I can tell the quality of the equipment is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great kit for practicing and learning how to do tattoos.  Great for an first time starting out apprentice. Great value too.</li>
    <li> Got what was expected</li>
    <li> Very happy with my Grinder Complete Tattoo Kit</li>
    <li> well everything is good soo far, havent had any problems out of it. it came with in 3 days and when i got it, it was pretty nice. guns are good and came with plenty of needles and the ink is okay but i rather buy new ink. i use it on 2 ppl and myself and it just dont seem too be the best quality. and the pig skin is not that good but yhu can still work with it. other then thoes two things its great. havent had no proplems out of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent equipment for someone just getting started. I gave this to my brother who just started doing tattoos and he loves it. Comes with everything you need to get started plus a list of all the supplies to order from the company with prices. That was very helpful because we had no clue where to get most of this stuff except out of a magazine. He recently did his first tatt on me and he says that the machine feels good and balanced in his hand. He&#x27;s looked at other machines and they were great but came with different grips that he said made it feel awkward and were way more expensive. We have a friend that does tatts and he said that the Grinder was great for someone wanting to learn the art.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! MY BOYFRIEND HAS BEEN A TATTOO ARTIST FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND HE LOVES THE QUALITY THE GUNS FOR THE PRICE YOU CANT BEAT IT THE ONLY CHANGE HE MADE IS HE PURCHASED AN 8/32 FRONT BINDING POST WHICH ENABLES HIM TO CUT DOWN ON TIME. I WILL DEF BE PURCHASING FROM PIRATE FACE AGAIN:)</li>
    <li> This item is just what I wanted and a little extra. If you know how to put a machine together then with a couple more pieces you can make these machines run pretty decent. Also only use the ink for practice I wouldn&#x27;t put it in anyone</li>
    <li> I was blowing away on how well these gun&#x27;s worked right out of the box,with little tuning to do..&lt;br /&gt;This kit is a great $100.00 Investment..This kit has everything you will need to do a tattoo..This is a great starter kit to start with, than add better ink an power supply,later down the road..</li>
    <li> It came neat in the case but the guns were not all that great having problems with keeping the gun running smooth everything thing else is fine</li>
    <li> Very nice set up in happy with this but buy a power supply as well its a pile of s*** and burned out on the 3rd use but amazing guns needles and ink the hole kit is worth alot more but in not complaining about the price easily adorable</li>
    <li> A cheap item. You get what ya pay for</li>
    <li> While I was expecting that the ink wasn&#x27;t going to be high quality, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the machines for a beginner&#x27;s kit. It was also nice to get a small starter supply of shaders, liners, and cups. I don&#x27;t care for the type of tubes provided- I will have to go buy the solid disposable ones. Overall, this is was a great purchase for the price because I received four machines to play with and a basic amount of things to being tattooing.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back when I first started tattooing, just so I could get started, and I was pretty happy with it at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power supply, pedal and clip cord work perfectly, and continue to run just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far of the four machines, two of them have cut out on me (and I maybe do a tattoo like every two weeks or so). Don&#x27;t be discouraged by this if you know how to build a machine.. They have great solid frames, and you can replace your coils, armature bar and springs and have a great machine. But if not, I recommend buying a higher quality machine with much stronger coils. I think that these are copper coated aluminum. If you&#x27;re a beginner, don&#x27;t waste time using these machines.. Get yourself a good quality machine, and your tattoos will turn out much cleaner and take a lot less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grips are great, a little too big for me even though they are average size (I have small hands), but they are great and get the job done. I&#x27;d recommend getting disposable grips however, and I only use the metal ones on myself. I also recommend silicone grip covers, because after a while this metal will hurt your hands (or maybe I just have dainty hands lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you do.. DO NOT use this ink on real skin! I know a lot of people probably ignore these warnings when starting out, but there are here for a reason. It is a waste of time. The ink will not stick, or the color will fade or warp. The black ink fades into a dark blue and looks like a 20 year old tattoo after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disposable tips and needles work just fine.. and so do the metal ones.. but like I said before, unless you have an autoclave for your metal pieces, just stick with disposables because you will not be able to sterilize metal without an autoclave.</li>
    <li> I bought a tattoon kit and its was pretty cherry just my machine power supply was pretty lame broke after one tattoo I did, power went out on the power box</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit straight from their website. The colors it comes with do not work. They fade way very quickly or just wont go into the skin. 2 of the machines stopped working after two weeks. After 3 weeks I left a tattoo 1/4 finished on the outline because the foot pedal stopped working. The company sent me a new foot pedal. After 4 weeks both the foot pedal and the power supply failed. I do not recommend buying this kit. Amazon has lots of tattoo guns here at great prizes. Amazon also has great deals on starbrite pigment ink sets which work extremely well. The book it comes with is ok but you can actually find all that information on youtube with visual examples. The ink it comes with a some no brand Chinese crap. Be careful with this ink. It is unknown if it safe. Do not trust Chinese inks unless you can find information about it online. Buy at your own risk. The only thing on this kit I currently used is the ink cap holder and the needles it came with. Other than that it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very good starter kit iv done 5 tattoos so far with it and the coil machines are still running along with the digital power source.&lt;br /&gt;One of the inks had opened and spilled all over the other ink bottles but cleaned right up.&lt;br /&gt;The practice skin is useless,it&#x27;s basically rubber, the book is written by an &amp;#34;artist&amp;#34; and it seems&lt;br /&gt;it only mocks begginer artist and it explains things as if you were an idiot. Didnt even give the Dvds a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Like other people on here already said the needles are pretty dull and not that sharp. I actually had to go over lines&lt;br /&gt;I had already tatood to make them pierce the skin. To avoid any trauma to the skin I would suggest to go by youself&lt;br /&gt;some good needles. The ink im not sure, havnt seen a tattoo healinorder to know if it will fade.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was in the kit nothing missing.</li>
    <li> everything was the same as described the machines work great I totally recommend for an aspiring artist  and it helps that the price is good to</li>
    <li> This is a great and affordable starter kit for someone who has never experienced the art of tattooing. Very easy to put together and use for the first time.</li>
    <li> Well I haven&#x27;t seen the gear yet but sofar its all good according to my girlfriend. When I get a chance to see if its junk ill give a new review. Hope it was worth the money you know get what you pay for lol you get five for none of it being broken sofar lol.</li>
    <li> the cost is a steal really the ink (for cheap ink) is good some colors could be thicker but over all not bad the reviews saying it was watery: well you do have to shake the bottles guys and maybe every order wasn&#x27;t as consistent as mine was. the machines are ok (still china made crap) but there good for 15 dollar machines. 2 liners 2 shaders but they need to be tuned the spring sets are good.&lt;br /&gt;the power supply to my surprise was great for the cost of the kit i expected alot less from a 20 dollar supply. clip cord foot switch is pretty standard but works well. nice array of needles but not enough tips to cover them all(sadly) grips are nice the tube backs are crap i trashed mine soon as i got it, buy the 10$ tube back 10 pack from amazon there better and cheap. so all in all the kit would cost you around 200 bucks if you pieced it out so cost is good quality is ok for a scratcher or apprentice. and on to the book, great read perfect for new guys with a passion for this art. the dvd strait junk they give you part 1 of a 12 part set and expect you to buy the rest, while a good idea not cost effective cheaper ways out there like go apprentice :D. the art flash dvd also junk no line work and its all very crappy work.  ok thats all i can think of all in all worth every cent for a starter set, fully recommended</li>
    <li> This is a decent kit for the price. The machines work great ounce you tune them correctly , except for one, but it&#x27;s a get what you pay for kinda deal. The ink is liquid chinese poop so order some starbrite or intense and you&#x27;ll be alot better off. All and all it&#x27;s a good kit for the money so if you are just getting started go for it.</li>
    <li> I got this kit for my daughter and she loves it,,  having gotten a kit  a couple yrs ago, this one blows it away,, I paid the same price then and it had only 1 gun,, this has 4 and  better  ink , moe needles  etc,, worth the price</li>
    <li> i think overall that i am in love with my new little machines. deffinently are amazing for begginers. the book that it comes with really helps alot too</li>
    <li> What I would like to point out is no professional, truly reputable supplier will ever be available on Amazon. I&#x27;m a tattoo apprentice and I bought this kit as a cheap practice set. The machines are brutal, all but one of them completely chews up my practice skin and I have to take them apart and tune them to get even slightly decent throw. The only ink I&#x27;m okay with using, even while practicing, is the black. Strictly for outlining. But! That being said, like all things that have to do with tattooing, you get what you pay for. So I can&#x27;t really complain. But not at all should this equipment be used on a living person.</li>
    <li> Kit is as described! Nice beginners set up has all pertinent items to begin tattooing. WIsh that it had transfer papers in the kit that would make it FIVE STARS!!!</li>
    <li> You pretty much get what you pay for. It&#x27;s a basic tattoo kit to get started. The only problem that I had is that the wire to the clip of the power cord came loose just by me lightly shaking it and I had to order another. I wouldn&#x27;t use this for INKMASTERS but it&#x27;s good for a beginner to hone their craft.</li>
    <li> good beginner kit and especially for the cost. You also get plenty of ink though i would recomend get a better quality like mothers</li>
    <li> Ordered as a gift. Perfect for learning / apprenticeship but I do not believe I would open a shop with them. I would order from the seller again, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend tattoo&#x27;s, so this came as an excellent deal. Shipping was perfect. It came on time and it was her christmas present so she was shocked when she saw the kit. 4 machines, with plenty of ink, needles and power supplies, it deserves 5* Rating for everything!!</li>
    <li> Came with everything it said it would. Very impressed and I was able to start tattooing the same day the kit arrived.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a decent quality kit! The book is great!</li>
    <li> If you are going to buy a kit, this is the kit for you</li>
    <li> Pro:  - Got the creative hand of tattooing fruit quickly&lt;br /&gt;  - Wide selection of colors to play with&lt;br /&gt;  - Find your style of Gun&lt;br /&gt;  - Lots of Clean, Fresh and Safe needles !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: - Not recommending to use on a Customer&lt;br /&gt;  - Still considering of self tattooing...&lt;br /&gt;  - Power Box is on the weak side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tattooing Kit is for the begging stages of practice tattooing. I would only recommend buying this product if you have some skill in drawing and knowledge in tattooing! On the up side, This Kit is perfect to tattoo Fruit and Pig&#x27;s skin; as well as the Kit is a all in one briefcase, with a clean black and silver finish. The traveling kit is handy, in addition the Accessories are well appreciated with a pair of gloves and a Wide Selection of Colors, including the Selection of Guns! The only down side I see in this product is the power source could be a little stronger but for the most part, I love the Tattoo Kit as its a start to my career.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product. I recommend this kit to tattoo artist. It has worked very good so far, after I re-tuned all my machines. But tuning is all about the artist. No a big fan of most of the inks, but I can and have replaced the inks. I also had to replace the caps of the ink bottles before I replaced the ink all together. The inks would leak out and make a mess. Other than that, this kit has been great and I would purchase another one if needed.</li>
    <li> The machine won&#x27;t turn off unless you unplug it and 4 of the colors on ink are bad. They won&#x27;t even shake up to mix. It&#x27;s like they are too old .</li>
    <li> Ink was a little messy when I got it... And 3 out of 4 of my machines don&#x27;t work lol butother than that I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> Ink was all blown up and spilled when it arrived. I do not Reccomend this to anyone because of that</li>
    <li> This kit is garbage.... the machines are worthless, there very cheaply made, the vibarate big time.. the power supply they advertise is a different power supply they send you.. the foot switch in junk. Everything about this kit is garbage. I had to buy everything new and replace everything! This kit is a huge mistake don not buy this kit! Its garbage! 6ou get nothing food with this kit. The tips and tube are fake as well. Plan on having you equipment rust and be pumping rust in to peoples bodys!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice kit for starters, nice equipment, and material also great book as well, for any one that wants to break into inking this is a nice package to get.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Frank H. Whittier, California</li>
    <li> I got this last year when the idea of me doing tattoos came forward. The book it comes with is preachy and there are better books out there but how it covers blood pathogen risks and what supplies you need was vital. The machines are great, but you need to adjust them to be either a liner or a shader (you can&#x27;t have a machine that does both). They do get warm, but it can pull a line very clean. The big complaint for me was the carrying case it came in was busted really bad. The ink it comes with is poor too but great for practicing on fake skin or melons (I used the ink on myself and had a reaction to it). The fake skin isn&#x27;t worth anything, more like a glorified mouse pad but it is a good start. This is perfect for an apprentice to get started. The basic flash is good for training lines and getting color down. THIS IS NOT FOR MAKING MONEY, this is for training, remember don&#x27;t do tattoos at home. Get in a shop, the book it comes with thankfully goes over that too.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING IT OTTA BE AND A HELL OF A LOT MORE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! WE GOT IT FAST AND THINGS ARE LOOKING WAY UP! THANKS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> All ink that came with kit were broken !  Plastic cups leak. And the ink were past their expired date printed on their label. Shipment was fast. Comes with basic DVD and a instruction book.  Rubber bands don&#x27;t fit either. Guns don&#x27;t fit in the foam inside case to keep secure.  Going to try and have them replace the ink.......wish me luck....lol.</li>
    <li> One of the machines was broken but overall happy with purchase :) Would still buy again</li>
    <li> I got my kit today.  First mine was missing the instructions. Second  I only got part one of the DVD.  If I had actually  got what I was supposed to my experience might have been better.  Trying to figure it all out without instructions is certainly frustrating.</li>
    <li> Love this tattoo kit.  It comes with radiant ink which is awesome. I recommend this to anyone starting out!</li>
    <li> THE KIT ARRIVED QUICKLY I ORDERED IT ON SATURDAY AND I GOT IT SUNDAY!!! ONTRAC AIR WORKS ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY!!! OUT OF THE 4 TATTOO GUNS 2 WORK REALLY GOOD THE OTHER 2 NEED ACCURATE TUNING TO RUN WELL. BUT ALL IN ALL YOU GET A BIG STACK OF DISPOSABLE NEEDLES,RUBBER BANDS,INK CAPS,ALL COLORS OF INK, AND MORE. THE DIGITAL POWER SUPPLY DOES THE JOB GREAT BUT I WILL UPGRADE IN A FEW MONTHS AND USE THIS POWER SUPPLY AS A BACK UP. I BOUGHT I SAW A KIT ON CRAIGSLIST AND WENT TO A TATTOO SUPPLY SHOP AND THE KIT WAS GARBAGE 2 USED GUNS AND HARDLY ANY SUPPLIES LIKE THIS KIT AND I GOT RIPPED OF AND PAID $100 THANKS AMAZON FOR POSTING REVIEWS!!!</li>
    <li> The kit came with all the equipment that was quoted in the description.The case was a little damaged on the inside but other then that the product works beyond average and is comfortable for use. I&#x27;ll recommend this kit for any starters looking to flourish in the tatoo industry .</li>
    <li> Good product.  It arrived on time. Price was fair for what it contain. No enough fake skin to practice tough.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.....my power supply cuts out, the guns are mis shaped apparantly and nobody returns phone calls. It is what it is......</li>
    <li> The kit is a great one to start with.  I&#x27;d recommend getting your own ink before moving on to practicing on someone.</li>
    <li> this is a great starter for anyone looking to begin. im learning alot from the booklet and cd that came with it.</li>
    <li> The whole set is grate no problems with anything well worth the money thanks</li>
    <li> I love it and it is great ,love the guns , the ink ,everything and i know that i will buy more stuff from them , and everyone that i showen them to love them and wounder where i got them from and how much . thank you so much</li>
    <li> All the stuff the kit said it have in it came with the kit is in it i cant wait to get started im happy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible. Everything was completely different then what they offered</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the low price. It is perfect for anyone on a budget. but the ink is not any good. I threw out the ink and got Skull Candy ink. I wouldn&#x27;t use the ink if I were you. but the guns are perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> Everything worked very well.although i recommend using the ink it comes to practice.ONLY TO PRACTICE &amp; do imply that you order other inks.(skin candy, kuro sumi, etc ...)</li>
    <li> I was very happy with every thing concerning the purchase. I honestly did nit expect much from a starter kit from online. The package itself arrived three days ahead of schedule which was great. All the items were there in great condition and worked very well. The machines were well worth the price. All four work great and the ink is also very nice. The book is very helpful to someone who would be starting as an artist. I was very happy this would be your best bet.</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing for begginers (Get better equipment and inks before working on other people) Everything arrived on time and in one piece. The only issue I had was with the foot pedal, amp, and clip cord but that happens alot with those things. I let the supplier know and he shipped me out all new stuff the next day. Would definitely order it again for any apprentices working under me.</li>
    <li> For someone just starting out and wanting/needing to get the feel for tattooing, the 4 gun kit w/ accessaries I got from Pirate Face was/is an excellent kit to begin with for the price around $100.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit, Id advised getting better ink allthough ive gotten tats on me with this ink yr ago and it still looks nice.</li>
    <li> this is a great kit to get started with and do some learning. Everything you need to begin is included. Machines need tuning to your personal preference. Plenty of sterile individually packaged needles and tips. Good to practice with and make mistakes while learning what types of needles and tips you prefer. Great company for supplies!</li>
    <li> Recieved this is a day before it said it would be! My husband ordered this because he wants to become a tattoo artist. Well everything was great except for one thing. The power cord that you hook up the gun to. It doesnt work unless you put a large ink cup inbetween the two prongs. Other than that, this kit is great!</li>
    <li> So far so good. everything was there, it all works. Im a newbie but i think it handles pretty well. easier than i thought. Great starter but definitly upgradable</li>
    <li> some of the reviews made me cautious when buying this product . that being said i now have to write my own. the people complaining about the \\&quot;poor quality\\&quot; of the power supply must not have know how to properly run it. if you tune the machines correctly and run them at the proper volts you will have no trouble with the supply. the machines are all of good quality and when properly tuned they run super smooth. read the instructional book in the kit if you have questions about how to tune the machines for different set ups. the book jumps around some but  the information you need is all there. don&#x27;t get over excited and skip reading the book if you are just starting out. you may regret it. all of the supplies in this kit were great, except the ink and the sheet of practice skin. the skin was cheap quality and basically useless. the ink is useless except for practicing on fake skin oranges or pigs. do not use this brand of ink on humans!!! but as far as the parts of the kit that were actually important the needles the machines the power supply foot pedal tubes ect... these were all great quality. sure there is better out there somewhere , but not at this price there isn&#x27;t . deff recommend these to any beginner. even for a professional who wants a few new machines at a decent price.</li>
    <li> great kit all four tattoo machines work great  but the ink is cheap made in china i would invest in some starbrite or intenz but with all the extras can&#x27;t complain all in all its wourth the money just use the ink to practice with and take my advice buy some decent ink</li>
    <li> i like this tatto machine,,, the colour of the grinder good,,,, the tatto machine gun i like,,, but the one that i did not like much was the book,,,, why not much tatto design pictures???</li>
    <li> Great kit I love it only thing that I was upset about is one of my guns are acting up still works but I have to stop and fix it quite a bit</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a beginning artist and he loves it and uses it frequently. No problems!</li>
    <li> we ordered this machine being brand new to tattooing im pretty happy with it so far we&#x27;ve already done about 3 tattoos but not all the stuff was in the kit like described.. we never received a stencil paper or practice skin so im not very happy about that</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. First time he did great. Easy to use and assemble and the carrying case fits everything and its easy to carry.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter and she was siked. she is an amazing artist and i think shes going to go somewhere with tattooing</li>
