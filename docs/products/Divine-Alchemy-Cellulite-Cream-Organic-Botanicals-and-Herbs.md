<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this for over a month and I do see a  difference.  I would buy this again. I do exercise too maybe that also helps.</li>
    <li> This product contains many organic ingredients and that is a challenge to find in this day and age. It goes on silky smooth, but leaves no greasy residue, just a mild fresh grapefruit scent. It sure does moisturize the skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> My lotion came super fast, which was great since I was really excited to try it.  I also appreciate that inside the lotion&#x27;s box, the bottle itself was sealed in clear plastic, so I knew that my lotion was brand NEW.  I love the citrusy-grapefruit scent, which is light and not overwhelming.  The lotion is really silky and made my skin suuuper soft, even my boyfriend noticed and that says something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a few days, so I will update my review in a few weeks :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help me with my stomach pre and post lipo surgery to help with stretch marks. [I will update this review with results pre and post.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the lightness of the lotion. It is light, but not watery. It has a great moist feel, but not oily. I could put my clothes on after using it and no stains!!! Yes! I have used my share of lotions that feel good at first, but are too watery to maintain the suppleness of skin. I have also used lotions that are too oily, and even though the skin is still moisturized... I have ruined my clothes. A+ on consistency of the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging. I hope I can add photos to this review. I loved the packing! The pump action bottle had a hard plastic around it that was great for shipping. Too many times have I ordered pump action bottles and it had already pumped in the box a few times before getting it. Not only am I cleaning the box up, but I have lost product that I paid to use upon receiving. YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH GETTING ALL OF THE PRODUCT THAT YOU ORDERED! I know I am pleased! A+ on the packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the citrus smell that is left lightly on my skin. A+ on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be updating this post in two weeks time. Try it for yourself in the meantime. You&#x27;ll get what you pay for and more!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product through a friend and purchased it for my Mom as a gift.  She has been using it for a short time but asked how she could get more of it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier that the product is doing what it describes and that I made the right decision to purchase this for her.</li>
    <li> I exercise 4 days a week and still my stubborn dimples remain.  I bought this firming cream with high hopes but little expectations. I have been using for about ten days now and I see a difference.  My legs look smoother and it seems like my dimples have lessened.  I have taken photos today (day 10) because I can’t believe that this cream works so well.  I will update you on day 20.  I looked up some of the ingredients and learned that caffeine helps the blood flow, flushing and firming the skin. Wow!  Another bonus is that smells really great.  I have tried other firming creams and been disappointed so I am extremely pleased with this firming cream and would give 10 stars if I could.  Bravo divine alchemy, you are divine in my book!!!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice lotion that absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave any greasy feeling or film. I&#x27;m not sure about the cellulite part as I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long yet. But it&#x27;s a good moisturizer that&#x27;s making my skin happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found some great products on Amazon in the past and although I&#x27;m not the type to buy beauty products, I bought this for my wife because she had talked about how much she hated other creams and anti-cellulite products she had tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny... she always told me that applying all those beauty creams was like &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;... with this one, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve seen her rub something on with a smile on her face... as if she knows she&#x27;s going to get a great result... You know women... they have this &amp;#34;sixth sense&amp;#34;. As a guy, all I can say is that she loves it, it smells great and I have seen improvement on her skin since she&#x27;s been using it... I&#x27;ll be buying more when she runs out to keep her smiling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars in my book!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and I started to apply the lotion right away that same day. Its been about a month I think and so far my skin is super smooth and soft. It has a very nice, light scent-nothing too strong. Easy to rub on, and not sticky at all. Packaging is also very nice, which I&#x27;m a sucker for. Definitely nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you updated on results after my bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few weeks and love it! I&#x27;ve used it twice a day and am so happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing. I have really sensitive skin and am always worried about trying new lotions, but this cream hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin at all! Love the smell too. Overall great lotion!</li>
    <li> Nice! This product does what it says. There was visible reduction of cellulite after regular use of two weeks. It is not greasy and smells wonderful. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have been using it for a few weeks and it seems to be working well for cellulite on my thighs.  It will make your skin silky smooth and most importantly it is not sticky even in the hot weather!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It smells great, goes on quick and easy (not greasy so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to soak in). The lotion leaves my skin silky soft and so far I am seeing improvement on my thighs where I started using the cream.  No doubt I need to order more to continue with my success so I&#x27;m hoping for better and better looking legs especially with increased healthy eating (that&#x27;s a no brainer...but it&#x27;s important to work from the inside out as well as the outside in).</li>
    <li> I love using this cream. I used it for a slighly different reason because It was handy when I was looking for lotion for my legs so I used it. This lotion smells really nice but not super heavy or cloying. When the weather is hot a lotion&#x27;s scent can get to be ovewhlming. This is not an issue with this product. Plus as a daily lotion it keeps my legs soft and I can see the improvement in my skin.  My legs just look better overall. I would definitely reccommend this and other products from Divine Alchemy Skin Care</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this Product!!! I&#x27;ve been using it now for approx 2 weeks - Love the feel, Love the scent, Love the way it makes my skin feel. As a avid essential oil user, the quality of the essential oils in this product are supreme! A little product goes a long way! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products by Divine Alchemy! I LOVE IT!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So far so great! I love that the product is light, not greasy or overwhelming with scent. It also is important to me that it is not tested on animals. Using it twice daily has proven to make a difference already and I am sure I will see more results over time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really have ugly cellulite, but other products have had such a nasty chemical smell that I was hesitant to rub them into my skin. I love the natural ingredients in this one, and it feels and smells nice so I don&#x27;t mind massaging it into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t make me worry about negative side-effects.</li>
    <li> truly enjoy using this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference but it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It feels good when you apply it - light, not too sticky, with a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has been really happy with this product. She saw results in her thighs in about a week and has not put this product down. We will surely buy more from this company!</li>
    <li> Smells great and goes on really smoothly.  I am seeing improvement since beginning to use this product.  I recommend it to anyone looking for an anti cellulite cream that works.</li>
    <li> I can describe this product is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Few days of using and  already can see difference.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my mom or mother&#x27;s day. I know she is going to LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable price always wins!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It arrived timely, and everything was as the seller said it would be.  I started using the lotion in conjunction with a targeted lower body weight training regimen (going for the dynamic due!) and I definitely see a big difference in my thighs and butt.  The lotion smells and feels great, and I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I have never ordered such a product before, but I decided to give this one a try.  The packaging caught my eye, so I thought, &amp;#34;here goes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product appears to be doing what it has promised.  I like the feel (not sticky, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue).  It also smells great.  I have seen an improvement within the first week - the cellulite places seem to be getting filled in.  I will continue to use this product and will post another review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect the 4 star rating will be a 5 star rating once I&#x27;ve had some time to use it a little longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I like it. It seems to be helping tighten up my skin in areas that I am trying to develop (abs, thighs). I workout as well, and this product seems to be very complimentary to my goals in the gym. I was worried when I first opened the bottle because the cream is pink. I&#x27;m not keen on smelling like roses all day. The scent is somewhat neutral, and will not make the man in your life smell like a lady.  This is a 5-star product! I&#x27;ll buy more soon!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and came quickly.  I have made it a point to give positive reviews for great products and this product is great!  The customer service is also very good; I reordered for gift-giving.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results of this product. Quality Content and packaging, I&#x27;ll be sending as gifts to a several friends.</li>
    <li> I would have bought this product if it wasn&#x27;t for the fake reviews.  All these reviews where written within few days from each other.  One reviewer (Jeffrey Alvarado) reviewed all three sizes of this product and apparently bought for his Mother in one review and for his sister in law in another (written on the same day).  I also find it odd that a MALE bought his mother and his sister in law Cellulite cream! (maybe that&#x27;s just me)  They all reviewed only ONE product and it&#x27;s this one (except for one or two unrelated reviews left around the same dates; common practice of fake reviewers).  It&#x27;s scams like this that makes one not trust the manufacturer. Trying to market your product using fake reviews will push consumers away.  Even if this item is wonderful and actually works, it did not get a fair chance to speak for itself in REAL reviews from REAL buyers.  I don&#x27;t care to get into an online back and forth argument with this company trying to save face.  Buyers have their own best judgment and will decide on their own.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful cream and I&#x27;ve been raving about it to all my friends. My skin feels energized so I&#x27;ve also been applying it to some areas where I have rough patches that wouldn&#x27;t heal and to lessen the appearance of a thick scar. I know that isn&#x27;t what this cream is recommended for but given the list of ingredients I thought it would do wonders AND IT HAS!! Honestly, I want to put it everywhere.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. See phenomenal results was quick and actually works. Smells great smells like grapefruit not oily no resadue at all</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks.  Great price and great product.  On my third bottle and I don&#x27;t want to cover up my legs these days.  Best service from any Amazon seller I have ever received.  I really like it, but the seller also offers an uncoditional guarantee.  Now the product sells itself.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> It felt good but I saw no change in my skin. It&#x27;s also pretty pricey for me.</li>
    <li> My lotion was packaged nicely and arrived quickly! Forget the fact that this is a cellulite fighting lotion, this is also just a nice body lotion to use. I love the mild grapefruit scent, and non greasy feel. Love the convenient pump bottle. I also like the ingredients and really like that the lotion is paraben free. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s helping me lose inches, but if it contains herbs and botanicals that help promote the breakdown of fatty tissue then why not!</li>
