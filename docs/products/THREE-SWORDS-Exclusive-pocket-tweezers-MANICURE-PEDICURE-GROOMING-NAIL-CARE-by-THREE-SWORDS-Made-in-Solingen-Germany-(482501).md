    <li> Perfect size for anyone who wants to have a nail file handy. It&#x27;s not too big and not too small. Love that it has a sleeve cover to go over it.</li>
    <li> Very good file, and the cover lets me carry it in my purse without fearing that something will get punctured.</li>
    <li> Great files. Bought 4. German, of course. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love this nail file.  Very small and files very well.  This is the best nail file that I have ever used.  Exactly what I wanted.  So glad that they are back in stock.  Plan on buying several more.</li>

    <li> I lost my file just like this.  I couldn&#x27;t live without it.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> High quality but a little smaller than I thought it would be. Great for use in a travel bag. The file works very well and is easy to hold. I like that it comes in a plastic sheath. That&#x27;s a very cool feature.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery-great mail file!</li>
    <li> Good, but not as compact as should be for dopp kit use.</li>
    <li> This file is a sweet little package. I like that it has a cover--no more pointy files sticking my finger when I fish around in my purse! Or poking holes in my cosmetic bag. It is wonderful for cleaning nails and for a quick filing of a snag. It is small and is easy to find a place for. I bought one for home too. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Just as described and fast ahipping</li>
    <li> Very high quality.  Compact for my purse yet works perfectly well.</li>
    <li> It is thin, could bend easily. The grit is wearing off at the end of 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> If you want to carry a nail file with you, this is a good one. It has a lightweight but sturdy case. It is smaller than a ball point pen but it is larger then the file you find on a nail clipper. I like to carry a nail file because I will bite my nails when I&#x27;m nervous and having a nail file saves me from wrecking my finger tips.</li>
