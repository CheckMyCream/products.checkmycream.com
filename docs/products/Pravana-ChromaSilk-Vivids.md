      <li>and I loved the color.</li>

      <li>But I love this dye!</li>

      <li>It arrived well on time and the color was really nice.</li>
      <li>Really nice color but</li>
      <li>you are looking for that kind of a look (and</li>

      <li>After one shampoo it lightens and stays nice silver.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product as a gray hair dye, it looks beautiful!</li>
      <li>Easy, good.</li>
      <li>If you want that color, you have to dilute the dye a lot (1:1 ratio or 1:2 of dye to conditioner) because it is very strong.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>First off, the color is more gray than silver, although it is still a very nice color.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It came out the perfect shade of silver wich faded to white.</li>
      <li>i do love that you don&#x27;t need a developer</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic if you have a cool toned, almost silver 9-11 blonde. It works great between touch ups as a non-damaging color mask to remove warm tones, at least that&#x27;s what I use it for lol. I originally used it to cool down my special effects pink to make it a pale dusty color before I went back to having normal colored hair before graduating college, and since dusty pink is the same maintenance as silvery blonde, it works the same but as a toner between dyes that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair (I always dilute my abnormal color dyes with conditioner).</li>
    <li> There is nothing better in this world than the color of this dye. Be aware that when using it, it comes out a rich dark purple-blue color. If you leave it on your hair too long, your hair will also be this color. I myself don&#x27;t mind the shade and actually purposefully leave it on a bit longer than usual to get that rich blue/silver color. Otherwise, if you&#x27;re not a fan, a good shampoo using Head &amp; Shoulders will rid you of the richer hue!</li>
    <li> I really love Pravana silver! I have used two tubes now since September 2014 and my experience using both has been great, although using the 2nd one has been better because of what I learnt the first time. This stuff lasts forever, smells great, and looks beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;main points&lt;br /&gt;-bleach hair to very pale blonde&lt;br /&gt;-straight from tube results in dark gunmetal grey (sometimes blue-tinted--this is not a warm grey--if that&#x27;s what you want, use nirvel nutre artx in grey)&lt;br /&gt;-diluting (with conditioner, no need to buy fancy products) gives a lighter grey, silver, or can be used to tone blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;-bleaching turns hair reddish!!&lt;br /&gt;-fades well with good hair routine, but very long-lasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my hair had to be bleached to a very pale blonde in order for the colour to work at all. Otherwise, you will have yellow or orange hair that hasn&#x27;t grabbed the colour at all (although if you want to use this to tone hair, it is good for cooling blonde shades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it straight out of the tube the first time and used it all up in one shot. The result was a very dark blue gunmetal grey, although I had been going for a more silvery look. At this time, I was still shampooing my hair regularly, and the colour didn&#x27;t last as long as I wished it would--it faded to a weird mermaid pale silver green? before the hair started returning to a pale blonde. I got compliments on it anyway, but it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, so to redo everything, so I did a bleach bath. I had read somewhere before that this happens and it is true--bleaching the colour out makes really processed hair turn a pale RED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stuck with white hair for a while and also stopped using shampoo, opting for putting vinegar in my conditioner. Months down the line, I touched up my roots and went for a diluted grey which has lasted for all of this year so far. (4 months without re-colouring) it has now faded to a mid-range silver colour, but I don&#x27;t think my hair will return to white. It probably will remain silvery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think the vinegar has helped extend the colour&#x27;s life, but even with regularly shampoo-ing the dye made my hair look cool for over two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included four pictures. The first shows the blue you might get using the product straight out of the tube, as well as the real shine Pravana gives. The second, with the lightest hair, shows the near-white hair I had before using the product again. The third shows the dark gunmetal achieved the second time around, pretty soon after I dyed again--mid or early February. The last picture shows the grey shade that remains two months later, at the end of April.n to white. It probably will remain silvery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think the vinegar has helped extend the colour&#x27;s life, but even with regularly shampoo-ing the dye made my hair look cool for over two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included four pictures.

    <li> Best ever, cut with conditioner and leave on several hours if you don&#x27;t want pewter.  Make sure your hair is bleached LIGHT first and you will have silver hair of your dreams.  Plus when you cut it this way it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This is great quality dye.  I bought it in silver and it says this is for hair that has been pre lightened to a very pale yellow, or white. So after lightening my hair accordingly, I shampooed it but didn&#x27;t condition. I did, however, apply neutral protein filler to my clean damp hair, left it  on for 20 minutes then applied the color right over it. I diluted the dye 1:1 with the generic white conditioner and left it on 25 minutes. It&#x27;s a little more intense than I intended, but after a few shampoos, it should fade to a lovely blue/silver. Oh and by the way, for those who don&#x27;t know, you can remove Pravana vivids, as well as any other direct dyes from your hair, with a clear permanent dye (any brand) mixed with equal parts 10 or 20 volume peroxide. This is a great tip I learned on youtube. Look up Guy Tang&#x27;s video on this to learn more. Cheers and happy coloring!</li>
    <li> it did not last after the first wash. but while  i had it my hair was silver... well more silver then my hair is normaly.</li>
    <li> Covers well, color exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Worked great diluted with 2/3rds Ion Extreme Moisture conditioner. Still some warmth but I didn&#x27;t bleach down very light so that&#x27;s on me. Hopefully the color holds up over time. My only complaint is that the tubes are a pain to deal with- mine caved under the squeezing and holes popped towards the end and made a mess. And the tubes are a bit small, which sucks. But for a higher quality dye, the price isn&#x27;t bad so I can&#x27;t complain there. But the packaging needs work to make it more convenient. Maybe a  tub?</li>
    <li> Got this for my Wife and she loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product for daily maintenance of silvery white hair. See the results for yourself in the pictures I posted...it works!!!   On my quest to take my natural golden blonde hair to a white platinum color I have crossed into the purple territory several times. Although cute, I still wanted the originally intended white color. I came across the silver color by Pravana and purchased excitedly.This is my first Pravana product and I am ecstatic with it. The color payoff is gorgeous and is build able on my now nearly white locks. I do not use this as an allover color...instead I actually add a a quarter sized amount to my shimmer lights shampoo with each wash and let it sit for about 4 minutes before rinsing. The color looks so perfect and I get several compliments daily with this product when used in this rinse method. I am addicted!!!</li>
    <li> Dyed my blonde hair blue with ginger roots. Completely destroyed my hair, now I have to salvage it with box dye or pay a salon.</li>
    <li> Worked beautifully!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Used the Silver... My hair was bleached from brunette to golden blonde. I put the Silver on for 30 minutes. My hair is blue- not even close to silver. Dark freakin blue. Do not recommend. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it smelled good and had a nice texture.</li>
    <li> We use Pravana Vivids in the salon that I work at and the haircolor works great and stays longer than any other &amp;#34;fun color&amp;#34; brands that I have used&amp;#62; I have personally used the silver which was too dark at first but faded very nicely after two shampoos to a great color that has maintained pretty consistently. I recommend using a purple toning shampoo to keep the silver color strong.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly- product as described. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful silver color, just a hint of blue in it so I definitely needed to dilute it to get that silvery blonde. Long lasting color. Always love Pravana.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work it was a waist of money it turned my hair green.</li>
    <li> I bought this in silver and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It can work as a great toner if you want to get your hair from a highly bleached blond to white or silver. If you want that color, you have to dilute the dye a lot (1:1 ratio or 1:2 of dye to conditioner) because it is very strong. So far it has not washed out much, which is not something I&#x27;ve found before for any toner or dye claiming to get your hair white or silver. I did about a 1:1 dilution and got a lovely silvery white. From other reviews I&#x27;ve read, the silver works best if your hair is the color of a peeled banana to a white color. If you don&#x27;t dilute it, it will turn out a steel grey, and the more you dilute it the more it will be silver. It does have a slight purple tone to it which is especially noticeable when the hair is wet (don&#x27;t panic about that), but I personally don&#x27;t notice much or think it&#x27;s bad looking when it&#x27;s dry. I&#x27;m really loving it so far and will probably buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I like pravana and I like grey as a color. I was not impressed with this though. It does have pravana staying power (about 3 weeks for me if I&#x27;m washing my hair every other day). I liked the way it faded to a soft grey then to a soft white. What I didn&#x27;t like was that it was VERY much a purple grey. I used 2/3 of the color and 1/3 of clear to dye my hair and ended up with a grey like purple. I had to was it several times to get the purple tones out. I&#x27;ve used other grey dyes before and this was a first. I think pravana is great but this color is not for me.</li>
    <li> To be quiet honest, I had watched a lot of videos on Youtube on how this should be applied and how it /should/ look after it&#x27;s been applied but it really didn&#x27;t even hit the mark on what I saw. Sure, it was an at-home application and I&#x27;m not hair stylist or colorist but I was sorely disappointed with how it turned out. It ended up turning my hair a blueish color and not even close to a silver color, I ended up waiting a week and just bleached out the color from my hair because it looked so...off. I suggest having a professional take care of your hair, I might donate it to my hair stylist and see if she could use it for someone else so I don&#x27;t waste 15 dollars on this purchase.</li>
    <li> Washed out after first shower.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I normally only have to use one tube of whatever color I use but I didn&#x27;t have enough with just one tube.</li>
    <li> A little darker than my own hair but, after a couple of washes, blends nicely.&lt;br /&gt;One application lasts about a week, if you don&#x27;t wash your hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;Still looking for a lighter, brighter silver.</li>
    <li> my hair turned out blue and only in some spots</li>
    <li> Awesome! Keeps my hair up between salon visits! I did have to dye it twice in a row to get it the shade I wanted but then it stayed!</li>
    <li> Washes out too quickly :(</li>
    <li> Difficult to use and did not cover well.</li>
    <li> The product came well wrapped! Also its easy to use, beautiful color and luster. I&#x27;ve used numerous of hair dyes. This has to be the best one I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR MY WIFE ..HAIR MUST BE BLOND TO GET GREY OR SILVER !! AT LEAST THATS WHAT IT DID FOR HER HAIR !!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I feel about it yet but eh I think maybe two tubes would have been enough for my hair or i should of used more conditioner but so far its kind of streaky and patchy i do love that you don&#x27;t need a developer so that&#x27;s a plus I just wish jet want so pricey tho</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I finally have my hair a chrome silver with slight blue cast.  Much better than harsh yellows that I get when tenting my hair.  I cut the mixture with hair conditioner to prevent it from getting very dark and also use shimmering lights for maintenance.</li>
    <li> This dye tends to lean towards violet, which isn&#x27;t the best thing.&lt;br /&gt;I have platinum hair, and when I dyed it with this, I layered the dye heavier on my roots to create a gradient effect, which would have worked, but the roots ended up bright purple for a week before it faded to grey.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts, though, and there aren&#x27;t many other grey dyes on the market, so it will do for now. It DOES end up the advertised color after a few washes, but it may come out purple at first.</li>
    <li> Be careful and strand test before using!! My hair pulled very blue from this product..yours might not though. I watched several youtube videos before attempting to use. Also, you need to be a level 9-10 blond (10 is the highest level blond you can get) or it will do nothing to your hair.</li>
    <li> This product turned my hair more lavender/purple than silver. But it came in a timely manner, the shipper was great.</li>
    <li> Love this but it&#x27;s NOT silver. My hair is a beautiful purple instead. Good thing I&#x27;m flexible.</li>
    <li> Its more blue than purple based. The ends of my hair retained a silver blue color long after the rest washed out. I like to dilute it with conditioner when applying.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, arrived as described</li>
    <li> For two years I have been dying for pretty silver hair. Finding this product I was a bit scared due to the reviews stating that it turned their hair blue. I did sone research and found that it is best mixed with conditioner. I had planned to do it myself but a friend wanted to help. I told her about the conditioner and she looked at me like I was crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bleached my hair, toned it, then added the silver. (Side note: I have long yet thin hair and the tube was barely enough to cover it. If you have thick hair get two tubes) After washing it out I noticed the blue. It&#x27;s light but it has a blue tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;The color it&#x27;s self wasn&#x27;t too bad but I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t silver. Figures. That&#x27;s what I get for not speaking up about the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also YOUR HAIR NEEDS TO BE WHITE!&lt;br /&gt;No yellow streaks here and there, completely white. I have natural lught blonde hair, I used Manic Panic bleach and toner and after washing it out I noticed the few bits of yellow but hoped for the best. The result, yellow patches shining through the blue! Though it is mostly at the tips and at the bottom but I see it and it&#x27;s obvious in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of the little negatives, I do really like my hair and am planning to do it again, but next time with the conditioner and better bleaching products!(:</li>
    <li> Totally in LOVE with this product!!!! It leaves my hair gray longer than any other product. Warning: if you&#x27;re looking for a lilac undertone this is more of a steel blue undertone. Just fyi.</li>
    <li> Make sure your hair is at its lightest blonde. It will not work on brown hair, yellow, brassiness etc. but other than that this product is great. I&#x27;m currently grey and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I recommend. Highly.</li>
    <li> Expensive item, not intended for business, and highly cost for shipment, this is for personal use only,</li>
    <li> Personally, I did not particularly enjoy this product. It has VERY blue undertones which make the hair appear blue in almost every lighting instead of the silver that I wanted. Additionally, it faded significantly within 5-6 washes.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go gray after chemo but this was not the product for a conservative gray Grandma.I thought I could apply it to my 67% gray/33% brown hair but the istructions require you to start with 100% white hair.  I will never apply it. I believe it has a lot of yellow in it so it appears more punk than I wanted. It may work for other customers.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, silver didn&#x27;t work out for me (I was trying for highlights). I understand that since my hair wasn&#x27;t completely bleached to the point of yellow/white, the silver would be subtle and not as bright, but I expected SOMETHING. In my particular case, I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair after using this dye. Bummer because it was really expensive.</li>
    <li> The color did not come out as gray as I wanted.</li>
    <li> If you want silver hair, this dye is the only thing you need.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to get silver hair for several years now (I never achieved it so I just ended up going blue, purple or black) and this is just... perfect.&lt;br /&gt;You gotta make sure you buy enough for your hair and YOU HAVE TO BLEACH YOUR HAIR FIRST. You have to bleach your hair to a very very pale blonde :) There&#x27;s no way to get silver hair without bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;I did my research and I found the dye comes out a blueish/purpleish-silver, so I mixed it with conditioner and left it in for about an hour and a half.  It came out the perfect shade of silver wich faded to white. I&#x27;m so in love the way my hair came out, I&#x27;ll totally be buying this again :)</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this. Just curious as to why it cost more than the other colors. Is that due to popularity?</li>
    <li> Thank you so much exactly what i wanted at the perfect price. Oo and on time delivery ..yasss&#x27;</li>
    <li> Bought this in silver..definitely blue not silver, but good product.</li>
    <li> Fabulous color and shine.</li>
    <li> I had my hair bleached to white, as per directions.  This turned my hair blue/purple.  I followed the directions to a T and only left it on to process for 20 minutes.  I had to dye my hair back to its normal color to cover it up.</li>
    <li> Works very well, long lasting, but must have very light platinum blonde in order to get a decent result</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by one of my stylists.  Didn&#x27;t stay in long enough, even with proper shampoo and conditioner.  Disappointed it didn&#x27;t cover all hair necessary.</li>
    <li> SOOOOO expensive! I spent $40 for 2 tubes when they are $5 a tube normally.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s a bad product, but I will say it&#x27;s not for me. I have dyed my hair a makeshift silver/gray before by mixing a number of other products, but decided to try an actual silver dye for once and bought the Pravana Silver. It turned out much darker than I was hoping for and it was definitely more blue than anything else, but also kinda purple and grey, but definitely a darker than I was hoping for (but not really dark dark, just darker than I normally go) and Pravana doesn&#x27;t fade as well as other products, which most people would love, but I hate it, I love the way my hair fades to white each time I dye it. So this product was fine, but I&#x27;d need to do some mixing of other products to get it to work for me. I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again, but it could just be my hair, sometimes it turns out the exact color I want and sometimes it&#x27;s way off from what I was going for, no matter if I&#x27;ve used the dye before or I&#x27;m trying a new one, my hair is fickle, it&#x27;s like bleaching your hair once a month doesn&#x27;t make it work properly or something. ;)</li>
    <li> Perfect to use both as a toner or to achieve the perfect silver hair trend.</li>
    <li> This can be a tricky color to apply/achieve on your own. There is a lot of blue in the dye, so for the first 10 washes for me, I had a splotchy blue/grey tone. Right now, almost a month after I applied the color, it&#x27;s close to the sample color, but there are still bits of my former color that show through. To get it this silver/grey you&#x27;ll have to literally pull all of the color out of your hair, applying this on the highest level of platinum blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend applying the dye by mixing it into a conditioner so that you get an even coverage. The pigment comes out very thick on its own and is hard to apply evenly this way.</li>
    <li> I will forever by Pravana for my hair color. The tracling was a bit wierd, but none the less, i got it in a timely manner and the response to the problem was quick and understanble.</li>
    <li> It made my hair green? My hair was almost white before this; therefore it wasn&#x27;t my bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Finally, a color that does what it promises, at least for now. I was reluctant to try this product, even after reading all the positive reviews. The product sat in my bathroom draw for over month until I got up the nerve to use it. WOW, I was so glad that I did. The color came out absolutely gorgeous, no bluing as others had claim, nothing but pure silver color. The areas of my hair that were ash blond was covered up and turned into a dark pewter that blends so well into the rest of my silver hair. I love this product so far, will update in 4-5 weeks to see if the color has held.</li>
    <li> It made my hair a beautiful dark gray. I adore this dye.</li>
    <li> Very nice gray color...but does not last past 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Best silver toner with zero damage</li>
    <li> Shipping was really quick! Not sure how it will work get since I have one more bleaching to do but the test strand looked pretty good!!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect.  The item was delivered on time.  It was just what I was looking for.  Will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> it was damaged when I got it in the mail......and it was not, not, not worth the money.........I will NEVER buy it again.......</li>
    <li> Every tutorial I watched to dye my hair silver/white/gray suggested this. So I was like okay cool I&#x27;ll try it! First of all, not a good price for how much you get. Second of all, it turned my hair the ugliest blue. My hair was a white blonde. The blue was horrible and it faded so so so fast. It&#x27;s been like a week or a little over a week since I dyed it and I&#x27;m back to my original hair color. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair was already beautiful, shiny and a silver white with cheap Sally&#x27;s toner which I applied month after month. Now... Now my hair has turned after using this stuff... From a purple to lavender to blue and it feels awful, not shiny anymore. Not gray, not silver. The box it came in looked very beat up and old.</li>
    <li> best dyed I&#x27;ve tried, stays in forever and doesn&#x27;t fade fast, BUT dilute dilute dilute! its very strong and comes out blue if not</li>
    <li> Perfect color, easy application!!!</li>
    <li> I love this color. My tips for the inexperienced consumer: Use a color safe shampoo and lukewarm water to make the color last longer. Don&#x27;t forget to read the instructions on the inside of the box and follow them carefully. Make sure you bleach your hair light enough first; I had to bleach mine twice.</li>
    <li> First off, the color is more gray than silver, although it is still a very nice color. It will only take on super naturally blonde hair or highly bleached hair. When it does take however, the color lasts only for about 3 washes then starts fading to a blue/blonde color then eventyually back to blonde.</li>
    <li> Use this without a developer.  I found it to last longer than I expected - about 6 weeks.  It fades very slowly.  It&#x27;s a wonderful blue-violet based ash tone that I use over salt-and-pepper medium ash hair.  I also like the Pravana 8.22 that does require a developer, but I think this one is my favorite because it does not require the developer.  Pravana also makes a blue-ash toner that I want to try.</li>
    <li> I applied the silver hair dye to bleached and toned hair that was completely white. Coming out of the tube, this dye is somewhere between purple and blue (more on the purple side). After letting it develop for the recommended 40 minutes I rinsed it out and my hair was Old Lady Blue. Towards my roots it&#x27;s a little more silver, but overall it&#x27;s definitely steel blue. The color is fine - I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on it - but it&#x27;s not silver. After shampooing it on the second morning, the blue faded a little, but not significantly. I&#x27;m hoping that within a week or two it will be more silver.  This formula was also pretty difficult to work with. It was thicker than dyes that come in tubs and bottles (Manic Panic and other brands like that). Because of that, it was incredibly hard to get on my roots. I have very thin, short hair and have never had this problem before. Even after applying a second time with specific attention to my roots I have spots where it just wouldn&#x27;t stick.  The tube doesn&#x27;t have a lot of dye compared to products at similar price points. I&#x27;ve been able to dye my hair 4 times and have plenty leftover with other brands, but I think I&#x27;ll only be able to get 1.5 uses out of this tube. I&#x27;m not sure if it would be able to cover a full application for shoulder-length hair.  *** Edit (one day later): I got pushed into an extra-chlorinated pool and that was enough to take all the blue out of my hair and left me with perfectly silver hair. Not the most controllable factor, but it worked out.   *** Edit 4/7/15: I decided to try this again, to see what would happen without the chlorine effect. Again, it was a little difficult to work into my hair, but my hair was a little shorter and I took my time and was able to get it all the way down to my roots. For the first week, my hair was a blue-ish pewter. After washing it a few times (and using a coconut oil mask to make the color fade faster) it has faded to a really nice silver. If things continue the waythey did last time, I expect that after a month my hair will be completely white. I&#x27;ve decided that I will definitely use this again, just with the expectation that it will not be the right color at first.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!!! I love it!!!! I have tried and tried to get my hair this color and this did it! if i could give it 10 stars I would!!! I am ordering more now!!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Silver Pravana two times now, and neither gave the desired results. I achieved more silver results from using a diluted blue conditioner-dye mix. I would not purchase a third time.</li>
    <li> • recommended! I love it!</li>
    <li> I made sure that I read the reviews for this product prior to buying it and everyone had some remarkable tips for using it correctly.  You do not use a developer with this product at all.  I did NOT use the product straight from the tube, however, I did mix it with conditioner in a 1:2 ratio (1 part dye to 2 parts conditioner).  Prior to using the product, I had bleached my hair and it had been dyed lightest ash blonde.  It turned a very pleasant shade of silver after applying the dye/conditioner concoction.  I still have enough of the dye left for 2 more applications after my roots begin to show.  I will most definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with purple and it gave my hair tons of shine and made it very vibrant. I LOVE Pravana they make the best products.</li>
    <li> I really like the look of silver streaked though hair so my hairdresser and I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say from the two stars - the results were horrible. There were indeed parts that came out beautifully silver, but there were also chunks of blue and even chunks of green. We went out in the sun to look at it and I knew I was in trouble when the little girl standing near me told me that I &amp;#34;looked like a mermaid.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for that kind of a look (and I know some people are), then this is the hair color for you. And in its favor I will say the color was stunning and my hair very shiny - but mermaid wasn&#x27;t the look I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairdresser next to us told us  had used this product before and had good results. When we looked at the Pravana my hairdresser used - and it was brand new and I bought it here at Amazon - she said that hers did not come out of the tube as purple as the one we had just used. She said hers was silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be careful when you use this product. I wish I had known this before I used it and double check to see the color as it comes out of the tube.</li>
    <li> Turned my hair blue. Do not use on white hair. Pale yellow blonde only.</li>
    <li> I have white blonde hair and I used the gray dye.. It was in for 55 minutes it looked great it was a gray color with a light lavender hue, every time I washed it it would fade a little bit which is fine because I like the silver color but it has been two weeks and all of the silver is gone and I am back to white blonde, no grey.. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> not sure if ever will use</li>
    <li> Love it! Does exactly what it says, and it arrived a little less than a week after I ordered it. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love the color, fast shipment.  Thanks we will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Do you want mauve hair? Then this is the product for you. Not white, not silver, and certainly not what I had in mind. Needed to bleach out the purple the next day. Not happy.</li>
    <li> This color did not come out as described. Took it to a professional, and it was not what was expected. Came out more of a purple/ash color</li>
    <li> It looks like a beautiful color if you can get it.  I tried, but did not have much luck with the color.  I plan on trying again.</li>
    <li> I use the silver color so I can keep my hair gray with minimum damage. I leave it in for at least 2 hours in order to get good color payoff. I leaves my hair soft when I wash it out. It&#x27;s a must for me.</li>
    <li> This color seems to have blue undertones in it so when it fades it does into a slightish green color ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also should have bought two because there was not sufficient dye to color the whole of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is above shoulder length but under the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wanting to achieve a grey silver hair color go lavender and let the color fade - which I did.&lt;br /&gt;Or go to a salon</li>
    <li> I use this once a week to combat the yellow overtones in my gray hair.  Just brush it through dry hair and then shower about ten minutes later.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> This totally crazy. Doesn&#x27;t show any effects at all. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Turned my hair blue first but then it faded to a nice grey</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even take on bleached out hair</li>
    <li> Two part review: the novice, and the expert. If you&#x27;ve never gone silver before, consult a stylist please. When I first tried this dye, I went to level 9 over a week or so before applying Chromasilk Silver. Well, I didn&#x27;t understand the directions, and my hair turned bright PURPLE. Granted, I was actually ok with this...but I also paid for silver. Over a month or so of using cheap shampoo to fade it, my hair was a god-awful color of washed out green (still unsure how that happened). Then, when I was able to lighten my hair up for a second round of dye, I got proper directions and learned how to mix the tube dye with the right amount of developer in order to turn my hair nearly white. It was awesome.</li>
    <li> The color was good for the three days that it lasted. I just feel like I paid a bit much for something to only last a few days.</li>
    <li> This product was reccomended by Michael James- he really knows what he&#x27;s talking about!</li>
    <li> so not silver, like a purple ish but with some conditioner you can fix it up but not the best.</li>
    <li> Everything was good color was good logging in&lt;br /&gt;Was a problem overall experience was good</li>
    <li> This dye is wonderful. Diluton for lighter shades possible - I just use conditioner. PLEASE NOTE: Pravana recalled their silver dye in the fall of 2014 due to accidentally manufacturing it with a green base. It was an issue - my second tube was affected and well, My hair was too. AFAIK they have&#x27;t re-released the new batch so please be careful when considering a purchase.</li>
    <li> It came out very deep</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this hearing all the reviews and desperately searching for a gray silver color that would actually work only to be disappointed.  I diluted this with a bit of conditioner because I didn&#x27;t want a super gunmetal gray and it turned my hair blue.  My hair was a platinum/white color when I first put the dye in so there shouldn&#x27;t have been any problems but my hair was blue.</li>
    <li> Works wonders if you lighten your hair properly first. Love the color.</li>
    <li> My natural curly  hair looks and feels  fabulous.</li>
    <li> oh, yeah.  this is just what I wanted, and it does seem great for hair.  it&#x27;s a real, deep silver.  I had to bleach my hair first (is naturally chestnut brown, with some grey) - and then left this on for a while.  Easy, good.</li>
    <li> It was nice, just didn&#x27;t like the blue undertone</li>
    <li> Gives a nice silver/ashy tone if you bleach your hair first.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! It&#x27;s very shiny and super silver!</li>
    <li> Good color.  Works well.</li>
    <li> this is supposed to be a silver hair dye left it in for 20 mins and it was dark purple plus I dyed it yesterday took a shower and it&#x27;s gone!! Worst hair dye ever do not buy if you tryin to get silver hair</li>
    <li> I used the Silver undiluted, like the directions said, on level 10 bleached hair that was previously toned. The result was awful muddy green and navy blue, not even remotely silver. Had I significantly diluted with conditioner, I think it would have been more silverish, but it still had an odd ashy base. I&#x27;ll stick with my Ion Lilac.</li>
    <li> This turned my hair blue.  Not all of it, but most of it.  I diluted the dye with conditioner as directed by a handful of tutorials, left it in for no more than twenty minutes, and still ended up with loads of blue.  Fortunately it gradually seems to be washing out and fading to silver, but I&#x27;m ending up with a blotchy result that I&#x27;m not too impressed with.</li>
    <li> Really nice color but one tube isn&#x27;t enough for my hair, I have blonde streaks on the top :(</li>
    <li> Came fast and looked as described</li>
    <li> Does not give consistent results</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even see a change in my hair color. The Ion dye is much better!</li>
    <li> I naturally have a lot of red in my hair and purchased the silver to make my hair more ashy. That being said, I didn&#x27;t bleach it at all. It covered the red great and I loved the color. However, it only lasted through two shampoos of just my roots, and I left it in my clean hair for more than an hour. If you don&#x27;t plan on bleaching your hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the silver dye, bleached it before hand as per instruction, and then let the dye sit on there for about two hours before rinsing out. My roots and some of the spots are silver, but for the most part its a light purple and blue color. Even then, the silver parts are just a very dirty looking blue. It&#x27;s a pretty color if thats what you&#x27;re going for, but don&#x27;t buy the silver if that&#x27;s what color your expecting your hair to be.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing stuff ever! I have silver/ gray hair and tried a product meant to give shine and body. It turned my hair pink!! Pravana rescued me!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to jazz up my nautral salt and pepper hair.. Looking for a product that REALLY accentuates the &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; highlights of the grays...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again... maybe leave it on lomger next try, but HOPE by doing so I won&#x27;t be a &amp;#34;blue haired&amp;#34; old lady LOL</li>
    <li> I say I like this, because I would if it was the color I&#x27;d expected.  I have white/grey hair.  It&#x27;s silver mixed with white around the face, kind of cool except that I&#x27;m old.  I thought this might turn the grey more of a shiny silver color.  And, that it does only it messes up the white which I want to be virgin white.  I&#x27;m glad I did a patch test first otherwise I&#x27;d have had a head full of silver hair and I&#x27;m looking for white hair.  So it was my mistake, but the product works great, it&#x27;s very easy to use.  I just took a strand, covered it with the product, waited 20 minutes and yes, I had silver/grey hair strand.  Maybe if I&#x27;d done my whole head it&#x27;d look silver.  I think if you are a young girl, trying to get that grey color that is currently in vogue, you can bleach out your hear, put this on and get there.  But, test first!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  I recommend using Color Charm Toner T14 instead</li>
    <li> Silver color  Update/revised review Sep 24 2015  2nd tube  Okay I knocked off 4 stars because the first tube I got was great with excellent results. My PROBLEMS with it,  the 2nd one did not come out silver results medium dark golden brown with a few streaks of yellowish muddysilver freak color. I also noticed these 2 things that never happened before it burned and it was rather difficult to mix. If like me you have a problem with yellow and or brassiness avoid this like the plague. Besides the regular ingredients in a separate section it says  May also contain  1-  Blue 1 Basic red 22 (I......2- 11055 Basic orange1 (CI.....3- 11320 Basic violet1 (CI...  4- 42535 Basic yellow 57 (C1......5- 12719 Basic green 4 ( CI....42000 Yellow 87, orange 31 CI..  6- 20050 violet 14 (I 42510.......

    <li> I liked the color. My daughter said my hair had a green tint though.</li>
    <li> Pavana  silver. I used this a week and a half ago. I mixed it 50/50 with conditioner left it in for the recommended time, I had very little results. So I used the second half and tried again, this time I left it in for two hours... the color is amazing the perfect silver grey a little blue in certain lighting. After a week my ends started turning green. I trimmed my ends and I now have a silvery white color I adore. I only wish the price would quit climbing. I am now looking for cheaper akternatives.</li>
    <li> This hair dye made my hair blue as opposed to silver. It was a pale blue but still more blue than silver</li>
    <li> It comes out as a gray with a baby blue sort of tint, I really didn&#x27;t mind the blue tint except for the fact that if you concentrate the product in one area too much like I did on my bangs it comes out more blue than gray. But other than that, I love the product because you don&#x27;t need additional products to mix it. But just a warning if you have hair that goes to above your chest, I would recommend at least three tubes.</li>
    <li> color says silver but its really more of a silver BLUE, heavy blue undertone, if your hair is not platinum white it will come out blue, once you wash it out a few times it turns silver eventually</li>
    <li> Hello, I&#x27;m a French Boy living in France. I bought this gorgeous silver, it really works! The bad point : the delivery for France is really expensive, and I&#x27;m not Happy about that! That&#x27;s why I put 4 stars and not 5.</li>
    <li> LOVED! Dark gray w/ blue base if used concentrated. If diluted with conditioner(white creamy conditoner. 50/50 mix) very silver. I loved it. I left mine on for 60 mins. i wash my hair 2-3 times per week &amp; need to freshen color every 6 weeks but I dont mind because this product is not mixed w/ damaging developers. My hair was bleached 4 times w/ the coconut oil method ( I have naturally jet black hair) &amp; it&#x27;s right above my butt in length. Initially I used Wella T18 but it did nothing for my roots( they were still blond), the rest of my hair was silver. The Pravana made it all silver. I also usr Loreal silver Shampoo which if I leave on for too long  gives me a pretty violet irridescent.</li>
    <li> I had better results with this than i was able to get from my hair stylist. I didnt mix it with anything either, just straight from the tube. But i would recommend having a professional bleach your hair ultra blond first in order to acheave the real silver. Also because this has blue toner is why you get better silver. The voilet ones turn out too light for me. More ash blond. After one shampoo it lightens and stays nice silver. It will be little darker at first if u do it straight from tube with no diluting. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Item as expected, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Looks amazing and I can use it multiple time! Although the shipping is quite bad. I wish the box wasn&#x27;t ruined. Thought it could smash the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this dyed my hair well! I saw many YouTube vids about this product too. I was skeptical but now I&#x27;m all about it!!! Will buy it again if I need more.</li>
    <li> The color didn&#x27;t take as much as I would have like and it left a slight blue-ish green-ish tint in my hair when fading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been monitoring the hair coloring trend lately and have been fond of the pastel shades but didn&#x27;t want to go for the current trendy purple or blue that everyone is doing.  Especially as a guy.  So I sought out a Silver and Pravana makes the best and I personally feel the only one you should use in hair color world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say for short hair one tube worked great for the first time using.  You do use a whole lot (trust me the more you use the better) the first application so it does leave little left for touch ups.  If you have longer hair I would imagine you need to use a full tube so make sure you use purchase two tubes.</li>
    <li> Nice color and leaves hair soft. I have not had any issues with this particular color transferring to my pillow case, etc. and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH I FOUND IT.&lt;br /&gt;Finally!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to dye my hair silver/gray for the longest time, but I was never able to find anything that worked. I had been using some Wella toners/additives for a couple of months, but because it required peroxide, it always fried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, and although it&#x27;s not permanent, it&#x27;s super easy to refresh the color.&lt;br /&gt;Applying the color directly to the hair is kind of a waste because it doesn&#x27;t spread too easily, and you&#x27;ll end up using the whole tube for a small section, so I recommend diluting it into some hair conditioner if you&#x27;re trying for a lighter silver color! I mix it into generic conditioner so that it&#x27;s a few shades darker than how I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;It washes out/bleaches out super easily, so it&#x27;s not a long-term commitment color and oh my gosh I need to buy 5 more of these because even as it fades, it just seems to turn a more beautiful silver.&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip, but if you want to color to be even and more of a shiny silver tone, I suggest bleaching your hair to the palest shade of yellow/white that you can get it to. Most of the area I use this dye on is pretty pale, but it doesn&#x27;t accept well into darker blonde towards my roots.</li>
    <li> Great product thanks again</li>
    <li> It turned my hair blue. I was able to mix organic vitamin C powder with shampoo and leave it on for awhile to get the blue out tho.</li>
    <li> This may work for some people.  For me my hair was colored black.  I greyed and then colored my hair.  I decided to let it go natural.  I cannot find anything to put on the area I am trying to let grow out. This did not color my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! More on the steel grey side.</li>
    <li> That you have to buy the lightener/bleach before you use this. I was all excited to add some highlights until I read the directions and discovered that I&#x27;d need to bleach my hair beforehand. Nope. No thanks. Wish I would have known that BEFORE I bought it! ;(</li>
    <li> This dye made my hair more blue than silver</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair also feels after. Just make sure your hair is light enough to take it. My hair did not turn complete sliver but I know it is because my hair is not light enough and the grey hair turned such a pretty sliver I am going to use it again!</li>
    <li> Did not last very long but would be willing to try again</li>
    <li> Definitely works. I love it.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re small bottles so order two unless you have a pixie cut. For long hair your best bet is to order four so keep that in mind when looking at the price.</li>
    <li> Bought for my Mom (totally gray hair) to give her hair some kind of depth. She loved it. It&#x27;s been really hard to find this kind of color anywhere locally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the other colors pravana has but this wasn&#x27;t very great and kind of &amp;#34;dulled&amp;#34; my hair</li>
    <li> I had this idea to get a streak in my hair, and I had no idea silver faded so fast. I was throwing a fit because it faded and started to look dull and coppery. I searched high and low for something I could have at home to do touch ups. I tried Manic Panic and some other similar product that the results were more like a toner, not really recreating the silver I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with conditioner based off of a You Tube video I saw, and it works perfectly. I only have a streak, and I&#x27;m mixing it so it isn&#x27;t so blue/purple and more silver, and this supply should last me fine.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! its has a blue undertone .</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works better on already bleached hair!</li>
    <li> It arrived well on time and the color was really nice.</li>
    <li> If you are hoping for silver, do not buy this. It is more of a purple-ish silver at best.</li>
    <li> No developer needed, smells great!</li>
    <li> If you want light blue hair this is good but it does not work for silver...</li>
    <li> fantastic colour and long lasting!  Easy to use and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I lightened my hair to a plat blonde with yellow flicks in it. I put this over it and my god, my hair looks amazing! I get compliments everywhere I go! My only problem is that I diluted the dye 1:1 with conditioner and I still didn&#x27;t have enough to cover my entire head evenly (Full head of thick hair to my collarbone). The color is great though.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I now see that I should have diluted this first. The silver I was shooting for actually turned out periwinkle blue. My hair has been bleached multiple times, and therefore it porous and does not hold color well. It has washed out significantly in one wash-- but is still not anywhere near what I would call silver. Next time (if there is one) I will give it a shot and dilute it. But I feel like such a reputable brand could at least make something that does what it says without having to alter it.</li>
    <li> This works so well after you have bleached your hair. Best silver I have gotten!</li>
    <li> 1 tube was not enough, but the color is fab!</li>
    <li> This turned the bleached parts of my hair a lovely gray, even though some parts of my hair still had a little bit of pastel green and pink in them from the last time I dyed it. I highly recommend this product as a gray hair dye, it looks beautiful! Just a warning though - I got some of it on my brown roots, which have grown in over the last month, and it turned them an almost reddish color! It&#x27;s not an ugly color, but it looks a little odd with the gray. I guess I should&#x27;ve expected this, since it&#x27;s a toner, but all three of the other toners I&#x27;ve used in the past (Manic Panic in Virgin Snow, La Fiche Directions, and Wella Colorcharm in &amp;#34;White Lady&amp;#34;) have never done this. I guess I&#x27;ll get my roots bleached eventually, so this isn&#x27;t the worst thing in the world, but just a warning if you have dark brown or black roots!</li>
    <li> This was easy to use and took well but I would not call this color silver. It&#x27;s more of a deep violet  gray even on well bleached hair.  It&#x27;s pretty but if you&#x27;re looking for a true silver this is not it. Update : I just used Wild Orchid and it does not look at all like the picture. It is a BRIGHT magenta. Good for doing the Galaxy Hair look when paired with blue but way off from the picture.</li>
    <li> I tried to dye my goatee with this, and it did not work at all. I applied it twice, onto bleached hair, and got about 25% coverage. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair Multiple times with basically every color and never seen a dye product just not work.</li>
    <li> It was so heavily pigmented that my hair turned blue. Having used silver dyes before I expected it to be blue or purple initially but it never did fade out to a pleasant silver color.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have blond enough hair first, and use a toning shampoo/conditioner. This dye is THE BEST and ONLY silver dye I use for my cosplay. You can make it range from a blue anime silver (sometimes you need to leave it in longer) and then use the toner to get it more like Storm from X-men. If you have longer than shoulder length hair, get two for sure! But I love this dye!</li>
    <li> Tricky to get real silver continuity. First time some turned out purple. This time it&#x27;s more pewter. Washes out SO fast even with using cold water and not shampooing more than 2 times a week</li>
