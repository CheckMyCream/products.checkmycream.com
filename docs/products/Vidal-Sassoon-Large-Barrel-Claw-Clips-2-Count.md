      <li>This is an ok item.</li>
      <li>These are ok.</li>
      <li>but they are okay.</li>
      <li>Just like ones in store but not as costly :)</li>
      <li>Which is better.</li>
      <li>These are great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re medium at most.</li>
      <li>Effective clips for getting shoulder length curly hair out of the way quickly.</li>
      <li>These are cute but broke rather easily.</li>
      <li>Large and good for holding hair up.</li>
      <li>Functions, but snaps in pieces really easy.</li>
      <li>The teeth brake off easily.  </li>
      <li>These break and bend really easily.</li>
      <li>The quality is alright, will break somewhat easily if dropped.</li>
      <li>They are still going strong.</li>
      <li>These hair clips are great, they stay in all day, and I have no loose pieces.</li>
      <li>One point to share is that my hair is fairly fine.  </li>
      <li>really cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>Does not hold hair securely.</li>
      <li>They fit a lot of hair, and I can even jog with them in if I wrap my hair in a bun and put the clip in just so.</li>
      <li>Was hoping they would keep my hair secure up in a bun.</li>
      <li>....feels cheap and doesn&#x27;t keep my hair clipped up</li>
      <li>with the curve, it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
      <li>Good colors to go with everything and strong enough to hold my hair.</li>
      <li>ok if I just pull up part of my hair or if I don&#x27;t mind having some of my hair fall out, but I prefer to keep ALL of my hair up during the hot summer months.</li>
      <li>Great for my long hair and keeps it all contained.</li>
      <li>and it took more than two years for one of the two to break, which is good compared to other brands.</li>
      <li>Even though they are described as large, i think they are more medium in size.  </li>
      <li>They are more of a medium than a large size.</li>
      <li>but I still use them cautiously for a quick updo around the house.  </li>
      <li>Good size; can easily hold all my hair (average thickness).</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention to the description that stated the length and that they are good for holding bangs or small sections of hair.  </li>
      <li>This item is fine but it says its large and its not it doesnt hold my hair</li>
      <li>VERY WELL!!  </li>
      <li>and they really hold secure.  </li>
      <li>These hold tighter than I had expected which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>This is one of the many styles of jaw clips available in local stores.</li>
      <li>I wish I had spent more money on a better product.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>These shipped in a decent amount of time and came packaged fine.  </li>
      <li>Comes right out.</li>
      <li>Price is right.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s 6 clips right.</li>
      <li>The end of the tines is pointed and digs right into your head.</li>
      <li>but if you are looking for a very very large clip, I would recommend searching elsewhere.</li>
      <li>These have worked perfectly for me since I got them a few months ago, with almost daily use, even during running.</li>
      <li>The plastic is very light and fragile - looks and feels like it will break if used.</li>
      <li>so they were perfect not to small and not to big!</li>
      <li>Springs are better quality as well, I&#x27;ve had these several months, wear them often, no signs of breakage or coming apart.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disappointed with the product. I liked the size but the material is cheap thin plastic, it can&#x27;t hold my long hair. It also has sharp teeth that hurts my scalp when using it. It&#x27;s pretty much useless to me now so I stop using it.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> These were exactly the size that I wanted and work great for holding my hair up.</li>
    <li> super strong clip holds thick hair due to it&#x27;s shape.</li>
    <li> The clips I got are not the ones pictured. The ones I received have only 7 teeth, the ones pictured have nine. These are not large clips, they are the same size you can buy anywhere. Terrible misrepresentation by the seller. Cheaper to be stuck with them then to ship them back. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know because I got them I help my friend/ family with long  hair</li>
    <li> NOT large.  I must have received the small clips.</li>
    <li> Got these for my Daughter , she has very Thick Long Hair , works Great , She wears them quite often when she wants her Hair Up</li>
    <li> These are too small, much smaller than I expected, and will not hold all of my hair.  I am going to send them back.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I needed them to be.</li>
    <li> gives my head a pain.</li>
    <li> surprisingly, these clips have not been broken yet! I am terrible about breaking the teeth off, but even with being man handled by my 4 year old, they are holding up well!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for shoulder length hair - I would highly recommend. They are strong but not heavy, but not super light cheapies either, they are priced right too. When they say &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; , I would call them more medium. If you have mega long hair, this will not hold all of your hair.</li>
    <li> Small not large. Unhappy</li>
    <li> Barely holds half my hair, granted i have a lot of it. I just thought that these being &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; would have meant something. I ended up going to Ulta and getting two different clips that worked much better.</li>
    <li> There is nothing &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; about these clips. I wanted something comparable to the large Goody clips and these definitely do not compare. They are a decent length but the barrel is is very small. It would never hold my hair like the Goody large clips.</li>
    <li> In what world are these a large barrel? I guess UK Women are almost bald? Good clip, but this is not a large.</li>
    <li> These are not large enough for very thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Same as those in stores, but cheaper. I use on my long, very thick hair, and they hold up well.</li>
    <li> These are very small and barely hold any hair. Definitely not large. Horrible!</li>
    <li> So I was looking for large clips cause my mother has extremely long thick hair and she has to wear it up for work. She uses large clips everyday. Well so we have searched high and low for large clips like she has because hers have either broken or gotten weak from so much use. So I got on here and I saw plenty that were just what id consider medium sized (which is what these turned out to be in my opinion) and then some that were outragiously prized to be a single clip. Then I found this one. Two 7\\&quot; clips for 4 bucks I was on it. Ordered three packs so I knew she would have enough to last a good long while. That&#x27;s 6 clips right. Well. I get em and the clips are 4\\&quot; inches the cardboard they come on is 7\\&quot;. Really product description??? Are you selling the the cardboard that holds the clips or the clips themselves? So of course they won&#x27;t hold her hair and I find myself with 6 new clips that I hardly use cause I got a drawer full of different ones at home already. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the trickery used in this product describtion</li>
    <li> The clips are too big for many people, the point of the curved part stick into your head and the material is that cheap brittle plastic that absolutely will not last!  I won&#x27;t be getting anymore of these!</li>
    <li> Nice add on item. Large and good for holding hair up.</li>
    <li> Very affordable considering that the plastic material used in making this claw clips are in high grade!</li>
    <li> Completely useless for my thick hair. No clenching power so it wouldn&#x27;t even hold it tight initially. Gave them to friends with thin, thin hair. The search goes on.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a good spring which make a tight grip to hold long hair up. My hair kept falling and had to keep twisting back up and readjusting through out the day....</li>
    <li> These clips are perfect for long, full, thick hair. They anchor well &amp; don&#x27;t usually slip out of place. Springs are better quality as well, I&#x27;ve had these several months, wear them often, no signs of breakage or coming apart. Well made.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep my hair up. My hair is shoulder length, wavy, and of medium thickness. These clips dig into my scalp.</li>
    <li> Hold is good but some of the teeth broke on the second day :/</li>
    <li> Product Dimensions: 3.5 x 7 x 1.5 inches.....no way was any measurement 7 inches! DEFINITELY not large.</li>
    <li> Holds hair really well</li>
    <li> my hair is between thin to medium thick and it is the perfect size for me.</li>
    <li> First clips that hold my hair in place for hours and hours.  Thrilled with them</li>
    <li> My hair is about 2&amp;#34; longer than shoulder length, and these clips do not hold the hair up.  The loosen and have to be readjusted often.</li>
    <li> These are great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
    <li> These are cute but broke rather easily. They are also painful after a few hours. I didn&#x27;t care for the sharp ends on my scalp if relaxed on the headrest while driving.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use, hold my hair firmly (despite all my layers) and are so comfortable to wear. No more pulling and breaking. Yay!</li>
    <li> Still not really big enough for my long thick hair but they are okay.</li>
    <li> Not big enough to fit my hair. :(</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and needed something large to hold it back.  These have worked perfectly for me since I got them a few months ago, with almost daily use, even during running.</li>
    <li> These are too scratchy for my tender scalp but I still use them cautiously for a quick updo around the house.  I have used other more effective hair combs in the past, without the scraping.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy. Does not hold hair securely.</li>
    <li> I have very, very long, thick hair. This clip does a decent job holding it up. Would recommend especially if you&#x27;re hair is of moderate thickness.</li>
    <li> These are ok. Was hoping they would keep my hair secure up in a bun. However it doesn&#x27;t stay, slips out. I think it&#x27;s because the teeth don&#x27;t extend past each other, they just touch so it doesn&#x27;t grab the hair closest to your head really, just the hair in the bun.</li>
    <li> nice clips, fits well in my kid&#x27;s thick hair</li>
    <li> Ordered exact same clips off as previous order however this time the clips were much smaller.</li>
    <li> NICE and TIGHT hold.  Keep in mind that these clips are very long so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for children due to the length and it sometimes hits the back of your neck which can be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> These are as I expected. I do wish they could hold more hair but they measure as advertised and were a good price.</li>
    <li> These break and bend really easily.</li>
    <li> On my second set of these. Had them for about a year before one of them broke and I bought the second set. Great for my long hair and keeps it all contained.</li>
    <li> Super comfortable with great hold.</li>
    <li> The spring in these clips isn&#x27;t tight, so it doesn&#x27;t hold hair up well at all. Comes right out. I have long, thick hair, so I need a bigger, stronger clip. These are a waste.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make my ponytails &amp;#34;clip-ons&amp;#34; and they did the trick well.  More will be purchased soon.</li>
    <li> Good for holding hair in place after washing and while taking showers/baths.  Hard to find these larger clamps in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> really cheap plastic. Functions, but snaps in pieces really easy. Will hold thick hair, just be very careful or part of it might snap off.</li>
    <li> I call them spiders!&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking around in different stores but were having problems finding ones in this size.  I have a long hair and thick, these &amp;#34;spiders&amp;#34; (ok, claw clips) are neither big nor small.  They are perfect!</li>
    <li> Even having read the other reviews and knowing these were only four inches they&#x27;re STILL smaller than I expected. The curve affects how much hair it can hold. My hair isn&#x27;t even long or particularly thick and it won&#x27;t comfortably hold all of it. They&#x27;re medium at most. Ignoring size issues they&#x27;re not very well made. The spring is weak and totally exposed, the plastic is thin, and they look chintzy in person. I bought Vidal Sassoon Dual Teeth Claw Clips, Black and Brown, 2 Count (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OT1S0G?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) for a few dollars more and they&#x27;re worlds better - about the same size but straight, look nice, strong, thick material, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Which is better. Hair tie or hair clamp? I personally think hair clamp because it allows me to keep my hair out of my face and still look hot. Nice Quality. Just like ones in store but not as costly :)</li>
    <li> These clips are strong and perfect for keeping medium/long hair up. thanks!</li>
    <li> Arrived as pictured. But these are not useful for straight and silky hair. They just fail to hold staight hair.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these and had the following feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;They poke and stab no matter how you wear them. They are more of a medium than a large size. After 2 weeks of use, teeth have cracked off of both clips. I wish I had spent more money on a better product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t stay put or hold long hair up at all.</li>
    <li> I have average thickness long hair and this clip grabs it all and keeps it in place.  Much better than the drugstore clips which are always too small and weak, and fall out after a while, or if I am exercising, etc.</li>
    <li> The clip is 3.5 inches - much smaller than led to believe. The plastic is very light and fragile - looks and feels like it will break if used. The spring is weak and if you have thick hair it will not keep your hair in place. The teeth are very sharp and hurt your head when you try to grip the hair with the clip.  DO NOT BUY. Goody makes larger sturdy clips which can be purchased at Walmart - a pair (black and brown) will cost you $3.47.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and unstable. Didn&#x27;t hold my hair up at all, not impressed!</li>
    <li> They do not hold my hair at all, barely have any &#x27;grip&#x27;.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was expecting. I have very thin hair so they were perfect not to small and not to big!</li>
    <li> These hair clips are very weak. My hair is long (reaches my waist) but rather thin and all other claw clips hold it without any problems, even when it is wet and gets much heavier.&lt;br /&gt;These clips do not hold my hair at all and the hair immediately slips down.&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to have waisted $4 on it, it is useless to me.</li>
    <li> All I can say is,&amp;#34; They are crap&amp;#34;! These clips broke within a few uses! The teeth brake off easily.  I have others that lasted decades.  I think same brand.</li>
    <li> Effective clips for getting shoulder length curly hair out of the way quickly.</li>
    <li> Good hair clips, but not for thin, fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t hold well for that type of hair. Otherwise, good product.</li>
    <li> I love them! Very sturdy. I finally found clips that will hold my long hair. Can&#x27;t find anywhere in stores.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these clips.  Good colors to go with everything and strong enough to hold my hair. Received in two days with Amazon Prime - great service.  One point to share is that my hair is fairly fine.  Not sure if these would work for those of you fortunate to have thick hair.  Even though they are described as large, i think they are more medium in size.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> I use these clips to hold my hair out of the way when I need to do my hair in sections. Love &#x27;em. :)</li>
    <li> Very low quality and is useless.  It coundn&#x27;t hold my hairs at all.</li>
    <li> They said LARGE but they were just a big small size. I needed something for mu thick long hair. Blah.</li>
    <li> I love these barrel clips.  They contour to your head well and hold lots of long hair.  Just wish they came in more colors.</li>
    <li> pretty much as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use to use banana clips but could not find them . Then I accidently dropped my last one. My hair was to my mid back and could not find a clip big enough to hold it for longer than 2 seconds then I found these. They work great! I bought 4 so Im good for a while. When I need more I will order these again.</li>
    <li> I am saving these for a special occasion and am so thankful I found the Vidal Sassoon name I would pay double for these,lol are a life saver for hair.</li>
    <li> I have long thick curly hair and usually manage to break clips, barrettes, and the like. I haven&#x27;t wrecked in several months these so, these clips are awesome! They can hole a lot of hair and hold it well. I maybe wish they were a smidge deeper to get a better grip but they work just fine!</li>
    <li> These are made of quality plastic, not sure what else to say about this item. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> These shipped in a decent amount of time and came packaged fine.  My problem with them is that they really are not big enough for me.  I have searched everywhere for LARGE clips and still have not found them.  I would call these medium, NOT large.  They are of decent quality I guess and what not but not going to be of much use to me because I have too much hair and can not use them.  The description does not have a size.  I would advise adding this.</li>
    <li> Finally for thick heavy hear with out tearing or using a hair/rubber band.</li>
    <li> Hey they hold this girl&#x27;s head of hair, thick and heavy as is, very well.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for these hardy hair clips.  The spring actual is NOT loose.  It holds my long thick hair in place without pain.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and most clips kept breaking or wouldn&#x27;t hold all of my mane!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Vidal Sassoon for making a quality product that works on my hair, wet or dry!</li>
    <li> This item is fine but it says its large and its not it doesnt hold my hair I had a large one this is not a large</li>
    <li> Were intact upon arrival! Clips work very well for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Meh, I was really hoping that these clips would hold my hair, but they don&#x27;t. I have shoulder-length, thick, wavy hair and when I pull it all up in this clip, it lasts about 30 minutes before falling down. They work ok if I just pull up part of my hair or if I don&#x27;t mind having some of my hair fall out, but I prefer to keep ALL of my hair up during the hot summer months. I will have to continue my search for a stronger claw clip...</li>
    <li> I love these they are perfect for my hair and they don&#x27;t move around.</li>
    <li> Great price, works well, good-looking.</li>
    <li> Initially i was excited to see these big clips available as i have a lot of hair to tie down with it and so far i have only been able to find them in Europe. However, the &#x27;product&#x27; description led me to believe the &#x27;product&#x27; was 7 inch long which was what i was looking for and is a key feature of a hair clip. But it is not. The &#x27;packaging&#x27; is 7 inch long and it contains 2 products of 4 inch. So i&#x27;ll have to return these and i feel mis-lead by the information given on this site.</li>
    <li> I have very, very thick hair and am able to clip it up and off my neck with these clips. They are short enough that they don&#x27;t tend to hit the back of chairs or car seats like longer clips do. I have previously purchased these at a drugstore and it took more than two years for one of the two to break, which is good compared to other brands. Good investment.</li>
    <li> These clips are horrible, they don&#x27;t hold your hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are very thin. They are not made like they used to be, that is for sure. Plastic is very weak. I could have saved my money on these.</li>
    <li> These clips look good on all shades of hair, especially light shades, providing a contrast. Large size, holds together long and thick hair all day. The quality is alright, will break somewhat easily if dropped. This is one of the many styles of jaw clips available in local stores.</li>
    <li> Pretty Hair Clips -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased these and they really hold secure.  I am happy that I made this purchase.  They really hold your hair back securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
    <li> They will not hold up all your hair. If you use it to hold a few strands it may be okay but they look too big. So technically it&#x27;s not good for anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> I am giving 1 Star considering Vidal Sassoon is a reputed company. Very cheap material, fell apart in one time use. It doesn&#x27;t even provide much idea on the size. I just threw them, and got better/sturdier ones from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, it&#x27;s sheer waste of my time to even send it back. Although it&#x27;s not that much money, but why such big companies even get their hands dirty with cheap MADE IN CHINA items.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my hair together at all! I have thick hair. The springs on these are really weak so they can&#x27;t stay shut strong enough to actually keep my hair up. don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and found this worked well for their size and have a comfortable grip that didn&#x27;t pinch but feels secure</li>
    <li> These are just awful. I thought they were the type of barrel clip which didn&#x27;t dig into your skull (like the Goodie clips I ordered, but bigger). These are absolutely excruciating to wear even for a few minutes. The end of the tines is pointed and digs right into your head. Who designs these things and why aren&#x27;t the tines curved so they turn away from your scalp?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw them away so I wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to use them in a moment of weakness.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and I break hair clips all the time and thats because my hair is so thick. I can barely find hair clips that hold my hair in place. These hair clips are great, they stay in all day, and I have no loose pieces. They are comfortable, and the claws are seamless. This is great for medium length, long hair and hair that is medium to thick, straight curly or wavy. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> These are seriously awful. The issue isn&#x27;t so much the size as much the strength of the claw. When I try putting my hair up with this half my hair just slips out. Super frustrating and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are great for those days that I get up... look in the mirror and think... yep, no fixing that.  So I just pull my hair back, twist it up and clip it.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Nice size claws and feel very secure on your head when you use them.</li>
    <li> might work for some poeople but i have to keep adjusting because its slipping out.</li>
    <li> These clips are great and hold up well to use.</li>
    <li> Great clips. Came as advertised. Price is right. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, I have very long hair and these hold in place VERY WELL!!  Will order more when these have served their purpose!!</li>
    <li> Too big, and they stick out way too much.</li>
    <li> Claw clips are a Goldilocks situation. They&#x27;re usually too small, not grippy enough, and these are the exact opposite. If you are Rapunzel or just have a crazy mane, these are for you. For my past shoulder length, fairly straight, medium thick hair, they suck. The claw overlaps, scratches my scalp, is heavy and hangs. Tough to find good claws- and the high quality pretty ones jump in price so much that they become an easily lost investment similar to sunglasses. What&#x27;s a girl to do?</li>
    <li> I got these to replace my old claw clip, which I&#x27;ve had for years and which my husband has repaired numerous times. I&#x27;ve been unable to find that style anywhere - guess it&#x27;s been discontinued because it worked too well and lasted too long :-). These will have to suffice.....</li>
    <li> The dimensions given are that of the card the claws are mounted on and not the claws.  The clips are really on 4&amp;#34; long.  I was after some really long clips I could not find in stores.  I also got the Caravan Jumbo Hair Claw which was just what I wanted to pull my hair up in the shower.</li>
    <li> I wear my shoulder length hair twisted and clipped up.  These are not strong enough to hold my hair in place - and they needed to be longer.  I should have paid more attention to the description that stated the length and that they are good for holding bangs or small sections of hair.  The prongs seem too long to use with thin hair sections.</li>
    <li> Use these clips everyday in my hair they don&#x27;t pull or damage.</li>
    <li> Came as expected. Great job on packaging!</li>
    <li> Have had these clips for months and have not broken either one yet - which is a miracle. They fit a lot of hair, and I can even jog with them in if I wrap my hair in a bun and put the clip in just so.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price....feels cheap and doesn&#x27;t keep my hair clipped up and I have thin hair!!! Imagine on those who have thick hair.  Works fine on my 3 year old though, but a little large for her head.</li>
    <li> I have thick, heavy hair and struggle to find a hair clip that can contain my hair and last for more than a few weeks. This product does both.  Well-made and attractive. I&#x27;ve even been asked about the clip while fueling up the car one day. The other woman was pleased to know where I got it.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this again, just to be sure I have enough.</li>
    <li> Good quality. with the curve, it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
    <li> These hold tighter than I had expected which is a good thing. I have baby fine hair and these do a great job of holding it up in place. I&#x27;m hoping these last. Thankfully, these don&#x27;t have a disgusting plastic smell like some clips do. I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;ll buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> This is an ok item. I like the larger size but the clamp pulls on hair too much for my personal preference.</li>
    <li> These work great. I have very long thick hair and it is hard for me the find something that will hold it up tight and keep it in place. These do the trick. I need to replace them every six months or so though but that is no problem.</li>
    <li> This clips are nice for collecting sections of my hair whenever I curl/straighten my hair. Which is basically everyday! Although people have mentioned their smaller than said, it doesn&#x27;t bother me because they get the job done but if you are looking for a very very large clip, I would recommend searching elsewhere. But these clips are large enough for me.</li>
    <li> Great clips. Good size; can easily hold all my hair (average thickness). Have had them for a few months and use on a daily basis. They are still going strong.</li>
    <li> Needed some large hair clips as my hair has gotten too long for the ones I had prior. These were perfect. Nice strength to hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I hate it when products that work are discontinued, so I give Amazon an A+ for providing hard-to-find,&lt;br /&gt;discontinued items and all at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clamp is not only a great size (and I have long hair), but it comes in a two-pack: one black and one tortoise shell.&lt;br /&gt;It holds my hair well, and isn&#x27;t too big or too small.</li>
