      <li>I am in love with this body butter and have told all of my friends and family about it.  </li>

      <li>I love going to the beach</li>
      <li>This made my skin so smooth and smells heavenly!  </li>
      <li>love love</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite body butters out there.</li>
      <li>I loved how soft it made my skin and how the light scent was pleasant.</li>
      <li>I  am very particular when it comes to skin products, but loved Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blushing Peony Body Butter.</li>
      <li>My skin felt nourished, more illuminated, and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>But the most important thing to me was the way it made me feel.  </li>
      <li>We both absolutely love the light, not overpowering smell this Body Butter provides.</li>
      <li>but it is truly like walking in a garden-- its a rich, luxurious smell that I love.</li>
      <li>The Blushing Peony scent (my favorite!) is a beautiful combination of Pink Peony and Lily of the Valley, and incorporates shea butter, sea kelp, Irish moss and sea berry to nourish, moisturize, heal and rejuvenate skin in the most pleasant way imaginable.</li>
      <li>Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blushing Peony Body Butter was easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of strong fragrances</li>
      <li>The butter was so light it soaked into my skin easily and let off a light flower scent until I showered.</li>
      <li>I love the scent because of how fresh it smells and how light it is.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth and the flakes were gone.</li>
      <li>This product went on light and lasted all day.</li>
      <li>The smell last for hours and is great if you like floral scents.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to others based on my experience because I honestly have never used body butter that has left my skin feeling so great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic on my feet, legs and elbows as well.&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this item like a work of art.</li>
      <li>I applied the body butter at night and was so impressed with how much moisture it gave my skin back.</li>
      <li>a spa like scent that was light and clean.  </li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this amazing body butter!</li>
      <li>This goes on lightly and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I have used my fair share of body butters from the various stores at the mall and online retailers and my skin never felt so smooth as it did with Blushing Peony Body Butter.</li>
      <li>The whipped creamy body butter is so silky smooth, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>Blushing Peony is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>it leaves your skin feeling great not greasy or sticky but super soft and hydrated, but the scent is really floraly and over powering to me</li>
      <li>It is creamy soft and hydrates amazingly.</li>
      <li>truly cannot say enough good things about this body butter.</li>
      <li>Are you ready to fall in love with your skin care again?</li>
      <li>I received a sample packet of this scent, and I was so blown away by the scent and the texture of it, I bought a full size</li>
      <li>I absolutely fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is super pretty but not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly without having an oily feel.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of body butter and very picky on the scent!  </li>
      <li>I have tried many moisturizers and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
      <li>The fresh peony scent automatically surrounds you as you step out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised with the light scent and smooth texture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> SPALIKE HYDRATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just used Coastal Salt and Soul Body Butter and I love it.  Hate the feeling of greasy creams and&lt;br /&gt;non-absorbant lotions but this body butter was absorbant, immediately hydrating my very dry skin and&lt;br /&gt;had a spa like scent that was light and clean.  My skin felt silky and hydrated and the smell was&lt;br /&gt;heavenly,  This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I  am very particular when it comes to skin products, but loved Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blushing Peony Body Butter. It has a light floral scent so it does not compete with any fragrance you are wearing and it has Shea Butter, Sea Kelp, Irish Moss and Sea Berry to nourish, moisturize your skin. I also love that it is Hypoallergenic &amp; Dermatologist Tested. I highly recommend this product, I love how soft my skin feels!</li>
    <li> Are you ready to fall in love with your skin care again? Get ready for Blushing Peony Blissful Body Butter from Coastal Salt &amp; Soul. This product is truly unlike anything I’ve ever tried before. The package says it’s “whipped to perfection,” and it really is! The consistency of this cream is thick and luxurious. It goes on easily (but not sticky or greasy like some other creams and lotions) and absorbs quickly to provide a lasting silky layer of light moisturizing fragrance that you’ll enjoy for hours. The Blushing Peony scent (my favorite!) is a beautiful combination of Pink Peony and Lily of the Valley, and incorporates shea butter, sea kelp, Irish moss and sea berry to nourish, moisturize, heal and rejuvenate skin in the most pleasant way imaginable. Best of all? It’s hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Pink Peony scent (did I mention that’s my favorite?), but there’s also a lovely fragrant Ocean Gardenia scent, as well as a lively, fresh Mediterranean Citrus. And in addition to the body butter, the Coast Salt &amp; Soul family includes scented candles, salted-honey body scrub and dreamy bar soap (which I can’t wait to try!). You’ll want to try them all!</li>
    <li> I received a sample packet of this scent, and I was so blown away by the scent and the texture of it, I bought a full size jar.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very strong, so if you are sensitive to heavily perfumed products, I would stay away. I put a bit on my hands in my living room, which is quite large, and within seconds, my sister, who was 10 to 15 feet away from me, asked me what that smell was. It&#x27;s very strong and it travels quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful, however. It smells like a beautiful, dreamy beach garden.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is perfect. I loathe anything that makes my hands feel oily or greasy. This goes on lightly and absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t have to fear leaving greasy fingerprints on everything that I touch, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wipe it off at all. It&#x27;s just a terrific formula. I wash my hands at least a dozen times a day, and this body butter lasts through quite a few washings. It has softened my cuticles as well as my skin. It&#x27;s fantastic on my feet, legs and elbows as well.&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this item like a work of art. The box that it comes in is gorgeous, if you were giving it as a gift you might not even want to wrap it. The jar is lovely, a smooth, white frosted sea glass with an intricate pattern softly etched into it. The lid is white washed beach wood. It would look terrific on any vanity or nightstand.&lt;br /&gt;I truly cannot say enough good things about this body butter. I&#x27;ll be buying their other scent, Ocean Gardenia, soon as well.</li>
    <li> I normally am really leery of trying new products without a friend or family member to have tried it. My skin and allergies are so sensitive that normally I can&#x27;t even receive flowers due to me being allergic. However Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blushing Peony Body Butter was totally awesome! I was so surprised with the light scent and smooth texture. I loved how soft it made my skin and how the light scent was pleasant. I have already and will continue to recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Body Butter products are amazing. Blushing Peony is by far my favorite! The smell is so amazing and the way it leaves your skin so soft, is like no other. I apply in the evening after I shower and my sheets and pj&#x27;s smell SO good every morning. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This body butter was super hydrating and intensely scented. I was able to wear just a small amount and still smell the rich scent hours later. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like the scent but it is truly like walking in a garden-- its a rich, luxurious smell that I love. This would make a wonderful hostess gift, or anytime gift, or a treat for yourself.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this and I can say it made my skin feel absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for a way to moisturize my skin but also leave it smelling great. I am usually reluctant to use a body butter because I instantly think it will leave my skin feeling oily. I was given a chance to try blushing peony body butter and I was so pleasantly surprised. It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling so soft but not oily at all. The best part for me was the lovely scent. It did not irritate my sensitive skin so that was an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I love the way Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blissful Body Butter feels on your skin. It is never greasy or oily and leaves you feeling moisturized for a long time. The smell last for hours and is great if you like floral scents. I would definitely recommend this product to others based on my experience because I honestly have never used body butter that has left my skin feeling so great!</li>
    <li> Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blissful Body Butter in Blushing  Peony scent. WOW  if you are looking for a moisturizing cream you found it. This body butter it amazing. It whipped to perfection ,when you apply it it has a thick consistency but it goes on my skin very easily its not greasy or sticky.I love going to the beach so I was looking for a butter they would moisturize my skin without irritating it and I found it. love love the Blushing Peony scent.it reminds me of lilys. Nit to mention that is hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested what else would I want in a body butter cream. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing feeling lotion! It is creamy soft and hydrates amazingly. It absorbs so fast and keeps your skin soft and supple all day. Then the scent...WOW! It&#x27;s so beautiful. It&#x27;s noticeable but not overwhelming. I can&#x27;t say enough about this body butter, it is my new favorite! Do your skin a favor and try it out for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I recently received Coastal Salt &amp; Soul body butter in the Blushing Peony scent and I am so impressed. The day that I received the body butter I unfourtanetly was suffering from a pretty severe sun burn on my arms and shoulders. I applied the body butter at night and was so impressed with how much moisture it gave my skin back. After applying the body butter my skin felt hydrated but not greasy or sticky at all like I have experienced with some body butters in the past. The scent is a very mild floral and smells amazing. My skin tends to be somewhat sensitive and due to my sunburn it was even more sensitive at the time. This product did not irritate my skin at all and I did not peel at all! I believe the moisture this product put back in my skin saved me! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product has an exceptionally creamy , thick texture but goes on smoothly and smells like Heaven!  The fragrance is not overwhelming but it is lasting and fresh.  Skin feels Dewey to the touch.  Definetly a treat for your skin.  This is one you will really enjoy having!</li>
    <li> Usually i don&#x27;t like using body butter especially with fragrance because of my migraine. Recently i tried this product from the sample i just received. At first i was reluctant to open it and try it on but i was in a hurry that day to go outside and need some lotion for my dry skin (can&#x27;t go out with my skin looks so flaky) so i did rub it all over my flaky skin and the result was superb plus, I love  the scent. My skin feels so smooth and the flakes were gone. Thought im going to get migraine because of the aroma but it didn&#x27;t happen. Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blissful Body Butter - Blushing Peony save my day.</li>
    <li> Some times my skin can get a little sensitive to the heat here in our warm climate. Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blushing Peony Body Butter was easy to apply. Not messy or greasy. or did not leave stains. It was a lovely light scent and it left my skin feeling ultra soft.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! From the smell to how the body butter felt on the skin everything was amazing! Let me start with the smell first-it&#x27;s not a strong smell but a lasting smell like if your in a field full of flowers you can just sit smelling yourself all day. And the body butter is very moisturizing and takes away the dryness! It&#x27;s not oily or sticky and great for the whole body and it lasts! I will definitely buy this and recommend to my friends and family</li>
    <li> I have used both scents from this brand and sadly this is my 2nd favorite. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it leaves your skin feeling great not greasy or sticky but super soft and hydrated, but the scent is really floraly and over powering to me but I&#x27;m not gonna lie I would still use it if the other scent was not available just from the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> The Coastal Salt &amp; Soul BLUSHING PEONY Body Butter is an 5 star product!  The smell is just wonderful. It has a soft, delicate scent that last. It makes your skin feel wonderful. If you look body butter, this is a must have.  I usually have trouble fine a product that does not irritated my skin. I love this one because it did not.</li>
    <li> I put this on after a shower and my skin felt soft and protected all day. It&#x27;s not oily or heavy on the skin and my skin totally drank it up. I don&#x27;t care for this fragrance too much as it&#x27;s a little too girly smelling for me. But the way it makes your skin feel, it&#x27;s not a huge deal to smell a little girly!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely in love with this body butter.  Even though it&#x27;s light weight, it really worked well on my dry skin, and left it feeling soft and hydrated.  The scent is super pretty but not too strong.  Definitely a must-have!</li>
    <li> This product went on light and lasted all day. I have tried many moisturizers and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I recently got to try this and was really surprised at how well it worked! I swim a lot and have trouble with chlorine drying out my skin so I&#x27;m always looking for new products to cure my problem. The butter was so light it soaked into my skin easily and let off a light flower scent until I showered. My skin felt so moist and felt so good! I love the scent because of how fresh it smells and how light it is. I&#x27;m not a fan of strong fragrances so this is perfect for someone like me!</li>
    <li> The Blushing Peony Blissfull Body Butter is smooth, velvety and luxurious!  It has the most amazing fragrance that seems to surround you with lush scents in a very subtle way.  But the most important thing to me was the way it made me feel.  I felt pampered and my skin looked luminous and felt so hydrated.  I love this body butter!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I tried the sample and just loved it!!  The fresh peony scent automatically surrounds you as you step out of the shower.  The soft feel of the lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and lasts all day long.  Great rich feel without the price tag.  Highly recommend.</li>

    <li> I received a sample of the Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blushing Peony Body Butter recently and was excited to try it.

    <li> Coastal Salt &amp; Soul Blushing Peony Body Butter is a delightful way to moisturize your skin. The whiped texture absorbs quickly into your skin leaving it feeling hydrated and not oily and greasy as so many other body butters do. Being an avid beachgoer I&#x27;m constantly looking for ways to help repair my sun kissed skin and I have finally found a product to do just that! Even my 5 year old who has light eczema absolutely loves using this body butter. It was very mild and not irritating on her sensitive skin. We both absolutely love the light, not overpowering smell this Body Butter provides. We both give this product two thumbs up and recommend it to anyone.</li>
