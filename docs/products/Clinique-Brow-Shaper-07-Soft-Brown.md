    <li> Clinique is a very good brand to have in your makeup drawer.....</li>
    <li> I have used this brow shaper for sometime and I just love it. It shapes the brow and makes them look natural.</li>
    <li> good brow product; easy to apply; stays on; no problems</li>
    <li> I had this product for years (before the plastic container) and loved it.  I still love it but be forewarned that the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brown is not so soft.  But you can remedy this with cotton swab.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I&#x27;m so happy I found it on your website.</li>

    <li> I like this eye brown product but the color was a little darker than I expected. And the brushes are very small. Would have preferred a longer brush rather than the two tiny brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the eyebrow brush and powder.  Easy to work with and no harsh lines on the brow.  Lasts a very long time and I use it every day.</li>

    <li> Perfect.  So subtle and effective.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Ok, but I find it easier to use a brow pencil</li>
    <li> The soft brown is quite dark, not soft or light the picture online looks.</li>
    <li> Liked this.would recommend.</li>

    <li> It works better than an eyebrow pencil.  Looks natural.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years, but lately have been having trouble finding it.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it.  The price was comparable to what I have been paying in the past.  Most of all I enjoy the ease of application and the fact that even in very hot and humid weather it does not come off.  I apply it once in the morning and I am set for the day.  It looks very natural.  I will come back for more.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I hadn&#x27;t seen it offered in quite a while.  Brows look so real.... much better than a pencil!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Maybeline Eyebrow Powder which was discontinued. The Clinique eyebrow powder works the same way as the Maybeline. It gives a very natural look to one&#x27;s brows. This looks much better and more natural than painting them in using an eyebrow \\&quot;template\\&quot;, which I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Maria B.</li>
    <li> Great product from Clinique...</li>
