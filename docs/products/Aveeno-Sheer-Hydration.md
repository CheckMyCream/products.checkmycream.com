### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Superb!</li>
      <li>This is some very nice lotion!</li>
      <li>The packaging is even great.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It is non-scented making it great for even my husband to use.  </li>
      <li>lotion contains oats, which are great for skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; version, which is great for summer.</li>
      <li>also great that it comes with a pump.</li>
      <li>All in all, a very nice product.</li>
      <li>the texture is perfect and the scent is very mild.</li>
      <li>It is unscented, which is a good thing for those who are allergic or who just don&#x27;t like perfumey or floral scents.  </li>
      <li>It is good for summer, as it leaves an almost powdery, not sticky</li>
      <li>It succeeds on both counts.</li>
      <li>Aveeno has a reputation for good skin care products, and this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
      <li>I find that Aveeno is the best of the mass-market lotions for a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>What I liked about this product was that it gave me coverage without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; by any means, but it&#x27;s effective.</li>
      <li>The best part is that it completely absorbs with no greasy feeling AT ALL.  </li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation to my sensitive skin -- Aveeno&#x27;s known for offering products without added junk (fragrance, color, etc), and this lotion lives up to my expectations of the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my tattoos -- healing and healed -- and have been very impressed.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a good product that does a nice quick job hydrating your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sounds like a win, right?</li>
      <li>This lotion is wonderful feeling once you put apply: light, smooth, never greasy, and like the bottle says, an almost powdery, clean feel.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is also very light.  </li>
      <li>You can put it on and it absorbs quickly, which is handy for people like me who often forget about this kind of stuff until I&#x27;m practically out the door.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but my skin tends to get *</li>
      <li>From my wife, who is the Aveeno user in our family: &amp;#34;I love and use a number of Aveeno products</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a variety of lotions for moisturizing and Aveeno is one of my favorite brands.  </li>
      <li>I recommend the Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream as a better alternative.  </li>
      <li>This is a pump bottle but you are able to lock the pump itself so that makes it easier for travel.</li>
      <li>most lotions</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product to use straight from the shower.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great product and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin!</li>
      <li>so I have to take the top off to get to the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But assuming you need a pretty mild moisturizer / cheap post shave balm, this is a great product.urizer / cheap post shave balm, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>so I was very excited to get the chance.</li>
      <li>They say the best time to apply lotion (if you are looking to rehydrate dry skin) is after washing your skin.</li>
      <li>A citrus scent would be nice - something light and fresh.</li>
      <li>Aveeno is a great brand, and this lotion is great for sensitive / dry / itchy</li>
      <li>It does absorb very quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and hydrated for most of the day.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, this Aveeno lotion doesn&#x27;t fit into any of those categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aveeno products have oats in the formula that help smooth the skin.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light feeling, fragrance free option, this is one to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Great lotion for your body, although it&#x27;s not 100%  sheer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost much and it gives you a nice alternative to lubriderm.</li>
      <li>Which is great when you don&#x27;t want to be overloaded with different cosmetic smells.  </li>
      <li>Lightly scented products make me feel happier, and give me a boost when I apply them.</li>
      <li>It seems there should be a way to add some scent without compromising the products claims of being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and good for sensitive skins.</li>
      <li>Aveeno Sheer Hydration is a very nice lotion.  </li>
      <li>Aveeno Sheer Hydration lotion is great: it absorbs quickly without any greasy film.</li>
      <li>My preference is for Eucerin&#x27;s Original Healing Soothing Repair Lotion over this.  </li>
      <li>It is still one of the best mass-market lotions available, but I&#x27;m still waiting for the perfect, completely non-greasy lotion (maybe an unrealistic expectation, but hey, I can hope!).</li>
      <li>so I was really excited to try out this lotion.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly and cleanly so you don&#x27;t have to wait around for lotion to soak in.  </li>
      <li>The name of the lotion would make it seem to be a more intense moisturizer than it is.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good lotion that I would recommend and plan on buying again, but perhaps from a local store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good not to have to worry about pasty white spots on your arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was shipped in a plastic bag inside a box, but the pump was activated and the bag was full of lotion.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for a lotion that would completely absorb and leave no residue or lotion feeling of any kind.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect solution to leave by the sink or somewhere with easy access for frequent use because it isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>Luckily it was in a plastic bag, so</li>
      <li>It goes in and keeps my skin hydrated for a good long while.  </li>
      <li>The lotion itself works fantastic and is much better on the hands than most other kinds.  </li>
      <li>I usually buy the &amp;#34;daily moisturizing&amp;#34; for myself, the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; kind for my daughter, and some fancy smelling kind for my wife.  </li>
      <li>The few drops needed are able to be quickly worked into the skin leaving it feeling healthy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for good lotions.  </li>
      <li>It just wants to keep you lightly moisturized and be affordable.</li>
      <li>Many lotions that claim to be fragrance free aren&#x27;t actually.  </li>
      <li>Itâ€™s not as convenient, but I find the difference in effectiveness worth it.</li>
      <li>Aveeno products rarely disappoint, and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Aveeno sheer hydration lotion is lighter weight, which is quite nice for the summer.</li>
      <li>Pleasant, with a very mild odor that dissipates quickly on the skin, and no allergic reaction, at least for me.  </li>
      <li>It also does absorb pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and amazing after using it - particularly if I apply right after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I keep it at my night stand and have used it on my face and hands right before bed.</li>
      <li>The bottle sits nicely on the counter and the pump distributes enough without giving gobs of too much lotion.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>The Aveeno will do as a backup, but unfortunately won&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
      <li>I like the light texture and its not heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>Aveeno skin relief is my favorite moisturizer for winter; it&#x27;s almost the only thing that helps my scaley hands.</li>
      <li>and I really like it!  </li>
      <li>The lotion is thinner and seems to dry faster, which is really nice, but I don&#x27;t think it really leaves a powder-like feeling as advertised.  </li>
      <li>It does have a pleasant smell, but the bottle size is quite small.</li>
      <li>This one really hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>For an everyday lotion its good, but for those times when your skin is overly dry, the Curel ultra healing lotion works much better.</li>
      <li>The Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing variety is a good one.  </li>
      <li>When was the last time you found yourself sitting at the table eating oatmeal for breakfast and suddenly thought: If the fiber is good for the inside of my body, what about my hands?</li>
      <li>I work at a computer and would not be able to use this when working without waiting or having a tissue to wipe my hands dry after application.</li>
      <li>The powder-like feel is the real deal breaker for me; I don&#x27;t enjoy the texture, and it makes me feel like I have something on my hands for several minutes after application.</li>
      <li>Aveeno has done a commendable job with their fragrance free daily moisturizing lotion, as it absorbs very rapidly with no greasy film.</li>
      <li>this lotion absolutely fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>I am very picky about texture and scent...</li>
      <li>Some, well, just don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>As for the powder-like feel, I would say not so much.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much it is; the scent is slightly different from standard, but both are pretty much \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; for most noses.</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to lotion for after I wash my hands, since it is so smooth and easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy greasy residue.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Aveeno is expensive but worth it for those with skin issues. It is one of the few products that actually does work for eczema or psoriasis, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle product and only helps with hydration of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars</li>
    <li> This Aveeno Sheer moisturizer feels a little bit different from my regular Aveeno, but I still like it.  The lotion is thinner and seems to dry faster, which is really nice, but I don&#x27;t think it really leaves a powder-like feeling as advertised.  Also, despite being labeled as scent-free, it definitely does have a lightly flowery, earthy scent to it, and unfortunately, I think I prefer the oatmeal-like smell of the original Aveeno.  Aveeno Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizer is a nice lotion, but I think I&#x27;ll just stick with my regular Aveeno.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno products. This is a thick rich emollient moisturizer that I use over my entire body (excluding my face, though, it probobly would be gentle enough to use as an ocassional facial moisturizer). My skin feels soft and amazing after using it - particularly if I apply right after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these products are supposed to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and gentle, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind a little scent. Lightly scented products make me feel happier, and give me a boost when I apply them. It seems there should be a way to add some scent without compromising the products claims of being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and good for sensitive skins. A citrus scent would be nice - something light and fresh. That would be my only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; and really it is not a complaint at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to use straight from the shower.</li>
    <li> All in all, this is a decent product from a brand that I respect--having used its line of soaps in the past--but I prefer other products over this one for moisturizing.  When spreading this one out, it feels as though the water content in it is too high, leaving my skin feeling a little less moisturized than desired.  My preference is for Eucerin&#x27;s Original Healing Soothing Repair Lotion over this.  The Aveeno will do as a backup, but unfortunately won&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
    <li> I found that this product was simply not moisturizing enough for my skin. It does go on really light (main ingredient is water), but you have to apply a large amount to actually combat dry skin. I have darker skin that can become &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; around the elbows and this lotion did not address this as well as many other products I have used (including cheaper brands such as Suave, Vaseline lotion, etc). I typically use Eucerin or Bath&amp;Body Works lotion and these work really well for me.  I always have to apply a second coat with this Aveeno lotion, which is unusual. It does have a pleasant smell, but the bottle size is quite small. Overall, one of the worst lotions I&#x27;ve used in a long time and it definitely doesn&#x27;t last for 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> Lotions can be a pain. Some don&#x27;t rub in well. Some stink. Some, well, just don&#x27;t work very well. Thankfully, this Aveeno lotion doesn&#x27;t fit into any of those categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great light moisturizer. You can put it on and it absorbs quickly, which is handy for people like me who often forget about this kind of stuff until I&#x27;m practically out the door. It&#x27;s good not to have to worry about pasty white spots on your arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; by any means, but it&#x27;s effective. It doesn&#x27;t cost much and it gives you a nice alternative to lubriderm. All in all, a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I have previously used what I thought was the same lotion, but it&#x27;s not identical. This &amp;#34;Sheer Hydration&amp;#34; is supposed to absorb quickly to make your skin feel soft but comfortably dry. The name of the lotion would make it seem to be a more intense moisturizer than it is. It&#x27;s okay, but my skin tends to get *very* dry - especially my hands - and this is not quite thick enough for me. It feels good going on, but the lotion isn&#x27;t thick enough to truly moisturize the driest areas of my skin. So for me, it&#x27;s good but not great. I&#x27;ll keep it by my kitchen sink for intermediate moisturizing, but I keep my Curel Ultra Healing lotion on hand (no pun intended) for when I need a heavier moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Aveeno has a reputation for good skin care products, and this is no exception.  It&#x27;s a relatively light lotion - not too thick or greasy and absorbs quickly.  I like it especially for the dry skin on my hands and feet. It is unscented, which is a good thing for those who are allergic or who just don&#x27;t like perfumey or floral scents.  It does have a faintly &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; aroma, probably because there is no other scent to cover it up. Other than that, there&#x27;s no downside - it&#x27;s a good product that does a nice quick job hydrating your skin.</li>
    <li> I am a total lotion addict, and this one is a winner.  It hydrates very well and immediately gets rid of the &amp;#34;fish scale&amp;#34; looking dry skin on my arms.  The best part is that it completely absorbs with no greasy feeling AT ALL.  My husband needs lotion, but he can&#x27;t stand the greasy feeling most lotions leave- this is the first lotion he&#x27;s actually willingly used a second time.  I also work a lot with my hands, so I need constant hydration, but can&#x27;t have my hands slippery- this lotion absolutely fits the bill.  Completely scent&lt;br /&gt;free.  Highly recommend for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I used Aveeno&#x27;s Oatmeal moisturizing cream for years before the stopped making it. I switched to their[[ASIN:B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce]], because it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it is a \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; moisturizer but dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue/feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno sheer hydration lotion is lighter weight, which is quite nice for the summer. Unfortunately it is slightly scented, although not flowery. The powder-like feel is the real deal breaker for me; I don&#x27;t enjoy the texture, and it makes me feel like I have something on my hands for several minutes after application.</li>
    <li> I have long been a fan of Aveeno lotion.  I usually buy the &amp;#34;daily moisturizing&amp;#34; for myself, the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; kind for my daughter, and some fancy smelling kind for my wife.  I find that Aveeno is the best of the mass-market lotions for a reasonable price.  I decided to try this new &amp;#34;sheer hydration&amp;#34; variation of their standard lotion to see how it worked.  The bottle says it absorbs in seconds and leaves a powder-like feel.  What did I find?  The lotion itself works fantastic and is much better on the hands than most other kinds.  It also does absorb pretty quickly.  As for the powder-like feel, I would say not so much.  I was hoping for a lotion that would completely absorb and leave no residue or lotion feeling of any kind.  I typically use lotion after working in the yard and then coming back to my desk to type: I want something that will eliminate the dryness without creating a greasy mess on my keyboard.  This lotion is not *greasy* per se, but it does leave a slight lotion-y residue that takes a while to fade.  So, 4 stars out of 5.  It is still one of the best mass-market lotions available, but I&#x27;m still waiting for the perfect, completely non-greasy lotion (maybe an unrealistic expectation, but hey, I can hope!).</li>
    <li> Not quite as described. I would not describe this as ultra sheer. It feels thick and creamy to me when compared to an average lotion. Maybe when compared to other &amp;#34;extreme hydrating lotions&amp;#34; this would seem light, but only because those should be called &amp;#34;creams.&amp;#34; Second, it is described as &amp;#34;absorbs in seconds&#x27; and this is definitely not the case. I work at a computer and would not be able to use this when working without waiting or having a tissue to wipe my hands dry after application. I do like this for at night or after a shower. They say the best time to apply lotion (if you are looking to rehydrate dry skin) is after washing your skin. This works well for that. I keep it at my night stand and have used it on my face and hands right before bed. It definitely helps with dryness. I can tell a difference after only a few days of use.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for your body, although it&#x27;s not 100%  sheer. There&#x27;s the slightest residue, which isn&#x27;t annoying if you don&#x27;t really care and just want a hydrating lotion. You pretty much can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno but I personally prefer their 24 hour skin relief because it absorbs faster. Still highly recommended compared to other lotions on the market.</li>
    <li> Aveeno skin relief is my favorite moisturizer for winter; it&#x27;s almost the only thing that helps my scaley hands. This is the &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; version, which is great for summer. It dries quickly, almost velvety, but isn&#x27;t heavy. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a variety of lotions for moisturizing and Aveeno is one of my favorite brands.  The Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing variety is a good one.  It goes on light and smooth and is not the least bit heavy or greasy.  I like the results, too, because I don&#x27;t feel the need to keep going back to the product throughout the day.  It goes in and keeps my skin hydrated for a good long while.  The packaging is even great.  The bottle sits nicely on the counter and the pump distributes enough without giving gobs of too much lotion.  If you&#x27;re looking for a light feeling, fragrance free option, this is one to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: product received via Amazon Vine in exchange for review.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing lotion goes on light but really penetrates.  I particularly like this lotion because it does not aggravate sensitive skin, even when it is dry and chafed.  I deducted one star because of the packaging.  This was shipped in a plastic bag inside a box, but the pump was activated and the bag was full of lotion.  A big mess, and a waste of product.</li>
    <li> I like Aveeno lotions, but this is my first time trying Aveeno Sheer Hydration . . . and I really like it!  I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for good lotions.  This one really hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s a different feeling than other lotions, almost like a smooth protective layer on my skin.  It is light weight and absorbs quickly.  Like the name says, it feels sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion contains oats, which are great for skin.  They draw moisture to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue with this product isn&#x27;t the lotion itself--it has to do with the shipping.  Mine arrived leaking.  Luckily it was in a plastic bag, so I just rinsed the leaky mess off the lotion bottle, but I felt bad wasting it.  Also, it arrived with a broken pump.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work at all so I have to take the top off to get to the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good lotion that I would recommend and plan on buying again, but perhaps from a local store.</li>
    <li> This Aveeno Sheer Hydration lotion seems like a lighter, less-oily version of the regular Daily Moisturizing lotion:  It goes on easy, penetrates faster, and feels less greasy compared to the regular formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- It works.  Aveeno is a great brand, and this lotion is great for sensitive / dry / itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Value.  Very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;- Lighter forumla.  I even use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.  This is our new go-to lotion.</li>
    <li> Hmm. This is a solid daily use hand lotion, but it is definitely on the light side of things. If you&#x27;re prone to dry skin or looking for a winter lotion, look elsewhere. IF however you&#x27;re in the market for a lighter spring/summer lotion for use on your hands after washing them... This stuff is solid. Not overly scented, no &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; residue after application or greasy feeling leftover. This is lotion that doesn&#x27;t want to make a big statement or be anyone&#x27;s special cream... It just wants to keep you lightly moisturized and be affordable. It succeeds on both counts.</li>
    <li> Aveeno products rarely disappoint, and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of lotion, and usually use an advanced hydrating type lotion all over my body after I shower, as well as lotion on my hands all day long.  This lotion is wonderful feeling once you put apply: light, smooth, never greasy, and like the bottle says, an almost powdery, clean feel. You feel moisturized without feeling coated.&lt;br /&gt;another bog plus with this lotion: no fragrance.  Many lotions that claim to be fragrance free aren&#x27;t actually.  This one truly is.  There is no lingering fragrance at all.  Which is great when you don&#x27;t want to be overloaded with different cosmetic smells.  This is my new go-to lotion for after I wash my hands, since it is so smooth and easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy greasy residue.  I hate it when you can&#x27;t open a door after using hand lotion.  That will never happen with this formula.  Superb!</li>
    <li> As promised this is a lightweight moisturizer that absorbs in seconds. It is good for summer, as it leaves an almost powdery, not sticky feel.&lt;br /&gt;That is has almost no smell at all is a big plus for me. also great that it comes with a pump. Great product.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Sheer Hydration lotion is great: it absorbs quickly without any greasy film. It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation to my sensitive skin -- Aveeno&#x27;s known for offering products without added junk (fragrance, color, etc), and this lotion lives up to my expectations of the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my tattoos -- healing and healed -- and have been very impressed. It keeps my skin well hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Sheer Hydration is a very nice lotion.  It is light, absorbs into skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling slick or tacky.  The fragrance is also very light.  I didn&#x27;t think it kept my skin hydrated for 24 hours, but maybe over time it will seem so.  This is a lotion I will keep on hand for daily use.</li>
    <li> I think about putting lotion up many times everyday especially in the winter when my skin is drier or I&#x27;ve used a lot of hand sanitizer, but I hate that greasy thick feeling many lotions leave behind.  This is the perfect solution to leave by the sink or somewhere with easy access for frequent use because it isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  It soaks in quickly and cleanly so you don&#x27;t have to wait around for lotion to soak in.  It is non-scented making it great for even my husband to use.  Overall, it is a great product and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin!</li>
    <li> One winter I started using Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream because my hands get so dry that they crack and bleed.  It was my hope that the Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing Lotion would have similar performance.  Unfortunately, it did not.  My hands are extra dry for this time of year because we are packing to move.  My hands are pretty rough from all of the paper, cardboard, and dust that goes with this activity.  This lotion did not make a dent in the dryness even when used for several days in a row.  It was back to the tried and true for me.  I recommend the Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream as a better alternative.  The only downside is that it is not in a pump-dispensing bottle, but rather a jar with a lid.  Itâ€™s not as convenient, but I find the difference in effectiveness worth it.</li>
    <li> Regular Aveeno Daily Moisturizer is my go to moisturizer for most uses. I use it after shaving, use it on dry skin in the winter, and on occasional mild eczema spots on myself and my daughter. The oatmeal does a great job of soothing redness and irritation, and the relatively simple and comedogenic ingredient list makes Aveeno one of the few moisturizers I can use on my overly sensitive face without sting or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem with Aveeno Daily is that it tends to be relatively thick and greasy. Not as greasy as CeraVe or Aquaphor, but a little bit so. Fortunately, this minor deficiency is addressed in the Sheer Hydration variant being reviewed here. Sheer Hydration (hereafter SH) goes on much drier than Daily Moisturizer standard, and is easier to work into the skin quickly. Rather than spending 5 minutes of working 4 squirts of Aveeno standard into my face, SH can be applied in less than 2 minutes. It seems to offer the same soothing and moisturizing benefit of the standard formula, but leaves a smoother \\&quot;crisper\\&quot; skin feel and can be applied more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a win, right? Pretty much it is; the scent is slightly different from standard, but both are pretty much \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; for most noses. The only issue is that SH costs more than daily standard and although SH is claimed to offer more benefits, in my short term comparison of both, I don&#x27;t see a big difference other than the quicker application and smoother post-use feel. These are not insubstantial benefits, especially for those who want to use Aveeno on their face but don&#x27;t like its (admittedly minor) greasiness. I would think people with oily skin would prefer SH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both SH and daily standard have a hard time remediating really dry skin or moderate to severe eczema, and folks suffering from those ailments probably want to invest in something more powerful. (I like CeraVe and Gold Bond Replenishing CoQ10 for those issues.) But assuming you need a pretty mild moisturizer / cheap post shave balm, this is a great product.urizer / cheap post shave balm, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> When was the last time you found yourself sitting at the table eating oatmeal for breakfast and suddenly thought: If the fiber is good for the inside of my body, what about my hands? Well the concept of this lotion may not be as simple as mixing plain oatmeal with some ingredients, but the theory is that oatmeal in its pure form can be used for facial masks and foot scrubs, treating insect bites, poison ivy and even hand lotion. Aveeno has done a commendable job with their fragrance free daily moisturizing lotion, as it absorbs very rapidly with no greasy film. Unless youâ€™re someone who is allergic to oatmeal (not the main ingredient btw) you will be pleasantly surprised with the results. For an everyday lotion its good, but for those times when your skin is overly dry, the Curel ultra healing lotion works much better. Recommend</li>
    <li> From my wife, who is the Aveeno user in our family: &amp;#34;I love and use a number of Aveeno products so I was really excited to try out this lotion. It did not disappoint. I am very picky about texture and scent...the texture is perfect and the scent is very mild. Once I put it on my face or hands, I do not want to smell it; and with this, I do not.</li>
    <li> This is some very nice lotion! I have always wanted to try the Aveeno so I was very excited to get the chance. I love it! It has a nice consistency, not too thick but not too watery either. It does absorb very quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and hydrated for most of the day. This is a pump bottle but you are able to lock the pump itself so that makes it easier for travel. I am now sold on Aveeno products!</li>
    <li> ****I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.*** Its summer and I needed a moisturizer that was light and still kept my dry skin moisturized &#x3D; Aveeno Sheer Hydration does the job. Will be using this lotion all summer. I like the light texture and its not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> Pleasant, with a very mild odor that dissipates quickly on the skin, and no allergic reaction, at least for me.  I&#x27;m trying to remember to use it daily.  My scratchy bits definitely seem a bit smoother even though I forget a lot.  A little bit seems to go a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t stick around in an obvious way.</li>
    <li> Although I had tried other Aveeno products in the past this product was new to me. I like to use a daily moisturizer as my skin ages. What I liked about this product was that it gave me coverage without feeling greasy. The few drops needed are able to be quickly worked into the skin leaving it feeling healthy and smooth. I also like the fact that it is unscented. Aveeno products have oats in the formula that help smooth the skin. The formula also helps break up oil but not stip all the natural oil away. This helps it not to feel greasy. After trying this product I have become a fan and now include it in my daily routine.</li>
