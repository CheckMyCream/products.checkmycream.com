    <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Period.  I have genetic dark circles - this covers better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I tend to get concealers that are too light. This one blends so well with my skin tone and hides my dark circles under my eyes! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
    <li> Best concealer I can find. Works on spots, acne, and dark circles. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it that it wells up in the creases under my eyes and i have to pat it a few times after the initial application to get it to set correctly.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 3 years.  Sensitive skin and this is only brand I&#x27;ve found that does not cause irritation and breakouts.  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This concealer has good coverage. Just make sure to know your color shade. You want to get something that is closest to your skin tone as possible.</li>
    <li> I have tried several concealers and keep coming back to this.  It is smooth and natural, the color is perfect for me, and it just makes me look better!</li>
    <li> used to get this when product first came out came with monthly bare minerals package but was in a large size, conceal&#x27;s well with just a small amount</li>
    <li> This is a great consealer. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this concealer! Very light but covers up my bags. I&#x27;m light skinned and use this with light 2.</li>
    <li> It came in the mail very quickly. This is such a great product. It goes on easily and looks so natural. I definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work out for me. It didn&#x27;t seem to blend in when using the BareMineral powder</li>
    <li> Great buying experience</li>
    <li> didnt cover the brown spots  that good</li>
    <li> Great coverage for my port wine stain.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals and this is one of my favorite products to hide blemishes</li>
    <li> I brought this in Medium 2 but I think I would have preferred it in Light 2.  I hate when concealer/foundations have a pink and/or orange undertone and the color I chose did.  It doesn&#x27;t give as much coverage as I was looking for and unfortunately, when you build up the coverage it gets cakey and creases since its so creamy.  Also, if you use a lot then the finish is dewy which to me looks oily and that is not what I want.  You can remedy this by layering with powder but I was trying to avoid that.  Its definitely not the worst concealer I have used but certainly not the best either.&lt;br /&gt;So far, my favorite concealer is [[ASIN:B007ZYJ19K Korres Wild Rose Brightening High Coverage Concealer - WRC2 (Light) 1.5ml/0.05oz]]  It does just what the name says, covers and brightens! (:</li>
    <li> A little too heavy and dry for mature skin. Works well if you want to conceal just a blemish or brown spot.</li>
    <li> I like it, Wish it can be bigger. Or aun offer 2nd with 50% or more discount.  -- -- --</li>
