      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>It is great smelling and really cleans the skin.</li>

      <li>It has a lovely scent</li>
      <li>all over - feels refreshing and softens the skin.</li>
      <li>Love this soap.  </li>
      <li>, I had to buy more for the guest bathroom.</li>
      <li>but I love that.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; like so many soaps do.  </li>
      <li>I sure will.</li>
      <li>Fabulous!</li>
      <li>:)  </li>

      <li>Love this soap.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s p cute, idk.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this soap- great scent, doesn&#x27;t melt fast in the shower and lasts.</li>
      <li>Amazing CLEAN scent.</li>
      <li>I love this soap ,best soap to use for dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>Not only does it clean a body wonderfully, when I&#x27;m done showering,  </li>
      <li>Great for many uses too (stains, smelly armpits, dandruff scalp,etc) Pretty much a multi purpose soap if you want it to be.</li>
      <li>I am cautious about what I use soap wise because I don&#x27;t want to have a hygienic reaction to perfumed soap - this is gentle and fine for even the most sensitive parts of the body - almost like Dove, but much, much better.</li>
      <li>Skin feels so smooth when you get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Amazingly clean smell that may be too strong for &amp;</li>
      <li>A simple, clean scent and sea salt throughout provides a great exfoliating experience.</li>
      <li>Smells great, leaves skin soft, and really lasts!</li>
      <li>The salt does that, giving off a neutral and fresh scent, and the slight granularity of it makes it perfect for lathering up before shaving (for me as a woman: legs, etc.)</li>
      <li>This soap makes you feel clean.  </li>
      <li>It rinses clean with no residue feeling on your skin.  </li>
      <li>clean scent, long-lasting soaps.</li>
      <li>as you lather, you can feel the exfoliation of the salt granules against your skin like soft sand paper, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>My favorite soap because it really stimulates the skin.</li>
      <li>Sea Salt Soap is the epitome of a clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>The water runs off really quickly, and you literally can just tote the bar around in the box</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also nice that it produces a nice creamy lather and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dried out.</li>
      <li>It cleans better and more simply than any chemical  </li>
      <li>Great holiday stocking stuffer as most people won&#x27;t spend extra $ on something simple like soap yet when you shower with it</li>
      <li>, it has a great scent (or lack there of, very clean/ sea salt scent), and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a light scent, gentle exfoliant and even can use it on my face.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>word of caution:  If your skin is a bit more sensitive to the touch</li>
      <li>I tend to use a bath pouf, because I feel it helps me to get cleaner, but honestly with this soap, it isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
      <li>Received a bar of this as a gift and was thrilled to find this 3 pack on Amazon at such an affordable price!</li>
      <li>Rich lather and very long-lasting</li>
      <li>The smell is slight but pleasant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Amazing soap! Smells great, leaves skin soft, and really lasts! Received a bar of this as a gift and was thrilled to find this 3 pack on Amazon at such an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  So great for your skin with the abrasive salt.  Skin feels so smooth when you get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - fast shipping</li>
    <li> I picked one of the lumps out of the soap and washed it thoroughly, revealing a tiny little white sphere which never dissolves and looks like plastic. It is NOT a salt crystal, as heavily implied by the product name, and the absence of any info about this ingredient on the packaging.  This REALLY seems like false advertising to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t formed an opinion yet, but surely it is questionable to put plastic beads down the drain every time this soap is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars based on the experience of actually using this soap, my favorite ever, due to the invigorating scrubbing, apparently provided by little plastic beads that then go down the drain.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels amazing! Very coarse but I love that. The whole shower area smells like the soap and it is heaven. I will buy and give this soap for gifts.</li>
    <li> love the swedish dream brand have recently tried the seaweed formula too and have a second love in the swedish dream soap line. will try the aster too when i go to reorder soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is addictive.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap because it really stimulates the skin. If you don&#x27;t like any texture in your soap this is not for you. I love the slight grittiness to the bar which makes me feel a bit like I am using a mild scrub all over - feels refreshing and softens the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the Seaweed soap, but NOT this one!! It doesn&#x27;t feel like Sea Salt. Also, I see many review that say it has a great scent. I smell nothing at all. It is very, very rough. You cannot rub it directly on your face or any other place that needs gentle handling! I was very disappointed after having loved the Seaweed version so much. I WOULD have given 2 stars, but...trying to give it the benefit of the doubt.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! A simple, clean scent and sea salt throughout provides a great exfoliating experience. I gave these as gifts and kept one for myself and everyone just loved it!</li>
    <li> My grand-daughter left this soap when she returned back to VA (thank GOD!......LOL.  So clean and fresh all at the same time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soaps. I but them all the time.</li>
    <li> Amazing CLEAN scent. Like you could just smell it all day long. Every time I was my hands with it I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting. Lathers great. I&#x27;ve been buying many and giving them to friends as gifts. Just wish it were a little less expensive sometimes. But I&#x27;d still probably buy it even if it was more.</li>
    <li> Love makes my sink feel awesome</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this soap after getting it as a gift. Well worth the extra money cause the soap lasts quite a long time, even with everyday use. Use it all over and never makes my skin overly dry. Wife actually likes the way it makes my skin smell too, go figure.</li>
    <li> My father loves this soap and its hard to get him excited about any bath product. It is great smelling and really cleans the skin. One of my favorite soap brands!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap.  After brain surgery my skin type changed from normal to oily and adult acne.  I started to use soap my skin is back to normal and acne is gone.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Both me and my boyfriend love them. It clears up our skin (him having body acne, me having combination skin), it has a great scent (or lack there of, very clean/ sea salt scent), and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time buying from this company, and it was a great experience.</li>
    <li> Great scent and texture!  I&#x27;ve seen this in local shops but the price is much better at Amazon. Order more than one, trust me.</li>
    <li> This soap contains \\&quot;polyethylene\\&quot; which is plastic and gives it the scrub. These they put in many scrubs and are too small to be filtered out after they go down the drain and are being put back in the water system and end up out to sea and are being ingested by fish. They then end up in the fish and if you eat fish, you may be eating something you previously washed with.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Great great soap - Love!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT! Its clearing up my PSORIASIS.....</li>
    <li> This soap is the best I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; Amazon has it for the best price! It leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve just had a swim in the ocean</li>
    <li> Yessss smells amazing. Hard to describe, smells as soap should smell, and the salt crystals add in for a exfoliating-Esque experience. A must buy for male or female!</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome! Smells wonderful &amp; does wonders for your skin- you get some exfoliant action from the sea salt, but it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized! Fabulous! It was at my doorstep in no time at all- great seller!</li>
    <li> I love this soap...smooth and cream with salt granules to exfoliate your skin. Great buy! Highly recommend it.Great for many uses too (stains, smelly armpits, dandruff scalp,etc) Pretty much a multi purpose soap if you want it to be. And no perfume in it.</li>
    <li> this is the best soap in the world.&lt;br /&gt;it smells amazing, and it makes your body smell amazing.&lt;br /&gt;this listing (idk what the price is now, but when I bought it) is the best deal when buying this soap. the packaging is exactly as advertised, and the soap comes imprinted with their logo. it&#x27;s p cute, idk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the sea salt embedded into the soap works as an exfoliant and can replace an exfoliator for minor exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not sure what else to say, but you should probably buy this soap.</li>
    <li> Removes all dirt from skin and can see skin difference after a week of use</li>
    <li> Sea Salt Soap is the epitome of a clean fresh scent. The mineral properties of the salt go a long way in helping skin. The salt is one of the best natural cleansers you can buy.  Not only does it clean a body wonderfully, when I&#x27;m done showering,  I soap up the face cloth and wipe down the shower stall and glass. It cleans better and more simply than any chemical  based cleaner I have ever used. I no longer worry about coming in contract with abrasive, harsh chemicals when I clean the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It feels really creamy on the face. It has a lovely scent</li>
    <li> this is great soap. as you lather, you can feel the exfoliation of the salt granules against your skin like soft sand paper, it&#x27;s amazing. highly recommend the soap, a bit expensive for everyday use for my wallet, but a good treat none the less.</li>
    <li> Rich lather and very long-lasting</li>
    <li> Love, love. love this sea salt soap.  It has bumps from the coarse sea salt that really scrubs your skin and makes it feel so clean.  The smell is slight but pleasant.  Will buy this again, my husband said another soap we like but can you find it again.  I sure will.</li>
    <li> Love this soap- great scent, doesn&#x27;t melt fast in the shower and lasts. Great holiday stocking stuffer as most people won&#x27;t spend extra $ on something simple like soap yet when you shower with it you notice the quality and great scent such that it makes you feel good!</li>
    <li> These soaps were ordered as gifts.  They smelled wonderful.  Would definitely order more for gifts or to display in bathroom</li>
    <li> This soap cleans your skin and makes it soft all in one washing. It leaves your skin with a clean smell and so soft.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I will ever use the rest of my life</li>
    <li> These soaps lather well and my skin feels great after using them in the shower.  Amazingly clean smell that may be too strong for &amp;#34;scent sensitive&amp;#34; folks, but I love them.</li>
    <li> We were given this soap for Christmas. I thought it would be nice in the guest bath....My husband stole it for his bathroom, because he like the smell of it so much, I had to buy more for the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! The clean fresh scent remains till soap is totally gone . Nice size and shape as well ,</li>
    <li> This soap makes you feel clean.  My wife and I won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
    <li> If the scent does not immediately capture you, once you lather and exfoliate with this amazing mixture of moisture and sea salt, you will never return to any ordinary soap.  I have sensitive skin and I had no irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would also make a wonderful hostess gift or use for party favors.</li>
    <li> the more you use it the better it works. as you use it, hard salt crystals are revealed to clean your skin and massage it at the same time without drying it. love it.</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent for my eczema. Recently, I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to hidden fragrances in shampoos and soaps and this product, though it has a pleasant fragrance, is very calming to the skin. Highly recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> I was really stoked about this soap because of the reviews that I read.  After using it for about a week, I can say that - in my opinion - it&#x27;s an okay soap.  The sea salt is nice because it&#x27;s exfoliating and sea salt is healing.  It&#x27;s also nice that it produces a nice creamy lather and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dried out. The only off-putting thing abut the soap is the fragrance.  It&#x27;s pleasant, but it&#x27;s way too much to the point that it smells artificial - way too perfumy.  I made the mistake of using this on my face, and it was really irritating.  I would have given this a higher rating were it not for the overpowering fragrance.</li>
    <li> clean scent, long-lasting soaps.</li>
    <li> I love this soap ,best soap to use for dry winter skin.The large salt crystals are great for exfoliating!!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  The scent is so clean and lathers really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution:  If your skin is a bit more sensitive to the touch I would recommend you either use a wash cloth or, lather before you wash you fiddly-bits.  The chunks of salt are assorted sizes within the bar and sometimes it feels a little rough.</li>
    <li> Really nice soap. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I received one as a gift and didn&#x27;t use it for a while…. glad I finally did.  It is very gently exfoliating with the sea salt, but moisturizing as well.  It rinses clean with no residue feeling on your skin.  Also seems to last a long time - doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; like so many soaps do.  I bought these as gifts - well 2 of them.  One for me also.  :)  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t bother my husband who is allergic to gluten!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve ordered it before and will keep ordering it. It has a light scent, gentle exfoliant and even can use it on my face.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described.  The person I bought them for loves the smell.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this soap. It really makes my skin feel fresh and revitalized. The salt does that, giving off a neutral and fresh scent, and the slight granularity of it makes it perfect for lathering up before shaving (for me as a woman: legs, etc.) Did I mention the lather? Oh so satisfying, even when not shaving. I tend to use a bath pouf, because I feel it helps me to get cleaner, but honestly with this soap, it isn&#x27;t necessary. I don&#x27;t take my pouf while traveling, and I&#x27;ve noticed that the salt in this soap makes it perfect for when you&#x27;re on the road. The water runs off really quickly, and you literally can just tote the bar around in the box it comes in. I&#x27;ve also tried the seaweed soap, which doesn&#x27;t last as long but is quite lovely and perhaps more hydrating. Last note: I am cautious about what I use soap wise because I don&#x27;t want to have a hygienic reaction to perfumed soap - this is gentle and fine for even the most sensitive parts of the body - almost like Dove, but much, much better.</li>
