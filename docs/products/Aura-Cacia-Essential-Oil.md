      <li>One of the best buys I have found.</li>
      <li>i saw this was a great price thats what made me purchase this, great product !</li>
      <li>Great product for a great price.</li>
      <li>Aura Cacia essentials sandalwood is blended with jojoba oil, so the scent is very light!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I just love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
      <li>JUST LOVE IT..</li>
      <li>I love Aura Cacia but won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering many more times.</li>
      <li>Aura Cacia is my favorite EO brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of sandalwood and Aura Cacia is my favorite oil line.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>I would describe it as a super light cedar wood scent.  </li>
      <li>Even the Jojoba Oil that it is mixed with does not have a smell (which is good).</li>
      <li>JUST SIMPLE, GOOD STUFF.</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t enough scent in this whole bottle to make a baby smell good.</li>
      <li>First I was surprised by the cost then I am pleased with the scent and healing proprieties.</li>
      <li>The scent is high quality sandalwood-- that intoxicating mix of musky and sweet.  </li>
      <li>This was the exact scent I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The final authority is your health care practitioner, but the aura cacia website has good information on general uses for the oils.</li>
      <li>cacia is good quality from my past experiences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>Well I used the whole damn thing for her bath products that I was making for her</li>
      <li>she told me how much she loves the smell of sandalwood.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too much like sandalwood to me.</li>
      <li>If you want the real scent and healing properties you should be prepared to pay the price for it.</li>
      <li>, in fact some I use I really dislike the scent.</li>
      <li>Oils are very powerful and the only one I use undiluted is lavender.</li>
      <li>The scent of sandalwood is very slight, but the smell of whatever else is in the bottle is definitely more powerful.</li>
      <li>I bought mine on special at the health food store for $2, but if I had to buy it again, I would just go for cedar wood essential oil</li>
      <li>I could not continue the use of this particular oil as it had NO scent.  </li>
      <li>I hope she likes the new scent I had to come up</li>
      <li>I would agree with the other reviews that Sandalwood is not my choice for it&#x27;s scent, and diluted in jojoba would probably not please true sandalwood fans.</li>
      <li>If I can only get the pure oil I dilute it myself in jojoba.  </li>
      <li>While it does not replace my stronger meds, I can often clear my congestion in the early stages by massaging it on my chest.  </li>
      <li>I will not be purchasing this particular Essential Oil from this brand ever again.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>My only problem with this is that I strongly prefer just plain Sandalwood without the Jojoba Oil.</li>
      <li>I think that the other positive reviews may be for the jasmine oil.</li>

<li> is also decreased.  </li>
<li> I may be wrong, I believe that since this is DILUTED in jojoba oil, it is NOT to be diffused.  </li>
<li> Sandalwood is an expensive oil....  </li>
<li> arrrrggggg :(</li>
<li> very very disappointed!</li>

    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough scent in this whole bottle to make a baby smell good. This was a nicely labeled bottle, however the contents are worthless. A HUGE waste of hard earned money. A complete rip-off. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! arrrrggggg :(</li>
    <li> Hi! I have not tried this yet, however, I am wondering if some of you complaining about the lack of scent are using this incorrectly.  Are you diffusing this? I may be wrong, I believe that since this is DILUTED in jojoba oil, it is NOT to be diffused.  The directions seem to indicate this is to be used as a dot on your forehead.  AGAIN please do not take my word for it, but I learned this about another oil i purchased.  I could not smell it, only to be told I was not supposed to be diffusing it, and also that oils that Eos are diluted in, are BAD for your diffusers.</li>
    <li> I think that the other positive reviews may be for the jasmine oil. One of them explicitly mentions it. This review is for the sandalwood oil. I&#x27;m in agreement with the other negative review. The scent of sandalwood is very slight, but the smell of whatever else is in the bottle is definitely more powerful. And that smell is a little better than unpleasant. Don&#x27;t get this!</li>
    <li> Somehow not quite what I expected.</li>
    <li> Zero smell~ used to Indian Sandalwood, this smells like Jojoba~</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of this Essential Oil cause I was going to make a birthday gift bag for a friend with a few of my bath products that I make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this bottle for her only cause she told me how much she loves the smell of sandalwood. Well I used the whole damn thing for her bath products that I was making for her and there is no smell what so ever. Even the Jojoba Oil that it is mixed with does not have a smell (which is good). Anyways useless and agreed a waste of money spent. I will not be purchasing this particular Essential Oil from this brand ever again.&lt;br /&gt;Very very very disappointed! I hope she likes the new scent I had to come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
    <li> I could not continue the use of this particular oil as it had NO scent.  Might as well buy a small bottle of Jojoba oil.  Look elsewhere for this scent.</li>
    <li> My .5 oz. Bottles leaked un the bag they were sealed in.  I told the company about it but didn&#x27;t get a response but for a computer reply.</li>
    <li> great product! last a long time still using it everyday! a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Hardly has any scent. I love Aura Cacia but won&#x27;t get this again. Dissapointed in this product. Will stick to buying products in person.</li>
    <li> Expeditious delivery! Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of sandalwood and Aura Cacia is my favorite oil line.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful! Aura Cacia is my favorite EO brand. Keep in mind, these essential oils are not for internal use.</li>
    <li> First I was surprised by the cost then I am pleased with the scent and healing proprieties. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I wish this Sandalwood had a stronger scent.  Because this is sold in a carrier oil (jojoba oil) to decrease the cost the scent and efficacy of the oil is also decreased.  Sandalwood is an expensive oil....  If you want the real scent and healing properties you should be prepared to pay the price for it.</li>
    <li> One of the best buys I have found. Perfect for wearing and or scenting potpourri!!! I will be ordering many more times.</li>
    <li> My only problem with this is that I strongly prefer just plain Sandalwood without the Jojoba Oil.</li>
    <li> I love it! It arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I would agree with the other reviews that Sandalwood is not my choice for it&#x27;s scent, and diluted in jojoba would probably not please true sandalwood fans. But I do not buy my oils for their scents, in fact some I use I really dislike the scent. I am a student of aromatherapy and use them for that reason. The final authority is your health care practitioner, but the aura cacia website has good information on general uses for the oils. Oils are very powerful and the only one I use undiluted is lavender. I am being treated for chronic bronchitis and my dr has approved my use of sandalwood. While it does not replace my stronger meds, I can often clear my congestion in the early stages by massaging it on my chest.  I never start the winter without having it in the house. If I can only get the pure oil I dilute it myself in jojoba.  The aura cacia website has a \\&quot;learning\\&quot; section which includes safety information about using oils.</li>
    <li> This was the exact scent I was looking for. I add it to moisturizers, bath water, and even run a little through my dog&#x27;s hair after a bath. It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
    <li> i saw this was a great price thats what made me purchase this, great product !&lt;br /&gt;aura cacia is good quality from my past experiences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;JG</li>
    <li> The scent is high quality sandalwood-- that intoxicating mix of musky and sweet.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia essentials sandalwood is blended with jojoba oil, so the scent is very light! I would describe it as a super light cedar wood scent.  I bought mine on special at the health food store for $2, but if I had to buy it again, I would just go for cedar wood essential oil (I always buy the Swanson brand cedar wood).  It smells much more concentrated, and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too much like sandalwood to me.</li>
    <li> JUST SIMPLE, GOOD STUFF.</li>
    <li> MY HOME SMELLS SOOO GOOOD WHILE THIS OIL SCENTS IN MY TEALIGHT BURNER..JUST LOVE IT..FEELING OF SPIRITUAL AWARENESS OVER COMES ME..</li>
