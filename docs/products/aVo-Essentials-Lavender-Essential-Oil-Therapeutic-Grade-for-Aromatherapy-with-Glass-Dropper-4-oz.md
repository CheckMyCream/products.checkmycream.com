<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am in LOVE!! My whole house smells like a dream!  I can&#x27;t wait to try this oil with my next batch of candles! The smell is rich and has the perfect smell of lavender. I used this to make a relaxing bath soak,only 4 drops to 4 cups of Epson Salts and the result was deliciously deep, and the whole house smelled great. I can not say enough about this product. I will be keeping a bottle on hand at all times. The shipping was fast too!&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at no cost for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2cents@40 does not get monetary compensation to review all products.

    <li> I am loving this Huge 4oz bottle of Lavender Essential Oil from AVO.&lt;br /&gt;When it came in the mail I quickly unboxed it and started it in my diffuser in my bedroom. Nice scent, so calming and relaxing. Hubby and I both slept really good last night.&lt;br /&gt;To find a 4oz bottle at the promotional offer I received was a great find! I could not wait to test this out.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first purchase from AVO and I love the potency of the oil and also the pureness. This will add to my newly found essential oil collection.&lt;br /&gt;So many great health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I love the high quality of this lavender oil and the glass dropper is alot nicer than just tipping out a drop at a time from the bottles that do not offer a dropper.</li>
    <li> Avo Essentials has made a completely pure essential oil. It works great for aromatherapy and oils in carrier oils. I tried it both ways. I made a homemade deodorant with it. It was my first time making a homemade deodorant so I have to work out some of the kinks in my own personal formula. But it smelled great, lavender is great to use in deodorant too as well as many other at home recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very nice strong smell when using it alone in aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I thought that Avo Essentials Premium Lavender Essential Oil was great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this review to be useful.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of REAL lavender, and so I was thrilled to find a large bottle to use in my room spray mixes. This lavender oil does smell differently than the French Lavender oil I normally buy, but it&#x27;s still a great scent. I do find I need to use a few more drops of this oil in my room spray mixes to reach the same level of fragrance as my previous brand. This difference in the strength of the lavender scent doesn&#x27;t worry me because the price difference is huge, and the lavender is scented slightly differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the lavender oil arrives in a glass bottle, a must for oils, and comes complete with a dropper. So many inexpensive oils come don&#x27;t include a dropper, or they have plastic plugs that are supposed allow you to add them by drops. I hate the plugs and find them annoying and hard to get an accurate measurement in my formulas. With the glass dropper,  measuring is easier and more precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this along with cedarwood to create a room spray that smells like fresh lavender growing in the yard. I can&#x27;t wait to see what other combinations I can come up with to make use of the generous amount of oil.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to facilitate this review; however, all opinions and my experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> I like this lavender essential oil. I pour a small amount on the diffuser and turn it and just relax after a hard days work or one of those blah days.lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love putting it on the diffuser because not only you relax but your house or room will smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lavender essential oil smell very good not to strong at all and not to light just perfect on one of those rainy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a Bulgarian lavender oil, it is pure, premium, and undiluted. It has no chemicals, additives, preservatives, or anythings else. I love that the oil is vegan, all natural and therapeutic grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited because as a person that usually have sinus problems this essential does not flair up my sinuses actually it relaxes me. As a person with fibromyalgia I have not yet had a message with it but It does relieves my anxiety a little bit. Also you can mix other oils with it if you like for a message or just to put in the infuser.&lt;br /&gt;Remember it is pure concentrated, never message undiluted oil, always add a quality oil carrier.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a complimentary sample for testing and review purposes.all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I must first say that I LOVE pure Lavender oil and have been using it for over 20 years.  It is the only scent I ask for when getting a massage, foot soak or any other spa treatment.  However, I detest cheap oils with an after smell that you cannot rid yourself of.  Unfortunately, this is one of those oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After all of the positive reviews, I was hesitant to write this negative review.  I instead tried to find a way to use the oil after receiving it today, thinking maybe my initial reaction was a bit harsh.  I  put it into my bath, tried a couple drops on my pillow, used it on a sachet to put in my lingerie drawer and ultimately ended up having to wash everything that came into contact with this oil.  I have to say, as usual, my initial reaction was spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real Lavender has a fresh clean smell while at the same time giving you a relaxed, calm feel.  Anyone that has used Lavender consistently doesn&#x27;t have to be told this nor do they have to be told what an inferior bottle of Lavender smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know that reviews are just opinions but that being said, if you have a discriminating nose that knows, and you put any credence into reviews, you will not be happy with this Lavender oil.  There is a distinct smell that lingers under the lavender scent as is true with inferior oils or extracts. It is like a sickening perfume that never dissipates.</li>
    <li> The oil is non greasy, very light and has awesome fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product!! Previous to this purchase I&#x27;ve purchased Lavender under the botanical name of Lavandula officinalis.&lt;br /&gt;This Lavender has the botanical Lavandula Angustifolia and has a different but very pleasing fragrance, because it is a different kind of Lavender and is grown and processed in a different place. I like it much better!!!! It is very decidedly Lavender it is True Lavender....&lt;br /&gt;very potent and a little goes a very long way!&lt;br /&gt; I will be buying this kind from now on because it smells more like Lavender to me. Yes when you purchase a very concentrated essential oil it will smell different full strength from the bottle. So I put some on tissue paper and set that in a small jar and carried it around with me from room to room where I would go and also near my bed as I slept. I really like it and plan to use it to add to my DYI skin cream made with Shea Butter and Sesame oil. Very  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, and the fact that is came with a glass dropper was a solid plus.  Only complaint is that the bottle was not completely full . At first I thought it was to compensate for the volume the glass dropper would posses but even once it was inserted there was still a large empty space</li>
    <li> Great for diffusing and in the bath!</li>
    <li> The Lavender oil was packaged very well and came quickly.  It smells very nice.  Price was great.</li>
    <li> having used Doterra lavender I did notice the difference. Franklin I prefer Doterra oils.</li>
    <li> My grandma loved it she uses it on a candle to relax. She also puts it in a little sack close to her bed to help her sleep.</li>
    <li> I received my oil yesterday. I used to rub lavender oil on my feet before going to bed. I used other oil which has a pleasant aroma. But this oil has earthly scent and bit runny, not like with what I am used to. I have a doubt on the purity of the oil. Not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for purified essential lavendar oil.  The bottle arrives with a dropper allowing easy measuring for mixture with carrier oils.  Lovely lavender essence, calming and soothing scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few brands of lavender oil before.  I use it undiluted on pulse points.  This one feels the same as the others, but has a very slight medicine smell with the scent of lavender.  This might be due to the distillation process.  I&#x27;ve noticed that some steam distilled oils have a similar smell.  It is vague and you may not even notice it unless you&#x27;ve used different lavender oils before.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This oil is very rich and pure.  Smells exactly like&lt;br /&gt;real lavender essence should smell like. A little&lt;br /&gt;goes a long way.  Cleans and freshens the air.&lt;br /&gt;Mixes well with a variety of carrier oils for&lt;br /&gt;different therapeutic effects.  Comes in a&lt;br /&gt;hefty 4 oz sized dark brown glass container to&lt;br /&gt;protect it from oxidation and a large dropper&lt;br /&gt;for a mess free application and to help avoid&lt;br /&gt;product contamination.  This oil has come in&lt;br /&gt;handy and recommend it to all households as&lt;br /&gt;their number one multi-purpose aid.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!  I put a few drops in the washing machine with my towels and they smell so fresh and clean!  I have also put a couple of drops in my Shea Butter to help eliminate the nutty smell of the shea butter.</li>
    <li> Used it the first night for my insomnia and I slept all through the night for once. I woke up feeling rested. Cannot wait to use it in all the many ways I can.</li>
    <li> So calming and a great price for the amount. I will have to look at more essential oils from this company</li>
    <li> Disappointing - I purchased because of all the good reviews but this is not a very good lavender oil. Smell is not much like natural lavender</li>
    <li> I have purchased many products on Amazon and have never written a review until now. I bought this lavender oil because it&#x27;s supposed to be pure essential oil and cruelty free. I have bought many brands of pure lavender oil and none of them smelled like this one. It seems diluted and smells very little like the lavender I have growing in my garden. I will not be purchasing this brand again and will go back to buying Aura Cacia or Now brands instead.</li>
    <li> Very very very good lavender oil.  I have used it almost everyday since I got it as a facewash and in my daughter&#x27;s bath.  Works great and smells great.  I would really recommend this brand of lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I got this product free to review, however, I never recommend products that I do not personally believe in.</li>
    <li> All essential lavender oils are NOT created equal!  Some brands are great, some brands are just awful.  AVO, however, has a wonderful, luscious, soothing aroma.  Excellent for relaxation, calming, and applied directly to the skin.  It will sooth aching muscles and stiffness.  Great price also!  I will continue to purchase my lavender oil from you and start adding to my essential oil collection with other oils.  I will give this product 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I use this oil multiple times a day. It was a great buy for how much they give you. The bottle is huge so I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying more any time soon, but I would definitely buy this again. Shipped really fast too.</li>
    <li> Some of the best smelling essential  oil ever!  Will buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> very good product just as it was stated I simply love it I will purchase it again</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, and has an amazing aroma</li>
    <li> This product arrived very promptly and is exactly as described.  Will be using for soap making.</li>
    <li> I love lavender oil. Great scent. Good amount to use liberally which what I look for in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Great Lavender Oil product.  Nice strong pure natural scent.  Will work great in my homeopathic creations.  Great for candles and soap making as well.  I also love adding a few drops to my vacuum bag before using to release a lovely floral scent into the house.  Helps cover up pet smells that usually are released from the bag unless u change it every time.  If I was only allowed to have 3 essential oils in my stuck on an island bag... Tea Tree, Eucalyptus and Lavender would be my 3 choices.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Just as good, better considering you get sooo much more for your money, as more famous brands!  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this oil! I have it in my diffuser right now. It is a wonderful stress reliever and definitely helps me sleep better!</li>
    <li> great quality..will stick with this</li>
    <li> It was good, not the best or very long lasting.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and at a great price. I use it in my diffuser and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I got this free to try and it has so many uses it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love essential oils, so I was very excited to get this lavender oil.  When it arrived, I immediately opened it up and put a few drops (the glass dropper was included) in my diffuser. It smelled wonderful and made me feel relaxed.  This is a very strong essential oil, it only takes a few drops to be effective. With this large four ounce bottle, it will last a long time. My grandmother told me that when she was little she used to use lavender to keep away the mosquitos. So I just might give this a chance to repel bugs as well.  I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced rate in return for an honest and unbiased opinion.  My review is based on my own experience and opinion of the Pure Lavender Oil by aVo.</li>
    <li> I mix a few drops of lavender to my coconut oil and my skin feels amazing. I love it!  I also add this to my bath.  I will always buy this wonderful oil.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT..works wonders on acne..Excellent seller, fast deliver!</li>
    <li> Thanks to this great seller. Above average product and customer service! I love the dropper that came with the essential oil--it makes dispensing much easier. The seller contacted me to make sure their service met my expectations. They also happened to have the best deal so it&#x27;s a win-win all around.</li>
    <li> Its smells good and I have ordered several bottles.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant when I received this because lavender soaps make me sneeze. This product, however, has a much more pleasant scent and I&#x27;ve had no issues. I put this in my diffuser each night, along with lemon and peppermint oil, to help alleviate my sinus issues. I wake up feeling much better and have noticed less issues with sore throat and runny nose caused by allergies and sinus problems. I like that this includes a dropper, which makes it easier to use the correct amount. I also like that large bottle size, which means this will last a long time. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Big bottle for a good price and seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like other Lavenders I&#x27;ve bought. I like the the eye-dropper and size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> My first time ordering this brand of Lavender. I&#x27;ve tried several differant ones. I have to say this will be one of my favorites...smells so so good.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I started using it as soon as it arrived. A little goes a long way. I am using it on my shoulder and it is helping to relive the ache.  Thanks for creating this essential oil.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Lavender Oil and AVO Lavender Oil is no disappointment! The smell is amazing since I absolutely love the way Lavender smells. I add 3-5 drops to my oil diffuser and let the amazing scent of Lavender fill my house. I love the bottle that this Lavender Oil comes in since it&#x27;s a 4oz bottle which means it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile depending on how much or how often you use it. It also comes with a dropper which I love so that I don&#x27;t end up wasting any or getting more than I need. This is definitely one of my favorite Lavender Oils and I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I want to start of saying I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, it has worked miracles in my house. We have a 7 month old Husky Pit Bull Mix and he HATES to be locked in his cage when we leave, I had heard that lavender oil was very calming so I thought what could it hurt to try. Well this product has calmed him down to the point he goes right in his crate now when we put on out shoes. All I do is place 2 to 3 drops of the oil on his blanket in his cage and then let the oil work its magic. I will be buying this oil for many more years as the puppy is only 7 months!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the product for free for an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different lavender oils and this did not smell like any I&#x27;ve ever had.  Do not like it.</li>
    <li> Incredibly fragrant, and you can&#x27;t beat the per/unit price.  In addition, the dropper is SO much easier to use than the smaller bottles that don&#x27;t have one.  Well worth springing for the bigger size, size you will be wanting more anyway.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant lavender and I love the idea of the eye dropper.  So much easier to place needed amount in diffuser.  Plan on making this purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love using essential oils lately. this is a very good lavender, not to overpowering but does smell like natural lavender and not artificial, and I love that it comes in a bigger bottle than most essential oils.</li>
    <li> HUGE bottle and we love the oil. Lavender is our favorite and use it daily. We use it in our coconut oil to make a body oil. Smells great but not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still new to the world of essential oils so I&#x27;ve only tried a few of the basics so far. The essential oil that I was sent to review this time is Premium Lavender Essential Oil from aVo Essentials.&lt;br /&gt;It was only when I started researching the uses for lavender essential oil that I discovered that there are different varieties of lavender oils that come from different regions. This lavender essential oil is Bulgarian lavender which is grown in the Himalayas. It comes in a large 4 ounce bottle with both a stopper &amp; a glass dropper. The label states that it is 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Lavender Oil Steam Distilled.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many different ways to use lavender essential oil. It is used to naturally ease headaches, anxiety, tension &amp; stress. I know a lot of people diffuse it in their homes to keep a calmer environment. I have also heard of diluting it to use as a spray on sheets &amp; pillow cases prior to bedtime. I tried both of these &amp; quickly discovered one important thing: lavender seems to give me a headache rather than relieving one! I knew when I opened the bottle that I wasn&#x27;t going to be a fan of the scent of lavender but I didn&#x27;t expect to get headaches. The scent reminds me of my days in high school working at a local fast food place where we used a heavily scented bathroom cleaner with added lavender fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to researching what other ways I could use this so that I didn&#x27;t notice the scent. And I found it! When I combine the lavender essential oil with peppermint &amp; lemon oils in my diffuser, it puts out a wonderful scent that also helps my allergy symptoms. I have also found that when I do get a headache, I can use the lavender essential oil combined with marjoram, thyme, rosemary &amp; peppermint oils to get relief. So I can use this lavender essential oil with no ill effects as long as I combine it with other oils.&lt;br /&gt;This Premium Lavender Essential Oil is highly concentrated so you will always need to use a carrier oil before massaging it onto your skin.ore massaging it onto your skin.</li>
    <li> Use in my kids diffuser at night. Long lasting scent</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this lavender essential oil. I found it to be weakly scented- almost like it was already blended with a carrier oil. I have a high quality diffuser and  I have to use a ton of this oil to even be able to notice it. I&#x27;ve def learned my lesson about buying &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; essential oils. I&#x27;ll stick with NOW or DoTerra in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I read the raving reviews this product got before purchasing, which just makes me think the people writing them dont have experience with high quality/theraputic grade oils.</li>
    <li> I can tell this is a high quality oil. I am looking forward to using it tonight.</li>
    <li> Fast service and great product</li>
    <li> Excellent and efficient service!</li>
    <li> Potent. Very long lasting scent. Really like it!</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality potent lavender oil! I use lavender oil for everything! I use it for essential oil burning, disinfecting and healing cuts and moisturizing my face and this stuff is magic! It is a huge bottle which will last me forever! I have purchased other brands and they were weaker smelling and definitely of lesser quality. I will be repurchasing when I finally run out!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and used every night before sleep.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad. I would have preferred the smell to be stronger. It has a sweeter, milder scent than the Lavender I am used to so I have to use more than one or two drops in my diffuser; however, I like the size and the dropper that comes with it. And the company&#x27;s Customer Service Team reached out to me directly via email after my purchase regarding my satisfaction with the product and address any concerns, so that&#x27;s a plus in my book.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this product. Very good for massages.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few aVo products in the past and I have nothing but great things to say about their products, as I have never been disappointed by any of them. Their Pure Lavender Oil is made of superior quality, just like their other products and I am very stoked to have been given the chance to try it because I have read a lot about its benefits. It works great as a bug repellent, for the nervous system, to promote sleep, as a tonic that works for the nerves and anxiety issues, for acne, pain relief, respiratory issues, urine flow, hair care, blood circulation, immunity, skin care, digestion, to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender essential oil also helps in eliminating nervous tension, enhancing blood circulation, disinfecting the scalp and skin and treating respiratory problems. It is extracted from the flowers of the lavender plant through steam distillation. Traditionally, lavender essential oil has been used in making perfumes but it is also very useful in aromatherapy, aromatic preparations and as previously mentioned, has a lot of health benefits as well. I have been personally using it on my sheets at night, to help relax and calm my nerves. I have been putting a few drops of it on my &amp;#34;organic smelling&amp;#34; night creams and serves several purposes for me - it works on my skin and it makes the &amp;#34;organic smell&amp;#34; of my preferred skin care products go away. I have also been putting a few drops of it on the cardboard part of my bathroom tissues and it makes my bathrooms smell so heavenly! Out of all the essential oils, lavender is one of my favorites! You get a lot of bang for your buck with aVo&#x27;s Pure Lavender Oil because not only is it made with superior ingredients - it is also reasonably priced! Truly worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> I recently got an oil diffuser and thought this Lavender Oil would be perfect to try out with it. The big bottle comes with a glass dropper for easy use. The scent is so lovely and sweet, like lying down in a soft summer field, napping in the sunshine. And that&#x27;s the same relaxing feeling it invokes! I definitely recommend using this while you&#x27;re trying to fall asleep or perhaps during a refreshing bubble bath- anytime you want to bask in pure relaxation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my pure lavender oil smell and uses since day one</li>
    <li> This is definitely 100% pure lavender essential oil. This 4oz bottle will last you a very long time since you only need just a few drops or even a drop when using. I use 3 drops of lavender essential oil for my son&#x27;s bath and it relaxes him and getting him ready for bedtime. I love the fresh smell of this lavender oil; I also use it for my bath and it is something about the aroma that not only it relaxes my body and mind, but it makes me feel good and relieves stress. In addition, I use two to three drops in one of our diffusers and set it next to my son&#x27;s bed, which helps him to sleep better. There are so many benefits of this lavender oil as well as various purposes. Try mixing it with coconut oil or any carrier oil you prefer and experience a very relaxing massage (this is from personal experience).&lt;br /&gt;*item was purchased while it was on promotion in return for my 100% honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the fragrance. It&#x27;s quite sharp and not at all the soothing lavender scent I was expecting. Will stick with my other source.</li>
    <li> Lavender is my favorite scent for essential oil. I&#x27;ve ordered it before but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Bulgarian from Avo. I don&#x27;t notice any difference. With that said, I haven&#x27;t found a lavender essential oil that I don&#x27;t love and this is no exception. I&#x27;ve breathed it in, dabbed it on my clothes, on my blankets - the smell of it is just a happy smell that makes me feel good. I originally discovered it because a dog trainer mentioned it was good for separation anxiety - they said to just dab some on a washcloth by where your dog sleeps. It should help them relax. It does help. It&#x27;s not a cure-all but it seems to make him feel a little better. The Avo comes in a 4 oz. sealed brown glass dropper bottle and has not been tested on animals. It&#x27;s concentrated with a strong smell and I enjoy using it (diluted with water) in a spray bottle to make my own homemade air freshener.</li>
    <li> Put a few drops of this in my bath water at night. I am relaxed and ready for bed within minutes.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and help mi sleep and This Lavender oil is great to help you relax. The aromatherapy is excellent.</li>
    <li> Very weak scent, and not at all like lavender. Definitely will NOT buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it! Will buy that again.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like real, good quality lavender.</li>
    <li> When this package arrived I could smell the sweet lavender oil even before I opened the package! I was very happy when I opened the box and discovered a glass bottle very nicely packaged and a glass dropper to facilitate the handling of the oil. The bottle is very elegant and made out of glass which is great to keep the oil pure and toxin free. The dropper keeps the bottle concealed and is leak free. I purchased this bottle of lavender oil for my aunt who has been looking to find a natural remedy for her depression. When I gifted the bottle of oil to her, she was so excited and opened the bottle right away and she was blown away by the giant 4 oz bottle and the scent of the oil! This review is written in my own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aunt has reported to me that she uses her lavender oil to help her pick up her mood and that she has felt a great reduction of stress and depression in her everyday life. She happily told me she mixes two drops of lavender oil with her moisturizer and whenever she feels down, she simply applies some on her hands and takes a deep inhale; the scent is soothing and quiets her mind with it&#x27;s healing properties. My aunt has been so blessed by this oil and I am happy I purchased it during a one time promotional code period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is natural and undiluted and simply smells wonderful, the oil has healing properties and can be used for aroma therapy, relaxation and to treat tons of skin conditions. The oil is also great for massages and perfume! I would buy this product again and this time keep it for myself!</li>
    <li> absolutely awesome...and pure..</li>
    <li> The Essential Oils from aVo are absolutely AWESOME, plus they all have such a lovely aroma!  These Essential Oils are a therapeutic grade and they&#x27;re premium quality.  What makes these oils so special, it that they&#x27;re undiluted, no toxins, no additives, no chemicals and no fillers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lavender Essential Oil is quite AMAZING!  It has an intoxicating aroma and it has many health benefits.  Lavender Essential Oil can help melt away stress and anxiety.  Did you know that Lavender Oil is an adaptogenic?  It posses both sedative and stimulant actions.  Its sedative actions are known to alleviate palpitations, nervous tension and lower blood pressure.  It can also stimulate people with depression, weak heart or shortness of breath.  Lavender Oil has been used for thousands of years for its unmistakable aroma and therapeutic properties!  I even make a mist of Lavender Oil and water to spray on the sheets, it&#x27;s just so relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon Essential Oil is definitely one of my favorite oils!  The oil has such a clean, crisp and refreshing aroma, plus it&#x27;s so uplifting.  I LOVE using Lemon Essential Oil as a disinfectant, so I put it in my homemade cleaners, soaps and detergents to kill the germs, plus I put it in my homemade handiwipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus has the most refreshing aroma, it&#x27;s like a breath of fresh air!  It&#x27;s great for respiratory ailments, including colds, catarrh, coughs, allergies, bronchitis, flu, throat infections, asthma, congestion and sinus problems.  We LOVE putting Eucalyptus oil in the diffuser to help us relax and clear our nasal passages, it leaves us feeling refreshed.  I also use Eucalyptus Oil for any kind of pain that I may be experiencing, since it helps with inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love putting all of these great essential oils in my homemade candles, hand soaps, hair treatments, shampoos, conditioners, detanglers, lotions, handiwipes, cleaners, laundry detergents, dish soap and bar soap.  I just love using essential oils in my homemade products.  You can add them to just about anything.  When I do laundry, I love putting Essential Oils on my Dryer Balls to make my laundry smell AWESOME!  I use essential oils on a daily basis and I love putting them in the diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend all of these fantastic oils from aVo Essentials!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these essential oils for a free or discounted price for my unbiased opinion and I was not compensated in any way for this review.

    <li> I am satisfied with the quality of product.  Suggest separate dropper should be replaced by a dropper fixed in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of lavender essential oil in my home.  I make a fragrance spray out of nothing but water in a spray bottle with about a capful of lavender oil mixed into it.  People tell me my home smells so nice.  I am happy with my purchase.  This 4 oz. bottle is a bargain for true essential lavender oil. Lavender oil just helps so many things, plus it&#x27;s nice to spray on your bed linens to help you sleep better.  It also helps when you have migraine headaches to rub some straight onto your temples, and lie down until it&#x27;s over. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This seems a little diluted compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used (specifically NOW). It takes more of this brand in mixtures I use, also the smell is a little different than the lavender oil I usually use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this before just a few months ago and it was awesome, ordered again and they sent me a nasty bottle. Smells cheap. Not lavender.</li>
    <li> Love this 100% pure natural Lavender Oil !  I use this to make Flea and tick defense. For dogs and people!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I&#x27;m using for homemade bath salts.</li>
    <li> Love this just one or 2 drops in my bath in the evening and I am all relaxed and ready to kick back and relax for the night. Love that it comes with the dropper also.</li>
    <li> Thank you...excellent quality...I love being able to get the larger quantities</li>
    <li> Love it great product will order from again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the lavender scent on its own. I do however love the scent when mixed with other oils. It works great with lemon and peppermint. I rub it on my temples and put it on the back of my neck to relieve allergy headaches. It can be mixed with Coconut Oil, Olive Oil, or Avocado Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also mix drops of it with water cleaner to clean the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I am a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> I was quite disappointed in aVo lavender essential oil.  I had recently purchased a 10ml bottle from another company that was quite good, but it only lasted two days, so I was looking for a more economical alternative.  The positive reviews swayed me to try aVo.  I am not amazed.  I have tried Aromis, Zenic, Now, Pharmaca, and Kis.  This is my least favorite.  I gave it two stars for the amber bottle and the dropper - good features.  The oil itself smells weak, perhaps diluted, and doesn&#x27;t have the sweet floral tones I expected.</li>
    <li> I love it!  The smell is amazing it definitely helps me fall asleep at night.  I&#x27;ll be buying more from this company. 🌞</li>
    <li> Smells pure. Bottle actually lists Latin name for English lavender.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff the only suggestion would be that the dropper have a smaller opening because this is very potent. I use it on my pulse points to help me sleep and its great for that but the smell does linger on the bed sheets and pajamas and I love it but your significant other may not. I also used it to help my daughter sleep when she had a bad cough. I received this free as part of promotion</li>
    <li> Good product; I will buy it again if the price is right.</li>
    <li> Generous amount of Lavender, but dropper was broken.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great buy!  I am extremely happy.  Smells WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great price. We be back to reorder.</li>
    <li> Smells like chemicals. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> OK -- not as thrilled as with other brands -- seems diluted or something as the aroma is not as noticeable when put in diffuser.  I seem to have to put more oil in the diffuser at night to get the desired effects.</li>
    <li> Beautiful smell, perfect size bottle. Great value.</li>
    <li> Very nice lavender scent, not over powering, but definitely authentic.  I use in my bath water and scent diffuser.</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited this week to receive the Lavender Essential Oil. I have anxiety a lot and the lavender essential oil is made for calming with its aroma as well as other health benefits. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this to rejuvenate my spirit and relax me before bed. I place a little bit on my temples before bed and I find myself sleeping so much better already. There are so many uses for lavender oil if you look on Pinterest you will find a TON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the size of the bottle. This is not your small bottle you find at the local department stores. This is a nice size. I also enjoy the dropper because it allows for you to not over use the product. The oil is 100% natural and derived from the Lavendula Officinalis plant. This plant is steam distilled until it releases the concentrated oil. This is all pure. There are no fillers or added ingredients. This is top quality stuff and for under $20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance and you can place on your pillow for an even better sleep or in your lotion for an added boost. This oil is also wonderful for tension headaches or headache migraines as well as cold sores and blisters and colds. This is 100% guaranteed and you will not be disappointed! This is one of the best deals I have found so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the sensuous smell of Lavender.  I&#x27;ve got cotton balls full of Lavender all over our home., and on my pillow, for a restful sleep.</li>
    <li> J&#x27;taime!  The fragrance is lovely.  I live that it included a dropper.  I will  buy more.</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely lovely and has so many aromatherapy uses!  I have bought other brands of lavender oil before, but this is by far the best.  It smells more natural and doesn&#x27;t have the artificial chemical smell that so many essential oils have.  I make my own reed diffuser oil with it, and it makes the room smell great.</li>
    <li> Love the oil but the bottle is horrible. The rubber disintegrated and spilled all over.</li>
    <li> I have only ever bought high altitude French lavender, so this lavender was a bit of a change for me.  It was a bit more powdery than I was accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that I&#x27;ve had it for a while, I appreciate it&#x27;s staying power, at lease twice the time it takes to dissipate.  I put a few drop in the far corner of my bathroom, and a few drops on my pillow.  I still get surprised when the scent is strong after almost a week.  Definitely will buy more!</li>
    <li> Lavender arrived well packaged, as described, and within the time frame that was communicated.  Like the dropper.  Appreciate that the manufacture and expirations dates are provided.  Product of Bulgaria and bottled in US.  Not sure how to evaluate the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Fabulous lavender and the dropper makes all the difference! I drop a few of these in my baby&#x27;s bathtub and he&#x27;s all set for the evening. Lovely product.</li>
    <li> I will buy&lt;br /&gt; This product sgain I really like it thanks .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this particular lavender.... I use it every night in my diffuser and it helps me not only get to sleep but to stay asleep.... If I happen to wake up during the night I&#x27;m able to drift right back off to sleep.... this is a real blessing and also a great price.... Many other essential oils are only 15ml for much more money.... this is a full 4oz... Thank you aVo for a great product.... keep up the good work.... Oh, by the way, I also put a few drops on my pillow before I go to bed....</li>
    <li> Wonderful relaxation at bedtime</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent with just a small amount added to water!!! 😊</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount of EO BUT not the same quality as doterra or living young EO. This will definitely just be aromatherapy NOT on my skin.</li>
    <li> High quality oil. Smells just right. Using it in my ZAQ diffuser. The glass dropper came broken. I&#x27;m sure I could have returned it for a new one no but I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged, safe on time delivery.  Exceptional scent and quality!  Especially when we place drops in warm tub water!</li>
    <li> Love the product used it to make homemade bug repellent, works great!!</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Love it</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance - nice size bottle - stopper excellent for dispensing oil</li>
    <li> This is a QUALITY essential oil, and lots of it! You can immediately tell the difference with this oil, and some others I have purchased in the past. I use this in a diffuser, or add some drops in a warm tub for immediate relaxation. Would love to try some of this companies other oils!</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try AVO ESSENTIALS Premium Lavender Essential Oil product for free. I love the smell it has a fresh, sweet and herbaceous scent that is relaxing, restorative, and refreshing. It can be used to relieve headaches, add to your bath water or like I did add to a face mask. A little goes a long way. Check it out on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very high quality essential oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using lavender for years. It has so many different uses! This product is so versatile. I love that it has a dropper compared to some of the other brands I&#x27;ve used that only have a dropper cap built right in that gives you no control over how much oil you&#x27;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have put this oil to use in so many different ways. I add a few drops to my shampoo before I wash my hair, I add some to my laundry when I wash towels so they stay fresher longer, I add it to my daughter&#x27;s baths before bed so she sleeps well, I&#x27;ve even made a linen spray by adding a few drops to a spray bottle filled with water. My boyfriend and I sleep like a baby when I spray the room before bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty concentrated, so if you want to use it for things like bug bites and burns (since lavender has excellent anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties) you will have to dilute it first. If you dilute it, you can also use it on acne to spot treat or if you have headaches dab a little behind your ears and on your temples for aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really love lavender oil, and this is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I suggest trying it and then seeing how many ways you can use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this for review purposes, all opinions of this product are my own.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It came in a nice small box. It smells aweaome and has a perfect t dropper. It also came fast and didn&#x27;t have oil all over in the box. It was ver well secured which is aweaome when getti ng oils.</li>
    <li> This oil is not up to snuff. I have two other brands of Lavender essential oil at home besides this one. Eden&#x27;s Garden and Healing Solutions Kashmir lavender. There is no comparing this oil with either of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use oils in my ZAQ diffuser and 5 drops of Eden&#x27;s Garden or the Healing Solutions oil fills the room with lavender scent. The AVO oil can only make the immediate 1 ft area around the diffuser scented. Just opening the bottle and doing a smell test it is immediately apparent to me that this oil is mediocre compared to the others I use. After a short time in the diffuser it doesn&#x27;t even smell like lavender but instead gives off some kind of mint or tea tree like scent that is vaguely chemical-like. I&#x27;m guessing most of these reviews are fake,as is likely this product. Or maybe I just got a bad batch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not an aromatherapy expert by any means but compared to two other brands of lavender EO it is readily clear that AVO is not worth the money, or any money really. I trusted the reviews and got a 4 oz bottle of this hoping it would be just as good as the oil I currently use but it simply cannot compare. I am returning it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Finding good quality, essential oils to use is very important. Whether you&#x27;re using them for topical application or aromatherapy, make sure you do your research on the company and the methods they use. A few things you want to look for when buying essential oils is that they come in dark colored glass bottles that are 4oz or smaller and the ingredients include the Latin name, country of origin and the extraction method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aVo Lavender Essential Oil has been a pleasure to use. It comes with a standard cap, but also a dropper for ease of use. The fresh, floral scent is very sweet and blends well with other oils. I&#x27;ve used this for a variety of homemade skincare recipes including soothing bath soaks and a moisturizing facial oil. Lavender is well known for it&#x27;s many health benefits. It is most commonly used to promote a sense of calm and encourage relaxation; but it is also widely used to support the immune system, as an antiseptic and anti-fungal for acne and first aid, to ease digestion and as a natural insect repellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Be aware that the more you open bottles of essential oils, the more you introduce oxygen and the potential for contamination. To preserve the quality, store in a cool, dry place away from sunlight and use the standard cap.</li>
    <li> A little light fragrance but it is nice.</li>
    <li> My product arrived on time.  love it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful smell and is a great addition to my essential oil collection which I use for shampoo/soap making and air diffuser!  Great size bottle for the money!</li>
    <li> Lovely product.  Packaged nicely.  Arrived on time.  I&#x27;m using on my woolen dryer balls to give my clothes a pleasant scent.  This is a pure essential oil so dilution is necessary for misting my pillow and massage.  Quality product and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS 100% PURE  IT SMELLS LIKE CHEMICALS</li>
    <li> The oil is wonderful, but the glass dropper was broken!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The Seller contacted me the same day that I posted my original comment.  She was very kind &amp; said she&#x27;d mail out a replacement that same day!!  I&#x27;m very impressed with the scent of the oil &amp; the customer service!!</li>
    <li> Great, light scent, and the price is great for such a large bottle. I&#x27;d give this product five stars, but the dropper was not protected from the rather heavy bottle - they were shipped in the same box with no cushioning whatsoever - and the dropper was crushed to pieces. Not thrilled about that, but I can live without the dropper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using lavender for years to gain restful sleep, this is a lovely lavender scent that works well for this, in this size I have enough to use as insect repellant. I recommend it. Amazon customer service can&#x27;t be beat. Updating earlier review: now that I&#x27;ve used this oil for a while I can recommend for insect repellant only. Does not help with sleep, not of good quality for that.</li>
    <li> Dear Avo,  the oil is wonderful, I love it.  The dropper arrived in 2 pieces, however.  The glass was broken in half.  May I get a replacement? Please?  Other than that the package arrived on time, and like I said, I love the oil., Luv, Ann</li>
    <li> First, about the product: It does not smell like lavender at all. It has a strange medical smell to it. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m an expert on lavender but I know for sure this is not lavender. Perhaps it was lavender at one point but the process of creating this oil has erased any trace of it away. Now it smells disgusting (I would use a stronger word but I shall refrain). My head is still spinning from the smell as I write this review, and not in a good way (if there is a good way in which heads can spin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the shipment. The first time I ordered this it did not come at all. I tried to have it replaced but no can do. So I contacted Amazon. The representative was quite kind and helpful and the second shipment came properly. I suppose things like this happen all the time but with the product being sub-par and it not arriving when it should the first time, it just compounded my dislike of this product. I never will buy this product ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the smell of this brand. A little odd. I won&#x27;t get this brand again. Great size though!</li>
    <li> This works amazing! I use it to wash my face with coconut oil added because I have a lot of acne...and it&#x27;s Has done a great job in a short period of time ! Also I put it in my oil diffuser and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the dropper as advertised.  The dropper was why I purchased this brand instead of another.  The oil is fine.  The fragrance is very strong.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five is because it was supposed to come with something that it did not.</li>
    <li> best lavender i&#x27;ve tried; love to use it every night, it helps me sleep, i use it in my lotions too. i love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I liked it. I love the smell of lavender, and it does help me relax, and with my migranes.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product. It is watered down and smells like cheap perfume. This is NOT 100% pure essential lavender oil. I&#x27;m sticking with Doterra and Young living. Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> Terrific and effective lavender oil.  Combined this with two small Burt&#x27;s Bees Vitamin E oil and it&#x27;s a great body moisturizer.  I also used this combination for soothing the itch of insect bites.  It&#x27;s great for that, too. Beautiful fragrance makes it a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Smell is just ok. Smells like lavendar with a bit of eucalyptus mixed in.</li>
    <li> So far so good. First time I&#x27;ve used your products. I would recommend this to family and friends. Thanks, Debbie</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Use for wool dryer balls and extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> Very good , I use it in several ways and it is lovely</li>
    <li> The Avo lavender smells heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops in the felted wool dryer balls that I made and use instead of dryer sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have to refresh the oil on the balls more than once a week due to it being long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;It gives the dried laundry a subtle lavender aroma and makes the laundry area smell good too.</li>
    <li> Best lavender oil I have tried. Great smell, not camphor smelling at all.</li>
    <li> It was suppose to be here Saturday and got here Monday and I even used prime so I had high expectations. Also, it&#x27;s broken. Not too happy.</li>
    <li> Lavender is an oil that I have been recommending to anyone and everyone I know. There are many uses, but the biggest one for me is the help sleeping and feeling relaxed. One of my kiddos was up until 5:30 in the morning one night and I tried everything to help them sleep. Finally it dawned on me that I had lavender oil on hand. I dropped two drops on the pillow and called it &amp;#34;sleep medicine&amp;#34; and they finally laid down and fell asleep. I haven&#x27;t allowed myself to run out of it since then. I also have trouble sleeping sometimes, so a few drops help me relax and sleep. If you really need a boost, a couple drops in a hot bath to help relieve a headache and feel calm and relaxed. I have also used lavender on skin irritations and small wounds to help speed up the healing process. This oil is high quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me.  I used 1 Tablespoon of coconut oil and 10 drops of lavender oil to make a massage oil. I was the one giving the massage, and it almost put me to sleep!  It was very relaxing, and I liked the smell of it mixed with the coconut.  If you want more of the pure lavender smell to come through, I suggest using a more neutral oil like safflower oil.&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this product in particular: The size of this bottle is extra big, which means you get more from your money.  I’ve never heard of essential oils going bad, so you will be able to use this bottle up eventually depending on how often you use it.  Also, it comes with a glass dropper for precise measurements and a regular lid for storage.  The oil is very high quality and pure.  Its vegan, non-synthetic, and very potent (so never apply it directly- always dilute it!).  One of my favorite things about it is that the lavender used to make this oil is grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides, so you can feel confident using it if you use mostly organic products like I do.  All in all I think this is a good oil for therapeutic uses or just for regular home use too.  Next, I’m going to put a dropperful of this oil in my bath before bedtime and relax with a cup of tea!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review.

    <li> I was sent the Avo Lavender Essential Oil as a product test and this is my review:&lt;br /&gt;First: I used the oil in a wax burner and used some unscented wax and a few drops of the oil in order to dilute the strength, the oil is VERY strong. This worked perfectly and the fragrance lasted the entire duration of the tealight I used with only a few drops of the oil...meaning a large bottle like the one provided will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is exact to lavender, so if you are a lavender person like I am...it is heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now...for the calming / destressing part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not believe stuff like that, BUT I usually freak out at least once on the night a paper is due and I did not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if I can attribute that to the lavender oil, but hey... it happened while the oil was burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I may be bias...this stuff smells magical)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item:&lt;br /&gt;Avo Essentials Lavender Oil  4 oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I tried mixing this with sea salt to make my own bath soak and it is heavenly, now... I love heavy scents, so I used 3 full droppers worth in a cup of sea salt, mixed it and dumped it all in a soak a few hours later to amazing results. The fragrance was wonderful and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets my seal of approval.</li>
    <li> I had been using a different brand, but actually like this one better. The price was reasonable and the smell is nice. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this oil again. (BTW, the product was shipped, nicely enclosed in a very secure bubble pack.)&lt;br /&gt;Update;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a second bottle of this oil. I have been using it in my homemade laundry soap, my homemade fabric softener, and a few drops on the wool dryer balls. Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer the Now brand by a small margin, but both of these lavender oils are very nice. I want to try making soap with lavender essential oil added for a pleasing odor in the near future.</li>
    <li> Liked it but not as strong as the DoTerra or the Now foods.</li>
    <li> Love this pure essential oil, the scent is so fresh and pure, not overwhelming at all as some cheap synthetic lavender fragrance oils can be.  This is all natural, and i&#x27;m using it in two different DIY beauty scrubs I make.</li>
    <li> I love using oils for just about everything!  I use them in my homemade products such as soaps, laundry detergent, starch, etc.  Using oils in a burner is also a wonderful way to fill your home with a wonderful aroma.  Different oils can have different effect on your mood!  I was given the opportunity to test and review aVo Essentials Premium Lavender Oil.  It is 100% Pure Therapeutic Lavender Essential Oil (Lavandula Angustifolia).  I really loved that this product was not diluted in any way and also had no chemicals, additives, or preservatives.  It is also grown without pesticides, herbicides, or any other additives!  This is very important to my family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my oil, I could smell the scent of Lavender through the box!  It was wonderful and made my entire kitchen smell of Lavender.  I immediately put it into my oil diffuser and it was great!  The entire house smelled of Lavender within 10 minutes!  I felt relaxed and calm with it which is exactly what I was hoping for.  I have heard that it can work as an insect repellent as well but being as it is still cold outside I have yet to try that out!  I plan on using this a lot and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a wonderful Lavender oil!  Great in place of candles or air fresheners! I really like this product and cannot wait to use it other things in my home!</li>
