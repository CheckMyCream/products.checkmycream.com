    <li> Love the silky smoothness. How else are you suppose to survive the frigid winter that pulls all the moisture out of your skin?</li>
    <li> Love this product. You use it in the shower so you are showered and moisturized when you are done. Great time saver when you are a Mom of 2 little boys. Got my mom and sister hooked on this product too so was really happy I could buy them in a 3 set.</li>
    <li> Can be hard to find at our local stores but always available on Amazon!  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my skin moisturized throughout the winter, and keeps my legs feeling smooth after shaving.</li>
    <li> I would recomend the product to any one  especially  a diebetic  It is wonderful how it makes you skin feel ,your skin even looks better.</li>
    <li> Received this product as part of a gift set. Best lotion ever!!! Smells good and leaves skin softer then any other regular lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Keeps my preggo belly from getting itchy! The best part is the convenience of using it in the shower. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the greasy hands caused by regular lotion! Other reviews mention that it makes the shower slippery, but I have not had this issue. Perhaps they used too much. I recommend this lotion to everyone. Thanks Olay!!!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied customer, thanks.</li>
    <li> My search is over, my super dry skin loves it.</li>
    <li> Got the shipment quickly and I was pleased to receive all three bottles and they&#x27;re great sizes. Bout these over a month ago and I&#x27;m still using them. Worth the buy.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t ever stop selling this moisturizer.  It is awesome.  Can&#x27;t find it in any stores.  You&#x27;re it!!!</li>
    <li> the best time to put on a moisturizing anything is when your skin is damp out of the shower. This product goes on while in the shower and even in the winter I&#x27;m not all flaky and itchy......great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing for the skin! I&#x27;ve been looking for shower lotion for a long time. Since its really not a product kept in stores I could never find it. I was pleasantly surprised that they sold it on amazon and I just had o have it. Just like it had done years ago it is giving my skin new life! A must have for those who suffer from dry skin like myself! The scent is nice too and strong I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product--the moisturizer is not heavy.  Hard to find in my area.  Not a lot of fragrance for those of us who have allergies!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist says I should put on moisturizer every day after my shower.  I don&#x27;t do it because I just want to wrap up in a towel after my shower.  This stuff saves my skin.  Especially in the winter.  I slather it on like crazy right at the end of the shower while the conditioner is in my hair &amp; I&#x27;m still warm in the steamy shower (supposed to take &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; showers too - not happening!).  Then just a brief rinse. It holds in the moisture &amp; keeps my skin soft. I can really feel the difference all day. These bottles are a little smaller than I was hoping for, but I should have read more carefully. It is scented - I like it, but I could imagine someone really sensitive to perfumes could have a problem.  Anyone with dry skin should LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly well to seal in moisture while still in the shower leaving skin really soft once you&#x27;ve dried.  Olay appears to have discontinued it which is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> love this product and use every time i shower</li>
    <li> Got hooked on this and now can&#x27;t shower without it.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer for the shower. I put it on before leaving the shower. It does a good job moisturizing. I don&#x27;t have to use other lotion after the shower. It has a good scent, too. Quite frankly, it saves me time by not having to put lotion on afterwards. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - can&#x27;t EVER be without it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Shower and  use the body lotion while in the shower. I love it.</li>
